Breaking down the category into its major diseases, COPD is the largest cause of lost DALYs (30.2%) by comparison with asthma (1.21%). In the past few years, research investment in CRDs has grown. In terms of project aims, most CRD research has focused on the development of new drugs and therapies. . In respiratory medicine, drugs are becoming increasingly important. The use of antibodies and antagonists to block and change disease mechanisms, oncogenes and metabolic pathways is relevant to k ey disease types like Asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. The European pharmaceutical sector has five companies in among the world's top ten pharmaceutical firms. The research pipeline for the top 10 European pharmaceutical comp anies suggests that firms seem to specialize in certain NCD categories. For example, pipeline data shows that SANOFI -AVENTIS, preferring to focus on other areas, does not have any CRD relevant molecules under development; other firms like GSK, however, ar e developing several. Overall, the European pharmaceutical sector has increased its commitment to R&D over the past four years. GSK is the only top 10 company to record a shrinking commitment to research investment. Some companies, like AstraZeneca, h ave recorded a massive increase in R&D spending. But most companies have recorded progressive of steady increases. By contrast, US levels of investment in R&D have been more mixed. Interviews with stakeholders revealed several major themes with regard to the future of research in the area of CRDs. There was a recognition of the growing importance of stratified medicine, which several informants considered to be the future of research across the wider spectrum of NCDs. There was a need to find new way s of working with private sector. And there was a need to accommodate new research requirements within a wider strategic approach to the funding of NCD research which considered the needs of researchers for autonomy and the requirements of funders to demo nstrate the effectiveness of their investments . In terms of the effectiveness of research investment, CRD funding demonstrates a significant European presence . And averag e 56% of paper published for CRDs are of European origin , which is much higher than the percentages for the other four (38% for ONCOL, 42% for for MENTH). The internationalism was initially lower than in the other NCDs, but has caught up and even surpassed some of them. The UK has the highest output in ter ms of CRD papers , more than twice as high as the second country, France. The UK is publishing almost twice as much as expected, as are Sweden and the Netherlands. On the other hand, Austria is publishing very little, and Germany, Norway and Switzerland a re doing barely half of what might be expected considering their levels of GDP . Papers from Finland and Sweden attracted most funders, and fewer than one in five papers for CRD had no acknowledgements. These papers also had the most support from private -non-profit sources: 48% for Finland and 39% for Sweden. In 10 of the 15 countries, private -non-profit (PNP) sources out -numbered those using public moneys. Industry provided about 13% of funders on average, and international sources, 3.5% - notably the E uropean Commission. Levels of funding also varied with the subject matter and type of the research, with asthma and COPD receiving the most funding attention and bronchiectasis the least. Clinical papers were less LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 11 likely to be funded than basic ones. Pa pers with more authors tended to have more funding bodies, and that (for the 2009 papers for which five -year citation counts were available) the number of citations was positively correlated with the number of funders. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 12 1 European Research Programs In this section, we present a \"Purposive Sample\" of funded research programs and projects for CRDs. It is neither feasible nor desirable to provide a comprehensive sample of funded CRD research projects across EU31. Alternatively, a \"Purposive Sample\" provi des a general description of the types of projects in the relevant disease area for which a selection of RFOs across the EU provide funding. A Purposive Sample is comprised of three parameters: a time limitation of 2006 -13 in order to include projects und er FP -6 a selection of range of RFOs in the disease area across the different European Countries and the most relevant projects funded by EU or at EU Level; and a selection of projects in the disease area relevant to the individual conditions based on IDCs (ie. CRDs: COPD, Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis). The point of the Purposive Sample is to provide a general description, or appreciation, of the kinds of projects that are being funded in each ICD -10 condition. 1.1 Methods For Establishing the Purposive Sa mple for CRDs In establishing the purposive sample of projects for CRDs, we queried the websites of the most relevant European RFOs. These RFOs were selected for their relevance in shaping the National and European Health Policies, rather than their actual levels of funding for CRDs. We adopted this approach for the purpose of capturing grants at a variety of levels, considering that smaller CRD grants play a significant role in smaller MSs. For example, in western European MSs, there are a wide range of grants with smaller levels of annual funding that provide an opportunity to extend or disseminate the results of research already un derway. In this way, the role smaller disease specific RFOs, like the British Lung Foundation, in providing these grants is important to the provision of research impact. In addition, larger research projects may also receive multiple inputs from a numbe r of smaller funders. By contrast, in Eastern European MSs, research funding is principally an activity of Government bodies, which award larger grants with a shorter time horizon. Where these larger block grants were awarded to fund research institutio ns rather than specific projects, we attempted to individuate larger projects via a multilevel query. This query consisted of the following actions: A search for k eywords (see Appendix 2) in English and in the relevant national language(s). A search by s ubjects (allowed under the databases) in order to find any possible gaps in the website query. In the absence of an available database, a website search or search of annual reports for recent awards . Given the large number of projects funded for the peri od 2006 -2013, we considered only the projects that commenced and concluded within the time period, limiting the sample to 100 (N) projects for the European area in total . Allocating the N to MSs across the EU, we r anked MS by GDP per capita assign ing certain number s of projects for each country based on comparative levels of GDP . The number of project s assigned for each MS is outlined in the table ??. We allocated 15% of the N to the EC given the higher funding levels and large numbers of projects it awar ds to CRD projects. Within MSs, we allocated N projects into individual disease types by calculating the percentage of projects for CRD types in MSs . Finally, the largest sample was divided by amount of funding, and 3 categories were created in order to include at least one project for each disease type where possible. After the retrieving of all the projects, we performed a more in depth online research to individuate the maximum level of detail possible. At this stage a mixed quantitative and qualitati ve analysis was performed. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 13 Results are outlined in the tables below. The creation of a Purposive Sample involves several limitations. In the first place, the purposive sample does not retrieves and analyzes all the projects funded across EU on CRDs. Ind eed, the construction of a comprehensive sample would be unfeasible. . Alternatively, we selected the main projects for relevance and proportionally including also projects with a small level of funding to individuate the main trends across all the type o f funding. Secondly, it was not possible to individuate basic from applied research projects via the database queries. Often the basic research such as microbiology and fundamental chemistry is not specifically directed to a group of diseases but may be di rected towards a wide range of applications. Alternatively, we analyzed the specific purpose of the most relevant basic research looking for specific research directed towards CRDs. Third ly, the website query has intrinsic limitations linked to the public availability of information. Often , RFOs do not clearly state the level s of funding for individual projects or even list the project s they are currently funded. Moreover, in some MSs, it was also not possible to individuate projects due to the lack of tra nsparent information. 1.2 Results: CRD Research Programs Initially, we found around 3500 individuated CRD research projects. Applying the search criteria, we identified 1924 projects across 20 European countries, from which we selected the purposive sample according to the methods outlined above. Broadly, the selection confirmed the trends highlighted in previous reports. As shown in Figure i, the research investmen t favors a sthma, with the 32% of project s. The second most important area is COPD to which ( 24% ) of the project are devoted, followed by 14% for cystic fibrosis. The remaining 30% is almost equally split between other CRDs, with no smaller CRD received mo re than 10% of projects . Figure i: Percentage of Projects by Disease Area Looking at the average time Horizon of the projects, the average life of grant is of 28 months with a minimum time of 12 months and a maximum of 60 months per project. However, in the larger database the 45% of the research projects funded were extensions of previous exploratory research or were further implemented by other grants in order to reach the output expected. The most important area in which the RFOs were interested was in relation to the therapeutic and drug developments, whereas the health care research and economic health research are almost not existent, with only 2 projects addressing these subjects. Indeed, a high number of projects (n=64) LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 14 addresses genetic or cellular biology, with the aim of finding the causes of chemical and biological mechanisms in order to develop new strategies in therapeutic and pharmaceutical care. Interestingly, in only 2 cases the primary output the projects was the approval of a patent, and in only 1 case was the translation of the theory into practice the primary outcome. In addition, only two projects addressed the quality of life for CRDs patients , and only a small percentage (between 3% and 4%) of stud ies addressed the economic consequences of these diseases (n=1) Typically, the many recipients of funding were universit ies or research center s (around 90%) whereas Private companies and charities conducted about 8% and 2% of projects respectively . In only one case , the lead recipient of funding was from the private sector ( BioChancePLUS -4: \"IgE - AAV ), which addres sed the issue of particles as vaccines for the treatment of asthma and other allergic diseases\" funded By BMBF) . In all other case, private companies and charities were members of a large r consortium led by universities . In terms of number of institution s funded, most of the RFOs (n=89) tend to fund only 1 organization whereas large r consortium s were mainly supported by the European Commission. Indeed, 7 out of 8 EC funded projects involved a consortium or multiple partners across Europe. The only excep tion was BMBF in Germany , which , in the period between 2009 and 2012 , funded two large joint projects in the program of \"Disease oriented Competence Network Asthma and COPD\". These projects had particular relevance to the shaping of national and European policy on CRDs given the large r level of funding investment involved, and the inclusion of research groups from several universities, research institutions and private companies and Charities. In terms of the level of collaborations among RFOs, results highlighted the absence of trans -border collaboration. Indeed, the 88% of the projects were funded within the MS of RFOs , and only 7% were developed at international level , and 5% at the European level. These results may indicate a need for larger collaborations within the European Union in order to enhance the quality of research. 1.3.1 COPD The sample includes 24 projects research on COPD (24% ). Across Europe , the primary focus of COPD research is the development of new therapies and drugs (n=9 ), and the management of the patients during the course of the illness (n=10). This could be linked to the slow progression of COPD and the presence of acute exacerbations characterized by a worsening of the quality of life, leading to a large need of new therapies. Furthermore , 15 out of 17 projects are focused on the management of patients or new drugs and therapies . In the main, these projects build on basic research . The direct cause s of COPD exacerbations are still obscure and the involvement of pa thogens remains uncertain. 3 projects considered aietology . And o nly 2 projects are focused on social determina nts and outcomes of COPD. The average length of the projects is 36 months. 1.3.2 Asthma The sample includes 32 projects directed to study of Asthma. The primary focus of these projects is directed toward development of new drugs and therapies (n=18), followed by the study of aietology (n=9) and development of diagnosti sc (n=6). Patient management (n= 1) and prevention (n=3) received less attenti on. Generally, 24 of 32 projects were the product of basic b iological research. The average length of the projects is 24 months. 1.3.3 Cystic fibrosis The sample includes f ourteen projects for cystic fibrosis . These were funded across 9 MSs and 2 non-European Countries. The majority of the projects i (8 out of 14) were investigating new drugs and therapies . Other areas investigated included disease management (n=2), Aietology (n=3) and Diagnosis and prognosis. Two projects out of 14 involved interna tional collaboration whereas the LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 15 others were country focused, perhaps highlighting the lack of a European network for research on cystic fibrosis. The average length of a project was 24 months. 1.3.4 Non Specific and Mixed Projects Website queries identi fied that 16% of projects were directed towards more than one CRDs. The most common association was made between Asthma and COPD (n=13) . Other non-specific and Pulmonary Hypertension , were a less common subject of mixe d research, which numbered 2, 3 and 7 projects respectively . The majority of mixed projects were concerned with biological discovery in the interested of develop ing new drugs and treatments (n=14). The most second relevant area of mixed study was in regard of the aietology of the diseases (n=7) and diagnostic s (n=5). Interestingly, 4 out of 5 diagnostic study focused on the develop ment and improve ment of imaging tools. The average length of the projects where 24 months.

For example, t he European Commission's 6th and 7th Framework Programme s have sponsored a large array of new projects for the purpo se of advancing CRD therapy and treatments such as GA2LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network). In respiratory medicine, drugs are becoming increasing ly important. The use of antibodies and antagonists to block and change disease mechanisms , onco genes and metabolic pathways is relevant to key disease types like Asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension (Canonica, 2007). Projects like GA2LEN aim to improve knowledge regarding Allergies and Asthma together with the factors correl ated to the prevalence of these diseases. However, these larger EC projects also involve an emphasis on collaboration than smaller projects lack . As part of the GA2LEN project, researchers are also building a more sophisticated network of researchers, experts and patients associations. In this way the ECs sponsorship FP6 and FP7, the EC had purposefully developed collaborations that extend beyond individual MSs and gain from a pan European exchange of information and expertise. For COPD, projects clearly focus on new therapies and drugs. Such a focus may be associated with the slow progression of COPD and the presence of acute exacerbations characterized by a worsening of the quality of life which produce a need for new therapies. However, they may also be room for research on the association between the pathogenic roles of key risk factors like cigarette smoke, inflammation, and protease/antiprotease balance . Although the cigarette -inflammation -protease approach neatly captures key features of COPD epi demiology and pathology, this approach has not yet led to a reduction in COPD prevalence or morbidity, to the development of any therapy proven to modify the disease process itself, or to an adequate understanding of how risk factors other than cigarette s moking may contribute to COPD pathogenesis. Others suggest more focus on the socials and economic consequences of COPD are necessary . Equally, others argue that there may also be room for socio -economic research on reducing the availability of tobacco via legislative means . For asthma, the focus of projects is mainly on understanding the aietology of the disease, and developing new drugs in response . In particular, a large amount of research has been directed towards tailor ed treatments for patients wi th severe asthma. Here, the emphasis is on personalized medicine, or the use of more rational and precise treatments that are targeted to individual patients. For some, the notion of \"treatment for everyone\" with asthma is applicable only to first - episod e patients, but not to those with severe asthma. (Weiss, 2012) Indeed, the effectiveness of new treatments also partially depends on the accuracy of the methods for tailoring patients. (Drazen, 2011; Weiss 2012) For cystic fibrosis, the majority of the pro jects are attempting to develop new drugs and therapies using a \"bottom -up\" approach based on knowledge of the mechanisms of disease. This approach involves identifying pathogenic markers of early response to treatment and implementing tests that can pred ictive their efficacy on the individual patient. Again, the emphasis is on personalized medicine. However, for the majority of the projects on personalized drug development for cystic fibrosis, the results are still uncertain. It is not clear when treatm ents will become available in clinical practice For projects that focus on more than one CRD, the most common association is Asthma and COPD. Although these disease types are treated and managed in related ways, prevention programs are very different. For COPD, the priority is to intervene for the reduction of smoking, which remains the key risk factor for the disease. Asthma, however, is not yet completely understood. Neither the causes of its induction, nor the exact influence of genetic and / or envir onmental development of the disease are accurately know, Consequently, experts are not yet able to recommend a program of specific measures for primary prevention. (Croxton et al, 2002) LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 40 For non -specific CRDs, there seems to be an absence of focus on pulmo nary hypertension, for which there is currently no cure. Novel therapies, prevention measures and early interventions for in patients at risk are needed. (ERS,2011) Chronic illnesses, like CRDs, detract from the ability of suffers to maintain a normal lif e. For this reason perhaps, our results highlight that the research seems to be oriented toward developing drugs and treatments. There has been less focus on imaging and diagnosis. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 41 2 Private Sector Investment in CRDs Investments in NCD research fundi ng originate from a variety of sources: national governments, regional organizations, charities, non -governmental organizations and supranational organizations. While policy -makers regard the management of NCDs as an increasingly important issue and are engaged in sponsoring research and facilitating cooperation between these organizations for the purpose of developing useful collaborations; less is known about the industry response to NCDs in terms of research and development . In this section of the CA, we consider the background and specifics of private sector investment in NCD research , and in particular, CRDs . 2.0.1. Background: Private Sector Investment in Research and Development Across the various sectors of industry, the world's top companies are increasing their commitment to research and development (R&D). After the 2009 financial crisis, the world's top 2500 companies, which account for 90% of the world's industrial investmen t in research and development, enjoyed a brief rebound in sales for the years 2010 -11. Although growth stalled in 2012 -13, companies continued to invest in R&D , which, overall, increased 4.9% in 2013 (Hernandez et al 2014, 6). Currently, the top 100 worl d companies are responsible for 53.1% of the total investment in R&D, which includes 31 companies based in the EU, 39 in the US and 17 in Japan. These companies are also responsible for about one third of all patents filed for approval in the US and EU, w ith the Electronic and Electrical Equipment sector (Samsung and IBM) being the most active (Hernandez et al 2014, 12) The Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology sector is one of the largest investors in R&D, claiming about a 18.0% share of total R&D investment fo r 2014 (Hernandez et al 2014, 47). However, the sector has a much less significant share of patents to R&D investment ratios. For example, the Electronic and Electrical Equipment sector, which enjoys the highest ratio, is about ten times larger than the ratio for Pharma & Biotech. Today, the production of safe and effective compounds requires substantial investment and cooperation between diverse companies across the sector, particularly bio -tech companies (Hernandez et al 2014, 39-40). Indeed, biotech companies are outstripping traditional pharmaceutical companies in terms of investment in R&D, which has increased 20.4%, against pharmaceutical , which has itself decreased investment by 0.2% (Hernandez et al 2014, 47). Although the Pharmaceutical and Bi otechnology sector is among the largest in terms of global R&D investment ; analysts have become concerned about the nature and quality of those investments. Decreased patent ratios, stalling investment in general R&D and the increasing role of biotech comp anies in discovering new molecules and bringing them to market are symptomatic of wider systemic shifts across the industry. The sector , they argue, is in the grip of major changes, which are weighing heavily on the capacity of industry to undertake inves tment in R&D and respond to the growing challenge of NCDs. These shifts are tectonic and include: changed paradigms for scientific research, new measures of productivity and a declining tolerance for risk (Cockburn, 2006 ; Pammolli et al., 2011) . Today, new drug discovery is a high -risk and time -consuming process. Only 1 out of every 5000 - 10,000 compounds screened becomes an approved drug. And it takes an average of 10 to 15 years at an average cost of more than US$1 billion to develop a successful medi cine (Merck 2015). Significant can losses occur where outputs are dependent o n research interaction at the interface of various disciplines, and where there is no guarantee that new compounds will advance to clinical trials. Increased possibility of R&D failure is one of the main factors in the raised estimates of the costs per new molecular entity (NME), on the basis which analysts now question whether industry is in the grip of an R&D productivity crisis (Cockburn, 2006 ; Pammolli et al., 2011). In pas t, analysts lauded the contribution of industry to the advancement of science and medical technologies. Today, however, where they measure productivity in terms of the ratio of the LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 42 \"output\" of a process to some measure of \"inputs\", like rising R&D expendi tures and falling or static counts of new drug approvals ; they have identified a sharp decline in research productivity over the past decade (Cockburn 2007, 1). As such, o ld confidences in the industry and its product development pathway are fading. In 2 004, the FDA expressed \"growing concern that many of the new basic science discoveries made in recent years may not quickly yield more effective, more affordable, and safe medical products for patients,\" citing falling numbers of applications for approval of new drugs, and placing the blame squarely on an \"increasingly challenging, inefficient, and costly\" product development path (cited in Cockburn 2007, 3). In the 21st century, industry analysts are concerned that the decreasing levels of productivity co nfronts policy makers with tough questions. Where tax -payers continue to provide significant amounts financial support to industry led R&D, analysts are now asking whether these \"poor outcomes justify continued public investment at its current scale?\" (Co ckburn 2007, 2 -3) 2.0.2. Mapping the Private Sector Research Pipeline In this context , mapping private sector investment in NCD research funding becomes quite important. However, such a mapping exercise also involves unique challenges. For example, the details and strategic focus of public and third sector NCD research funding programmes are readily accessible and, in many c ases, a matter of public record. By contrast, the activities of the private sector are not. Governed by the profit motive, the spe cifics of private sector investment in NCD research are more usually confidential. So, w hat is the commitment of European pharmaceutical companies to R&D investment in CRDs . How can we map the ways (types of technologies ) in which industry has responded to the challenge of CRDs ? And how can we assess, or make sense, of this response. In order to map the industry response (activity, investment and initiatives) to CRDs in terms of research investment , we describe the research pipeline for major European pharmaceutical companies in terms of Molecules in Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, Submission and Approval . Data was collected from the four most recent annual reports available at the companies' global websites (2014 -2011). Where data was not ava ilable for 2014, the range 2013 -2010 was applied . Information was readily available on the web. Results are expressed in terms of phases of development for individual molecules, which are set out in the tables below. The tables also include the total amo unt of R&D expenses f or the available period and the percentage of sales or revenues allocated to R&D. In order to assess the industry response, we compare the top 20 US and European headquartered companies in terms of annual R&D investment against unmet US and European need for CRDs. Table v details the top 20 pharmaceutical companies based in the US and Europe by investment in R&D. In the sections that follow, we discuss unmet need for NCDs in both Europe and the US, map ping and analyzing the commitment of each company to CRDs in terms of their individual research pipelines.

Indeed, b y 2020, the World Bank/World Health Organization projects that COPD will be the fifth highest disease in terms of the worldwide burden of disease (Rabe et al 2007, 532). Still, f or some time now, COPD, and CRDs in general, have remained relatively unknown to both governments and the public. Even today , there are very few European based RFOs concerned exclusively with CRD research. And i n United States, concerns about the visibility of CRDs have even prompted the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obst ructive Lung Disease (GOLD) (Pauwels et al 2001, 1256). At the g lobal level , the 53rd World Health Assembly (WHA) has attempted to redress the lack of attention to CRDs by request ing that the WHO Director General to give immediate priority to the preventi on and control of CRDs. And i n addition, the WHO has attempted to establish a comprehensive worldwide approach to the surveillance, diagnosis, prevention and control of CRDs with the formation of the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (G ARD), a voluntary alliance of organizations, institutions and agencies, including GOLD, for the purpose of delivering on the common aims of improving global lung health and increasing wider public awareness about the threat and debilitating effects of CRDs (Bousquet et al 2007, 217 -218) In terms of specifics, t he Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the world leading data base for recoding epidemiological levels and disease trends worldwide. Maintained by the Institute for H ealth Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 44 Washington , the database provides rigorous and comparable freely available measurement of the world's major health problem s, of which CRDs is one. The purpose of the GBD data base is to provide poli cymakers with sufficient the evidence to make informed decisions on the allocation of resources for the improvement of population health. For our purpose, the GBD offers an accurate comparative picture of the levels of unmet need that the major NCD categor ies represent. According to the GBD, CRDs are a serious public health problem in Europe . They are the fifth leading cause of lost DALYs across Europe in terms of NCDs . Figure ii: NCDs in Europe (2010 Category* *Sourced at: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ Breaking down the CRD category into its major diseases, the database reveals that COPD is the largest cause of lost DALYs Figure iii: CRDs in Europe (2010 Disease* *Sourced at: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ Using the European burden of disease as a basis, we analyzed the commitment of the European pharmaceutical sector to CRDs and its major disease categories. With the analysts suggesting that CRDs typically receive less attention than other NCD categories f rom national governments and the general public, it is reasonable to assume that they might also receive less attention in the private sector. But , as we found, this was not always the case. The research pipeline for the top 10 European pharmaceutical co mpanies suggests that firms seem to specialize in certain NCD categories. For example, pipeline data shows that SANOFI -AVENTIS , preferring to focus on other areas, does not have any CRD relevant molecules under development; other firms like GSK, however, are developing several. In the second place, we though it reasonable to assume that we should expect to see a relative ly similar commitment from major companies to the disease categories of COPD and asthma. Although COPD is by far the biggest source of l ost DALYs within the CRD category, analysts have suggest ed that there is a greater potential for developing pharmaceutical products for the treatment asthma than for the treatment of COPD. And indeed, where companies chose to focus their attention on CRDs , they did seem to have similar numbers of products available in each disease category. 17.68 16.97 11.79 6.15 5 05101520 Cancer Cardiovascular Mental Health Respiratory% Total of DALYS 3.02 1.21 0.44 00.511.522.533.5 CRDs% Appraisal CRDs 45 2.2 European Pharma ceutical Sector : Research Pipeline fo r CRD s The European pharmaceutical sector has five companies among the world's top ten pharmaceutical firms. And indeed, across Europe, t he sector is major investor in R&D. According to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries, the European pharmaceutical sector invested an estimated \u20ac30,630 million in R&D across Europe for the year 2013 (EFPI 2014). The industry also employs about 690,000 people and supports between three and four times than number of jobs across the EU area. The EFPI also asserts that the sector has suffered from the impact of European austerity measures introduced in response to the financial and debt crisis of 2008 -9 (EFPI 2014). 2.2.1. NOVARTIS (EUR) Novartis is a Swiss based company headquartered in Basel. It was formed in 1996 through the merger of Sandoz and Ciba -Geigy. In 2003, Novartis reintroduced the Sandoz brand as a s ingle subsidiary in which it consolidated its generic drugs businesses. Novartis divested its agrochemical and genetically modified crops business in 2000 with the spinout of Syngenta in partnership with AstraZeneca, which also divested its agrochemical business. Today, Novartis focuses its business on three leading divisions: pharmaceuticals (Novartis), eye care (Alcon) and generics (Sandoz) . Novartis is currently expanding its presence in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America, where there is fast -growing demand for access to high -quality medicines and healthcare. The company has more than 119.000 employees in over 150 countries.

But, considered in relation to other NCD categories, it yet remains the fifth largest cause of lost DALYs across the continent . According to the GBD, t he US seems to have larger problems with categories like diabetes and mental health than Europe; and the si tuation for CVDs and Cancer is somewhat reversed. In the US, CVDs are the largest disease category in terms of lost DALYs, but the levels of lost DALYs in Europe and the US are about the same. In the US, however, there is less burden of disease associated with cancer. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 51 Figure iv: NCDs in United States (2010 ) Percentage of Lost DALYs by Disease Category * *Sourced at: http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd -compare/ Breaking the CRD category into disease areas , COPD remains the largest contributor to lost DALYs in the US . Interestingly, the US and Europe have broadly similar levels of disease burden associated with asthma. Still, the US has a significantly higher level of disea se burden associated with COPD. Figure v: CRDs in United States for CRDs Five of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies have their headquarters in the US, which is also the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals, and a world leader for investment in R&D. U.S. firms carryout the majority of global R&D and hold the intellectual property rights on most new medicines. Considered as an aggregate, t he US research pipeline has approximately 3,400 compounds currently under development in the United States, which is signifi cantly more than any other region (PHRMA 2015). According to Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the US biopharmaceutical industry employs more than 810,000 people, supporting another approximately 3.4 million jobs nationally. In additi on, the US biopharmaceutical sector is one of the most R&D -intensive sectors in the United States and around the world. In the US, the industry invests more than 10 times the amount of R&D per employee than all manufacturing industries overall (PHRMA 2015 ). Based on the GBD data, the US pharmaceutical sector should demonstrate relatively similar levels of product commitment to CRDs, and perhaps also a similar levels of commitment to COPD and asthma.

MERCK (US) Merck US is headquartered in Kenilworth, New Jersey. The company was established in 1891 as a US subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was originally founded in 1668. During the First World War, the US government confiscated Merck and reestablished it as an independent American company. In 2013, Merck invested $7,500 million in R&D, which represents the largest amount in the sector both globally and the US. However, Merck's overall investment level in R&D has been progressively falling over the period (2010 -2014), with a major fall of 22.7% in 2011.

Since 2010, the company's investment in R&D has increased s ubstantially , by almost 50% 2.5 Discussion: The Pharmaceutical Research Pipeline fo r CRD s Overall, the European pharmaceutical sector has increased its commitment to R&D over the past four years. G SK is the only top 10 company to record a shrinking commitment to research investment. Some companies, like AstraZeneca, have recorded a massive increase in R&D spending. But most companies have recorded progressive of steady increases. By cont rast, US levels of investment in R&D have been more mixed. Companies at the top of the scale, like Merck and Pfizer, have steady reduced their levels of investment. At the lower end of the scale, companies like Gilead and Celgene have massively increased their commitment. Despite being the world leader for R&D investment in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector, major US companies have significantly less CRD -relevant molecules in their research pipeline s than European based companies. In several cases, US firms were not at all active in developing new molecules for CRDs. By contrast, European based pharmaceutical companies have a much greater commitment to CRDs in terms of pipeline development. Certainly, the top 10 European companies seem to sp ecialize in specific NCD categories, and major companies such as SANOFI -AVENTIS do not have any CRD relevant molecules under development at all. However, compared with the US, other large European firms like GSK, Novartis and AstraZeneca have quite a numb er of products in development. Indeed, these three firms consolidate more molecules in their research pipelines than do the top ten US firms collectively. Where the number of molecules under development in the United States is set against broadly similar levels of patent need in the US and Europe, there are grounds for concluding that US R&D commitment to CRD is lacking and perhaps even broadly insufficient to tackle to scale of the problem that these diseases represent. In the broader context of the academic literature, the observation that US R&D investment in CRDs underestimates the scale of the problem that disease areas like COPD and asthma represent in terms of unmet need also raises an important issue. For example, in the 1980s, analysts argued that, given significant levels of industry contribution to scientific advancement, public resources may well have been better directed to facilitating research in the industry sector rather than academic institutions (Koenig 1983, 35). At the time, where conventional wisdom would have suggested that pharmaceutical companies would primarily invest in developmental and applied research in order to advance their economic interests; and similarly, where commonplace thinking of th e time would have also suggested that both the industry and wider society was dependent on blue sky scientific research undertaken in a predominantly academic environment; analysts cast doubts on these ideas, finding that industry investments had contribut ed significantly to the vast body of scientific research in the public domain, which was guiding and influencing researchers everywhere (Koenig 1983; Nairn and Rozek 1988). Measuring the quality and quantity of industry published research in mainstream sc ientific journals, analysts found that industry investment in R&D has contributed significantly to advancement of broad based scientific research and the general public welfare through the 1970s and 1980s (Nairn and Rozek 1988, 139). In the 1980s, analyst s argued that the high citation rates of industry published papers represented \"non -trivial degree\" of contribution to the basic biomedical research literature (Koenig 1983, 35). Consequently, they suggested that encouraging industry investment in R&D via special tax treatments of expenditures, might even represent a more effective contribution to the public interest than investment in the public sector universities (Koenig 1983, 35). Indeed, these earlier analysts even questioned whether academic institu tions were the proper environment in which to sponsor basic scientific research given the pressing social interest in translating that research into pragmatic health technologies. Thus, g iven LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 59 the significant contribution of industry to scientific advancem ent, earlier analysts asked whether public resources were better directed to industry (Koenig 1983, 35). Today, however, in the case of CRDs at least, where industry investment in R&D seems insufficient to the level of patient need, there seem to be ground s for questioning the conclusions of these earlier analysts, and perhaps even some additional grounds for exploring new models of working between academic and industry based researchers. 2.6 Medical Devices Industry Investment in CRD s A Medical Device (MD) is an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including the software necessary for its proper application intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of: diagnosis , prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap, investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, control of conception, and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means (Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices). The objective of this section of the CA is to provide a detailed map of CRD relevant outputs of the Medical Devices Industry across the EU. In order to map MDs industry R&D investments, we identified a list of top 16 medical device manufacturers worldwide r anked by total revenue (updated to October 9, 2014). Based on website interrogations and annual reports, general information and total R&D expenses for each MD company have been collected for the period 2011 to 2014.

In the first place, we searched a database of clinical studies (i.e. c linicaltrials.gov) for recently (2011) closed and ongoing clinical studies funded by each MD company identified above. Secondly, we searched databases of new approved MDs (i.e. FDA premarket approval, de novo database, EuroScan) have been searched accor ding to the same time frame (2011 -2015). Thirdly, at the European Level, we searched a database of CE marked products exists since 2009, called EUDAMED. This database is only accessible to government agencies in charge for the market surveillance in each country (e.g. Ministero della Salute in Italy). In the US, by contrast , the relevant authority, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , has a whole section on the website with approval dossiers for all medical devices. Although there is not a direct link b etween technologies approved in the US and technologies licensed in the EU, knowledge of the most recent innovations overseas does provide some indication of the most up -to-date technologies that are available to improve clinica l practice for the management for CRDs . Therefore, the FDA premarket approval (PMA) and de novo databases have been searched for new approved products between 2011 and 2015. The 510(k) clearance has not been considered as this refers to products \"substantially equivalent\" to others already on the market. In this case, unlike the previous steps, the search has been performed according to indication in cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health. In addition to the FDA databases, we also searched the EuroScan Database. In Europe there is not an equivalent of the FDA online databases for new approved devices. We therefore relied on the EuroScan database. EuroScan is the International Information Network on New and Emerging Health Technologies , a collaborative network of member HTA agencies for the exchange of information on important emerging new drugs, devices, procedures, programmes, and settings in health care. Many European HTA agencies are members of the network (e.g. Agenas from Italy, N IHR 1 Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) ) has completed the acquisition of Covidien plc (NYSE: COV) in 2015 2 Actavis plc (NYSE: ACT) has completed the acquisition of Allergan, Inc.

The Medical Devices Industry provides a mixed picture in relation to investment in CRD research. Broadly, industry's commitment to R&D investment remained steady over the period and advancements were limited to individual companies. However, most compani es in the sector had not developed any CRD relevant medical devices. Bibliometric output data confirms this assessment. Very few companies had produced research outputs in terms of scientific papers. Novartis was responsible for the overwhelming majorit y of papers (76%) with Covidien claiming a 5.7% share, Johnson and Johnson 3.0%, Koninklijke Philips NV 2.8% and Siemens 2.6%. Considering the private sector as whole, i nvestment in R&D remains a principal activity of both the pharmaceutical and medical d evices industr ies. In the 1980s, analysts were confident that, throughout the 20th century, the industry ha d played a significant and indispensable role in the advancement of science through the production and publication of high quality research (Nairn a nd Rozek 1988, 139). However, the larger scientific paradigms under which R&D activities , particularly pharmaceuticals, are conducted has certainly undergone a tectonic shift. Back in the 1980s, industrial R& D was still about drug discovery on the basis of the old chemical paradigm, which reigned supreme throughout the 20th century. Under the chemical paradigm, drug discovery was about isolating the active ingredients of traditional remedies, serendipitous in novation and using discrete chemical substances to normalise biological processes (Drews 1998, Dutfield 2003, Allarakhia and Steven 2011). In this way, large pharmaceutical companies engaged in silo -chemistry, under which knowledge, new molecular entities (NMEs) and intellectual property was developed in house. In the 21st century, however, following the successful the mapping of the human genome, new pharmaceutical technologies are now created at the nexus of a number of intertwined disciplines: bio -phar macology, chemistry, nanotechnology, and computational sciences (Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 105). Today, drug discovery is about managing complex information that derives from a variety of disciplines, all of which exist outside the walls of the traditio nal pharmaceutical firm. In the twenty -first century, large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly forming research consortia to manage and exploit new forms of data that have arisen from parallel advances in molecular biology, nanotechnology, super -computing, statistical analysis and data management (Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 105). In the new millennium, analysts argue that, h istorically, the R&D process for drug discovery can be divided into three main epochs. The first epoch concerns the period of 1845 -1945, in which little LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 73 new drug development occurred, and minimal research was conducted along predominantly raw and unrefined methods. The second epoch arrived with the outbreak of the Second World War and the large -scale development of penicillin . This epoch involved a chemical paradigm for drug discovery, which continued until about 1990, and was characterized by rapid rates of new drug development and introduction. Although the third epoch of biotechnological, or systems medicine had its origi ns in 1970s; it has only recently matured and superseded the chemical epoch, and is characterized by the use of the tools of genetic engineering in the production and discovery of new drugs (David Mowery, 1999). With the changed research paradigm obliging companies both to explore a wide array of R&D trajectories , and also to utilise an increasing number of research methods, pharmaceutical companies are faced with new challenges regarding where and how knowledge is generated and protected (Orsenigo et al., 2001; Chiou et al 2011, 3 -4). In the pharmaceutical sector, intellectual property rights and the search for competitive advantage are closely linked than in any other sector (Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 105). Today, the fact that drug discovery occurs ou tside the silo of individual pharmaceutical firms complicates IPR and increases the costs and risk associated with general investment in R&D (Reppy, 2008; Hoyle and Pries,2009; Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 105). Crafted under the old chemical model of drug discovery, IPR rights in the industry centre on the manufacture of chemical compositions of matter. And t hroughout the 20th century, industry defended its IP claims in relation to methods of synthesis, formulations, dosing, methods of treatment, and drug delivery systems (Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 106). But, as the model of drug discovery changed, industry has been forced to change its strategy, to re -evaluate the current patent system in order to accommodate new discovery processes and new categories of ''biological'' goods (Foray, 2004; Woodcock, 2010; Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 106). The notion of a productivity crisis is an issue of some concern. In response to earlier analysts of the 1980s , analysts of the 21st century have asked, and with some j ustification, whether new models of drug discovery require new measures of industry productivity. In a changed environment for drug discovery, the ratio of R&D inputs to NME outputs may well be unreliable guide to productivity (Pammolli et al 2011, 428). With drug discovery involving manifold risks and uncertainties in terms of both knowledge generation and knowledge translation, several analysts are now suggesting that the quality of the outputs, in terms of the number of NMEs representing a therapeutic advance, is a much more relevant measure than of productivity than the absolute number of new drugs brought to market (Pammolli et al 2011, 428; Allarakhia and Steven 2011, 106; Light and Lexchin 2012, 1 -2). Certainly, the suggestion has some merit. Howe ver, when analysts have applied the new measure to industry productivity, it has revealed a crisis of much more different and perhaps even more alarming nature. Where today's analysts focus on innovation and quality rather than absolute numbers, they find that most NMEs provide only minor clinical advantages over existing treatments. Indeed, since the mid -1990s, an increasing number of independent reviews have found that about 85-90% of NMEs provided only few or no clinical advantages for patients at all (Light and Lexchin 2012, 1 -2). Today, it seems that the real crisis across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector is about innovation, not productivity. In the literature, analysts have associated this new notion of an innovation crisis with a num ber causes. For some, the crisis is the consequence of pharmaceutical companies attempting to control and regulate R&D costs associated with the new research paradigm. Analysts argue that companies are implementing sophisticated portfolio management tech niques to smooth out new -drug outputs, to minimize financial risk, for the purpose of bringing order and predictability to the new \"chaotic\" model of scientific discovery (Munos and Chin 2011, 1). Commercial management of R&D investment, processes and out put is a very recent development acorss the industry. Under the old chemical model of drug discovery, R&D divisions were ring fenced from the wider commercial initiatives of companies. Researchers were able to pursue drug discovery with greater freedom. As a consequence, they often produced therapies in disease areas in which companies had small LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 74 experience. Today, however, companies are attempting to join R&D divisions with market demand, instructing researchers to develop 'blockbuster drugs', which pro duce great more than $1 billion in returns per annum, that support wider marketing interests (Munos and Chin 2011, 1). But with the fact that most new drugs fail to constitute on advance on existing clinical therapies, some analysts fear that the industry is working on the basis of a 'hidden business model' which turns on the manufacture of scores of minor variant drugs, only some of which go on to become big \"market blockbusters\" (Light and Lexchin 2012, 2). The purpose of the hidden model is to smooth t he highs and lows of the drug discovery process, which, otherwise, would produce scores of costly failures punctuated with a few high yielding successes, thereby scaring away investors looking for a capital safe havens. Under the hidden business model, sa les from variants generate profits throughout the ups and downs of blockbusters coming off patents. Meanwhile, telling stories about an \"innovation crisis\" to politicians and the press serves as a wider \"ploy\", a clever industry \"strategy to attract a range of government protections\" from free market and generic competition (Light and Lexchin 2012, 1) Others suggest that larger macro -strategic interests are responsible for the innovation crisis. In 2011, a former President of Pfizer Global Research and Development suggested that \"the impact of mergers and acquisitions on R&D\" were a less well documented contributor to the crisis (LaMattina 2011, 559). Mergers and acquisitions were usually accompanied by downsizing, integration and streamlining of R&D ca pabilities and infrastructure, resulting in the shutdown of many research facilities. The impact of mergers and acquisitions on the \"R&D of the organizations involved has been devastating\" (LaMattina 2011, 559) Largely, it has produced less competition and less aggregate investment. Cut backs have hit hard in areas like antibacterial drugs and neuroscience. These impacts, they claim, should be of major concern to patients, physicians and governments especially at a time when sufferers of NCDs like Alzh eimer's disease and diabetes are in dire need of new treatments (LaMattina 2011, 560). In a related way, other analysts associate the crisis with economic forces, whereby industry aims to maximise profit by protecting and expanding market share. Today, in dustry pursues health as a commodity which can be bought by those with the resources to pay. Accordingly, company interactions with its own researchers and outside clinicians are founded on a profit motive. In funding research, commercial motives control the study design and the use of comparators. Companies conduct seeding trials promote familiarity with new drugs for marketing purposes rather than knowledge creation (Macleod et al 2014, p. 104). They engage with clinicians for the purpose of offsettin g the costs of high R&D investment by buying into the discoveries of other companies, exploiting them via marketing, brand recognition and instilling brand loyalty. For these reasons, analysts fear that the research pipeline for new drugs will soon run dr y, leaving the public to the mercies of whatever illnesses befall them (Light and Lexchin 2012, 1). LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 75 3 Stakeholder Interviews : CRDs Today, fewer EU citizens are contracting infectious and communicable diseases. Enjoying longer average life -spans, however, they are increasingly developing more debilitating non -communicable conditions that fall within the general category of CRDs. Broa dly, CRDs involve a decline in lung function. They include major conditions like: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory allergies, pulmonary hypertension, chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema and occupational lung diseases (Bousquet e t al 2007, 216). Of these conditions, the two major and most common are asthma and COPD. For asthma, the decline can be temporary and associated with environmental stimulants. For conditions such as Cardio Pulmonary Obstruction Disorder (COPD), the decl ine can be permanent and associated with individual behavioral factors, like tobacco smoking. Both these conditions are largely preventable. In the developed MSs of the European Union, CRDs are typically associated with increased tobacco -use, obesity, so cio-economic inequalities and limited access to healthcare resources (Yach et al 2004, 2617). And across Europe, policy -makers engaged in funding research for developing interventions and prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of CRDs before they req uire a public health response. In total, there are 118 Research Funding Organizations (RFOs) investing in CRD research. In Eastern Europe, all RFOs are government organizations, and third sector RFOs do not exist. In Western Europe, there is a greater number of charitable and voluntary sector RFOs. In all cases, however, few of these RFOs are devoted exclusively to CRD research, and the majority make research investments in other NCD disease areas. While accurate mapping of RFOs and their funding activities via surveys and bibliometrics can assist government in identifying the most fruitful approaches to making in NCD investments research ; policy makers must also take account of the often strong visions and firm priorities of leaders in the field of CR D research. To this end, MAPPING_NCDs necessarily involves the conduct of semi - structured interviews as a means for eliciting the preferences and opinions of key CRD stakeholders. In this way, the project opens a dialogue with CRD researchers on the basi s that qualitative interviews hold the potential to develop wider theory and hypothesis for both mapping CRD research funding , and also improving the relevance, efficiency and impact of CRD research investment (Wright et al 2014). To a some extent, n ew strategies and funding initiatives for CRD research must align with the scientific, clinical and economic priorities and interests of leaders in the field of CRD research. For this reason, the mapping of CRD research activities need s to consider stakeho lder motivation and views for improving research investment strategies and outcomes for CRD. Stakeholders are located at various points of the CRD research funding process. Typically, CRD funding originates from a variety of sources: national governments (European Union Member States), international organizations with regional or global reach (OECD, WHO Regional Office for Europe, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations), the private sector (pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industry), charities (European Diabetes Foundation, Macmillan Cancer, World Cancer Research Fund), non -governmental organizations (United Nations Children's Fund, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and, importantly, supranational organiz ations (European Investment Bank, Council of Europe, The European Commission) as well as public -private partnerships (e.g. the Innovative Medicines Initiative). Stakeholders can either be directly associated with NCD research or involved in making researc h investments in NCD research. At both of these points, MAPPING _NCDs makes contact with stakeholders, seeking their views on both the current and future state of funding for CRD research. As a research technique, semi -structured interviews provide oppo rtunity to develop hypotheses about the future shape of CRD research funding. Enabling close collaboration between the LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 76 researchers and stakeholders, interviews allow stakeholders to describe their views of the current state of CRD research and to improve researcher's understandings of the key factors influencing the current and future shape of CRD research. They hold a capacity to answer the 'how' and 'why' of CRD research funding, allowing researchers to understand how funding activities are influenced b y individuals and the contexts in which they are embedded (Baxter and Jack 2008, 556). Consequently, interviews have the potential to improve the quality of the wider mapping exercise by providing researchers with more complete understandings of causes an d effects, enabling them to develop better ideas for future funding strategies that target more relevant factors. Ultimately, the purpose of the stakeholder interviews is to open a sophisticated and collaborative dialogue between decision makers and key p ersonnel involved in the conduct of CRD research with a view to producing a more nuanced map of CRD research funding, and thereby heighten the potential for improving the state of CRD research funding in the future. 3.1 Methods Stakeholders were purposiv ely selected to reflect a range of factors including: expertise in CRD research, geographic location and expertise in awarding research funding . For all stakeholders, interview questions explored (1)current threads of research; (2) future research areas; (3) types of collaborations; (4) working with collaborators; (5) working with the private sector ; (6) types of funding organizations; (7) working with funding organizations; (8) future strategies for funding NCD research. Personnel were selected to refle ct a range of geographical regions across the EU. The aim was to solicit views and experiences of people involved in both the conduct and funding of research across the EU area . In total, 14 interviews were conducted. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. Consent was gained for all interview subjects and their anonymity. Transcripts were typed verbatim, proof read and corrected, while notes and comments were collected and made into memos. Transcripts were analyzed on a thematic basis, with responses collated under the most common themes , and reported in the results section below. Examples from the analysis are included below to explain or illustrate key points. While retaining anonymity , the speakers have been identified by their order of int erview in order to allow readers to distinguish different voices. 3.2 Results Interviews with stakeholders revealed five major themes with regard to the future of research in the area of CRDs. There was a generalised recognition of the growing importanc e of stratified medicine, which sever al informants considered to be the future of research across the wider spectrum of NCDs. Other informants emphasised the importance of directing research towards tackling individual CRDs such as COPD and asthma. For C OPD, informants stressed that the future was equally about non -clinical measures like smoking cessation, public health and health service delivery and also about relieving the symptoms of COPD via pharmaceutical treatments. For asthma, informants suggeste d there was a greater scope for developing innovative and game -changing pharmaceutical s than for COPD. Across the broader spectrum of CRDs, and indeed NCDs, Informants also suggested that there was a need to find new ways of working with private sector. Consistent with the academic literature, stakeholders emphasised that the model for drug discovery has changed and that pharmaceutical companies were less prepared to take risks in regard to allocating resources. Consequently, there was a need for academi c institutions to pursue the basic science that pharmaceutical companies were no longer able to conduct for themselves. Other informants suggested that these new research requirements needed to fit within a wider strategic approach to the funding of NCD research that accommodated the both needs of researchers and the requirement s of funders to demonstrate the effectiveness of their investments LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 77 3.2.1. Stratified Medicine At the more generalized level, some informants insisted that the future for CRD research lay in relation to 'stratified medicine'. Sometimes called ' personalized medicine', stratified medicine involves the practice of subdividing patients into groups based on their responses to therapies or their risk profile for developing certain disease conditions. Ultimately, stratified medicine is using knowledge of patients and disease pathways to ensure that the right patients, receive the right types of medicine at the right times. Tow ards this end, it is also about early diagnosis and predicting the onset of disease using biological markers that divide patients in to groups for the purpose treating the disease much earlier. Informants suggested that \"stratified medicine is definitely the future\", that it was going to be the future \"whether we like it or not\". As a consequence, \"we have got to make sure the respiratory community is properly connected with it\" (13) A stratified approach to CRD research was about understanding the role o f epigenetic processes in the origins and onset of conditions like asthma and COPD, processes that \"connect environment and genetics really.\" In these disease areas, informants explained that the practice of stratified medicine involved \"developing new mod els to study respiratory disease by taking human cells, stem cells, expanding them in tissue culture and studying interactions with those cells in vitro, both in asthma, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis\" (13) For the future, these practices would demand a more 'team orientated' approach to CRD research, which informants sometimes termed \"big science\" or \"team science\". Team science was about \"bringing data together... being able to...integrate it.\" And it required CRD researchers to utilize skill sets that de rived from outside the scientific disciplines, skills associated with other areas of industry \"such as the computational and data analytic industries, not just the pharmaceutical industries\". By employing the skills, stratified medicine held the potential to explain why \"there is a lot of fall off\", or a lot drugs \"that are no longer as effective\" upon their original manufacture (13). Attempting to connect CRD research with stratified medicine, some informants explained that organizations like \"the Europe an Respiratory Society,\" were forming \"a new research agency in Europe where we can pool resources from across Europe to try and take greater advantage of the data and team science approach\" (13) These processes of teaming -up and pooling data were about cr eating \"disease registers\" or \"biobanks\" that consolidate \"clinical trial data\", which could \"be analysed in large data sets...it is all about joining up really.\" With the ultimate aim being to deliver the right drug to the right patient and the right st age of development, teaming up or doing big science is about linking the disease, the patient and the treatment. With the mapping of the human genome, \"it's getting much easier, we have got more and more genes which tell us whether we've got pre -disposit ion now.\" (5). For the future, \"the big challenge now that our community is working with is how to integrate those data. (13) In terms of research, this creates the need to \"capture the richness of the biological disease area and what we tended to do in t he past is to concentrate on rather pure aspects of disease without looking at the wider implications of the disease in society \". In addition, stratified medicine provides human based tissues and cells and genes \"to be able to show that linkage between th e pathway and the disease. \" (13) It is about \"capturing the gene through to the phenotype and the different stages\" of the disease. Practicing big science CRD researchers were \"forming these groups now.... very big cohorts, disease cohorts and COPD, bron chial asthma, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, various other diseases... we haven't exploited them fully yet, and that is the challenge for the next five years. But they are in place now. (13)\" Historically, the respiratory community have relied probably too much on industry to support them in trials and all this sort of stuff. But today, \"the [CRD] community is having to reinvent itself.\" (13) For CRD research, the future, some argued, would thus be \"all about salami slicing complex dis ease around common pathways and identifying what those pathways are....and to be able to do that, we have got to be able to integrate these difference levels of information really.\" Some informants were adamant that the shift to stratified medicine was ine vitable across the wider spectrum of NCDs. \"If they want healthy aging, then they want to be able to predict who is heading for ill health, ten years, LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 78 fifteen years before it happens\". (5) Stratified medicine \"is the way medicine is going to be, you're going to be able to identify people at high risk long before they get the illness and there are some areas where we desperately need those genes .\" (5) 3.2.2. COPD In terms of major CRD conditions such as asthma and COPD, informants suggested that future research areas would likely focus on stemming attacks that have the potential to result in hospitalisation or death. Typically, these hospitalisations were the result of respiratory infections associated with \"the same viruses that for a healthy person give s them a common cold\". At a disease level focus, the aim of researchers was to develop \"better therapies to either prevent or, if we can't prevent, treat [infections] when they do occur\" (12) Beyond hospitalisation, future research for COPD would also li kely focus on simple strategies of disease management, early diagnosis and smoking reduction. Indeed, the difficulty with COPD is that lung decline is irreversible and that lung functionality also declines naturally with age. COPD is about \"an inevitable and prolonged decline due to premature aging.\" Unlike asthma and other CRDs, \"the horse has already bolted with COPD\". COPD is the consequence of \"damage which has already occurred over years\". Consequently, drugs that target \"reversing inflammation o r preventing the inflammatory process.... do it from thereon in.\"; and treatments for COPD are not going to improve damaged lungs. With COPD, lungs lose their elasticity, \"they have lost their structure, you are not going to reverse that\" (3). Certainly, asthma is a reversible process, \"you would expect medication to reverse the process.\" But COPD is largely \"an accelerated ageing of the lung and you can't reverse that.\" At best \"you can improve it with some things, but those things don't work by revers ing the pathological process. It makes COPD different\" (3) For these reasons, informants put much emphasis on \"early diagnosis... because most patients with COPD have an opportunity missed many years before to make the correct diagnosis\" (3). Informants even went so far as to suggest that \"three quarters of the people with COPD have yet to be diagnosed\". And, in some cases, they explained that these people were already suffering from the disease quite seriously. \"Between 10% and 30% of patients who are admitted to hospital with an exacerbation of COPD\" have never been diagnosed (3). In the main, these people have not been diagnosed because \"diagnostic spirometry or case finding is not available.\" As one informant suggested, spirometry is a priority not for scientific research. Rather, it is a priority for \"implementation research\". It is \"a fairly basic tool\". Today, \"you can't go to your G.P ... without getting your blood pressure taken or cholesterol or something, but very few of them will do specu lative spirometry and case finding spirometry\" (3). Thus, the future for COPD research is not exclusively clinical. In the past, old models of care involve \"reactive hospitals for unexpected emergencies,\" but today researchers are looking at \"trying to link up primary and secondary care or primary and specialist care in a way that makes those distinctions less obvious\" (3 -2). For the future, the emphasis is on \"chronic disease management...taking a symptom based approach\" which involves a focus on key sy mptoms such as breathlessness and may have a relationship to other NCDs like CVD. (3) This strategy involves \"giving patients control over their condition, getting their involvement in it, their health professionals around self -management and around chro nic disease models which straddle acute care and long -term care\". (3) A problem with \"COPD particularly\" is that \"people are seen of the victim of their own habits\", specifically in relation to smoking. But this is often \"grossly unfair for several reaso ns.\" Informants pointed out that \"only about 15% of smokers will get COPD.\" There are degrees of vulnerability. It is not inevitable that smokers contract COPD . \"Some people are particular vulnerable to cigarette smoking.\" (3) Furthermore, \"smoking r ates... are declining\". And this fact is \"not reflected in a reduction in the prevalence of COPD\". Here, informants identified two reasons: one occupational exposures or... domestic exposures like passive smoking and through biomass fuel cooking\" are LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 79 responsible for continued incidence of COPD; and two, the fact that \"lung function declines with age anyway\" has also ensured steady incidence rates for COPD. As people age, they \"are developing COPD as a function of age and much more minor damage to their l ungs from other agencies.\" In the past, a person aged 50 or 60 \"would develop COPD predominantly through cigarette smoking.\" But today people are developing COPD in their \"70's and 80's and developing COPD through a combination of mild noxious exposure, p lus advancing age.\" Informants explained that the demographic profile of COPD is \"changing so that is why the incidence hasn't really changed because of the ageing factor and ageing population\" (3). There is also much potential for research in the sociolog y of COPD. \"Why is it that some people just sit at home and watch the T.V when they've got lung disease and others try and get on top of it?\" (3 - 8) Scientists explained that non -clinical factors \"taking pathophysiology into the sociological world\", purs uing novel collaborations and extensions into other fields \"may help explain a lot of the things that we don't know about\" (3). Others felt that the emphasis should shift \"towards how you integrate the findings and service delivery and primary prevention and how you actually make it happen... all the way to rehabilitation and palliative care in cardiovascular disease\" (10) Informant explained that \"the health services and public health component has been seriously under -funded\" (10). The emphasis is on \"r isk factors\" and treatments, not necessarily \"on public health and primary prevention on health services research.\" (10) Today, research was focussed on \"medical treatment rather than thinking about what can we do to prevent, whether to actually prevent s ome people from taking up smoking\" 10 -2. Indeed, some maintained that \"population level approaches are actually more effective than individual level approaches\". The challenge lies in the implementation. For example, tobacco regulation necessarily excit es the interest of the tobacco industry, and is also \" an income source for governments\" (10). Referring to the plain packaging issue, informants suggested that \"Australia's currently the only country actually doing something about it... against tobacco i ndustry interests\" (10). Overall, informants suggested that COPD was the CRD \"which causes the most trouble economically.\" (3) Once a patient contracts the disease, the challenge is to slow down or prevent the progression of the disease. But once they ha ve it, \"acute attacks are by far the biggest problem. And they're a bigger problem in COPD than they are in asthma, in that people sit in hospital sometimes for weeks. They end up in intensive care. Once they've been in, they come in repeatedly. So, that's a big issue.\" (12) In western countries, the big public health issue is reducing smoking at a population level. (12) But there are also \"other lifestyle factors which they can improve on, particularly around physical activity and alike and may be obes ity if that is coexisting...if you wait until they're very symptomatic or they're going to hospital you are not going to achieve anything (3). 3.2.3. Asthma Clinically, informants pointed out that significant scope remains for improving outcomes for as thma sufferers. Asthma is a temporary condition that involves a hypersensitivity to external stimulants. For asthma, \"the basic problem is one of internal malfunction.... we are on the cusp of a lot of biological drugs for asthma like Metho and others. So there will be more expensive drugs coming for asthma, but probably not for COPD.\" (3) In the first place, the aim is always \"to prevent asthma happening\" (12). And asthma researchers are interested in helping lungs to develop tolerances to external stimulants. In this respect, the challenges are to identify both the external stimulants and the internal triggers that result in attacks. Informants pointed to t he \"potential for a huge improvement if you can find the key, potentially the airways can return to normal....become less responsive and less twitchy\" (3). Once the attack occurs \"then trying to cure it would be the next desire. And that comes down pretty much to the same thing\" (12) In this respect researchers were LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 80 interested in \"acute attacks of disease and what can you do about those.\" For mild asthma, the condition is \"relatively well -treated by drugs we have currently available but severe asthma is n ot. \" (12). And there are also fruitful areas of research around paediatric asthma, \"linking allergy and asthma, especially around food allergy, peanut allergy... to try and understand how sensitisation can enhance asthma really\" (13) Interestingly, info rmants suggested that stratified medicine was also relevant to asthma research. Researchers are involved in projects that built \"a handprint, a diagnostic handprint, of the different subtypes of asthma using progenomics, genomics, transcriptomics a nd so on.\" 13 -2. Here, the research challenge involves \"developing team science within respiratory medicine, so that we have go the expertise to exploit these amazing interpretative datasets really\" (13) 3.2.4. Working with the Private Sector Informants were very much aware that the role of the pharmaceutical sector in NCD research was undergoing profound changes. As one suggested, \"the pharmaceutical industry has shrunken so much and closed various places down, especially in our field....respiratory\" (13). Generally, informants understood that bar for developing new drugs is higher \"because the easy fruit have been picked. And it's the difficult things that are left\". In the past, \"the industry had more money. They had less costs ...associated with drug development.\" Today, clinical research \"has got more and more expensive as the demands of the regulatory authorities have increased. So, there's simply less money in the coffers\". (12) Typically, informants identified two reasons for the shrinking o f the industry. In the first place, the \"patent cliff\" in which some important drugs \"used in asthma have come off patent and therefore profits into the companies are dramatically falling.\" (13) And in the second place, the model of drug discover had cha nged. The old chemical paradigm had given way to \"the stratified medicine approach\", the process of \"catching up complex disease into disease related pathways and targeting those is where it is all going and industry is having to reinvent itself really, basically, to be able to deal with this.\" (13). As a consequence, informants suggested that the industry \"can't afford to do their own basic research and they're better off partnering with academic institutions and getting the basic research done in partne rship with academic institutions. And some of them are very reasonable indeed about the intellectual property sharing.\" (12) The practice of stratified medicine would oblige the clinical academic community \"to work much closer with industry than they have ever worked before\". And for some informants, working with the private sector was about a straight forward exercise of working within the established processes of private sector research. As one informant described: \"I had an idea... based on the admini stration of this medication. So I approached the people from the company and I learned about the procedure.... they...have something like internal grant... so I applied....went through all the paper work...and at the end were successful so got the funding from them.\" (1) Often, the private sector has more resources, they pointed out,. \"if you are able to justify the costs you would get full funding.\" Unlike public sector RFOs, pharma companies don't say, \"'okay we will fund you the grant', but only give y ou 60% because 100% will be too much. That is also one of the reasons why I would go to Pharma\" (1) Several informants also noted that drug companies were making less amounts of money available for basic research. Essentially, they thought that pharmaceu tical companies were less willing to take risks. \"Their readiness to spend money on basic research is diminished.\" (12). One informant suggested that \"at GSK\" and also other companies, were \"spending all their money developing yet another bronchodilator and yet another inhaled steroid, rather than looking at innovative approaches.\" (12). While there remained a potential for discovering game -changing drugs in relation to asthma, some informants even confided that the private sector may not be relevant t o the treatment of some CRDs. For example, with COPD, the largest CRD, \"inhaled treatment, the drug treatment is icing on LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 81 the cake. The things that do work, as I said to you at the beginning, are very basic things\" (3). Informants thought that most phar maceutical research is \"aimed at market share, they're not.... they're all aimed at prompting the product. They are not about new science.\" (3) And particularly in terms of COPD, \"it's not an area where you're going to find a cure because you can't revers e time.\" (3) As a consequence, \"pharmaceutical research in that area has been focused on improving symptoms... improving on bronchodilators... taking them...now once a day because they have longer acting preparations, or they have different combinations o f bronchodilators, or bronchodilators or inhaled steroids just around convenience or delivery side of things. So I'm not hopeful in COPD that anything will come out (3). For COPD, research is mostly about delivering care, \"making sure that patients are d iagnosed and reviewed, that they receive smoking cessation, active smoking cessation, that they get their flu immunisations and go to rehab.\" For the future, COPD research is \"about organisation of care, not about new drugs... pharma hasn't come up with an ything qualitatively new for COPD for twenty or thirty years\" (3). And furthermore, in terms of COPD, researchers, particularly non -clinical CRD researchers, were reluctant to become involved with the private sector. \"I just felt like it was important t o me to maintain my virginity. I could have gotten a lot of money and made a lot of money, personally, doing it. But... I mean I get attacked all the time by tobacco interests and other bad guys. And being able to say I've never taken a penny from these pe ople. Yes, I know them. They're friends of mine. I talk to them. We have some common interests. I help them sometimes. But there's never been any formal monetary relationship. I think it protects the credibility of our work.\" (7) However, some argued that the lack of industry risk -tolerance created a new role for academics. Companies are \"still looking for new approaches\", but \"generally pretty poorly, I would say. They follow the literature. But if you went to anybody at GSK and asked them detail on the s ort of work I'm doing or any other academic, they wouldn't be able to give you detail\" (12). In short, there was a need for new types of collaborations. In the past, collaborations were often ad -hoc and sporadic. \"Sometimes you meet them at congresses a nd sit down and chat and give them some ideas. And they might then decide to put some money into your work because they find it interesting. But it often... it also changes with personnel. You often have a relationship with a person in a company. And when that person moves on, you've then got to build a new relationship with new teams. So, it's a constantly moving ball -game\" (12). Others, however, pursued more unique collaborations. As one informant remarked: \"we made a discovery about why viruses trigger asthma attacks and patented that.\" On the basis of this discovery, the university based scientists formed their own company to tempt the interest of larger pharmaceutical companies. It \"wasn't a fashionable thing to do in those days I have to tell you.\" Fortunately, the experiment worked: \"the agent we were going to administer had a lot of the safety toxicology already done on it... so all we had to do was adapt it for inhalation. So I and two of my colleagues formed the company, got some seed funding a nd then launched it on the alternative investment market.... and it has done really well.\" (13) The academics out -licenced the clinical development of the agent to a large pharma company \"for $230 million to [deleted]...it worked really well... now we are bringing forward three new products...back into the company from [university] to further develop them\" (13). The process demonstrates that the conduct of \"high quality basic bimolecular science in a university setting\" can eventually turn \"into something where patients are going to benefit at the end of the day\". For informants, these were useful partnerships in which academics could use their expertise and also allow others to uses theirs. The partnership was not \"just selling it off to big companies\", but developing the hard science, and increasing its value, \"and then passing it on to those that can best develop it\" (13). Informants explained that pharmaceutical companies were also useful in \"giving some seed funding because they were interested in t he idea, but also helped us with the legal and patent side of it all, which sometimes academia does not do very well.\" (13) LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 82 3.2.5. Funding Future CRD Research Overall, informants suggested that RFOs could take advantage of these developments largely throu gh the pursuit of a \"broad portfolio\" of research. In other words, RFOs needed to develop a research pipeline in which they consolidated \"some quick wins.. translation in the next five years...gets into the clinic, everybody's happy, everyone can see wher e the money is going\". In addition, RFOs also needed to develop a pipeline of \"underpinning research that funds the translational work that will be taking place in five, ten, fifteen, twenty years' time \" (9). Ultimately, informants suggested that \"politicians like five year cycles,\" which often fitted nicely with their electoral mandate. \"It makes sense for them to have these quick wins\" (9). Scientifically, however, \"you've got to think longer term than th at\". And in developing the longer term, \"you've then got to think\" (9) 3.3 Discussion and Conclusion Perhaps the most striking themes to emerge from the stakeholder interviews were the significant emphasis several informants place on stratified medicine , and the consequent changes to collaborations between industry and academic researchers. Certainly, analysis of the academic literature in relation to shifting methods of working in the private sector confirms that the pharmaceutical industry is in the g rip of major system ic change s. In response to the rapidly changing environment, both the literature and our informants suggests that industry has implemented conservative management practices for the purpose of increasingly the predictability of drug disc overy and the sustainability of returns on capital investment in R&D. For example, sources in the literature argue that investments in R&D produce NMEs that are, at best, only marginally better than existing therapies, thereby stifling innovation and ampl ifying a sense of crisis across the industry (Munos and Chin 2011, 1). And f or the future, sources in the literature fear that unless industry ceases to pursue \"safe\" risk -averse management strategies, unless it adopts more collaborative approaches to kno wledge creation and costs sharing, few breakthroughs will reach patients and sufferers of disease (Munos and Chin 2011, 1). Indeed, these sources counsel that sustainability and risk aversion did not characterise the breadth of vision shown by the industr y's early pioneers. Figures like Eli Lilly , the literature argues, thrived on tumult and disruption. Successfully developing so -called 'wonder drugs' like insulin, figures like Lily did not aim to support the company's other prosperous product lines in d ubious tonics and elixirs. They did not engage in risk assessment, they held no concerns for brand recognition, and no anxieties about market share. Lilly immediately recognised the medical importance of the new drug, and trusted his scientists to rise t o the challenge of mastering its implementation in clinical practice (Munos and Chin 2011, 1). In the twenty first century, however, the entrepreneurial model is gone. Consistent with the views of stakeholders, t he literature suggests that industry must find new means by which to respond to unmet need, particularly in the area of NCDs. In pursuing this new mode of drug discover, there may be significant scope for new types of collaborations between academics and industry, with each taking advantage of the other's major skill sets. As informants suggest, a cademics may need to pursue the raw science of drug discovery through the analysis of big data sets. Upon making breakthroughs, academics may need to secure patents, explore the launch of IPOs, which could function as the scientific plankton for the development of new pharmaceutical technologies. Both industry and university based academics may also need to gain more experience in negotiating mutually amicable IP rights, with academics recognizing th e skills of industry in relation to the clinical development of NMEs . Certainly, key informants have described useful collaborations with industry along these lines which have ultimately ensured that suffers gain access to innovative pharmaceutical treatm ents. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 83 4 Bibliometrics: Impact of CRD Research Funding A key goal of MAPPING_NCD s is to establish the impact of funding investment across five key NCD areas: cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer and mental health . In this aim , MAPPING_NCD moves beyond the state of the art in the research area by pursuing bibliometric mapping and analysis of the volume of research outputs in the EU and MSs relevant to these disease categories . Bibliometrics establishes the impact of f unding investments by mapping and analyzi ng of the volume , citations, funding sources, influence on clinical guidelines and newspaper stories of research papers and reviews in the Web of Science (WoS) published in EU MSs during the last ten years (2002 -12). Where funded research produce s scientific papers, funding is considered to have had 'impact'. Bibliometrics identifies specific impacts associated with individual research papers through citations in other relevant papers. B ibliometrics also check s funding acknowledgments in relevant scientific papers . It considers the extent to which they have provided the evidence base for clinical guidelines relevant to various NCDs . And, it also considers the extent to which they are cited in stories about NCD re search in newspapers and the broadcast media in MS . In this way, the impact of the paper is associated with the relative values that papers achieve against these measures. 4.1 What is Research Impact? Measuring the impact of research is a complex task. Often, health improvements depend on a host of different research discoveries, which are made at different times and in different places . The pathway from the conduct and publication of research to better health is usually indirect. In addition, the re sults of research contribute to better health in different ways , from the improved diagnosis and treatment of patients to the prevention of illness or the reduction incidence . Figure vi: Links between research and healthcare improvement details the manifold linkages between research funding and health impacts. Figure vi: Links between research and healthcare improvement Among these many nodes and linkages, 'government policy' occupies a central position and has a several linkages to other nodes. Moreover, the 'reduction of illness incidence' also depends on a LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 84 large number of inputs, including: environmental pollution, individual health behaviours, wealth, education and the effectiveness of public health campaigns. Thus, it can be observed that r esearch impacts upon all these nodes , many of which are not specific to individual disease area s. Similarly, different types of research can also deliver advances in individual disease areas. And for these reasons, the norms for measur ing both the effectiveness of research and its quality can also differ. Nevertheless, all of these nodes are inter -connected . A nd at connection points, hard evidence of research impact necessarily accumulates. In the main, the evidence of research impact manifests itself in the paper trails that flow between one node and another. For example, research funding produces research, which produces papers in scientific journals, which in turn lead to citations in other journals , decision making influence, policy , media stories and even the allocation of additional research grants. Tracking and analyzing these paper trails, using them as a proxy for research impact, is the fundamental business of bibliometic research. In this section of the paper, we utilize bibliometric methods to analyses data that accumulates at five of these nodes along the many paths to research impact for CRDs. These nodes are : Scientific research papers Funding sources (d ecisions on funding ) Citations The evidence base of clinical guidelines; The stories in newspapers and the research papers that they cite. 4.2 Scientific Research Papers: CRDs The first means by which b ibliometric analysis establish es funding impacts is by the number of published scientific papers . This section of the report details the number of downloads papers for CRDs whose details are in the Web of Science (WoS) from 31 European countries (the 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) in the 12 years 2002 -13. To this end, bibliometric analysis utilizes two overlapping databases , the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI) and also the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI ), for the provision of knowledge on socio -economic impact and behavioral interventions associated with CRDs . The report identifie s by means of a \"filter\" whose precision and recall was determined by means of experts in the subject area marking sets of paper s as relevant or not. Filters were developed for each of the five disease areas : Cancer research (oncology): ONCOL Cardiovascular research, including stroke: CARDI Diabetes research: MENTH, and Respiratory disease research: RESPI Details for each filter were written to five Excel spreadsheets for analysis , which are explained in each of the five relevant Critical Appraisal documents . The main analyses were of country outputs, their research levels (from clinical t o basic) and for some subject areas, the type of research or disease. Each filter was applied to the Web of Science for the Science Citation Index (extended) - SCI - and for the Social Sciences Citation Index(SSCI), for the twelve years 2002 -13, and artic les and reviews only were identified. The papers were also limited to those with at least one address in one or more of the following 31 countries - the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Table 2 lists the countr ies with their digraph ISO codes. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 85 Table lxii: List of 31 countries used to limit the downloaded papers ISO Country ISO Country ISO Country ISO Country AT Austria EE Estonia IS Iceland PL Poland BE Belgium ES Spain IT Italy PT Portugal BG Bulgaria FI Finland LT Lithuania RO Romania CH Switzerland FR France LU Luxembourg SE Sweden CY Cyprus GR Greece LV Latvia SI Slovenia CZ Czech Rep. HR Croatia MT Malta SK Slovakia DE Germany HU Hungary NL Netherlands UK United Kingdom DK Denmark IE Ireland NO Norway The \"full record\", which includes all addresses, e -mails and funding details (where given) were then downloaded to a series of 12 \"year\" files, 500 papers at a time. These were then processed by a special macro to produce one combined Excel spreadsheet. Each paper in the combined sheet was given an individual index number, and the following parameters were recorded: Names of all authors, in the format SMITH -AB Paper title Source (journal name, year, volume, issue, pages) Journal name Document type (article or review) Addresses (all in upper case, separated by a forward slash). Note: in the WoS UK papers are attributed separately to ENGLAND, WALES, SCOTLAND or NORTH -IRELAND. Country of publication Year of publication Month of publication (for most p apers where the date of the journal was given) Language (almost all were in English) E-mail address(es) of corresponding author, sometimes others Funders, FU (for late 2008 papers and subsequently) Funding acknowledgement text, FX Composite list of authors and their individual addresses (from 2008) Authors' full names (where given), in the format Wilhelm, Hans; Wanke, Isabel; Hirche, Herbert (this allows the sex of most of the authors to be determined) Whether in the SCI or SSCI only Although most papers in the WoS have their chosen keywords and formal abstracts, these were not recorded in the main spreadsheet as they would have made it far too cumbersome. From the paper title, a macro was applied to determine if the paper could be classed as \"clinical \" or \"basic\" or \"both\", according to the presence of one or more words on two lists (see Lewison and Paraje, 2004 ). The research level of the journal in which the paper was published was also determined from a master list, based on the same scheme; clinical j ournals were classed as RL = 1 and basic ones as RL = 4, and ones in between were given an RL value as a decimal number between 1.0 and 4.0. These RL values were determined for groups of five years, 2000 -04, 2005 -09 and 2010 -14. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 86 In order to measure the im pact of CRDs, a specialized RESPI filter was created. The RESPI filter, like the filters for other disease areas, consists of two main parts: a list of specialist journals and another list of title words. In terms of definition and subject area, the filt er was discussed with a leading expert in the field, Professor Tariq Sethi of Guy's Hospital, King's College London. Following these discussions, the filter was created to include the major non -infectious respiratory diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, a sthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary/respiratory disease, cystic fibrosis, and emphysema. However, it was also contrcuted to include the effects of infection if the primary problem was one of pulmonary insufficiency (e.g., for environmental or genetic rea sons). CRD is one of the smaller NCD research areas. By comparison with other disease areas, the RESPI filter was short and listed four specialist journals and eight title words or phrases. As expected, it generated the smallest of the five NCD files, wi th just 18822 papers, of which 188 were in the SSCI only (1.0%). The calibration gave values for precision, p = 0.939 and recall, r = 0.884. Table lxiii: Outputs and Parameters of the five NCDs by size Subject World output * EUR31 output * % world % BIOMED 56 0.8 *indicates the number of research papers published in the disease area RESPI research was divided into the six main disease areas, which are listed in Table lxiv with the numbers of papers in each, and the percentages of the total that these represented . Table lxiv: CRDs categories against Scientific Papers (2002 -13). Subject Code Papers Percent Allergic rhinitis ALR 869 4.8 Asthma AST 7534 41.3 Bronchiectasis BRO 197 1.1 Chronic 24.4 Cystic fibrosis CYF 3137 17.2 Emphysema EMP 446 2.5 Total 18222 As the figure above indicates, t he disease areas are very unequal, with asthma representing over 40% of the total, and bronchiectasis barely 1%. The research was very clinical, and no disease area had papers with RL > 2.0. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 87 The RESPI files also enabled analysis of world and European ou tputs, year by year, for CRD research papers . The following table provides access to the comparative results. Table lxv: EUR31 outputs RESPI papers WoS (2002 -2013 ), integer counts RESPI RESPI/BIOMED% Year World Int EUR31 with the other NCD results, RESPI shows a much greater European presence, averaging 56%, which is much higher than the percentages for the other four (38% for ONCOL, 42% for for MENTH). The internationalism was initially lower than in the other NCDs, but has caught up and even surpassed some of them. But RESPI is a very small subject area, and even in Europe only averages 0.8% of the papers in biomedicine overall. The results for the in dividual European countries are shown in figure below .

Most of the papers wer e at the clinical end of the spectrum, and in most NCDs had become more so over the 12 years of the study. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 90 Figure vii: Plot of RESPI paper output (2002 -13)* against GDP for 18 European countries** *For countries with fractional counts above 100 papers. ** Note: BG, CY, CZ, EE, HR, IS, LT, LU, LV, MT, RO, SI and SK omitted. Dashed lines show values x 2 or x 0.5 relative to power trend -line. The research level of the RESPI papers tended to increase slig htly (i.e., become more basic) over time, and the papers were noticeably more clinical than the average for the journals in which they were published. This rose from 1.72 to 1.82; not a big rise but in the other NCD areas the journals tended to become mor e clinical with time. Data were also obtained on the burden of disease in each of the 31 European countries and in the group as a whole. These data have been taken from the WHO Global Burden of Disease study for 2010. Comparing results against the 2010 WHO data on the burden of disease, bibliometrics analysis has the potential to identify where resources are being usefully invested, and where savings might be made by deploying resources elsewhere. Conversely, where fewer papers are published in high burden areas, it also holds the potential to identify evidence of a research gap. Bibliometrics can also identify potentialities for international collaboration: countries with smaller scientific output Critical Appraisal CRDs 91 usually have a greater need to seek partners abroad. Here , bibliometrics can identify MS that collaborate less with other MSs in a given subject area than would be expected, which can be interpreted to suggest the need for the deployment of additional means to encourage such partnerships. Using this approach, bi bliometrics provides an indication of the potential shortfalls, excesses and potential for synergies in terms of NCD research funding.

At its simplest, the acknowledgement of a funding source on a paper indicates that an agency, usually an external one, has reviewed the research project and judged that it is worthy of support. Multiple funding sour ces would indicate that the project has found favour in several places. In the past, the recording of the funding sources on a paper was a labour -intensive task as each paper needed to be inspected individually, usually in a big library. It was, however, worthwhile if the work could serve to provide many different funding bodies with a tally of papers that they had supported. This was the principle behind the creation of the Wellcome Trust's Research Outputs Database (Jeschin et al, 1995; Dawson et al., 1 998; Webster, 2005). This covered all UK biomedical papers over the 14 years, 1988 -2001, and was based on the papers in the Science Citation Index on CD-ROM, which was purchased from the Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia (now Thomson Re uters) and operated under license from them. The data were made available to members of the \"ROD club\", who paid a graduated annual fee and in return received a list of their papers, together with access to consultancy advice. Since the introduction of th e Science Citation Index , the facilities available for searching and for retrieving data have been steadily enhanced. During 2008, Thomson Reuters started to provide details of funding for individual papers - quite likely stimulated by the earlier existe nce of the ROD! There are two individually searchable fields, FO = funding organization and FT = funding text. The FO field lists the names of the acknowledged funders and FT gives the full text of the acknowledgement, including recognition of individual s who have helped with the research. For some funding bodies, the FO field also lists the grant numbers, although they are often absent and have not been considered in this analysis. Authors of papers record their funding acknowledgements in a wide variety of ways . Many papers had multiple funding acknowledgements3. In order to determine the funding sources for RESPI and the four other disease areas, it was therefore decided to use a coding system, with four parts: a trigraph (three character) code designating the individual funding body; a single letter code showing the form of support (no longer used); a digraph (two character) code designating the sector and sub -sector of the funder; and another digraph showing the country of the funder based o n the ISO codes. 3 There are also acknowledgements to individuals who have provided help or advice. These are not considered further in this report. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 93 The trigraphs were designed to be easily memorable, e.g., MRC = UK Medical Research Council; BHF = British Heart Foundation, although it turned out that there were so many different funders of UK research papers that many had to be given o dd combinations of letters4. It also became apparent that some papers did not carry an acknowledgement because they had been supported internally - in a government lab (such as one supported by a research council or Government department), by a collecting charity, or by a commercial company. So the decision was made to include these \"implicit\" acknowledgements along with the \"explicit\" ones in the acknowledgement paragraph to form a composite acknowledgement5. In principle , the research described in all pu blished papers has to be paid for in some way . In practice, however, there are many papers (especially ones describing clinical work) that do not contain any formal acknowledgement. In any case, m ost of their authors would be academics or medical person nel working in a hospital or clinic, supported by general university funds or by salary support from the health service. But such support would not be peer -reviewed, and so such papers would perhaps be of a lower standard. For these reasons , it did not s eem appropriate to record this nominal support, and the ROD was set up to record such papers as \"unfunded\", and the hospital or university or research institute address was not given a code. However, if a specific acknowledgement appeared to a university or department, or to a hospital, then it was presumed that some system of grants was in place and the contribution of the employing organisation WAS recorded with a code. This gave rise to three sub -sectors of the private -non-profit sector, namely HT = ho spital trustees, MI = academic6 and NP = other non -profit. The other two were CH = collecting charity and FO = endowed foundation. The methodology used to extract funding information for papers whose details were downloaded from the Web of Science (WoS) w as the same across the five disease areas. The basic principle used was to assign a three -part code to each funding body, with a three -letter code to identify it uniquely, a two -character code to identify the sector and sub -sector, and another two -charact er code to identify the ISO designation. Codes were assigned to each funding body listed in the FO = funding organization section of the WoS, subject to redaction if they were mentioned in a conflict of interest statement only as having paid for unrelated work. Codes were also assigned where there was an acknowledgement implicit from one (or more) of the addresses - a government department or agency, the laboratory of a collecting charity, or of an industrial company. Once codes were assigned to each fund ing body, they were collected and written to two thesauruses for future use. The spreadsheet of papers was then completed with the explicit and implicit codes by means of a special macro, which also combined the codes into a single column. Another macro determined the division of funders by main sector for each European country (own government including local and regional authorities; own private -non-profit (PNP), industry, international, and other). These were doubly fractionated: to allow for the fract ional presence of the target country on each paper, and to allow for the total number of funders on a paper. The commercial sector was divided up into five sub -sectors, with companies divided into three: pharmaceutical, biotech and industrial. The first a nd third of these were further divided into independent and subsidiary. The purpose was to distinguish between the research activities of UK subsidiaries of large multi -national companies which might be relatively independent of the parent, 4 Initially, every UK research funder was given an individual trigraph in order to cater for the possibility that it would become a ROD member, although membership seldom rose above 30. 5 Several of the ROD members maintained their own labs and als o gave external research grants and this system allowed them to compare their respective outputs. 6 This term was used because many universities and colleges are both endowed with capital and are still collecting money ( e.g., from their alumni). LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 94 e.g., the Merc k Neuroscience Park in Harlow, which did its own research and also gave funding to universities. However there were many takeovers of small biotech (and not so small pharma) companies and it seemed appropriate to regard the takeover as a way in which the new parent company would thereby gain the intellectual property of the new acquisition. This meant that many of the commercial codes became out -of-date. This had two consequences for the analysis of funding sources. First, the country of a company was e ffectively undefined, and second, the sub -sector could change when a biotech company had brought a new drug to market and had so become a pharma company. The public sector was divided into three sub -sectors: government department (controlled by ministers), government agency (nominally independent of ministerial directives) and local authorities (including regions, counties and cities). They were given sectoral codes: GD, GA and LA, respectively. Although the latter form of support hardly exists in the UK, it is becoming increasingly common in several continental European countries (L\u00e4nder in Germany, r\u00e9gions in France, provinces in Spain) and also in North America (provinces in Canada and states in the USA) and in Australia (states and territories). Most of these regions have been given their own trigraphs, although some smaller regions have generic codes, see below. Because of international collaboration on biomedical research papers, many of the UK papers covered in the ROD also had foreign partners and acknowledgements to foreign funding sources. The thesaurus soon began to run out of trigraph codes, and we started to use \"generic\" codes for the smaller organisations (in terms of their biomedical research spend). These consisted of a single letter (X, Y or Z) followed by one digit (to designate the country) and another to designate the sector and sub -sector. Individual countries that supported a lot of biomedical research were given their own digraph (e.g, X1 = USA); others were given one that showed t heir continent. There is, of course, some redundancy as the country and sector/sub -sector are also given by the second and third digraphs, but these are needed for the main analyses. For example, X1B -BT-US indicates a US biotechnology company in two ways . Generic codes for the UK were not used initially, but have been introduced to cater for the large number of new British funding bodies, and codes UK1, UK2 etc. are employed.

These trigraphs, and the associated sectoral and country codes, were assembled into a large thesaurus of funding bodies. The thesaurus is structured so that the different names and formats given to a funding body (and in some cases its dependent agencies, bodies or companies) are all listed to facilitat e the allocation of codes. At the time of writing, there were 17,485 entries and 10,045 (out of a possible 17,576) individual letter trigraphs. This suggests that there is still plenty of opportunity for new codes, but it is often difficult to find appro priate letter combinations for new organisations with many funded papers. These are appearing in continental European countries as work on the project develops, because the thesaurus was originally developed mainly for UK funding bodies. 4.4 RESPI: Funding Sources RESPI is the smallest of the five NCDs in terms of numbers of papers, with diabetes (DIABE), the second smallest. CRDs was the first of the five to be analysed in accordance with the methodology described above. The file consisted of 18,8 22 papers, of which 9269 were published during the last five years, 2009 -13. Of these, 775 or 8.4% had a conflict of interest statement, and needed to be examined individually in order to check the funding bodies listed in the FU column of the spreadsheet , and redact them if necessary. Some papers originally crediting funding bodies were found not to be funded explicitly, and others had the number sharply reduced; a very few should have had additional funders credited. After the redaction, 5451 papers ha d one or more funders (59%) and the remaining 41% had none. This redaction process was very labour -intensive, and involved the removal of approximately half the commercial funding credits listed in the WoS FO field. Figure viii shows the percentages of papers with given numbers of funders or more. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 96 Figure viii: Cumulative percentage of RESPI papers with different numbers of funders (2009 -13) The average number of acknowledged funders per paper varied from over four for papers from Luxembourg, Estonia and Iceland to less than 0.5 for papers from Croatia and Slovenia. Among the countries with a fractional count of papers of at least 100 (numberi ng 15 out of 31), those from Finland and Sweden attracted most funders, and fewer than one in five had no acknowledgements. These papers also had the most support from private -non-profit sources: 48% for Finland and 39% for Sweden. In 10 of the 15 countr ies, private -non-profit (PNP) sources out - numbered those using public moneys. Industry provided about 13% of funders on average, and international sources, 3.5% - notably the European Commission. Funding also varied with the subject matter and type of the research, with asthma and COPD receiving the most funding attention and bronchiectasis the least. Clinical papers were less likely to be funded than basic ones. Papers with more authors tended to have more funding bodies, and that (for the 2009 papers f or which five -year citation counts were available) the number of citations was positively correlated with the number of funders. For example, \"unfunded\" papers received only 11 cites on average, papers with 3 to 5 funders averaged 25 cites and papers with 11 or more funders averaged 38 cites. By way of comparison, DIABE funding gave rather similar results, with data for each of 14 subject areas. However, the diabetes papers attracted more funding than the respiratory disease ones, and only 31% had no spec ific funding (cf. 41%). The average paper had 2.5 funders compared with only 1.8 for the RESPI ones. We noticed that the later papers (2012 -13) acknowledged more funders than the earlier ones (2009 -10): in DIABE the mean rose from 2.1 to 2 .8, and in RES PI from 1.5 to 2.1. The literature clearly shows that more funders are positively correlated with publication in higher impact journals, and with receipt of more citations in a given time window, even when other possible confounding factors are taken into account by means of multiple regression analysis (Roe et al., 2010). We have found that an important confounding factor is the research level of the paper (clinical or basic), see Lewison and Paraje (2004). Basic papers tend to receive more funding and receive more citations than clinical ones. This may put clinicians at a disadvantage when they apply for research grants. 020406080100 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of funders, FCumulative % of RESPI papersLSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 97 Another important factor in the European context is that researchers in some countries may have many more potential sources of support than others. In particular, the pharma industry is more prominent in Western Europe, and there are also many more charities and endowed foundations. In addition, there may be more governmental and regional sources, as we have observed in Belgium, France , Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The countries of Eastern Europe have been freed from the centralised system of government support for research for nearly 25 years, but we have not so far observed significant numbers of private -non-profit organisations that sponsor biomedical research in these countries. The first analysis was in terms of the mean number of funders per country, and there was a big variation, with the Scandinavian countries having the most and (of the major countries) Poland and Greece the least. The number of funders has been calculated on a fractional count basis. The analysis by main sector, using fractional counts of sectors for each paper and fractional country counts, is shown in Figure ix.

The RESPI database was divided up by five disease areas: asthma (AST), bronchiectasis (BRO), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis (CYF) and emphysema (EMP). Figure xi shows the numbers of funders and the mean research level of the papers in each area. Cystic fibrosis is the most basic, followed by emphysema, but asthma, followed by COPD, receives the most funding (in terms of numbers of xi: Mean number of funders per paper (F) and mean research level (RL)* *a scale from 1 = clinical to 4 = basic research for all RESPI papers 2009 -13.

It is not surprising that the average number of funders per paper rises with the number of authors, A, as the additional authors may be expected to be able to tap extra funding sources, and papers with many authors are likely to be international and attract funding from different c ountries, but nevertheless the correlation is striking . 11.522.5 AST COP All papers CYF EMP Critical Appraisal CRDs 100 Figure xii: Mean number of funding bodies per paper for RESPI papers (2009 -13.) 4.5 Citations of Research Papers Bibliometric analysis uses citation scores to measure of the impact of research papers. For most NCDs, European research was better cited than the world average, although there was much variation between countries. Interestingly, there was generally poor correlation between the burden from particular diseases and the amount of research. In this case, there may be grounds for re-balancing some national research portfolios. There was again a big difference between the disease areas in terms of their propensity to attract citations, with a two -to-one variation be tween chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, see Figure viii. This was in part because of the size of the researcher cohort ( i.e., the number of papers), for which the correlation with ACI was r2 = 0.49.

Consistent with the analysis presented above , we found that, for 2009 papers, the numbers of funding bodies correlated positively with the mean citation score, see Figure xvii. The increase in actual citation impact (ACI) for papers with many funding ackno wledgements is very clear, and the relationship will be expected to hold even when account is taken of factors such as the papers tending to be basic and having more authors (Lewison & Dawson, 1998; Roe et al. , 2010).

Among the countries with a fractional count of papers of at least 100 (numbering 15 out of 31), those from Finland and Sweden attracted most funders, and fewer than one in five had no acknowledgements. These papers also had the most support from private -non-profit sources: 48% for Finland and 39% for Sweden. In 10 of the 15 countries, private -non-profit (PNP) sources out - numbered those using public moneys. Industry provided about 13% of funders on average, and internationa l sources, 3.5% - notably the European Commission. Funding also varied with the subject matter and type of the research, with asthma and COPD receiving the most funding attention and bronchiectasis the least. Clinical papers were less likely to be funded than basic ones. We observed that papers with more authors tended to have more funding bodies, and that (for the 2009 papers for which five -year citation counts were available) the number of citations was positively correlated with the number of funders. For example, \"unfunded\" papers received only 11 cites on average, papers with 3 to 5 funders averaged 25 cites and papers with 11 or more funders averaged 38 cites. 4.6 Clinical Guidelines This measure of impact has been used previously both to evaluate the research being cited, and to describe the evidence base for recommendations regarding clinical practice. However, the mere presence of such guidelines is no guarantee that they will be e ffective at improving healthcare (Schrader et al., 2006). The first study, on a small scale, examined the cited papers on a sample of 15 UK clinical guidelines (Grant et al., 2000). It found that they were very clinical and that UK research was over -cited by 2.5 times. A subsequent study of 43 cancer clinical guidelines in the UK (Lewison et al., 2008) reached similar conclusions, and showed that they could also be used as a means to evaluate research in other countries, for example six Swedish universit ies. This work was subsequently updated (Pallari and Lewison, 2014) and showed that surgery featured strongly among the cited references (over 25% of the total). It also showed a big variation in whether a country's papers were over - or under -cited relat ive to its presence in cancer research. Thus UK research was over -cited by almost four, Danish, Dutch and Swedish research by more than two, but that from the \"accession\" Member States (Poland, Czech Republic and Romania) by half or less. We investigated the clinical guidelines currently available in the different European Member States in order to extend the work to other countries. Although many countries had a set of national guidelines, some had regional ones as well, and there were yet others publish ed by European societies of professionals in various branches of medicine. We even learned that in Sweden, each of the 21 counties had their own clinical guidelines. Clearly, it would have been impossible for us to collect the references on all of these, and so we decided to limit the study to national guidelines. In the earlier studies on UK guidelines, the identification of the references with papers processed for the Web of Science involved much labour as each one had to be sought individually. It wou ld not have been practical in the scope of this project to continue in this way for guidelines for the other NCDs and for all the other European countries, but we were able to semi -automate the process by means of a visual basic macro, written by Dr Philip Roe of Evaluametrics Ltd. This worked as follows : first, the references section of a guideline in PDF format were copied and pasted to an Excel spreadsheet ; second, these were slightly tidied by removal of page numbers, document running heads, etc ; and thirdly, t he macro was then operated, and it generated sets of search statements, eight at a time, ready for copying and pasting into the search panel of the WoS. An example is given below: ((AU=(Anderson AND Pottier AND Strachan) AND TI=concurrent AND SO =(T*) AND PY=1992) OR (AU=(Heaney AND Conway AND Kelly AND Johnston AND English AND Stevenson) AND TI=Predictors LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 104 AND SO=(T*) AND PY=2003) OR (AU=(Martin AND McLennan AND Landau AND Phelan) AND TI=childhood AND SO=(B*) AND PY=1980) OR AND AND OR AND TI=Interpretative AND SO=(E*) AND PY=2005) OR (AU=(Dundas AND Chan AND Bridge AND McKenzie) AND TI=bronchodilator AND SO=(T*) AND PY=2005) ) The limit of eight individual papers was set so as to keep wi thin the limits for the number of terms allowed by the WoS. Author names (AU) up to six in number were given without initials as sometimes they were given incorrectly by the guideline although if there was only one author the first initial was given. [In the WoS, Jones or Jones,A will find papers by Jones, AT but Jones,PR will NOT find papers by Jones, PRT.] The title word (TI) was selected to be the longest in the paper title. The journal name (source, SO) was given by just its initial letter as the gu idelines usually gave an abbreviated name and this would have needed to be substituted by its full name, which would have had to be researched and entered into the macro. Finally, the publication year (PY) was given for completeness. This process worked w ell, and even though the search statements needed to be inspected individually (to remove author names with non -Roman characters which are not recognized by the WoS and to delete any punctuation marks attached to title words), it was possible to identify a nd download over 860 references from one guideline in about 3 1/2 hours. The macro also listed references that did not satisfy its specific requirements so that any errors could be corrected manually and the macro then run again. 4.7 Clinical G uidelines : CRDS This guideline was the Scottish Inter -collegiate Guidelines Network guideline on the management of asthma (no. 141). This was one of only three UK guidelines on respiratory diseases, the other two being from the National Institute for health and Car e Excellence (NICE) - number 101 on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and number 163 on idiopathic pulmonary disease. The three clinical guidelines cited a total of 1179 papers in the WoS, and their cumulative distribution with age is shown in Figure xviii. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 105 Figure xviii: Cumulative time distribution of references on three UK clinical guidelines for CRDs Table lxxiii shows the distribution by country, on the basis of integer counts, for the cited references plotted against the percentage presence of each country in respiratory disease research in the 18 years, 1997 -2014, which account for three quarters of the cited papers. [See Table 9, below, for their ISO codes.] The UK, together with New Zealand and the five Nordic countries, are over -cited by a factor of two (the spot for Iceland is not show n, but the citation ratio is 2.4). On the other hand, Japan, China and Brazil are all under -cited by a factor of two or more, and South Korea and Taiwan by more than that. Within the UK, Scotland shows to advantage, particularly on the SIGN references where it is over -cited by 2.4 times, but only x 2 on the NICE guideline references. The cited papers are very clinical, as expected, with a research level (RL) based on their individual titles of 1.05 on a scale running from clinical observation = 1.0 to ba sic research = 4.0.

Some of these are based on individual cases, in which it is reported that named patients do not have access to particular means of therapy (expensive drugs, for exam ple). Ministers react by making special provision for them, but this can distort the overall health -care system as with the Cancer Drugs Fund in the UK (Thornton, 2011; Knapton, 2014). Senior officials can use the stories to bring news of research to the ir ministers; most will not have the time to read the literature extensively and need help to learn about interesting developments. The same is true for health -care administrators in hospitals and clinics, who may learn about new methods of health -care de livery that offer potential cost savings. Medical personnel will also benefit, though the media can also provide misinformation that can cause doctors to misdiagnose (Schmidt et al. , 2014). They can also influence researchers, and there is evidence that media coverage increases modestly the numbers of citations (Phillips et al., 1991; Lewison et al ., 2008). The print media may even be a source in their own right (Hicks & Wang, 2013). The biggest influence may be on ordinary people, and could assist the public to NL AU IT ESDESE DK BENZ FINO refs, INT CTLSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 107 healthier life styles (Nishtar al (Olufowote, 2011; Robbins, Pang & Leask, 2012), although sensational press coverage of supposed links between MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination and autism has had a negative effect (Holton et al ., 2012). They may also add to the political pressure for public investment in medical research, particularly if own -country papers are well -cited. In som e countries, commentators on the significance of the research often come from medical research charities, which thereby gain exposure (Lewison et al., 2012). Print newspapers are in decline in many countries, but many have a strong web presence and are st ill important despite the growing influence of social websites such as Twitter and Facebook. This part of the project was intended to show the effects of European NCD research on six groups of people: politicians and other decision -makers; senior officials and advisers; health -care administrators; medical personnel (doctors, other professionals); researchers; the general public. It embarked on an ambitious programme of study on the coverage of research in the five NCDs during the 12 -year period, 2002 -13, in a large number of European newspapers. Some of these have their own searchable websites; others can be searched through full -text databases such as Factiva \u00a9Dow Jones, to which KCL subscribes. The results of this element of the project span the five NC D disease areas. For this reason, they will be reported in the Bibliometrics Work Package of Mapping NCDS. 4.9 Discussion and Conclusion Measuring the impact research investments is a complex task because pathway from the conduct and publication of research to better health is usually indirect . Indeed, h ealth improvements stem from a wide variety of interrelated research discoveries, made at different times and in different places. Other factors such as environmental pollution, individual health be haviors, wealth, education and public health campaigns also have an important bearing on the incidence of illness and further complicate the task of measuring research impact For this reason , research impacts are evident at a variety of nodes along the pa thway , many of which are not specific to individual disease areas. Bibliometrics has the capacity to quantitative measure impact at several of these nodes, including: s cientific research papers , funding sources (decisions on funding) , citations , evidence base of clinical guidelines; and newspapers stories regarding research papers. In terms of the number of published scientific papers , CRD s generated the smallest of the five results for NCD s, with just 18822 papers, of which 188 were in the SSCI only (1.0% ). However, b y comparison with the other NCD s, published research for CRDs shows a much greater European presence, averaging 56%, which is much higher than the percentages for the other four NCD areas (38% for ONCOL, 42% f or MENTH). But, even in Europe, CRDs is a very small subject area , averag ing only 0.8% of the papers in biomedicine overall. In terms of individual European countries , the UK published the most research regarding CRDs, more than twice the amount than France, the second leading EU MS, which itself publish es almost twice as much CRD research as expected, and similarly with Sweden and the Netherlands. As expected, UK based research had greater level of impact than research in other European MSs. Indeed, UK research was LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 108 over -cited by 2.5 times. The UK, together with New Zealand and the five Nordic countries, are over - cited by a factor of two (the spot f or Iceland is not shown, but the citation ratio is 2.4). On the other hand, Japan, China and Brazil are all under -cited by a factor of two or more, and South Korea and Taiwan by more than that. Within the area of CRDs, the individual disease conditions , such as asthma and COPD, are uequally represented , with asthma accounting for over 40% of the total number of published papers , and bronchiectasis barely 1%. In the UK and France, and also across the EU, most scientific papers are published in relation to asthma rather than COPD and other CRDs. In terms of funding, a sthma, followed by COPD, receives the most funding (in terms of numbers of funders per paper). There was a large difference between the disease areas in terms of their propensity to attract citations, with a two-to-one variation between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema. Funding also varied with the subject matter and type of the research, with asthma and COPD receiving the most funding attention and bronchiectasis the least. Clinical papers were less likely to be funded than basic ones. We observed that papers with more authors tended to have more funding bodies As for most NCDs, European research was better cited than the world average, although there was much va riation between countries. Interestingly, there was generally poor correlation between the burden from particular CRDs and the amount of research published . Based on the levels of disease burden reported in the GBD study, the UK and France demonstrated a medium level of commitment to CRDs. Across the EU in general, MSs demonstrated a medium to high level of commitment to research for asthma and COPD. In this regard , there may be grounds for re -balancing some national research portfolios. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 109 5 Conclusion According to the Global Burden of Disease study, CRDs are the fifth leading cause of lost DALYs across Europe in terms of NCDs (5%). Breaking down the category into its major diseases, COPD is the largest cause of lost DALYs (30.2%) by compari son with asthma (1.21%). In the past few years, research investment in CRDs has grown. In terms of project aims, most CRD research has focused on the development of new drugs and therapies. In respiratory medicine, drugs are becoming increasingly import ant. The use of antibodies and antagonists to block and change disease mechanisms, oncogenes and metabolic pathways is relevant to key disease types like Asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. The European pharmaceutical sector has five companies in among the world's top ten pharmaceutical firms. The research pipeline for the top 10 European pharmaceutical companies suggests that firms seem to specialize in certain NCD categories. For example, pipeline data shows that SANOFI -AVENT IS, preferring to focus on other areas, does not have any CRD relevant molecules under development; other firms like GSK, however, are developing several. Overall, the European pharmaceutical sector has increased its commitment to R&D over the past four y ears. GSK is the only top 10 company to record a shrinking commitment to research investment. Some companies, like AstraZeneca, have recorded a massive increase in R&D spending. But most companies have recorded progressive of steady increases. By contr ast, US levels of investment in R&D have been more mixed. Interviews with stakeholders revealed several major themes with regard to the future of research in the area of CRDs. There was a recognition of the growing importance of stratified medicine, wh ich several informants considered to be the future of research across the wider spectrum of NCDs. There was a need to find new ways of working with private sector. And there was a need to accommodate new research requirements within a wider strategic app roach to the funding of NCD research which considered the needs of researchers for autonomy and the requirements of funders to demonstrate the effectiveness of their investments. In terms of the effectiveness of research investment, CRD funding demonstrat es a significant European presence. And average 56% of paper published for CRDs are of European origin, which is much higher than the percentages for the other four (38% for ONCOL, 42% for for MENTH). The internationalism was initially lower than in the other NCDs, but has caught up and even surpassed some of them. The UK has the highest output in terms of CRD papers, more than twice as high as the second country, France. The UK is publishing almost twice as much as expect ed, as are Sweden and the Netherlands. On the other hand, Austria is publishing very little, and Germany, Norway and Switzerland are doing barely half of what might be expected considering their levels of GDP. Papers from Finland and Sweden attracted mos t funders, and fewer than one in five papers for CRD had no acknowledgements. These papers also had the most support from private -non-profit sources: 48% for Finland and 39% for Sweden. In 10 of the 15 countries, private -non-profit (PNP) sources out - numb ered those using public moneys. Industry provided about 13% of funders on average, and international sources, 3.5% - notably the European Commission. Levels of funding also varied with the subject matter and type of the research, with asthma and COPD rec eiving the most funding attention and bronchiectasis the least. Clinical papers were less likely to be funded than basic ones. Papers with more authors tended to have more funding bodies, and that (for the 2009 papers for which five -year citation counts were available) the number of citations was positively correlated with the number of funders.

Medtronic Inc Covidien plc Siemens AG Baxter International Inc Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGAA Koninklijke Philips NV Cardinal Health Inc. Novartis AG (Alcon) Stryker Corp. Becton, Dickinson and Co. Boston Scientific Corp. Essilor International SA Allergan Inc. (Actavis) St. Jude Medical Inc. Then, we performed a second search using as filter only the decision date (from 01/01/2011 to June 2015). We included o nly MDs for non -communicable diseases and MDs which have not received 510(k) clearance yet. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 121 Appendix 6 Search strategy for EuroScan medical devices The search was performed according to indication in the five NCD areas (cancer, respiratory disease, card iovascular disease, diabetes, mental health) and not according to top MD companies. Search strategy: 1. Technology -type: device 2. Specialty: ONCOL: metabolic RESPI: Respiratory disease & thoracic surgery MENTH: Mental health, addiction & learning difficulties Only MDs approved between 2011 and 2015 have been considered. LSE: Critical Appraisal CRDs 122 Appendix 7 Search strategy for top MD companies research outputs The search was performed on Web of Science database. As ONCOL, MENTH and CARDI have yet to be coded, specific search terms were used to filter the RFOs. It must be noted that the aliases/ spelling errors in naming the RFOs by WoS means that not all them may have been cap tured or that other organizations may have accidentally also been captured due to the simplistic terms used. In cases where a company had only generic codes, the name was searched instead of the code. In RESPI and DIABE the funding data that were searched also include papers where the company was listed among the addresses; for the three other NCDs only the funding data were searched. It has to be noted that some of the companies also make pharmaceutical drugs and the counts of papers may include them.
