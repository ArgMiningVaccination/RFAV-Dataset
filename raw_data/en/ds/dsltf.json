Because of this, it is important to consider recommendations to decrease stress for you and your classroom. Introducing evidence-based mindfulness practice(s) into your classroom can have positive effects on both you and your students. The Oxford dictionary defines mindfulness as \"a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique.\" Mindfulness Benefits for Students Mindfulness Benefits for Teachers 10 Ways to Incorporate Mindfulness in the Classroom Mindfulness is not a new concept; but modern-day research suggests this 'enhanced self-awareness' diminishes stress and anxiety and, in turn, reduces the risk of developing cancer, disease, and psychopathology. It is useful to practice mindfulness as a tool for general physical and mental health.

Tools for Building Classroom Mindfulness Original sources: As educators, it may feel like you are in a constant stressed state. Consider these resources to help combat stress and anxiety for you and your students. Original Sources Teaching is a profession with a high amount of daily stress. This high amount of stress can lead to both physical and mental health problems and that can eventually lead to burnout. With almost half of teachers leaving the profession within five years of employment, it's important to learn how to recognize what burnout is and consider how your school can make small changes to help prevent teachers from burning out. What is Teacher Burnout? Burnout can be defined as \"a state of emotional, mental and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest or motivation that led you to take on a certain role in the first place.\" The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) is a 30 item self-report measure of the positive and negative effects of working with people who have experienced extremely stressful events. The ProQol contains three subscales measuring Compassion Fatigue, Burnout and Compassion Satisfaction.

How to Avoid Burnout Strategies to Help Reduce Burnout Original sources: To be able to care for others, you must first take care of yourself. It's like the advice we're given on airplanes: put on your own oxygen mask before trying to help someone else. Taking care of yourself is a valid goal on its own, and it helps you support the people in your life. Teachers and caregivers who pay attention to their own physical and emotional health are better able to handle the challenges of supporting someone with mental illness. They adapt to changes, build strong relationships and recover from setbacks. The ups and downs in your family member's illness can have a huge impact on you. Improving your relationship with yourself by maintaining your physical and mental health makes you more resilient, helping you weather hard times and enjoy good ones. Here are some suggestions for personalizing your self-care strategy. Understand How Stress Affects You Stress affects your entire body, physically and mentally. Some common physical signs of stress include: Begin by identifying how stress feels to you. Then identify what events or situations cause you to feel that way. (i.e. feeling stressed by grocery shopping with your spouse when they're symptomatic). Once you know which situations cause you stress, you'll be prepared to avoid it and to cope with it when it happens. Protect Your Physical Health Improving your physical wellbeing is one of the most comprehensive ways you can support your mental health. You'll have an easier time maintaining good mental habits when your body is a strong, resilient foundation. Recharge Yourself When you're a teacher it can be incredibly hard to find time for yourself, and even when you do, you may feel distracted by thoughts of what you \"should\" be doing instead. Learning to make time for yourself without feeling you're neglecting others is critical. Any amount of time you take for yourself is important. Being out of \"teacher mode\" for as little as five minutes in the middle of a day can be a meaningful reminder of who you are in a larger sense. It can help keep you from becoming consumed by your responsibilities. Start small; think about activities you enjoyed before becoming a teacher and try to work them back into your life. If you once enjoyed days out with friends, try to schedule a standing monthly lunch with them. Once scheduled, it becomes part of your routine and no one has to work extra to make it happen each month. The point is not what you do or how often you do it, but that you do take the time to care for yourself. It's impossible to take good care of anyone else if you're not taking care of yourself first. Practice Good Mental Habits You may feel you don't have the time to stay in touch with friends or start new friendships. Focus on the long-term. If you can meet up with a friend once a month, or go to a community event at your local library once every two months, it still helps keep you connected. It also gives you the chance to connect with people on multiple levels. Being a teacher is an important part of your life, but it's not the whole story.
