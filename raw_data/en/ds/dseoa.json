Unfortunately, the tidal wave of ecstasy carried totally different connotations for the Senators. In the fall of 2000, Congress had passed a bill asking the U.S. Sentencing Commission to recommend an increase in the penalties forMDMA. Two days before the Senate hearing, several MDMA researchers, drug policy activists and I had fruitlesslytestified before the Sentencing Commission about MDMA's risks and benefits, opposing the increase in penalties onscientific grounds (http://www.maps.org/news). The day before the Senate hearing, the Commission announced itsdecision. Dose for dose, Ecstasy would now be more heavily punished than heroin! In testimony presented to theSenators, ecstasy was linked with poison, abuse, death, brain damage, addiction, violence, damage to dopamineand serotonin brain cells, rotting flesh falling off the side of a user's face, holes in the brain, a high school cheerleaderunable to make it to practice since she was in thrall to ecstasy and would \"lie, cheat and steal\" to buy more, and ageneration of young people who thought MDMA was harmless even as it insidiously robbed them of their mentalabilities and moral sensibilities. How can MAPS move forward with MDMA psychotherapy research in this overheated environment? It's clear to anyone paying attention that MDMA isn't harmless. MDMA has its share of risks, even fatal ones, especially whenit is taken in non-medical contexts. Yet the Senators saw only the risks, and portrayed the extreme cases as if they werethe average experience. They also denied the existence of any benefits, even when users claimed to have benefited. On the federal level, the FDA is a rare and rational agency that still prioritizes science over drug war politics. The FDA is more responsive to the needs of seriously ill patients than to the misguided crusade for a drug-free America.As the tidal wave of ecstasy gathers momentum, MAPS is seeking a safe harbor at the FDA for a pilot study of MDMAin the treatment of patients with chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The MAPS-supported protocol soonto be submitted to the FDA represents the culmination of almost two years of work conducted by a team ofresearchers. MAPS funded the creation of a complete digitized bibliography of the entire peer-reviewed scientificliterature on MDMA, and also funded the writing of a comprehensive review of all the published data, as well as thelatest unpublished data from on-going government-approved clinical trials. Finally, MAPS helped bring together anoutstanding team of researchers to design the protocol, and gathered a group of experts to critique and improve theproposed protocol design. Call me brain-damaged, but I believe that the protocol will, in some form, be approved this summer. FDA approval will be a watershed event in our 16-year effort to initiate MDMA psychotherapy research, starting whenMDMA was first criminalized in 1985. FDA approval will mark the beginning of MAPS' $5 million, 5-year plan todevelop MDMA into a prescription medicine (www.maps.org/research/mdmaplan.html). If MAPS' staff and membership continue to work together patiently and persistently, we should be able to show the Senators that MDMA, as well as other psychedelics and marijuana, can be successfully and beneficially integratedinto our shared culture. Let's continue to work together to ride the tidal wave safely to shore!

Last December,in a departure from tradition, MAPS published a special issue of the Bulletinwith the theme of Psychedelics and Creativity. We wanted to keep thespecial issue focused on that topic and decided to publish the annualfinancial report for FY 99-00 in the first issue of this year. The increasingly heavy workload that MAPS' staff has undertaken has affected the timeliness of this issue of the Bulletin, and therefore of thisannual financial report. MAPS' staff time has been devoted both to agrowing number of substantive projects, and to an increasing amount oftime spent communicating with members, the public, the media andgovernmental authorities. Subsequent issues of the Bulletin should resumebeing produced on our regular quarterly schedule. Staff Time Spent on Media Relations During the last year, there has been a sustained and substantial growth in the non-medical use ofMDMA (Ecstasy), especially among young people. The resultant government crack-down (MAPSsubmitted testimony on 3/19/01 to the U.S. Sentencing Commission regarding the increase in penaltiesfor the non-medical use of MDMA, http://maps.org/news/) has caused related media interest in MDMAto rise to a rather intense level. Since MAPS is the only organization in the United States actively workingto conduct FDA-approved research into the therapeutic uses of MDMA, most journalists contact MAPSat some point in their research. Now that I have finally earned those three magic letters after my name,Ph.D., media people more frequently seem to take me seriously. Amusingly, the first person to ever callme \"Doc\" was Geraldo Rivera, on Rivera Live, during an MDMA-related segment of his show. The most high-profile exposure in which I've been called Doctor is in the Rolling Stone article (4/26/01) about MDMA, in which I'm called \"Doctor X\". I wouldn't call myself that, but I can live with it. The MAPSwebsite (http://www.maps.org/media/) offers a chronological listing and electronic version of many ofthe media stories on MDMA and/or MAPS. I feel that its important to allocate substantial time to speak to the media in order to help journalistspresent the public with a more balanced picture of MDMA. Fortunately, Dr. Charles Grob, an MDMAresearcher at Harbor UCLA Medical Center who works closely with MAPS, is also willing to take time totalk with journalists. Public support for the medical uses of MDMA and other psychedelics is importantto try to generate in order to create a supportive regulatory climate for MDMA research. In a relatedcontext, public support for the medical uses of marijuana has resulted in FDA-approved and NIH-funded research that otherwise might not have been approved or funded. Yet no matter how much time Dr. Grob and I and other allied experts talk with reporters, theopportunities we have to discuss MDMA's therapeutic potential and to put forward reasonable riskestimates are only a drop in the bucket compared to the tens of millions of dollars of anti-ecstasy ads andother forms of \"education\" the federal government is funding. Fortunately, the websites that MAPShas helped support, Erowid, DanceSafe, and Alchemind, and also the MAPS website, have attractedtremendous attention and have substantial credibility. Media presentations about MDMA nowfrequently include at least some mention of MDMA's therapeutic potential and often question the direm a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 134 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1pronouncements of some government officials stating that even one dose of MDMA will result in serious and permanentbrain damage. In addition to the time it takes to respond to media, MAPS'wider visibility has resulted in a flood of e-mail. This is,unfortunately, all too common a challenge these days. Asmany people have experienced, it's difficult to keep one'shead above the rising waters of e-mail. Despite the struggles, it's a privilege and a joy to work atMAPS. The following report will explain in detail how MAPSallocated its financial resources in FY 1999-2000. From thisreport, MAPS members can see MAPS' strategy in action aswell as ascertain our priorities. Comments of all types areinvited. MAPS Financial Overview Income and expenditures increased dramatically from FY98-99 to FY 99-00. total expenditures for FY 99-00were $533,482. Educational Overview Most of the growth in income and expenditures was dueto the expansion of MAPS' educational efforts, both directlyand through MAPS' support of the (erowid.org) and Karl Jansen's bookabout ketamine, helped fund Dr. Rick Strassman's efforts towrite a book about DMT research, and supported to varyingdegrees several scientific conferences. MDMA Overview In the area of research, MAPS participated in a historicmilestone. A MAPS-supported study, to be conducted underthe direction of Jose Carlos Bouso, Ph.D. candidate at theUniversity de Autonoma de Madrid, Spain, became theworld's first government-approved, placebo-controlled sci-entific study of the therapeutic use of MDMA. Patientrecruitment has been slow and only one subject has beentreated so far. The dose was 50 milligrams, well below thedesired therapeutic level. Nevertheless, there were somepromising effects and an absence of negative consequences.Major efforts are being made to recruit the additional 28subjects. In FY 99-00, MAPS' most expensive and top priority efforthas been the sponsoring of a mammoth effort to review allthe scientific literature on MDMA published in peer-reviewedjournals, for submission to the FDA and to other regulatoryagencies around the world. Matt Baggott has been leadingthe literature review team, with excellent full-time assistancefrom Ilsa Jerome in Boston and part-time assistance from ReidStuart and Michael Bauer in San Francisco. Associated with the MDMA literature review project hasbeen an MDMA bibliography project, under the direction ofEarth and Fire at Erowid (see page 19 for an update on thisproject.) We are creating an electronic database listing everystudy ever published, with digitized PDF copies to permitregulatory authorities, researchers and students to access thebasic data upon which our risk assessments are based. Finally, MAPS has been coordinating the development of an MDMA-assisted psychotherapy protocol for submission tothe FDA. The study, under the direction of Dr. MichaelMithoefer, Dr. Kathleen Brady, Annie Mithoefer R.N., andMark Wagner, Ph.D., is designed as a preliminary pilot study.The study will gather basic information about the safety andefficacy of the use of two MDMA-assisted psychotherapysessions in patients suffering from chronic Post-TraumaticStress Disorder (PTSD). If approved, and I believe that somevariation of what we submit to the FDA will be approved, thestudy will be the first scientific investigation of the use ofMDMA in a patient population since MDMA was criminalizedin 1985. The study will mark the start of MAPS' $5 million, 5-year pharmaceutical drug development plan to transformMDMA into an FDA-approved prescription medicine. AClinical Plan explaining the assumptions behind this estimatecan be found on the MAPS website at: http://www.maps.org/research/mdmaplan.html. Ketamine Overview MAPS helped Dr. Evgeny Krupitsky lay the groundwork inFY 99-00 for a conceptually exciting study of the use ofketamine-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of heroinaddicts. The study, designed in FY 99-00 and begun in FY 00-01, will test the effects of multiple (3) sessions of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, as compared to one session ofketamine-assisted psychotherapy and two non-drug therapysessions. This study moves us beyond the one dose/miraclecure approach into a more practical and realistic understand-ing of the profound but limited potential of psychedelicpsychotherapy. (see page 13 for an update on this study.) Psilocybin Overview In FY 99-00, MAPS purchased (from a DEA-licensed labo-ratory) the world's most expensive gram of psilocybin! MAPSis seeking to have the psilocybin approved by the FDA for usein a study that is already approved by the FDA. The study willevaluate the use of psilocybin in the treatment of patientswith Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and will takeplace at the University of Arizona, Tucson, under the leader-ship of Dr. Francisco Moreno and Dr. Pedro Delgado. Oncethe psilocybin is determined to meet FDA standards, likely tooccur soon, the first FDA-approved study of the therapeuticuse of psilocybin in a patient population in over twenty-fiveyears will begin. (see page 15 for an update on this study.) Medical Marijuana Overview Regarding medical marijuana, MAPS started working in FY99-00 to obtain permission from state (Massachusetts De-partment of Public Health) and federal (DEA) regulators toestablish a small medical marijuana production facility. Thepurpose of the facility is to produce high-potency marijuanafor use exclusively in FDA-approved protocols. MAPS receiveda grant of $20,000 from Peter Lewis for this effort. Prelimi-nary research and team-building took place in FT 99-00. Theproject is now steadily gathering momentum, though noformal application has yet been submitted. MAPS, in association with CANORML, planned in FY 99-005 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1and initiated in FY 00-01 a study of the constituents of marijuana \"smoke\", or more accurately marijuana \"vapor.\"The basic concept is that vaporizers heat the marijuana plantbut don't burn it, in a sense boiling out the cannabinoids andother materials. Due to the lack of combustion, the vaporizermay be a \"safer\" delivery system. (see page 20 for an updateon this study.) Staff Overview MAPS also experienced a major staff change in FY 99-00,in that Sylvia Thyssen moved to San Francisco to work forDanceSafe. Sylvia had been with MAPS since 1993, andadjusting to her departure was not easy. This year, CarlaHigdon is departing. (see page 49 for her letter.) The new team in Sarasota is composed of two full-timestaff members, Maggie Hall and Nicole Tavernier. They workout of Arcturus, the home I designed and built at age 21, inthe hopes that construction would help me get groundedafter a series of difficult psychedelic experiences. Also inSarasota is Mercedes Paulino, who works part-time out of herhome, running the MAPS website and other information-related tasks. I'm still located in Boston. Detailed Income Report The primary reason for the dramatic rise in MAPS' incomein FY 99-00 is that MAPS served as a fiscal sponsor for threeother non-profit groups working on psychedelic-related and expenditures in FY 99-00($155,285) were restricted donations for the educationalactivities of these three organizations. The organizationalmission of these groups fell within the broad scope of MAPS'own charter and mission, yet the specific projects thesegroups were developing were not being worked on by MAPS'core staff. MAPS was the fiscal sponsor for these groups whiletheir founders and staff worked toward establishing theirorganizations and obtaining IRS approval for their own non-profit status. In order to assist these groups as much aspossible, MAPS chose not to take any fees for being a fiscalsponsor and passed through 100% of the donations thatwere restricted for use by these groups. Income came primarily from about 1900 members,roughly the same number of members as last year. (MAPS'goal is to increase membership to at least 2,500.) Nineteenindividuals and one corporation gave $1,000 or more, for atotal of $214,365, while nine foundations gave $155,935.The remaining $184,992 came from the rest of the member-ship, book sales, and income on investments. The nine foundations that donated to MAPS in FY 99-00include the Promind Foundation Fund ($3,000), Family Foundation($2,650), Tarcher Family Foundation ($2,500), and the Odys-sey Foundation ($1,500). The individuals or corporations thatdonated $1,000 or more include John Gilmore ($3,000), Richard Wolfe ($3,000), MarshaRosenbaum ($2,500), Julie Holland, who donated to MAPS'Holland Fund for Therapeutic MDMA Research and to whichshe invites others to contribute ($2,125), Mark Europe ($1,000). Expenditures $533,482 in total expendituresin FY 99-00, $309,045, were devoted to various facets of its'educational mission. A total of $75,200 was spent on re-search projects. Staff expenditures totaled $131,311, whileoffice-related expenses amounted to $17,925. These expen-ditures will be discussed in detail below in the sectionexplaining each line item in the expense spreadsheet thataccompanies this report. Balance/Net Assets MAPS' net assets were $379,423 as of the close of FY 99-00 on May 31, 2000. As a non-profit organization, MAPS'goal is to advance its mission, not to amass net assets.However, a reasonable amount of net assets empowersMAPS to achieve its goals. Net assets give a measure ofstability to meet organizational expenses in the face offluctuating contributions from membership. More impor-tantly, net assets give MAPS the ability to commit to fundhigh-priority projects still in the development stages, shouldthe projects be approved. As a result, researchers who workwith MAPS are willing to invest their time and energy in thelengthy and time-consuming protocol development andapproval process confident that if approval is eventuallyobtained, their research project will indeed be funded. Of MAPS' $379,423 in net assets at the close of FY 99-00,$40,000 is not available for use but represents the net presentvalue of MAPS' remainder interest in a home that MAPS willreceive in its entirety in forty to fifty years. Roughly $200,000will be needed for the MDMA/PTSD research project MAPS isseeking to initiate in the United States, should it be approved(which I expect it will be). About $100,000 will be needed forthe medical marijuana production facility MAPS is trying toestablish should lightening strike and DEA permission isactually granted for this project. As a matter of fiscal strategy, MAPS will seek to raise newfunds for all projects in development that do become ap-proved. If new funds can be obtained for approved projects,MAPS can retain some net assets along with the ability toguarantee funding to additional pioneering studies in thedevelopment phase, should they also become approved. Ofcourse, MAPS can only pledge to fund projects whose cost islower than MAPS' unallocated assets. The major way I look at MAPS' net assets is in comparisonwith the estimated cost of achieving MAPS' primary goal, thatbeing to obtain FDA approval for the medical use of MDMA asan adjunct to psychotherapy. Based on what I believe arereasonable financial assumptions, I've estimated that it willcost $5 million and take 5 years to conduct sufficient researchto demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA the safety andefficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of6 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 Totals FY 99-00 $533,482.56MDMA Conference MAPS Forum BulletinPostalCopies Phones InternetBooks and Tapes MAPS Ads, Membership Drive Information Staff Travel Conference FeesProfessional Services Salary, Benefits & Tax Office Supplies Office Rent Computer EquipmentOffice Equipment Fees -- Bank, etc.$ 19,927.70 $ 14,132.16$ 13,391.32 $ 6,993.12 $ 7,060.517 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1patients suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). (see the Clinical Plan at: http://www.maps.org/research/mdmaplan.html.) From this perspective, MAPS' current netassets are sufficient only for the first steps of this clinical plan.However, I've always believed, and so far have had that beliefconfirmed, that funding can and will be obtained for all thesuccessive steps in the research process, once the protocolsare fully approved and ready to be implemented. Request for Feedback As in previous years, MAPS' statement of income andexpenses is published in the Bulletin along with a detailedexplanation of the individual expense items. In this way,MAPS members can review exactly how their donations wereallocated and what expenses were incurred. This report is aninvitation for dialogue; MAPS members are encouraged toreview this report and share with the staff any comments,suggestions or questions that they would like to offer. MAPSwill continue to flourish only to the extent that the expendi-tures it makes correspond closely to the priorities of itsmembers. As a result, we publish this detailed accounting andseek your input. Expenses For ResearchMDMA-Related Projects In FY 99-00, MAPS spent $58,669 on expenditures relatedto MDMA research. Of that total, MAPS spent $13,746 forprotocol design, approval, and preliminary implementationexpenses for the world's first and still only government-approved study of the therapeutic use of MDMA. The study,entirely funded by MAPS, is taking place in Madrid at theUniversity de Autonoma de Madrid, Spain, under the direc-tion of Jose Carlos Bouso, Ph.D. Candidate. The study is adose-response pilot study designed to evaluate the effects ofMDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of femalesurvivors of sexual assault suffering from chronic Post-Trau-matic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Subjects are required to haveparticipated in at least one other treatment effort beforeenrolling in the MDMA study. One patient has been treated todate. MAPS allocated $19,923 in FY 99-00 for researchers andconsultants to begin the process of reviewing all the scientificliterature on MDMA. When MAPS initiated the review, it wasintended to be used first as support for a protocol to besubmitted to FDA by Charles Grob, M.D., Harbor-UCLAMedical Center. The protocol will be designed to evaluate theuse of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment ofdepression in end-stage cancer patients. Dr. Grob's protocolwill likely be submitted to the FDA in Fall 2001. PromindFoundation made substantial contributions to the MDMAliterature review project. As it turns out, the literature review will first be submittedto the FDA in May 2001 in support of a protocol designed tostudy the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treat-ment of patients suffering from chronic PTSD. This study willbe conducted in Charleston, South Carolina, with Dr. MichaelMithoefer, a psychiatrist, and Annie Mithoefer, a registerednurse, working as the male/female co-therapist team. Dr.Mithoefer has been board certified in emergency medicine,internal medicine and psychiatry. Both Michael and Annie Mithoefer have studied under Dr. Stan Grof and are certifiedHolotropic Breathwork practitioners. Co-investigators are Dr.Kathleen Brady and Mark Wagner, Ph.D. This MDMA/PTSD protocol represents the culmination ofalmost two years of work conducted by MAPS-funded re-searchers. MAPS funded the assembling of a complete digi-tized bibliography of the entire scientific literature on MDMApublished in peer-reviewed scientific journals (about 900papers), the writing of a comprehensive review of the pub-lished data, as well as the latest unpublished data from on-going government-approved clinical trials with MDMA, thebringing together of an outstanding team of researchers todesign the protocol, and the gathering of a group of expertsto critique the proposed protocol design prior to submissionto FDA. MAPS allocated $11,000 in FY 99-00 to Alex Gamma,Ph.D., for his work writing several scientific papers based onMDMA research he conducted at the University of Zurichunder the direction of Dr. Franz Vollenweider. For moreinformation on these papers, see the MAPS website list ofcompleted MDMA projects. Promind Foundation donated$10,000 toward Dr. Gamma's project. MAPS allocated $14,000 for the analysis by a DEA-licensed lab of samples of Ecstasy pills sent in anonymouslyfrom around the country. It costs $100 to analyze each pill,but is free to the people who send in the pills. The purpose ofthe pill analysis research project was to determine whatEcstasy pills actually contained. This was undertaken as harmreduction research, with the results made public on theDanceSafe website. The study revealed that a substantialpercentage of Ecstasy pills contained absolutely no MDMAand often contained potentially dangerous adulturants. Formore details, see http://www.dancesafe.org/currentresults.html The costs of this program were funded by the PromindFoundation. Psilocybin in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder MAPS purchased the world's most expensive gram ofpsilocybin in FY 99-00, at a cost of $10,527. The drug is for anFDA-approved study of the use of psilocybin in the treatmentof obsessive-compulsive disorder. The study will be con-ducted at the University of Arizona, directed by Dr. FranciscoMoreno and Dr. Pedro Delgado. The protocol and informedconsent for this study are on the MAPS website at http://www.maps.org/news/1099news.html This study has not yet treated its first patient. In November2000, FDA requested more analytical data from the DEA-licensed manufacturer of the psilocybin to ensure that thedrug is safe for use in humans. In FY 00-01, MAPS paid$1,750 for this additional analytical data, which has satisfiedthe insatiable FDA. When the first patient is treated, it willmark the first time in over twenty-five years that psilocybin hasbeen given to a patient in the context of an FDA-approvedstudy. This research project is yet another example of the needfor patience in seeking approval for psychedelic research. Theprotocol was approved by the FDA in September, 1998. Thetwo and a half years since then have been focused solely on8 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1obtaining an FDA-approved supply of psilocybin. MAPS de- cided to have new supplies manufactured after it provedimpossible to obtain any from the National Institue of DrugAbuse (NIDA) or the National Bastiaans LSD Follow-up In FY 99-00, MAPS paid the second installment of $2,500for costs associated with a follow-up study of Dutch psychia-trist Dr. Jan Bastiaans' patients, whom he treated for PTSDwith LSD-assisted psychotherapy. The study was conductedby Dutch researchers Hans Ossebaard and Nicole Maalste.Many of Dr. Bastiaans subjects were concentration campsurvivors. This study provides promising anecdotal evidencesuggesting that further research into the use of psychedeli-cally-assisted psychotherapy in patients with PTSD should beconducted. For more information on the results of this study,see http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n2/09203maa.html Marijuana in the Treatment of Migraines MAPS allocated $2,000 to Dr. Ethan Russo, University ofMontana, to support his efforts to conduct FDA-approvedresearch into the use of marijuana in the treatment ofmigraine sufferers. Dr. Russo obtained both local InstitutionalReview Board (IRB) approval and FDA approval for his study.The $2,000 that MAPS donated was for Dr. Russo's ultimatelyfruitless efforts to obtain from NIDA a legal source of FDA-approved marijuana for his study. Marijuana is the only Schedule 1 drug for which NIDA hasa monopoly on the supply that can be used in FDA-approvedclinical trials. Unfortunately, NIDA is less than enthusiasticabout facilitating research into the potential therapeuticbenefits of smoking the marijuana plant. On May 21, 1999,NIDA and Health and Human Services (HHS) established apolicy whereby research with marijuana became subjected tomore reviews than any other drug in the United States.Research must now be approved, not only by the FDA and anIRB, but also by a special committee of the Public HealthService (PHS). This PHS committee rejected Dr. Russo's proto-col even though all he and MAPS were seeking was the rightto purchase low-quality marijuana at high prices from NIDAfor an FDA-approved study. No government money wasrequested for the study. For the sorry history of the effort toresearch marijuana in the treatment of migraines, seehttp://www.maps.org/mmj/mjrusso.html MAPS, Dr. Russo and the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP)tried to make the proverbial lemonaide out of this lemon. OnFebruary 20, 2001, we submitted an Amicus Curiae brief tothe U.S. Supreme Court in the Oakland Cannabis Buyer'sCooperative medical marijuana case (http://www.maps.org/mmj/maps-mppbrief.html). We have tried to turn our frus-trating experience with NIDA to the advantage of medicalmarijuana patients by letting the U.S. Supreme Court knowthat for marijuana, the FDA drug development process ispolitically obstructed. The basic point of our brief is that theseobstructions create a compelling case for the medical neces-sity defense for patients who run into conflict with the policeover their use of marijuana as medicine. Dr. Russo has decided to abandon his struggle to conductFDA-approved research into marijuana's therapeutic poten-tial in treating migraine patients. Instead, he has designed a basic safety study to evaluate the health of those few patientsremaining alive who legally receive marijuana from NIDA aspart of the Compassionate Investigational New Drug (IND)program, which in 1992 was closed by HHS to any additionalpatients. MAPS has pledged $10,000 for this study. (see page21 of this issue for more details about this study.) Ketamine Research MAPS donated $1,100 to Dr. Evgeny Krupitsky's ketamineresearch investigating the use of ketamine-assisted psycho-therapy in the treatment of heroin addicts. The amount wedonated in FY 99-00 year was minimal, since Dr. Krupitskyhad completed his initial study in heroin addicts comparingthe effects of a high-dose ketamine session to session. In FY 99-00, Dr. Krupitsky mostlyfocused on data analysis and the design of a new study. Dr. Krupitsky's initial study demonstrated statistically sig-nificant advantages in sobriety in patients receiving the high-dose ketamine session as compared to patients receiving thelow dose/placebo session. As a result, Dr. Krupitsky requestedfunding to conduct a 5-year study comparing multiple (three)high doses of ketamine one month apart with a single highdose and two non-drug therapy sessions. This new protocoldesign is quite exciting since it moves beyond the one-dose/miracle cure model, popular in the 1960s, but not demon-strated to have long-lasting benefits. The new study exploresthe use of multiple psychedelic psychotherapy sessions inte-grated within an ongoing therapeutic relationship. MAPSand Heffter Research Institute have agreed to share equally inthe costs of this study, budgeted at $9,450 for each organiza-tion for each of the five years of the study. This study has beeninitiated in FY 00-01 (see page 13 of this issue for the latestupdate). The protocol is on the MAPS website at http://www.maps.org/research/ketamine/kprotocol2.html Takiwasi Takiwasi is a drug treatment center in Peru that usesayahuasca and other herbal medicines to treat patients withaddictive disorders. MAPS donated $400 to Takiwasi, whichMAPS received as a restricted grant for that purpose. For moreinformation on Takiwasi, seehttp://www.maps.org/news-letters/v06n3/06324aya.html Expenses for Educational Purposes MAPS MDMA Conference, Dead Sea, Israel, August 1999 MAPS allocated $60,972 for the costs of organizing a conference on MDMA at the Dead Sea, Israel. This sumincludes the costs of the conference itself, which MAPSobtained from a small group of donors (Tim Butcher donated$17,500), and the costs of the optional pre-conference tour,which was organized by MAPS and paid for by the tourparticipants. MAPS' MDMA conference was attended by at least onerepresentative from every team in the world that had ob-tained governmental permission to administer MDMA tohuman volunteers in the context of clinical research. The9 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1purpose of this conference was twofold; to facilitate commu- nication and collaboration between the world's MDMAresearchers, and to educate representatives of the IsraeliMinistry of Health as part of MAPS' efforts to start research inIsrael into the use of MDMA in the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). For more information onthis conference, seehttp://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n4/09402dob.html Due to the increased level of violence in the Middle Eaststemming from the failure of the peace talks, the need fornew treatments for PTSD is greater than ever. However,MDMA psychotherapy research remains controversial in Is-rael. It now seems that the Israeli authorities are waiting untilafter the FDA approves MDMA psychotherapy research be-fore permitting a MAPS-funded MDMA/PTSD study to takeplace in Israel. An April 2001 article on MDMA from the Israelinewspaper, Haaretz, which mentions MAPS' efforts to startMDMA/PTSD research in Israel, can be found on the MAPSwebsite in the section on MAPS in the media. DanceSafe MAPS received and disbursed $100,672 to DanceSafe, arave and dance culture harm reduction organization focusedmostly on MDMA (Ecstasy) and other drugs used in the ravecontext. DanceSafe used some of its resources to create andmaintain its website, which presents detailed and credibleinformation about MDMA and other drugs. Dancesafe.orgattracted a large number of visitors, in excess of the number ofvisitors to the various governmental websites established byNIDA and other agencies in order to provide their own versionof drug education. DanceSafe also wrote, designed andpublished printed informational brochures to hand out atraves and in other venues. DanceSafe's boldest harm reduction activity, which gen-erated substantial media attention, was to pioneer the use ofMDMA testing kits at raves, designed to determine whetherpills sold as Ecstasy actually contained any MDMA. The testkits were used at raves by DanceSafe's local chapters, whichwere established around the country. DanceSafe also as-sumed responsibility for managing and funding the moresophisticated laboratory-based pill testing program thatMAPS had initiated. Sylvia Thyssen, who had worked at MAPS since 1993,moved to San Francisco at the end of FY 99-00 in order towork full-time for DanceSafe, moving out of the MAPS fryingpan (with its relatively conservative research agenda) into theDanceSafe fire (with its more controversial harm-reductionagenda). MAPS continued to act as DanceSafe's fiscalsponsor in FY 00-01. Among others, Ray Joseph Greenwelldonated $25,000 for DanceSafe, John Gilmore donated$20,000, and Paul Phillips donated $10,000. Erowid MAPS received and disbursed $28,852 to Erowid.org, aneducational website focused on providing information aboutpsychoactive plants and drugs. Erowid is the most frequentlyvisited psychoactive drug information site on the web. Erowidis currently (April 2001) getting an average of more than20,000 unique visitors and more than 220,000 pages serveda day. Erowid does not accept advertising on its site, whichcould generate significant income, but prefers to provide information in a non-commercial, non-judgmental context.Erowid relies on donations to support staff costs. In FY 99-00,Promind Foundation donated $27,263 to MAPS for Erowid.MAPS continued to act as Erowid's fiscal sponsor in FY 00-01. Through a not completely coincidental turn of events, thecreators of Erowid (Earth and Fire Erowid) and I all went tocollege together at New College of the University of SouthFlorida, that bastion of academic experimentation thatcoupled rigorous academic standards with a fundamentalbelief in the value of facilitating each student's exercise of hisor her own intellectual curiosities. Alchemind MAPS received and disbursed $25,761 in FY 99-00 toAlchemind, a non-profit educational organization foundedand directed by attorney Richard Boire and Wrye Sententia.Alchemind publishes a journal that monitors and commentson legal issues related to the use of psychedelic plants anddrugs for a full range of purposes including spiritual, thera-peutic, creativity-enhancing, and recreational. Alchemindalso maintains an informative website, at alchemind.org.Alchemind describes its mission as follows: \"We seek to fostercognitive liberty; the right of each individual to think inde-pendently, to use the full spectrum of his or her mind, and toengage in multiple modes of thought and alternative states ofconsciousness.\" Promind Foundation donated $28,505 to 00-01.) MAPS Alchemind in FY 00-01. Web-Based Psychedelic Bibliography - New in FY 99-00 to Matt Baggott forhis work monitoring the scientific literature for human clinicalresearch with psychedelics. Studies identified by Matt wereadded to the psychedelic bibliography (http://www.maps.org/wwwpb/index.html). In addition, Matt sub-mitted comments on the findings of some of the moreinteresting studies to the MAPS Bulletin, the MAPS Forum, (anelectronic discussion group to be discussed below), as well asto other researchers. This project was an adjunct to theMDMA literature review that Matt was coordinating forMAPS. This project was placed on hold in FY 00-01 in order topermit Matt to concentrate fully on the review of the scientificliterature on MDMA. Work on the web-based psychedelic bibliography wassupported by a grant from Promind Foundation. Albert Hofmann Foundation LSD/Psilocybin Bibliography MAPS allocated $2,012 to the development of an on-linebibliography that will list all published articles on LSD andpsilocybin. These funds were spent on development of cus-tomized software for the bibliography and on data-entry. Theproject was funded by a grant from the Promind Foundation.To access the bibliography, see http://www.maps.org/wwwpb/index.html A collection of nearly all of the scientific peer-reviewedpublished articles on LSD and psilocybin is in the possession ofthe Albert Hofmann Foundation. The bibliography project10 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1will expand substantially during FY 01-02 with the goal of creating a PDF file of each paper, linked to each bibliographicentry. A substantial number of volunteers will be needed tocomplete this project at an affordable cost. This project isbeing supported by the Promind Foundation. (For moreinformation, see the article on page 19 in this Bulletin.) DMT- The Spirit Molecule, by Dr. Rick Strassman In FY 99-00, MAPS received a series of restricted grantsfrom Robert Barnhart totalling $18,000. The purpose of thesegrants were to provide financial support for Dr. Rick Strassmanso that he could focus on writing a book about his experiencesconducting FDA-approved psychedelic research, primarilywith DMT but also somewhat with psilocybin. Dr.Strassman's book, DMT-The Spirit Molecule, was published by Inner Traditions in 2001. The book is selling well and asecond print run has already been initiated. Ketamine: Dreams and Realities, by Dr. Karl Jansen MAPS allocated $1,992 in FY 99-00 for the editing of Dr.Karl Jansen's book, Ketamine: Dreams and Realities . Jon Hanna was the editor and did a wonderfully thorough andinsightful job; Mercedes Paulino compiled the exhaustiveindex (which nearly drove her back to her home planet).Ketamine: Dreams and Realities was published by MAPS in 2001. Dr. Jansen's book is being well received and is availablefrom MAPS at http://www.maps.org/kdreams/index.html. Emanuel Sferios, founder of DanceSafe, wrote the intro-duction to book. Promind Foundation donated $9,672 toMAPS in FY 99-00 to support the editing and printing costs ofthis book (The remaining portion of this donation wasallocated to printing costs in FY 00-01). LSD Psychotherapy, by Dr. Stan Grof In 2001, MAPS published a new paperback edition of Dr.Stan Grof's classic work, LSD Psychotherapy , with a new introduction by Dr. Andrew Weil and eight pages of new colorplates. Though none of the expenses for printing this book(about $15,000) or any of the donations to support theprinting of this book (Promind I'm mention-ing this book anyway to call attention to its availability. To order LSD Psychotherapy see http://www.maps.org/lsdtherapy/index.html. The Secret Chief, by Myron Stolaroff, Ecstasy: Dance, Trance and Transformation,by Nicholas Saunders with Rick Doblin, with a bibliog-raphy by Sasha Shulgin MAPS paid royalties to Myron Stolaroff in FY 99-00amounting to $1,587.64. MAPS paid $166.15. Orenda Conference- Hollyhock, British Co- Canada Richard Yensen, Ph.D. and Dr. Donna Dryer, OrendaInstitute, organized an invitational conference focused onthe use of altered states of consciousness in religious andtherapeutic contexts. MAPS allocated $10,000 in FY 99-00toward this conference, after receiving a restricted grant inthat amount from the Promind Foundation. Psychedelic Elders Conference MAPS allocated $5,273 in FY 99-00 for the organizationof the interviews and transcripts gathered as part of thePsychedelic Elders conference which took place in Novemberof 1998. MAPS received a restricted donation for this purposeby Betsy Gordon. The Elders conference, which was spon-sored primarily by the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS),gathered together many of the early pioneers of psychedelicresearch, including Albert Hofmann on his last visit to theUnited States, Laura Huxley, Ram Dass, Stan Grof, RalphMetzner, Myron Stolaroff, and others, including a few repre-sentatives of the younger generation of researchers. Theconference focused on a discussion of how psychedelics hadaffected the Elders' views of reality and spirituality, and onsuggestions for the successful integration of psychedelics intoWestern culture. Ibogaine Conference MAPS allocated $1,000 to the first international confer-ence on ibogaine, organized by Dr. Ken Alper at New YorkUniversity. The conference took place November 5-6, 1999.The clinical portion of the conference was focused primarilyon the use of ibogaine in the treatment of addiction. MAPS Forum MAPS spent $3,600 in FY 99-00 on the MAPS Forum, anelectronic discussion group available for free to MAPS mem-bers and non-members alike. This discussion group has about1600 subscribers and generates some lively and substantivediscussions. The Forum is skillfully moderated by Jon Frederick,Ph.D candidate at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. (Jonis going to receive his Ph.D in June, 2001, with a dissertationfocusing on the use of the EEG for brain wave analysis). TheForum is archived on the MAPS website at http://www.cerebral.org/Maps/maillist.html. The MAPS Forum is funded by a grant from the PromindFoundation. MAPS Bulletin MAPS spent $23,876 on printing the MAPS Bulletin in FY99-00. The Bulletin is MAPS' primary means of communica-tions with its members. MAPS also sends the Bulletin for freeas an educational tool to about 350 scientists, governmentofficials, drug war prisoners, and academics. In addition,about 750 copies of the two color cover issues per year aresent to distributors for sale on newsstands. The $23,876 thatMAPS spent on the Bulletin in FY 99-00 was almost exactly thesame as the $23,497 spent in FY 98-99. The costs of MAPS' Bulletin are rather high for an organiza-tion of MAPS' size. This is due primarily to the length of theBulletins and to the extra expense of the two color coverissues. In this age of the Internet, with its instant and virtuallycost-free communication, MAPS expenditures on its Bulletinneed to be evaluated carefully. I've come to the conclusion that hard-copy issues of theBulletin are still important to MAPS' educational and commu-nity-building mission. The Bulletins act as a permanent11 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1physical record of MAPS' activities, of the scientific research papers that are presented within the Bulletin, and of topics ofinterest to the MAPS community. It's more pleasurable toread hard copy than a computer screen, and the Bulletinprovides MAPS members with the opportunity to showsomething tangible to their friends who may wish to learnmore about MAPS and its agenda. However, the use of the Bulletin to transmit information ofa timely nature, or of an extremely detailed nature like a longprotocol or literature review, is limited. This sort of informa-tion is more efficiently communicated through the MAPSwebsite. I'd like to expand the use of the MAPS website formore timely and detailed content. I'd also like to expand theuse of e-mail to send out occasional time-sensitive messagesto MAPS members, so please consider sending your currente-mail address to the MAPS office at info@maps.org. MAPS is going to experiment with focusing the next twocolor cover Bulletins on themes that speak to broader topicsthan just MAPS' pharmaceutical drug development efforts,which seek primarily to move psychedelics and marijuanathrough the FDA drug review and approval process. Theseupcoming issues will be similar to the recent Psychedelics andCreativity issue which was enthusiatically received and isturning out to be the first MAPS Bulletin that we have everreprinted. The two non-color cover issues will continue tofocus on articles more directly related to MAPS' projects,research reviews, general updates, interviews, conferencereports, book reviews, and other such content. Organizational ExpensesPostage MAPS spent $7,986 on postage in FY 99-00. This com-pares to $8,761 in FY 98-99. MAPS is trying to use the internetfor communications where possible in order to further reduceexpenses for postage. Copies MAPS spent $1,617 on photocopies in FY 99-00, com-pared to $2,858 in FY98-99. This reduction probably repre-sents savings due to our increased use of the internet to sendinformation to people who request it. Phones MAPS spent $6,108 in FY 99-00 on telephone bills. Thiscompares to $7,262 in FY 98-99. This savings represents thecontinued decrease in the per-minute cost of long-distancecalls. Internet MAPS spent $2,960 in FY on internet connections.This compares to $1,787 FY 98-99. This increase reflects theadded cost of high-speed internet connections, as well as thecosts associated with the use of the secure server. Books and Tapes MAPS spent $341 in FY 99-00 on books and tapes forresale to MAPS members. This compares to $1,539 in FY 98-99. This savings reflects the reductions in sales of Ecstasy:Dance, Trance and Transformation, which we didn't publish ourselves but still sold through the Bulletin, as well severalother items. MAPS Ads and Membership Drive MAPS spent $3,616 in FY 99-00 on ads and membershipdrive expenses such as small, limited mailings. This comparesto $9,158 in FY 98-99. This substantial decline reflectsreductions in ads for The Secret Chief, the absence of ads for other MAPS books which didn't get published in FY 99-00,and the decision to focus on obtaining approval for one ormore major research projects before going to the publicseeking additional members. Information MAPS spent $402 in FY 99-00 on books, subscriptions,tapes and other sources of information. This compares to$1,561 in FY 98-99. This decline is not due to the fact that weMAPS staff members knew more in FY 99-00 than in 98-99 (Iwish). Perhaps it is due to the fact that I was completing mydissertation in FY 99-00 and expanded my ability to findinformation for free on the web. Staff ExpensesStaff Travel MAPS spent $8,926 on staff travel in FY 99-00, comparedto $9,855 in FY 98-99. This slight reduction is probably due tothe fact that I was completing my dissertation and didn'twant to venture too far from my computer. Conference Fees MAPS spent $3,745 on conference fees in FY 99-00,compared to $2,757 in FY 98-99. This increase is due tohigher conferences fees for the conferences that MAPS sentstaff members to attend. Professional Services MAPS spent $5,023 on professional services in FY 99-00,as compared to $3,712 in FY 98-99. This increase is due inpart to MAPS' larger budget and the associated need foradditional accounting services, as well additional costs associ-ated with computer consultants to expand our software andto develop video content for the MAPS website. Salary, Benefits and Taxes MAPS spent $113, 617 for three full-time staff in FY 99-00.This compares to $100,134 in FY 98-99. This increase reflectsraises in salaries and in the cost of health care benefits to SylviaThyssen and Carla Higdon. In addition, a small portion of thisincrease was due to the hiring of Maggie Hall near the end ofFY 99-00, in order for her to receive training from Sylvia, manyof whose responsibilities she assumed after Sylvia's depar-ture. Rick Doblin's remained at $30,000 in both FY 98-99and FY 99-00, with no health care benefits in Thyssen's salary increased in FY 99-00 to $32,600, from$28,600, health salaryincreased FY 99-00 to $26,880, from Thyssen and Carla Higdon, though not Rick12 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 Doblin, also received payments into a retirement account set up by MAPS for their benefit. A total of $3,300 was placedinto Carla's account, while a total of $5,220 was placed intoSylvia's account, reflecting her seniority at MAPS. As with most non-profit organizations, MAPS' salaries arelower than those for jobs in the private-sector with compa-rable skills and responsibilities. The lower salary is compen-sated for by the satisfaction of working on issues that havepersonal and social relevance. This wage disparity is also dueto the fact that a large fraction of MAPS' income consists ofrestricted funds that go 100% to projects or other organiza-tions, leaving less for organizational expenses than a quickglance at FY salary remained at $30,000,without health care benefits. Sylvia Thyssen moved to SF andstarted working for DanceSafe as of the end of FY 99-00. CarlaHigdon received a raise from $26,880 to $28,224. Theamount going into her retirement account increased from$3,300 to $4,740. Health care benefits stayed the same.Maggie Hall was hired as the third full-time staff member at asalary of $26,880, with retirement benefits of $1,260 and fullhealth care benefits. Mercedes Paulino was hired severalmonths into FY 00-01 as a part-time staff member whoseresponsibilities included being in charge of MAPS' website ata salary of $12.50 an hour, with full health-care benefits butno retirement contributions. Office ExpensesOffice Supplies MAPS spent $3,025 on office supplies in FY 99-00, com-pared to $2,075 in FY 98-99. Office FY 99-00, comparedto $3,967 in increase in Sarasotain FY 99-00. Rather, this increase reflects that fact that forabout half of FY 98-99, the MAPS office was in Char-lotte, NC, where the monthly rent was $200 a month,while for the other half of FY 98-99, the MAPS officewas in Sarasota, where the monthly rent was $500.As a result, overall rent for FY 98-99 was lower for FY 99-00. Rent 00-01 has remainedthe same in Sarasota, at $500 a month. Office Equipment Office equipment expenditures in FY 99-00were $2,817, compared to $685 in FY 98-99. Thisincrease reflects the cost of setting up a new officein a new location. Computer Equipment MAPS spent $3,948 for computer equip-ment in FY 99-00, as compared to $74.94 in FY98-99. MAPS substantially upgraded its com-puter equipment in FY 99-00. Fees, Bank and Regulatory FY 98-99. This increase is due to new registration fees with the State of Florida. Conclusion MAPS had a successful and active year in FY 99-00, with amix of educational and research projects. In terms of clinicalresearch, much of what took place in FY 99-00 was laying thegroundwork for research projects still to be approved. Now that I have completed my dissertation, I feel a bit morewind in my sails. Simultaneously, the social breezes areshifting directions somewhat. With skill and patience, it'spossible to create increasingly greater opportunities to ad-vance MAPS' agenda. As the teamwork between MAPS' staffand our membership continues to develop and expand,MAPS becomes more effective. I'm reminded yet again ofTheodore Hertzl's inspiring words, \"If you will it, it is nodream.\"13 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 Introduction The number of registered and non-registered heroin addicts in Russia dramatically increases every year. Heroin addiction has a particularly high prevalence rate among Russian youth. During the last several years, the heroin addiction epidemic in Russia has become closely related to the HIV epidemic. Since methadone maintenance isprohibited in Russia by law, relapse prevention in heroin addicts is mostly limited to the use of naltrexone, antidepressants, and psychosocial treatment. Poor compliance with the above medications is a major problem, which makes it important to develop new treatment approaches based on combined pharmacological andpsychotherapeutic interventions. During the 1960s, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy was demonstrated to be a promising approach to the treatment of addictions. However, studies of psychedelic psychotherapy were essentially stopped in the early1970s due to political limitations resulting in part from adverse reactions associated with the non-medical uses of psychedelic drugs. Ketamine is a government-approved registered drug used for general anesthesia. In small doses (1/10 to 1/6of that usually used in surgery), it induces a profound psychedelic experience. It is safe, short acting, and has an approved medical use unlike other psychedelics which are criminalized and have no approved medical uses. The legal status of ketamine was one of the major reasons we chose to study the efficacy of ketamine-assistedpsychotherapy (KPT) for alcoholism and heroin addiction. We have been doing studies of KPT since 1985. We have shown that a single KPT session is an effective method of treatment for alcoholism (Krupitsky, Grinenko, 1997) as well as for heroin addiction (Krupitsky et al, 1999). We are currently exploring the question of whether increasing the number of KPT sessions will increase the efficacy of the treatment. That might be the case since many of the subjects who underwent psychedelic psychotherapy reported a specific \"psychedelic afterglow\" (positive psychological changes induced by the KPTsession) which usually lasted up to several weeks after the session. Thus, multiple KPT sessions might have a cumulative effect that would generate longer-lasting positive psychological changes, thereby improving treatment outcomes. The study that we are currently conducting, with support from MAPS and Heffter ResearchInstitute, is designed to test this hypothesis. Methods At this point in time (mid-April, 2001), forty-one detoxified heroin addicts have voluntarily given their informed consent and have been included into the study. All subjects received one KPT session at the end of theirdetoxification treatment course in the psychiatric hospital. At both one and two months after the initial KPT session, all subjects were invited back for one day to the same hospital and randomly assigned to one of two groups, an experimental group and a control group. Patients randomized to the experimental group (20 so far)have received their second and third KPT sessions at one and two months after their first KPT session. Subjects randomized to the control group (19 subjects) have received regular drug counseling sessions instead of KPTKetamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KPT) In The Treatment of Heroin Addiction: Multiple v Single with St.Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University, Russia14 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1sessions, at one and two months after their first KPT session. The third KPT session was considered to be the end of the treat ment program for the subjects in the experimental group while the second counseling session was considered to be the end of thetreatment program for the subjects in the control group. We are evaluating all subjects participating in the study at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after completion of the treatment program. We are monitoring their abstinence from heroin with the use of urine drug tests and are also conducting psychological assessments measuring such variables as anxiety, depression, craving forheroin, anhedonia, and purpose in life. Two subjects who relapsed after the first KPT session had not been randomized to either group. Results Two heroin addicts relapsed after the first KPT session, so that they were not randomized to either the experimental or co ntrol group. In the experimental group (3 KPT), three subjects relapsed after the second KPT (without having a third KPT session), one relapsed after the third KPT session (\"end of treatment\"), one in two months after the third KPT session, and one in five month s after the third KPT session. A total of six subjects have relapsed to date in the experimental group. Two subjects were abstine nt one year after the last KPT session and thus finished their participation in the study. We continue to follow twelve subjects f rom the experimental group who are abstinent, with a period of abstinence of less than one year after the end of the treatmentprogram. In the control group (1KPT + 2 Counseling), six subjects relapsed after the first counseling session, one after the second counseling session (\"end of treatment\"), one within two months after the last counseling session, two in three months, one infive months, and one in eight months after the last counseling session. A total of twelve subjects have relapsed to date in the control group. We will continue to follow seven subjects of this group who are abstinent with a period of abstinence of less th an one year after the end of the treatment program. Thus, the preliminary data we have gathered so far provides some evidence that three KPT sessions work better than one KPT session followed by two drug counseling sessions. We will continue recruitment of new subjects into this study to at least doub le the number of subjects in each group since that is important from a statistical point of view. It is important to note that KPT produced no severe adverse reactions in this study. The safety of KPT demonstrated in thi s study is also an important result.

History of the Protocol Approval Process From late 1994 through the beginning of 1995, I treated, under Dr. Pedro Delgado's supervision, a patient who had difficult-to-treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Sur- prisingly, this patient reported that his symptoms haddramatically improved immediately after ingestion of dry psilocybin mushrooms (taken in a recreational context). After chronic exposure to these mushrooms, he noticed that hissymptoms remained in remission even when he stopped using psilocybin. After a brief discussion with Dr. Delgado, in which he indicated that he had heard of similar cases, we conducted a literature search and found minimal direct literature butseveral supportive reports. We wrote a case report and initiated contact with experienced hallucinogen researchers, including Dr. Rick Strassman, who was then in New Mexicoand had expressed interest in collaborating in a prospective study to evaluate this phenomena under controlled circum- stances. A number of other researchers including our sup-porters at MAPS were very enthusiastic about the plan and contributed ideas and feedback to the development of the current protocol. Our initial task was to work closely with the University of Arizona Human Subjects Committee (HSC) in order to discussthe potential approval of our project. After repeated reviewsand a visit by Dr. Delgado and myself with the HSC, we were able to satisfy their concerns and suggestions by Novem- ber1997. Earlier conversations with Dr. Strassman made it clear that obtaining permission from the FDA and the DEA would be thelargest hurdles to overcome once the HSC had approved the protocol. In addition to FDA approval of our protocol for the use of an Investigational New Drug (IND), we need to obtaina DEA schedule I license that is psilocybin-specific. However, the DEA requires an FDA-sanctioned protocol with an ap- proved IND in order to process the application for a DEAlicense. Although our protocol design was finally approved by the FDA on September 17, 1998, the FDA placed our IND on clinical hold pending clarification of the source of the drug. Part of the delay in the FDA process is the result of our lack ofexperience at preparing all the material that is required by the FDA. They accepted our application without a formal proto- col written in the format that pharmaceutical companiesusually compose. Mistakenly, we had provided the FDA with data on psilocybin existing at NIDA even though NIDA had not yet decided to make that psilocybin available to us. We madethe decision to pursue obtaining the drug from NIDA through our in-house collaborators but were unable to do so after about one year of trying. We attempted to import psilocybin fromSwitzerland but were also unable to arrange for that option.by Dr. Francisco Moreno (fmoreno@u.arizona.edu) Update Around April 20, 2001, we submitted additional analyti- cal data to the FDA regarding the purity of the one gram of psilocybin that MAPS arranged to be synthesized and purchased for ourexperiment. On May 8, 2001, we learned from the FDA that the psilocybin was approved forhuman use. We now have final approval from FDA to begin the study! All we need to do nowprior to beginning formal recruitment of subjects for the study is to obtain our DEA Schedule1 licenses to handle the psilocybin, and obtain a DEA certificate of confidentiality (to protectthe privacy of our subjects, who are required to have had prior experience with psychedelics).Now that we have final FDA approval for the study, we should be able to obtain our DEAlicenses and certificate of confidentiality within a month or two.On May 8, 2001, we learned that the FDA has approved the psilocybin for use in humans. This is the final approval we needed from FDA!16 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 In October, 1999, Rick Doblin began searching for a potential non-governmental domestic source of psilocybin. He located Organix, a private company with the required DEA licenses and expertise in the synthesis of organic compounds,including psilocybin. He learned that Organix could synthe- size our drug and provide the FDA with the required analytical data sufficient to characterize our drug source (the issue thatresulted in the clinical hold FDA placed upon our protocol). A contract between MAPS and Organix for one gram of psilocybin was initially proposed for $7,500, but this amountwas increased to $10,000 in a December 1999 contract after Organix had discussed directly with the FDA its needs for analytical data. It then took almost six months to resolve lengthy discus- sions between Organix and the University of Arizona lawyersabout what would be the safest legal process to obtain psilocybin from Organix. In May 2000, the University of Arizona received a grant of $10,527 from MAPS so that theUniversity could purchase the substance directly from Organix. Two more months went by before the University of Arizona submitted a purchase order to Organix on August 1,2000. By the end of September 2000, Organix had com- pleted the synthesis and had provided us with the analytical data initially agreed upon. We, in turn, submitted thisinformation to the FDA. On November 29, 2000, the FDA informed us that additional analysis, interpretation, and a written description of the synthetic process was required.Organix agreed to provide this additional information at anextra cost of $1,750 that MAPS agreed to pay directly to Organix. Organix subsequently provided us with the newly required data and we in turn resubmitted it to the FDA beforeApril 20, 2001. On May 8, 2001, we learned that the FDA has approved the psilocybin for use in humans. This is the final approval we needed from FDA! Now we will be able to obtain the necessary licenses from DEA. Once this study begins, it willmark the first time in over 25 years that psilocybin has been administered to a patient population in the context of a legal, FDA-approved protocol. Partial funding for the operational cost of the study has been pledged by the Heffter Research Institute. Additional funding in the amount of $25,000 will be needed in order to complete the implementation of the entire project. Dona-tions to MAPS can be restricted for our use, with 100% of the donation allocated to our study.\"Once this study begins, it will mark the first time inover 25 years that psilocybinhas been administered to apatient population.\" The Alchemists17 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 In association with MAPS, I am seekinag funding to prepare a grant proposal to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health / Swiss NationalFoundation (SFOPH/SNF) for a double-blind controlled study of theeffectiveness of high dose and low dose psilocybin-enhanced psy-chotherapy with narcotic addicts. I'm a Swiss psychologist, psycho-therapist and international trainer of a form of psychotherapy calledprocess work. I am co-founder of process work training programsacross Europe, a presenter at conferences and a group facilitator withexperience in large group process, team building and conflict resolu-tion. For the last ten years I have been living in Oregon whilecompleting my Ph.D. and am planning to return to Zurich. The project development is planned in Switzerland from July 2001 - July 2002. The Swiss have traditionally done psycholytic therapies, and therapists working with substances do so with permission of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The fact that substance- assisted psychotherapies have been conducted in Switzerland increases the likelihood ofgetting the necessary permits (Ethics committee, SFOPH). To insure the scientific character of the study, protocol development and implementation will be done in collaboration with experts in the field. If a grant proposal is completed and subsequentlyaccepted by the Swissfoundations - for which there is quite a good chance - a large Swiss grant will finance the actual implementation of the 3 year project, hopefully to take place from Fall 2002 - Fall 2005. This is a unique opportunity for a large-scale treatment study in the field of applied psychedelic research to be successfully implemented due to a wonderful synergy in time and place of resources and researchers. Funding needs For the year July 2001 - July 2002 - until the protocol is completed and the grant proposal accepted by BAG/SNF, I need to generate a funded position formyself for the development of the protocol. Scientific support has been promised so that there should be no delay in establishing the protocol. Preparation will include literature review, design of the methodology of the study, selection of assessment instruments, developing a manual for shortterm psilocybin-supported experiential psychotherapy, connecting with the collaborating institutions, team building and writing of the grant application. The funding needs for the one- year preparation period are $65,000. We are hoping to leverage the $65,000 required for thedevelopment of the protocol and grant application into a donation from Swiss federal institutions in excess of $1 million for the implementation of the study. Preliminary design of the study Part of the work during the development phase will be to design a manual-guided (standardized) psychotherapy program lasting six months for psilocybin-supported treatment of narcotic addiction - combining a powerful medicine with cutting edge experientialpsychotherapy. A new therapy manual will be developed in close reference to international standard manuals. The manual will comprise a complete guide to typical in-session processes in psycholytic therapy and corresponding sets of possible therapist interventions. The therapyprogram will include 1) preparation, 2) psychedelic experience and 3) integration phase. Four therapists will treat 16 clients each in up to 30 individual non-drug sessions and in up to 4 repetitions of the psychedelic experience in two-day group sessions. Therapists, clients andraters will be blind to the dosage.The Effectiveness of Psilocybin-assisted Psychotherapy with Narcotic Addicts: A Request for Funding By Reinhard Hauser, Ph.D. (reini@earthlink.net)18 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 The protocol itself also needs to be designed in detail. The current conception is to enroll about 64 substance-depen- dent persons who would be randomly selected from a pool ofclients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, then assigned in matched pairs to either high or low dose group. Outcome criteria would be drug use, craving, psychological problemsand personality, life values, criminal activity, and social adap- tation. Assessment instruments will include self, clinician and significant other ratings as well as physiological measures,urine analysis and possibly, SPECT, PET and / or fMRI for the study of the effect of therapy on craving. Follow-up evalua- tions at 6, 12 and 18 months are planned. Today, Switzerland is a leader in the treatment of addic- tion. Risk reduction measures are effective and heroin mainte- nance projects show promising results (Uchtenhagen et al 1999). However, there has been little innovation in alternative treatment. I believe that it is important to invest in creativeprograms designed to motivate addicted persons toward life style changes including reduction of drug use. I share the confidence of my colleagues that the time is right for thisstudy in Switzerland and expect to obtain government per- mits and funding with a protocol that meets today's method- ological standards. Process Work The model of process work is an innovative experiential approach to psychotherapy, dream and body work, conflict resolution and large group work developed by A. Mindell and colleagues over the past 20 years. Its elegant framework - based on the final perspective of Jung -organizes psychotherapy, shamanism, creativity, spirituality and politics/social action into a unified paradigm to personal development and global change. Drawing on my background in an experiential psycho- therapy which emphasizes the non-drug induced use of altered states of consciousness for therapeutic purposes, I explored its application in the treatment ofaddiction. This led me to study the altered states of con- sciousness that addicts are seeking through the use of drugs. My dissertation is on the topic: \"Altered states of consciousness as a complement in the treatment of addiction: effectiveness of a single process- oriented intervention - a quantitative and qualitative study\". I believe that an addiction may be, beyond its causal origins, a potentially purposeful behavior, a search for experi- ences which are missing in an addicts everyday life. The intervention I studied facilitates re-experiencing the drugstate or \"high\" without drugs, with a sober attitude, and deepens the experience in an interactional process through body awareness, movement and relationship work until somedeeply felt personal meanings emerge. In this process, the client learns to separate the drug from the state and experiences the altered state without drugs. The method proposes an inner work practice which assists the addict to access the drug state and to unfold its effects. Theidea is that the altered state carries a message which wants to be lived and integrated into the person's everyday life. The goal in the treatment of addiction is not the altered state perse but expansion of awareness and a reorientation toward what has been neglected, in short, toward a spiritual life. I used an AB experimental design in my dissertation research in which an initial baseline session was compared to an intervention session (accessing the state) with 13 heroindependent persons. On the SOC-13, a measure of health (Antonovsky 1987), the empirical results demonstrated effec- tiveness of the intervention with a significant increase of to t2 effect size d=0.85). On the Experiencing scale, a measure of client involvement in process (Klein et al 1969), which is based on ratings of session transcripts and video tapes by trained raters, the increases were significant but inthe lower ranges of the scale from 3.24 - 3.65 (t-test p=0.03; Index, an adapta- tion of the Experiencing scale to process work, the increaseswere not only statistically significant but measured a full stage increase to critical stage 4, the level where clients start to focus on inner experiencing in a meaningful way (from 2.95 - 4.03;t-test p=0.000; r=0.58, p=0.39; d=2.27). The qualitative results are more difficult to summarize since every individual has a unique process which needs to accurately and precisely be followed in therapy. However, at the risk of simplification, the results illustrate a generaltendency toward some core experiential states revolving around yearnings for self love, intimacy in relationships as well as expressing social and spiritual messages. In all cases,aggression in the form of a harsh inner critic, an abuser or a killer was found as a threat in the background pointing to the need for more conscious contact with and integration of thatpower. The aim is to refocus that inner critic to \"kill off\" addiction rather than oneself. The results demonstrated very significant in-session client progress on a measure of health and improved contact with one's self through entering and unfolding the altered statethe person searches for (at least originally) with the help of a drug. One of the limitations of the study is the lack of follow- up measurements which makes it impossible to draw anyconclusions about how long this improved sense of well- being lasted. However, from psychotherapy process research we know that long-term outcomes build on small positivechanges in each therapy session. Last but not least, accessing the drug state in a sober manner is just one experiential intervention from a large toolbox of options. Not only are all of the various treatment modalities needed, I believe, but it is crucial to create innovative alternative methods in addiction treatment. To accomplish just that is the goal of the proposed study of the use of psilocybin-assistedpsychotherapy in the treatment of addiction. To test the effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of addiction with state of the art methodology isthe dream that drives the project.

Erowid has been providing exper-tise and work developing and coordinatingconstruction of an online MDMA Referencelibrary and we've just begun working ondoing a similar project with the AlbertHofmann Foundation's LSD and PsilocybinLibrary. MDMA Reference Project We've been working with MAPS over the last eight monthsto produce a comprehensive MDMA Reference Database aspart of MAPS' larger project of facilitating research into thepotential therapeutic benefits of MDMA and an FDA Investi-gative New Drug (IND) application. We completed the first draft of the MDMA ReferenceDatabase project at the end of January, 2001, but there werea number of loose ends (including missing articles, typos, anderrors) which we have been working to clear up during March& April. With help from several volunteers, we are hoping tohave each entry verified and some of the difficult-to-findpapers added by the end of April 2001. There will be additional follow up work as we developbetter collaborative tools, improve the search capabilities andinterface, continue to seek out the missing entries, and keepthe collection up to date.Albert Hofmann Foundation Library In 1996, the Albert Hofmann Foundation (AHF) receivedAlbert Hofmann's collection of articles about LSD and Psilocy-bin. MAPS has been working for the past several years tocreate an online bibliography of the articles contained in thisvast collection. In March, Erowid joined the project in order toevaluate whether the full texts from the collection can bedigitized and included in an online database. Some of thecore goals of the Albert Hofmann Foundation include pre-serving the early research, making it publicly accessible, andserving the interests of scholarly research. It has become clearthat the best way to further those goals is to archive the workdigitally and provide public access to it. In the middle of March, four of us (Fire, Earth, Eric Ondler,and Michael Greene), spent a weekend in LA researching theAlbert Hofmann Foundation's collection. Our goals were toget an understanding of the current state of the materials,determine whether it would be possible to digitize some or allof the collection, and outline the steps, costs, and timenecessary to complete the project. The weekend was very successful. The AHF collectionconsists of 79 binders packed with copies of more than 4,000journal articles, academic theses and miscellaneous writingson LSD; and 9 similar binders related to Psilocybin. The articles(over 20,000 pages worth!) seem to have been collected bySandoz as a working reference library and don't appear toinclude any personal notes. With the exception of a dozen orso unique items, such as Sandoz Pharmaceuticals' shippingmanifests and internal memos, most of the articles wouldtheoretically be available through a high quality universitylibrary. The collection itself appears to have been put together as aworking reference library. The bulk of the collection is heldinto books with cellophane tape that is no longer sticky.Because of this original binding method many of the articlesand papers have also begun to degrade. After spending a day carefully going through the collectionand consulting with Myron Stolaroff and other AHF mem-bers, it became clear that the primary value of the collection isin the information it contains and the research it represents.We made the decision to move ahead with plans to preservethe information by detaching the remaining tape, puttingeach article in its own plastic sleeve, then scanning anddigitizing all of the articles that can easily be processed. Asmall number of the 'articles' are actually bound theses orbooklets which will require evaluation on a case-by-casebasis. The first step in the process of creating a fully digitized,searchable database of these articles is to create a system forentering the references and verifying that the entries alreadyin the MAPS / AHF Bibliography are correct. We've gotten asmall start on this first step and should be ableto have some more hands dig into the project in May. Overthe summer, we're expecting to be able to coordinate volun-teers to get the first stage of the project complete and get alarge majority of the articles scanned and sleeved. The enddate for having the entire collection available online,searchable, and viewable will hopefully be sometime in thelast quarter of 2001. We're looking forward to having this amazing resourceavailable to the world.20 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 Medical marijuana patients may be able to protect themselves from harmful toxins in marijuana smoke by inhaling their medicine using an electric vaporizer, according to initial results of a study by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and California NORML. Research expenditures to date are roughly $50,000. The study showed that it is possible to vaporize medically active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by heating marijuana to a temperature short of the point of combustion, thereby eliminating or substantially reducing potentially harmful smoke toxins that are normallypresent in marijuana smoke. Vaporizers may therefore substantially reduce what is widely regarded as the leading health concern associated with marijuana, namely respiratory harm due to smoking. In addition, many medical marijuana patients say they prefer vaporizersbecause they deliver smoother, less irritating medication. MAPS and NORML sponsored the study in the hopes of helping medical marijuana patients and others reduce the health risks of smoking marijuana. A major obstacle to approval of natural cannabis by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 1999 report, \"Marijuana and Medicine,\" was that smoking is an \"unhealthy\" delivery method. The IOM report failed to notethe possibility of vaporization. The MAPS-NORML study tested a device called the M1 Volatizer(R), an aromatherapy vaporizer developed by Alternative Delivery Systems, Inc. It consisted of an electric heatingelement in a chamber that radiates heat downwards over a sample of marijuana contained in a standard bowl. Output from the vaporizer was analyzed and compared to smoke produced by burning the sample. The vaporizer produced THC at a temperature of 200 C. (392 F.) while completely eliminating three measured toxins - benzene, a known carcinogen, plus toluene and naphtha- lene. Temperatures of around 200 C. appear to be most efficient for vaporization. The potencyof the cannabis in the study was on the order of 10% - 12%. Significant amounts of THC (around 5%-6%) begin to be released at 180 C., with slightly more (7% or 8%) at 200 C. Carbon monoxide and smoke tars were both qualitatively reduced by the vaporizer, but additionaltesting is needed to quantify the extent of the decrease. The vaporizer study was undertaken as a follow-up to a previous MAPS-NORML marijuana smoking device study, which concluded that vaporizers offered the best prospectsfor smoke harm reduction: www.maps.org/news-letters/v06n3/06359mj1.html MAPS and NORML are currently seeking support for further research and development of vaporizers. Research is presently underway to explore the optimal temperature andconditions for vaporization. An additional $85,000 is needed to provide accurate measure- ment of carbon monoxide and other toxins, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Further studies may be needed to explore alternative device designs and the effects of differentconsistencies, potencies and preparation methods of the samples of marijuana.MAPS/NORML Study Shows Vaporizers Reduce Toxins in Marijuana Smoke Gieringer, Ph.D. NORML California State Coordinator (canorml@igc.apc.org) \"...vaporizers offered the best prospects for smoke harm reduction.\"m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 121 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1MAPS: Missoula Chronic Cannabis Use Research Study By Ethan Russo, M.D. (erusso@mtneuro.com) MAPS is pleased to announce that funding has been secured for the Missoula Chronic Cannabis Use ResearchStudy. This research project will examine the overall health status of six of the eight surviving federally-supplied medical marijuana patients. These patients receive their medication incanisters containing 300 cigarettes of regulated and feder- ally-grown medical marijuana on a regular basis, according to their FDA-approved protocols. Patients receive their medicine from the \"Compas- sionate Use\" Program of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) under the medical supervision of their InvestigationalNew Drug (IND) study physician. The Compassionate Use Program was closed by NIDA in 1992 to any new patients beyond the first fifteen (seven are now deceased). Despite the obvious opportunity to generate data on the use of cannabis by these patients, and its possible sequelae, neither NIDA, other branches of the NationalInstitutes of Health, nor the FDA has ever attempted to collect or analyze information from this cohort. The Missoula Chronic Cannabis Use Study provides a unique and important oppor-tunity to amass and analyze the long-term effects of cannabis on patients who have used a known dosage of standardized, heat-sterilized quality-controlled supply of low-grade medi- cal marijuana for 8-22 years. Six of the eight remaining legal patients have agreed to participate in this study. Two prefer toretain anonymity. Each study patient will undergo the following tests: Pulmonary function tests Chest X-ray, P-A & lateral Hormone and (EEG) P300 testing (a computerized EEG test of memory) Neurological examination The study is being conducted in an effort to further scrutinize federal claims that the harmful sequelae of the chronic use of smoked cannabis for therapeutic purposes are far worse than the benefit derived. The proposed study will be conducted at St. Patrick Hospital and the offices of Montana Neurobehavioral Special- ists, Missoula, Montana. Institutional Review Board (IRB)approval for the study has been obtained. The study will be co-conducted by Ethan Russo, MD, and Mary Lynn Mathre, RN. The essence of the study is to evaluate the functionalcondition of these chronic cannabis patients. All physiological systems will be probed to some degree but concentration will be on pulmonary and neurological functions. Three subjectswere fully evaluated from May 3 - May 6, 2001.MAPS has pledged $10,000 to this study, as has a private donor, while the Zimmer Family Foundation haspledged $1050. The results of the study are to be distributed as widely as possible. Data will be presented at the Interna- tional Cannabinoid Research Society meeting in Madrid,Spain, in June 2001, and at the Second National Clinical Conference on Cannabis Therapeutics to be held in Portland, Oregon, in the spring of 2002. A full report of the results will be published in the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics . Articles on the study will also be submitted to peer-reviewed journals of wide circula-tion. This is designed as a one-time study. Replication is possible at a future time if the need or advisability of suchreplication is deemed appropriate, and if the patients agreeto participate. When completed this study can serve as abaseline for future comparisons. Key Operating Personnel Primary Investigators: Ethan B.

There were no studies in humans. Two otherstudies in rats or mice showed interaction of THC with nicotine and opiates, but these animalswere given a THC-per-weight dose approximately 1000 times that of primates, so the modelsmust be viewed with that massive dose in mind, and thus are not reviewed in this report. The primate study, funded by the U.S. National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) and carried out by S.R. Goldberg, P. Munzar, and G. Tandra, was entitled \"Self administration the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana insquirrel monkeys.\" It should be noted that the lead author, Dr. Goldberg, works at thePreclinical Pharmacology Section of NIDA in Baltimore, MD. Dr. Goldberg was present at thereport at a poster session presentation on Sunday, November 5, and responded to my questionsand provided a copy of the poster. The Study In essence, a small number of squirrel monkeys (the number is not specified in the poster, but4 animals are identified in graph labels) were first taught to self-administer intravenous cocaineby pressing a lever when a light came on (a fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule). This step wasnecessary because numerous attempts over the past 30 years to get any animal to self-administer THC have been unsuccessful. Training occurred in one-hour experimental \"sessions\"conducted daily on weekdays. Once accustomed to getting the cocaine, this response was\"extincted\" by not giving the cocaine after the lever press until the monkeys only pressed thelever a tenth as much as when the cocaine was given. Just how long this extinction took is notreported, but it was more than 3 sessions, according to graphical data. Then THC dosesreportedly comparable to that received by smoking a reasonable amount of marijuana (1 to 8micrograms per kg, I.V.) were given in response to a lever press, using a second-orderreinforcement protocol. The monkeys quickly learned over 1 to 3 sessions to press the lever toget this \"reward.\" In short, they seemed to like the effects, at least up to a point. Carefulobservation of the graphical data indicated that up to 4 ug/kg per dose, the animals pressed thelever more frequently. At 8 ug/kg doses, however, there was a distinct and highly significantreduction in lever presses to the level of half that found with 4 ug/kg. No explanation was givenfor this finding, and it was not mentioned in the study results or conclusions. The experimentalso included sessions after pre-administration of SR141716A, a drug which seems to block theeffects of THC, but not cocaine. On this regimen, the monkeys reduced their lever pressings tothe extinction point in three days, recovering the lever press frequency to THC 2 to 3 sessionsafter the blocking agent was stopped. No effect of SR141716A was seen in sessions wherecocaine was the test drug.A Report from The Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting - New Orleans, LA, Nov. 4-8, 2000 A Critique of a Controversial Study on THCEffects in Primates by James Stewart Campbell, M.D. (jimcampbell@ieee.org) \"a small number of squirrel monkeys ...were first taught to self-administer intravenous cocaine.\"23 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1Official Study Conclusions The six conclusions reached by the study authors were as follows: 1) \"The active principle in cannabis, THC, possesses strong reinforcingproperties in experimental animals, inthis case, non-human primates, as itdoes in human subjects.\" 2) \"The findings further suggest that marijuana has as much potential forabuse as other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and heroin.\" 3) \"The selective reduction of THC but not cocaine self- administration by SR141716A indicates that this abusepotential is likely mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptors inthe brain. \" 4) \"THC self-administration by squirrel monkeys was ob- tained using a range of doses in agreement with the totalintake and the single doses self-administered by humanssmoking marijuana cigarettes.\" 5) \"The recent discovery of new therapeutic actions of marijuana has increased public debate on the legalization ofsmoked marijuana as a medication. The present findings ofpersistent, reliable self-administration behavior withmarijuana's psychoactive ingredient, THC, should help tobetter inform this debate.\" 6) \"This methodology provides an exciting opportunity to study neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying mari-juana abuse and to develop drugs possessing therapeuticefficacy similar to or better than marijuana or THC but lackingthe potential for abuse.\" The Conclusions as Seen by This Observer (JSC) The above six conclusions as rewritten after careful study of the poster: 1) Once cage-raised, chair-restrained squirrel monkeys are habituated to self-administering intravenous of entry\", they tend to self-administer intravenous THCunder similar conditions. Any extension of thisconclusion to non-primates, or other primates,including humans, cannot be made by thisstudy. 2) No conclusion as to the abuse potential of THC in squirrel monkeys or any other species can be drawn from this limitedstudy. However, the finding that higher doses of THC reducethe self-administration rate in these monkeys self-limiting \"ceiling\" to the self-administration ofTHC species. 3) blocks the self-administration THC insquirrel monkeys previously habituated to cocaine self-ad- ministration. Where and how this actiontakes place cannot be drawn from thisstudy. 4) Intravenous THC self-administration by squirrel monkeys habituated to cocaineseems to occur only at a dosage rangesimilar to the dosage range of respiratoryself-administration of THC-containingsmoke in humans. 5) The present limited findings of self- administration behavior with marijuana's psychoactive ingre-dient, THC, may prove to be valuable concerning publicdebate on the legalization of smoked marijuana as a medica-tion. But these findings should not be unduly extended oreven be found to be reliable until verified in independentlaboratory experiments. 6) This methodology may provide an opportunity to study neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying marijuanaself-administration by cage-raised monkeys and to screendrugs possessing therapeutic efficacy similar to or better thanmarijuana or THC but lacking the potential for self-adminis-tration by these monkeys. Discussion This particular study is important in that it shows howstrongly the sponsor of a scientific study affects the conclu-sions drawn from the work. In this case, Drs. Goldberg, et. al,performed a fairly rigorous scientific investigation, then ap-parently embellished the report to satisfy NIDA official policy.This bias is shown from the first sentence of the poster, whichreads: \"Marijuana is among the most abused illicit drugs inthe world.\" Note the NIDA-inspired keywords - \"abused,\"\"illicit,\" and even \"drugs.\" The authors simply could not write\"Marijuana is among the most used psychoactive agents inthe world\" without putting their funding, careers, and liveli-hood in jeopardy. This is the cloud under which NIDAscientists must function if they are to survive. When I broughtthis up to Dr. Goldberg at the meeting, he at first denied thathe could lose his job because he was tenured. But he did notdeny that he worked independently of outside influence.After all, tenure means little today when administrators can assign you to a small windowless office in the basement and deny funding for your work. Accordingly, the authors' conclusions are grossly tainted by this bias, as exampled by the two comparative sets ofconclusions shown above. Extending the \"strong reinforcingproperties\" of cannabis to humans in the first conclusion is anexample. There weren't any humans in the study! How canthis then be a scientific conclusion? What has been shown in\"Once cage-raised, chair- restrained squirrel monkeys are habituated to self-ad- ministering intravenous cocaine as a 'drug of to self-administer intravenous THC under similar conditions.\" \"...it shows how strongly the sponsor of a scientific study affects the conclusions drawn from the work.\"24 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1the study is that a handful of chronically bored and possibly depressed cage-raised and restrained squirrel monkeys thathave been specially taught to self-administer IV cocaine willalso self-administer IV THC . This is the first time any animal has been taught to self-administer THC under any conditions. To extend this very limited result to include human behavior isgrossly unscientific. Furthermore, any researcher worth his grant money should have noticed the ceiling effect of reasonable THC doses inthese monkeys. These captive and drug-trained monkeysliked THC, but only in a very limited way. Why did they reducelever pressing at the higher dose of THC? Were they \"stoned\"and passive or drifting off? This is not mentioned in theposter. Perhaps this is the well-known ceiling effect of THC(seen in humans) that was not recognized as a worthwhilefinding, as it indicates that THC self-administration has intrin-sic limits that are far short of the toxic dose of THC. But why labor over the \"NIDA-Speak\" in the study poster at all? One seasoned neurophysiologist remarked that healways ignores the obvious propaganda-laced conclusions,and goes right to the graphs and technical data to find whatreally occurred in NIDA studies. That may be fine if one is aneuroscientist, but politicians may read only the conclusionsand rush to legislate public policy with drastic results. Indeed,Dr. Goldberg proudly told me that the conclusions of thisstudy had already been influential in the recent British debatein parliament where the conservatives had insisted on draco-nian penalties for simple marijuana possession. The \"addic-tive\" properties of THC shown by this study had been one ofthe main arguments for the increased penalties. In conclusion, this interesting and provocative study in- cludes some well carried out primate research into THC use,but the scientific data are sullied by untenable \"conclusions\"consisting almost entirely of NIDA propaganda. Discussion ofthis state of affairs brought out an appropriate quote from aRussian Neurophysiologist at the Meeting: \"The Americanapproach to the drug problem is like a doctor who treats acough with a strong laxative. The treatment may stop thecough for a while, but it does nothing for the underlyingproblem.\"Response toCritique of THCStudy By Dr. Steven Goldberg (sg97r@nih.gov) I do appreciate the opportunity to review the critique by Dr. Campbell. There are inaccuracies and problems of inter-pretation in the critique, which I should note. The majorfindings in this poster were published in a leading peer-reviewed journal, Nature Neuroscience , the month of the Neuroscience Meeting (2000, volume 3, pages 1073-1074).It was a press release by Nature Neuroscience about the article that resulted in public debate in Great Britain just before theMeeting. As Dr. Campbell suggests, these findings should not be \"unduly extended\" and, of course, need to be replicated by independent laboratoryexperiments, but our re-search does provide pre-clinical evidence of whathas long been clear fromclinical experience, thatmarijuana has abuse po-tential like other abuseddrugs and is a potentialmedical problem. The prin-cipal guide for the medicalcommunity in diagnosingpsychiatric disorders is the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-4, 2000) published by the American Psychiatric Association. It clearly describes marijuana (can-nabis) as an abused drug capable of producing dependenceand intoxication (pages 236 to 242). Marijuana is indeedillegal in the United States, Great Britain and much of the restof the world. When I am writing about caffeine, I do refer toit being the most used psychoactive agent in the world, butmarijuana is not caffeine and it is illegal. Finally, the presence of a \"ceiling effect\" as the injection dose of THC was increased in our self-administration studies isexactly the same effect seen with other abused drugs such ascocaine or heroin under the same conditions. It is commonlyreferred to as an inverted u-shaped dose-response curve.However, the presence of an inverted u-shaped dose-re-sponse curve under controlled experimental conditions doesnot mean that a drug such as cocaine or heroine (or THC inmarijuana) is free of toxicity and safe for human consump-tion. \"...our research does provide preclinical evidence of what has long been clear from clinical experience, that marijuana has abuse potential like other abused drugs...\" \"He always ignores the obvious propaganda-laced conclusions, and goes right to the graphs and technical data to find what really occurred in NIDA studies.\"25 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 Abstract Introduction Pharmacology Ayahuasca is a beverage extracted from plants in the Amazonian rain forest. By boiling the bark of the vine Banisteriopsis caapi with the leaves of the plant Psychotria viridis a psychoactive brew is made. short-ac ting psychoactive agent dimethyltryptamine has a structural similarity to serotonin. When DMT binds to neuronal receptors in the brain it causes changes in cognition and state of consciousness. However, DMT is orally active only in the presence of MAO inhibitors, such as the beta-carbolines of the Banesteriopsis bark. Thus, the interaction between the DMT andbeta-carbolines is the basis of the psychoactivity of ayahuasca (McKenna et al., 1984). Ayahuasca has a long history of safe and beneficial use for spiritual and healing purposes among large numbers of indigenous people in South America (Metzner, R., 1999). Only recently has Western science become interested in studyingayahuasca scientifically. In 1993, the Hoasca Project, a multinational, biomedical study of the ayahuasca tea, took place in th e Brazilian Amazon Basin and the tea's pharmacological, physiological and psychological effects on humans were studied (McKenna, D.J. et al., 1998; Callaway, J.C., et al., 1999; Grob, and Silveira Tea, Ayahuasca, on the Electroencephalographic (EEG) Activity of the Human Brain During a Shamanistic Ritual EEG data from 12 volunteers participating in a workshop in Brazil were recorded under field conditions before and after a shamanistic ritual inwhich the psychoactive tea, ayahuasca , was consumed. Following three doses of the tea, the subjects showed strong and statistically significantincreases of both EEG alpha (8-13Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) meanamplitudes compared to baseline while beta (13-20Hz) amplitudes wereunchanged. The strongest increases of alpha activity were observed inthe occipital lobes while alpha was unchanged in the frontal lobes. Thetaamplitudes, on the other hand, were significantly increased in bothoccipital and frontal areas. Our data do not support previous findings ofcortical activation with decreased alpha and increased beta activitycaused by psychedelics (e.g. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin). They ratherpoint to a similarity between the altered states produced by ayahuascaand marihuana which also stimulates the brain to produce more alphawaves. We suggest that these findings of increased EEG alpha and thetaactivity after drinking ayahuasca reflect an altered state of consciousness.In this state the subjects reported increased awareness of theirsubconscious processes. This is an altered state comparable to, howevermore profound than, the meditative state. Our results suggest thatingesting Ayahuasca may provide individuals with increased access tosubconscious processes and feelings while in a wakeful, relaxed state.Thus, Ayahuasca has the potential to become a potent tool in the processof psychotherapy.26 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1Electroencephalography (EEG) There is general consensus that rhythmical waves recorded from the surface of the scalp (the EEG) are summed synapticpotentials generated by the pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. The EEG represents responses of cortical neurons to rhythmic discharges from the thalamus. The frequency andamplitude of the EEG are determined by a complex arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory interconnections within the thalamus itself and between the thalamus and thecerebral cortex. The spontaneous fluctuations of the brain electrical activity (EEG), picked up on the scalp surface by electrodes, vary from moment to moment in both amplitude(voltage) and frequency (cycles per second). In order to interpret this complex signal, quantification, usually by a computer, is necessary. The Quantitative EEG (qEEG) In order to assess the effects of a substance on brain functions, the quantitative EEG (qEEG) is useful. Usually mean amplitude or power within the major frequency bands iscomputed. Other variables such as right/left amplitude ratios and phase coherence between pairs of symmetrical EEG signals may be calculated. Ample evidence suggests that theqEEG is a valid measure of the functional state of the brain. Research has shown that there is a direct correlation between a person's level of conscious attention and his brain wavefrequency. During the unconscious state of deep sleep, high amplitude, slow delta waves (0.5-4Hz) predominate the EEG. state sleep(the drowsy, hypnagogic state) theta waves (4-8Hz) tend to prevail. During the awake, mentally relaxed state with eyes closed, alpha waves (8-13Hz) predominate the EEG in most people while the fast beta waves (13-30Hz), normally with smaller amplitudes, are observed during aroused,hyperattentive states of consciousness (Fig. 1). Thus, the qEEG method can determine whether a person is conscious (alpha and beta waves), subconscious (theta waves)or unconscious (delta waves). The general rule is that the lower the EEG frequency the more unconscious the individual. EEG research of psychedelics The majority of EEG studies done on psychedelics appearedin the scientific journals some 30 years ago, before these compounds were banned. Wikler (1954), Itil (1968) and Fink (1978) are all in agreement that psychedelics, regardless ofthe substance (LSD, mescaline, psilocybin), produce decreases in slow wave (alpha and theta) activity together with increases of fast (beta) activity. This low amplitude, desynchronizedEEG pattern induced by psychedelics reflects an activation of the brain and is in opposition to the highly synchronized alpha pattern observed during deep relaxation. Fink (1978) foundthat regardless of the nature of the drug administered, EEG synchronization (alpha/theta waves) was associated with euphoria, relaxation, and drowsiness; while EEGdesynchronization was associated with anxiety, hallucinations, fantasies, and illusions. Don et al. (1998) found an increase of high frequency beta ('40Hz') with nosignificant change of alpha and theta activity in the EEG following the ingestion of ayahuasca. All the above studies indicate that most psychedelic compounds tend to suppresslow EEG frequency activity (alpha and theta) and enhance beta activity reflecting an activation of the brain. However, other psychedelic-like compounds such as marihuana andMDMA (ecstasy) seem to have the opposite effect and increase alpha activity. In a recent, controlled placebo study, an increase of EEG alpha power, correlating with intenseeuphoria, was found after smoking marihuana (Lukas, et al., 1995). Long-term effects of the use of psychedelics, using qEEGmonitoring, have rarely been studied. However, in a recent study of 23 recreational MDMA users, Dafters et al. (1999) found that the use of MDMA was positively correlated withabsolute power in the alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-20Hz) frequency bands. These findings were supported recently in another study by Gamma et al. (2000) who found globalincreases of theta, alpha and beta power in a group of regular MDMA users compared to a control group. Consciousness expanding properties of ayahuasca The main psychoactive agent in ayahuasca (Psychotria viridis) is the short-acting compound dimethyltryptamine(DMT). The only published study of the qEEG effects of DMT was done on mice with implanted electrodes (Morley BJ, Bradley RJ, 1977). These authors found a dose-dependent hypersynchrony with increased power in the low frequency (delta/theta) range following the ingestion of DMT. DMT, when applied intravenously in humans, almost instantaneously elicits visual hallucinations, bodily dissociations and extreme shifts in mood (Strassman et al.,1994). It is the mind-altering properties of ayahuasca which have been used for healing and spiritual purposes in shamanic ayahuasca rituals by indigenous people throughout SouthAmerica for maybe a thousand years (Metzner, R. et al, 1999). In many respects, the changes in consciousness induced by drinking ayahuasca are comparable to other states of deeprelaxation and increased subconscious awareness, such as the meditative, the hypnotic and the hypnagogic states which are all characterized by increased theta activity in the EEG (Hoffmann E., 1998; Ray WJ, 1997; Budzynski TH, 1986). Thus we expected to see increased theta and possibly increased alpha activity following the intake ofayahuasca. Materials and Methods Subjects Subjects were twelve normal volunteers, mostlyEuropeans, who attended a workshop of four ayahuasca rituals in Brazil, organized by an experienced Ayahuasceros, a native healer (YSB), working already for years with ayahuasca.Subjects included nine men and three women between the age of 29 and 59 years (mean = 44.7 years). Two subjects had never taken ayahuasca before while the remaining ten had Figure 1. States of Consciousness with Corresponding EEG Frequencies27 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1attended 12 to over a 100 ayahuasca rituals before. Most of the subjects had taken psychedelics as well as other drugsbefore (Table 1). Table 1. Demographic data of the subjects In order to screen for psychiatric symptoms, the subjects initially underwent a psychiatric interview and ratedthemselves on the SCL-90 Symptoms Checklist. All subjects had scores within the normal range. All volunteers signed an extensive Informed Consent Form explaining the effects andside effects of ayahuasca, as well as the EEG recording procedure. It should be noted, however, that the intention of the volunteers was to experience drinking ayahuasca underthe guidance of (YSB). The monitoring of the qEEG was the scientific part of the workshop; the workshop was explicitly not organized to monitor the qEEG. The EEG data reported here were all collected under field conditions, in the middle of the Brazilian jungle, using batteries as the power source for the equipment. Baseline EEGrecordings were done, together with the psychological testing, in the village of Alto Paraiso, north of the capital Brasilia. The rituals were held a few days later in a remote area,only accessible by foot.Administration of ayahuasca EEG recordings were done at two separate rituals led byYSB according to methods developed within the ethno- psychopharmacological society 'Friends of the Forest' in the Netherlands and based on Brazilian shamanistic tradition.Three doses of ayahuasca, 75 ml in total, were administered during the ritual with intervals of 1-1 1/2 hours. EEGs were taken one to two hours following thethird dose of ayahuasca, 4-6 hours after the first dose. At this point all subjects appeared to be experiencing an altered state of consciousness. EEG equipment and electrodes The PCEEG8 1, an eight channel EEG brainmapping instrument from Khepri Electronics, was used for data acquisition. This battery-operated portable unit, which weighs only 8 ounces, works with a laptop PC and is very suitable for field work. Using 128 samples per second, 12 bit A/D conversion, eight channels of EEG and one channel of EMG are fed, via fiber optic transmission cable, to the serial port of a Pentium 233, PC laptop. The signals are simultaneously stored on a disk and displayed on the computer screen. Later, data may be replayed from the hard disk, edited for artefacts, and analyzed for frequency, amplitude and a number of statistical parameters. We used bipolar scalp recordings from eight different electrode locations using the international 10/20 system. Gold- plated electrodes were fastened to the subject's head with elastic head bands, and EEG signals were obtained from right and left the top of the head as a common reference. Data collection, editing and analysis Baseline recordings were done in a hotel room in the village of Alto Paraiso. The subjects laid down on a couch withclosed eyes while their EEGs were recorded. Following a few minutes of rest, approximately 200 seconds of EEG signals were stored on disk for later analysis. A few days later all the subjects had their EEGs recorded again during two separate ayahuasca rituals in the jungle. By the end of the ritual most people were lying down quietlyabsorbed in their inner subjective experiences. In order not to disturb the subjects and interfere with their state of consciousness, we did not want to take them to an adjacentroom for the EEG measurements but decided to do the recordings in the very same spot in the Zendo (meditation hall) where they had been sitting or lying during the ritual.They did not even have to get up from their mattresses for the EEG. Thus we expected them to remain in an altered state of consciousness throughout the recordings. During themeasurements the subjects were lying flat on their backs with closed eyes. The room was relatively quiet at that point, and all subjects seemed to be deeply relaxed and absorbed in

the experiment none of the volunteers had any physical complaints. One male subject described himself as afirst-class junkie, but refrained from drug-use, apart from mari- huana and ayahuasca, since he started using ayahuasca in ritual settings. A second male subject suffered from decompensatiocordis and used prescription medication (digoxine, enalapril, and a diuretic). There was one male subject with a complicated psychiatric history, suffering from depressive symptoms in thepast and was treated with serotonin uptake inhibitors. Most volunteers had a higher education or university degrees (law, medicine, psychology).28 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1inner experiences. Thus, very few muscle and eye movement artefacts were observed in the recordings. Also electrical noise interference with the recordings was at a minimum since allour equipment was battery operated. After the rituals the EEG records were replayed, inspected visually, and edited for eye/head movements and muscletension artefacts. Power spectral analyses were done of at least 100 seconds of artefact-free EEG epochs. For each of the 8 scalp sites, the mean amplitude in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha(8-13Hz), and beta (13-20Hz) frequency bands were computed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Since it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between delta wavesand eye movement artefacts, we chose not to analyse delta (0.5-4Hz) frequencies in order to avoid misinterpretations. Results To assess the effects of ayahuasca on the resting EEG, mean theta, alpha and beta amplitudes following the ritual were compared to baseline values. Because the data could not be considered normally distributed, a non-parametricstatistical test, the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks, two-tailed test, was used for comparative analysis. We found considerable and statistically significant increases(p<.01 or p<.05) of mean alpha amplitudes after ayahuasca for the O1, O2 and T6 locations. For the left occipital lobe the increase of the group mean was an impressive 120%,statistically significant at p<0.01. Smaller but statistically significant increases of mean theta amplitudes were found at F7, F8, T3, T5, O1 and O2 locations. Eleven out of 12 subjectsshowed substantial increases of theta activity. Thus, increases of alpha amplitudes were seen primarily in the occipital regions of the brain and in the left post-temporal area, while increases of theta amplitudes were observed in all parts of the brain, except for the right temporal and post-temporal areas.Only one subject who initially had a low amplitude, inhibited EEG with virtually no alpha, showed almost no changes of his EEG under the influence of ayahuasca. Discussion We found large and statistically significant increases ofboth EEG alpha and theta mean amplitudes in a group of normal subjects following three doses of ayahuasca in a shamanistic ritual setting. To our knowledge this is the firststudy to demonstrate such profound EEG changes after the intake of ayahuasca. The only other published EEG study of ayahuasca (Don et al., 1998) found statistically significantincreases only of high frequency (36-44Hz) beta, following the intake of ayahuasca. It's important to notice that these authors did their EEG recordings after only one dose ofayahuasca while we did our recordings following three doses of the tea. Also Don and collaborators took their subjects out of the ritual context to an adjacent room for EEG recordingsand thus may have interfered with their altered states of consciousness. In addition, Don et al. found a trend toward decreases of alpha and theta power and an increase of 14-30Hz beta power. Thus, their subjects showed a somewhat activated EEG pattern which could be due to some apprehension following the intake of ayahuasca. On thecontrary, our findings of increased alpha and theta amplitudes and unchanged beta activity point to the fact that our subjects were extremely relaxed and in an altered state ofconsciousness during the EEG recordings by the end of the ritual. This was also confirmed by the subjects during questioning after the recordings. One may speculate that the increase of theta waves during the ritual was due to drowsiness in the subjects. Theta waves tend to prevail in the EEG during drowsiness and light sleep,while alpha waves usually decrease. Alpha waves are indicators of conscious attention, and since nearly all of our subjects exhibited very high alpha levels during the recordingsthey could hardly be asleep or even drowsy. All subjects also stated afterwards that they had not been asleep but had been consciously absorbed in their inner subjective experiences. Ayahuasca is thought by indigenous people to give the individual access to unconscious, spiritual and transpersonal realms of experience. The psychological state induced byayahuasca can be compared to other altered states of heightened unconscious activity such as meditation, hypnosis, etc. A number of studies have shown that thepresence of theta waves in the EEG reflects subconscious activity, and people with increased EEG theta levels usually have better access to their subconscious feelings, imageryand memories (Green E. & Green A., 1977; Budzynski, T.H., 1986; Cowan, J., 1993; White, N.E., 1999). During states of increased awareness of subconscious activity (e.g.meditation, hypnotic trance, hypnagogic imagery) theta activity usually increases considerably. The presence of alpha waves in these states is important since they reflect consciousattention. If alpha amplitudes drop down it is a sign that the individual is losing consciousness. This is what happens when a person falls asleep. Budzynski (1986) says \"In contrast to the waking or deep sleep states, there is a very special state of light sleep. Identified by an EEG pattern of theta frequencies (4-7Hz), this transitory condition has been referred to as the reverie state, the fringe ofconsciousness, the pre-conscious, and the twilight state.... During this rather brief period ... people often experience emergent, hallucinatory, dreamlike experiences that are moredisjointed and brief than those dreams associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep... A number of illustrious individuals from the fields of science, music, literature and arthave credited the imagery produced during the twilight state for creative solutions or inspiring thoughts.\" (Budzynski, 1986, pp. 429-30). Ayahuasca seems to induce and expand the hypnagogic or twilight state (correlated with an increase of theta) and at the same time keeps the individual awake and conscious(correlated with an increase of alpha). These EEG changes are exactly the same as during deep meditation (Hoffmann, E. 1998). Thus, in some respects the ayahuasca-altered state iscomparable to meditation and it is quite conceivable that ayahuasca facilitates meditation. In an altered state of increased EEG theta and alpha activity the individual exhibits greater susceptibility and better conscious access to his unconscious realms of experience without interference from his critical, analytical mind which issilenced. This is exactly what happens in hypnosis and, we believe, during the altered state of consciousness induced by ayahuasca. However, in this latter state the individual is his\"The psychological state induced by ayahuasca can be compared to other altered states.\"29 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1own hypnotist and therapist. He may have new profound insights into his own behavior patterns and may learn to integrate previously unconscious material at a higher level ofconsciousness. In neurological terms the individual learns to raise, for example, emotional conflicts from a limbic to a neocortical level where the problems can be processed,understood and integrated. These speculations are supported by extensive studies of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy done in Russia. Ketamine isan anaesthetic used in surgery which in small doses induces a profound psychedelic experience lasting for about an hour. Krupitsky and Grinenko (1998) reported a 3-4 fold increase oftheta activity in all regions of the cortex following the ingestion of ketamine. These authors suggest that their findings of increased theta are \"... evidence of limbic systemactivation during ketamine sessions, as well as evidence for the reinforcement of the limbic-cortex interaction. This fact can also be considered to a certain extent to be indirectevidence for the strengthening of the interactions between the conscious and subconscious levels of the mind during the KPT (Ketamine Psychedelic Therapy)\", (Ibid.p. 60). Our data do not support previous findings of cortical activation withdecreased alpha and increased beta activity caused by psychedelics such as LSD, mescaline and psilocybin(Wikler A, 1954; Itil TM, 1968; the hypothesis withincreased frontocortical activation (Vollenweider F.X., 1998) in psychedelic states be supported. The only significant EEG change we found in the frontal lobes was an increase oftheta waves reflecting a state of deep relaxation and reverie. Thus, ayahuasca seems to have different effects on brain functions than the traditionalpsychedelics (LSD, mescaline, psilocybin). Our findings rather point to a similarity between the altered states produced by ayahuasca and marihuana which both appear to stimulatethe brain to produce more alpha waves (Fink M, 1976, Lukas et al., 1995). Ayahuasca has a long history of use for healing andspiritual purposes in shamanistic rituals in South America (Metzner, R., 1999). Psychological long-term effects of ayahuasca have been investigated recently by Grob et al.,(1996) who compared a group of 15 long-term users with 15 controls with no prior use of ayahuasca. The assessment included psychiatric diagnostic interviews, personality andneuropsychological testing. The study reported considerable remission from certain psychopathology and substance abuse among the long-term users with no evidence of personality orcognitive disturbances. Overall assessment revealed a high functional status of ayahuasca users with no safety issues (Grob, C.S. et al., 1996; Grob C.S., 1999). If further studiessupport the notion that ayahuasca opens up people to their unconscious feelings and memories and gives them an opportunity to explore new psychological insights, ayahuascamight be used as a valuable adjunct to psychotherapy.References Budzynsky TH. 1986.

This sacred drink has beenused for millennia by over seventy indigenous groups in theUpper Amazon and Orinoco basin for healing, shamanicjourneys and divination. (Luna, 2000) It is also referred to asyage, caapi, daime, hoasca, natem, nishi, along with numer-ous other names. The purpose of this work is to report the medical healing experienced through the use of ayahuasca. It is qualitative research utilizing narratives and participant observation, tocollect the stories of five co-researchers plus myself. The datawas gathered through two visits to Mapia, Brazil, the centralhome to the Church of Santo Daime. The first journey was apreliminary three week visit in 1996, followed by a return andthree month stay at the beginning of 1999. All but one of thestories was collected in this environment. In each of the accounts, the co-researcher was suffering from either a terminal or chronic illness. In four instances, thepeople came to Santo Daime because they had exhausted allother options within the allopathic system, and could go nofurther in their healing process. Two of those were facingimminent death. For the other two participants, one chosenot to engage with the allopathic system beyond the point ofdiagnosis, and instead decided to work with ayahuasca fromthe beginning of the cancer. In the second instance, it was theSanto Daime that both showed the presence of the illnesses,and then facilitated the healing, which was validated throughthe biomedical system. This work explores concepts of healing; what it means and how it is achieved. It explores and expands the concept ofwhat creates disease. It is a record of the inner and outerjourney through illness that each person experienced usingayahuasca as the catalyzing agent for the curing that eachperson reported. It investigates the potential for healing thatdoes not currently exist in our allopathic system of medicinewhich \"presupposes the direct organic combat of disease andof its symptoms through a neutralizing, opposing agent\"(Groisman & Sell, 1995). Ayahuasca offers a potential tochange that paradigm, and to expand our current medicaloptions in treating terminal and chronic illness.31 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 nspiration is elusive. Innovation is hard. Demand for technical and conceptual breakthroughs in global business is intensifying. Organizations are looking everywhere for the transforming insight. Perhaps the best prescription for boosting corporate creativity would be a prescription. Think about it. Work-hard, play-hard executives seldom hesitate to go out for a few drinks to mull over a clever idea. In the right dose and in the right company, alcohol can reduce inhibitions and encourage unfettered debate. Even some teetotaling managers occasionally pop a Prozac to put themselves in a better mood to consider a business proposal. More conventionally, Fortune 1,000 companies commonly organize manager retreats and Outward Bound-like excursions explicitly designed to pump up the endorphins and promote an intensity of interaction that ordinarily wouldn't occur. It's awell-established business principle that changes of venue and changes in body chemistry frequently lead to refreshingchanges in corporate perspective. Why not the next logical step? Turn these everyday experiments in self-medication into more rigorously designed and disciplined initiatives for innovation. Think of such mediated medicated creativity as a form of creative managerial therapybest done under professional supervision. Picture the Leary-Huxley Institute for Creative Business Visualization on one of the sunnier islands near Crete. Psychopharmacologists and board-certified neuropsychologists dispense small, precise dosages of psychoactive materials tovisiting executive teams that want to push themselves beyond the boundaries of conventional business perception. The purpose would not be to get \"high\" but to enhance creativity. Skilled facilitators would ensure that the interactions focus on the business tasks at hand. At minimal medical risk, managers could discover what--if any--impact chemical stimulationmight have on their creative acumen. Perhaps a team of hedge fund managers might find investment inspiration in a myco-managed conversation in the hypothetical institute's Coleridge Room. Off in the Lennon Wing, fashion buyers and designers at a global clothing merchantcould brainstorm in profoundly different ways. At the newly refurbished De Quincey Pavilion, computational chemistry researchers from--ironically--one of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies could play with the asymmetrical geometries of a potentially therapeutic protein. As outrageous as such a scenario might sound, the reality is that drugs like Rogaine and Viagra have become billion-doll ar blockbusters even though their longer-term medicinal benefits remain in dispute. \"Dysfunctions\" of all kinds--physical, mental, emotional--have been medicalized. We don't think twice about prescribing statins for a man with a family history ofearly arteriosclerosis; we wouldn't think twice about prescribing a drug to prevent the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The low-risk chemical enhancement of creativity seems at least as worthy a medical objective as the chemical preservation of a head of hair. To the extent that market imperatives insist that individuals and institutions become ever more creative or fail, there wi ll be growing societal pressure to view psychoactive drugs as a kind of value-added Prozac--a pill to enhance creativity rather than mood. No one is shocked to hear of an \"artist\"--a pop musician, a painter, a photographer, a film director, a writer--whocredits experimentation with \"consciousness-expanding\" drugs as essential to her creative development. Indeed, global media conglomerates knowingly hire such people even as they disapprove of and disavow illegal drug use. Consider the public reception if a world-class hedge fund manager or software developer or derivatives designer openlyproclaimed that some of his best ideas came when he had had a little too much to drink, or when he had ingested a mushroom-laden meal in the Amazon, or when he had undertaken a therapy that required psychoactive drugs. Would we think less of such an innovator? If the art world is any indicator, the answer is an unambiguous no. And if that fund manager'speyote-driven portfolio consistently outperformed the market, even the most conservative investors would surely find a place in their hearts (and wallets) for the same answer. As long as the debate around such drugs revolves around indulgence, addiction, illegality, and excess, their use will beconcealed and constrained. But in a global economy, where different cultures have radically different standards about the medicinal and economic rationale for drug use, the odds are excellent that chemistry-driven creativity will cease to be a managerial taboo. Why? Because as long as it's legal and safe, managers will seek whatever creative competitive edge theycan find. Even if they have to find it in a pill.BRAVE NEW WORK IA Brave New Prescription for Creative Management: Perhaps the best prescription for boosting corporate creativity would be a prescription. By Michael Schrage (schrage@media.mit.edu), Fortune Editor's Note: The following article is about the possible use of psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs to stimulate business-oriented creativity. MAPS purchased the rights to reprint this article for $100 from Fortunemagazine, where the article originally appeared on April 30, 2001. MAPS is interested in funding the designand sponsoring a pilot study into psychedelics and creativity. Jeremy Tarcher has already donated $2,500 toMAPS to help with the design process of such a study. We need to complete the work on the MDMA/PTSDprotocol and get it submitted and approved by the FDA, then complete the work on the MDMA/cancer patientstudy and get it submitted to FDA. Then...perhaps in the fall, we can start in earnest on the design of acreativity study. This article from Fortune suggests that before long, this sort of research will become moresocially accepted, at least by the titans of business who read Fortune.32 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 Conference at Breitenbush Hot Springs, Dec. 7-10, 2000 By Ian Soutar 21234567890123456 From L to R: Ralph Metzner, Jonathan Ott, Rob Montgomery, Daniel Siebert, Kat Harrison, Dale Pendell, Breitenbush Staff, Bret B losser Salvia Divinorum (SD) is a member of the Sage family whose name means \"Sage of the Diviner\". The herb contains a very powerful visionary component called salvinorin-A.This diterpine substance attracted a lot of attention in the field of pharmacology in themid-nineties because it was not an alkaloid. Alkaloids are a chemical family which hasbeen regarded for a century or so as the only one likely to possess psychoactive members. During the past two years I have been carrying out research (funded by MAPS) to seewhether or not Salvia divinorum could enhance meditation when used in very low doses. (Editor's Note: See the MAPS Psychedelic Project List for details: http://www.maps.org/research/salvia/sdmeditation.html . See also Ian's article in the MAPS Bulletin, Vol. IX,#1, Spring 1999, page 36: http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n1/09136sou.html.) was invited by MAPS to attend the 3rd World Conference on Salvia divinorum at Breitenbush Hot Springs in Oregon, Dec. 7-10, 2000. I was delighted to go and report on the conference, especially since Breitenbush is one of my favorite holiday spots for healing and relaxation. The hot spring resort specializes in organically grown vegetarianmeals, yoga, and healing mineral pools. Breitenbush has been the center of environmental activism to preserve the Opal Creek watershed from logging. It is remotelylocated and there is no communication with the outside world beyond the radio channels available through the office for emergency use. Their usual \"no drugs\" policy at Breitenbush was waived in light of the fact that partici- pants at the conference were to be given fresh Salviadivinorum leaves to chew if they felt so inclined.33 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 \"...he stated that answers to modern ecological and spiritual crises may be found by looking deep into the past -- to the ancient indigenous religions and shamanic practices of Pagan Europe.\" 1234567890123456789012345678901212345678901234567890123 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1 23456789012345678901234567890121234567890123456789012 3 1234567890123456789012345678901212345678901234567890123 Ralph Metzner We have found that one gram of dried leaves can be washed with hot water to remove the bitter components,pressed to remove most of the water and held under thetongue for twenty minutes or so, after which the remainingplant is spit out. The herb was found to greatly enhancepeople's ability to meditate. Our study isjust starting up again after a period ofinactivity. We are hoping to prove thismeditation-enhancing effect in a scientificexperiment. We are using a questionnairedesigned by Dr. Rick Strassman, modifiedfrom a set of questions he used to evaluateDMT in another study.

As a psychedelic researcher I aman amateur ... motivated by the love of the herb and the desireto find a valuable use for Salvia divinorum . Amateur scientists are extremely important in astronomy as well as many otherfields. Perhaps their importance in psychedelic research willgrow if restrictive drug laws continue to hamper professionalinvestigators. Conference Presenters The presenters at the conference included Ralph Metzner, Kathleen (Kat) Harrison, Bret Blosser, Rob Montgomery,Jonathan Ott, Daniel Siebert and Dale Pendell. The conferencelectures kept us busy from 9:30 AM until 9 or 10 PM eachevening. I kept extensive notes on a palm pilot with keyboardand took a few pictures of each speaker. Every lecture was veryinteresting and I observed that most people in attendancewere also keenly interested in each speaker. At the end of eachday most attendees could be found relaxing in the hot pools,looking at the stars or snow falling, and discussing theconference and other related issues. The organizers of the conference, Bret Blosser and Rob Montgomery said that the purposes of the conference weremany: 1) To describe the use of the herb Salvia divinorum tradition. 2) To describe the modern techniques of SD usage, includingthe use of the very powerful active ingredient salvinorin-A.This extracted drug is one of the most powerful visionaryagents ever discovered and can be quite hazardous emotion-ally for the user if it is taken without the respect that it deserves.Safety issues include the importance of a \"sitter\" to watch overthe SD user who may become ambulatory and temporarilyunaware of his or her surroundings. Simple emotional sup-port is sometimes required if the person becomes agitated orfearful. Salvia divinorum is not a drug one tries for entertainm ent.3) To describe the cultivation techniques of growing this rather delicate herb, easily destroyed by insects. Organic techniqueswere recommended for its cultivation and tobacco tea to keepaway the insects.4) To describe the process of divination both theoretically and experientially and to give the attend-ees the chance to try chewing a small number of leaves of Salvia divinorum in a peaceful setting. Attendees could choose to explore divination both with and without the use of the herb. Ralph Metzner The first speaker was Ralph Metzner who has been exploring states of con- sciousness and transformational prac- tices for over thirty years. He is a psychotherapist and professorat the California Institute of Integral Studies, where he teachescourses on altered states of consciousness, ecopsychology andecological worldviews. In his presentation he stated thatanswers to modern ecological and spiritual crises may befound by looking deep into the past\u2014to the ancient indig-enous religions and shamanic practices of Pagan Europe. Thislittle-understood tradition is the ancestral heritage of so manyof European descent. It includes the god Odin and hisrelentless quest for knowledge; Freya, the goddess of sexual-ity, abundance, and seership; the shamans, warriors, andpriestesses; and magical plants and incantations. The riches ofthis spiritual path are still abundantly available to all throughthe practices of divination. In his traditional societies, the Spirit World. A shamanicpractitioner walks between ordinary reality and non-ordinaryreality ... or between the Spirit World and \"consensus\" reality.So-called witches were known in Europe as those who couldwalk between both worlds. Crossing the boundaries between ordinary reality and non-34 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 \"She asked for her load to be lightened. And she asked for the Shepherdess to be present....Kat saw the Shepherdess take away the burdens one by one.\"ordinary reality and back, and carrying new information, is the process of divination. Drumming is one means to experiencethese alternate worlds, as is drugs, breathing, dancing, pray-ing, chanting and other techniques. Divination can be usedfor both acquiring information and for healing. Low doses ofdrugs are best for divination because we need to be conscious... we need to be aware and have some memory of theexperience. For divination purposes we use a mild sensory-enhancing effect. Entheogens amplify perceptions ... divina-tion can be done with and without them, for the process ofdivination is independent of the drugs. For divination the crucial thing is intention or question. The degree of dissociation from your surroundings is anotherimportant variable. Some drugs, including Salvia divinorum , Datura, as well as ketamines, are more thanothers, such as the classical tryptamines. The degree ofdissociation in Salvia divinorum is dose dependent. Low doses are not so dissociative, hence better for divination. It takessome mental discipline and intentional ritual to use the herbeffectively. Being in a questioning or receptive state is verysignificant. You ask a question and listen for the answer.Traditionally, in divination, as in healing, there is always a costor sacrifice to be made, such as fasting or praying. After his talk, Ralph promised that on that first evening he would conduct a class in divination and invited us to either usefavorite herbs to amplify the experience or not. In any case hestressed the use of very low doses of herbs so that we had a fullmemory of the experience. That evening we were led in one divination to go into the past - back to our birth, and back even further to the time ofconception. It was a powerful experience with drumming,incense and chanting. We were led to the roots of the tree oflife. Later we were led in a divination into the future bybecoming a bird of our choice. The bird flew high and couldsee the future stretched out before us. This was a powerfulexperience for everyone. Later, when I talked to people, manyhad not done any drugs or herbs. The ritual was a powerfuleffect on its own. After the divination I did a little exercise on my own. My wife had just recovered from major brain surgery. The good newsis that she will be fine and have a normal life span. However,I was still traumatized at the conference from the remem-brance of seeing her in intensive care on the edge of life anddeath. So I did a divination ritual of healing. I used a very smallamount of SD about an hour before, by placing the driedreconstituted leaves under my tongue. After an hour there islittle effect from this herb except an increased ability tovisualize. The healing ritual was simple ... I held the memory ofmy wife in intensive care as clearly in my mind as possible andalso held my attention as clearly as possible on the present(benign) outcome of good health for her. I shook with terrorat the memory but soon felt the trauma melt away as it wasneutralized by the present. It was a deep healing that releasedme from that experience. This technique shows a positive use for Salvia divinorum or some other psychedelic that might form the basis for a research project. The visionary plant couldhelp people overcome traumatic experiences by allowingthem to re-live the experience with greater clarity and in thelight of their present situation in the world. Kat Harrison On the afternoon of the first day Kat Harrison gave a presentation including slides showing her work with theMazatec peoples who use SD ritually in Mexico. She is anethnobotanist, photographer, and artist who has traveled toMexico for many years studying and practicing SD rituals witha family willing to share their experiences. In her talk she spokeof the following: Salvia divinorum is a spirit to which (the Mazatec people) pray and ask for guidance, which they associate with a guidingspirit who is thought of as a shepherdess. The name of theconference ... \"Ska Pastora, Leaves of the Shepherdess\" isbased on this concept. The native people are careful to honorritual guardian spirits who are present in their SD rituals. Thesespirits serve to guide andprotect them during the ex-perience. Vision-inducing mush- rooms and SD are some-times used by the samefamilies, although mush-rooms are available at a dif-ferent time of the year. Theleaves or mushrooms are alwaysmeasured out in pairs. The SD rituals areoften used for healing and are led by women ormen, either alone or together. Kat finds it especiallyinteresting to work with native midwives. Altars for SD andmushroom rituals often contain images of the Virgin ofGuadalupe and other saints. The families are quite secretive ofthese rituals, possibly because of persecution by the Spaniardsas early as 1600. The Spanish regarded the visionary plants asthe work of the devil. One example of such a healer, an 80-year-old curandero, looks at patients in the dark. Cloudy areas or dark areas meanthat there is a problem in this area of the body. The therapistthen tries to lighten up the dark areas with herbs rubbed on thebody and other ritual practices including the use of SD by thehealer, in order to gain insight into the cure. This traditionalpractice of using SD goes back hundreds of years. It hasavoided attention until the early 70's and is now establishedaround the world by cultivation. It cannot reproduce by seed,but rather by cuttings passed down through the generations. Kat is very fond of the plant and sees all such plants as working spirits. She has acquired the native perceptions and35 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 \"Seeing through the eyes of an animal is a typical effect that is useful for divination.\"uses SD in the traditional way in her own life. Surprising information that comes to mind from nowhere can be remem-bered and be useful. She described that recently she neededhealing and could feel that day-to-day responsibilities andstress were the cause of her illness. She did some SD leaves,incense and meditated while watching her cats. Ritual prayersfor healing were carried out with candles. She asked for herload to be lightened. And she asked for the Shepherdess to bepresent. She is 20 feet tall and infinitely benevolent. Kat sawthe Shepherdess take away the burdens one by one. Shethanked her in many ways and suddenly found herself singing.La Pastora ... La Pastora ... the song goes around and aroundand was sung again and again. Other phrases came and thesong became an invocation. Her stress was healed and she feltwell again after the experience. Kat recommended growingtobacco near your Salvia divinorum and to use it in rituals. Ritual tobacco varieties are never sold because they areconsidered sacred. In a later lecture we learned that tobaccoserves a very useful function in repelling the insects that tend toattack Salvia divinorum plants. A final recommendation for a healing ritual was to use SD to relive a past painful experiencein a more positive way ... in effect, to change your history. Bret Blosser Bret is an anthropologist who has also studied the Mazatec peoples and their Salvia divinorum rituals. Recently he has become interested in tracing back the historical records of theSpanish to find references to SD that might enlighten us aboutits' past usage. It was a most intriguing lecture outlining therecords found at the Archivo Nacional de la Nacion in MexicoCity about a year and a half ago. The Mexican scholar GonzaloAguirre Beltran had published extracts from documents thatmentioned pipiltzintzintli as a psychoactive plant used inhealing in his groundbreaking study, Medicine and Magic: theprocess of acculturation within the colonial structure (1963).Bret located a few more documents from the library relating topipiltzintzintli on his own. The lecture consisted mainly ofquotes from Spanish authorities about nativedrug use in religious and healing rituals datingfrom the 1600's. The puzzle unfolds in such away as to suggest that pipiltzintzintli is in fact Salvia divinorum . The evidence is based largely on Spanish Inquisition records ofseizures of sacred herbs, and fines given to native peoplecaught either growing such herbs or engaged in rituals felt tobe demonic. These records state that pipiltzintzintli was pulledup by the roots (ruling out psilocybin mushrooms) and thatthey grew in areas of great rainfall and cool climates (typical forSD). The most interesting record mentioning pipiltzintzintliwas from 1769 and was an edict condemning the use of ritualsand specifically the use of this herb. Several arrests were madearound this time, and the details suggested that Salvia divinorum was seized by the sheriff. Several records of investigations in the late 1600's also showed that herbs similarto Salvia divinorum could be associated with the name pipiltzintzintli. The connection between demonic practices and visionary herbs that were established by the Spanish Christians mayexplain the peculiar dread that western cultures, particularly inthe USA, have held for these herbs. Perhaps deep in ourcultural memories in North America there is an associationbetween visionary herbs and evil practices dating from earlyChristian prejudices of the 1600's. It is interesting to note thatthe modern Mexican families who have taught both Bret andKat about the use of Salvia divinorum were deeply convinced that the herb was illegal. This demonstrates clearly that fear ofa law can come down through the generations long after thelaw has ceased to exist. So also perhaps the fear of hallucino-gens has come down to us in North America through the 400-year-old Spanish Inquisition beliefs and persecutions. TheInquisition would of course have been active in those parts ofthe US that were once part of Mexico. This is only a theory ofcourse, but it helped me to understand the irrationality ofmodern drug laws. Jonathan Ott Jonathan is a well-known writer on the chemistry of a number of psychoactive herbs. His lecture was on Salviadivininorum Pharmacognosy. He began by describing aMexican method of SD ingestion in which the leaves wererubbed between the hands until it became a juice. The historyof our awareness of SD was traced back to research in 1938but the exact identity of the plant was not known at this time.Wasson and Hoffman discovered the actual plant in 1958 andit was named Salvia divinorum in 1962. Hoffman took several gallons of the juice to Switzerland but was unable to find anactive ingredient. He assumed that the ingredient was veryunstable and had been lost. Various people tried to establishthe active ingredient and to standardize the dose. Howeverthere was much confusion and the estimate ranged from 6leaves to 150 leaves. This was due to the fact that SD is inactivewhen eaten and the transfer of the active ingredient onlyoccurs as the herb is held in the mouth. Experiments by amateur scientists es- tablished this in a simple way ... the herb was made into a juicewith a blender and the volunteers drank it quickly withoutholding it in the mouth. They then washed out their mouthswith water. No mater how much they consumed in this waythere was no effect. On the other hand, if the same volunteersheld 2 to 6 chewed leaves in the mouth, the effects were verynoticeable. It appears that the digestive process destroys theactive ingredient. The active ingredient named salvinorin-A was discovered in 1982 and is known to be so potent that 500 microgramsproduces a profound effect. Daniel Siebert was the first personto consume the pure active ingredient in 1993.36 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1\" I found myself whistling the haunting musical theme that was chanted and it carried on into my dreams that night.\"Amateur Research The importance of amateur science in the study of pharma- cologically active plants was discussed at length. Whileprofessional scientists evaluating possible psychoactive plantsmust work for years on animals, amateurs can simply try themout for themselves. Instantly they can determine if a plantlooks promising. Double-blind testing can follow immediatelywith human volunteers. Jonathan pointed out that in the fieldof psychoactive herbs, animal tests mean nothing. A goodexample is catnip which appears tobe a powerful plant to cats. Inhuman testing catnip is only mildlyactive or inactive. Conversely many powerful drugs such asLSD can have little effect on some animals. The issue of amateur research came up and Jonathan suggested the following as a guideline for researchers tofollow ...1) Consult the professional literature.2) Consult the ethnographic studies that show the nativeusage. If the native people use a tea, do not grind the herb upand eat it. Thousands of years of experimentation my have ledup to that tea technique in order to avoid an insoluble poison.He has observed many an amateur poisoning himself by notfollowing a traditional method for herbal consumption.3) Be careful and be conservative about dosage.4) If we are looking for visionary effects, amateur self-experimentation can lead to the most significant results. Dataon rats will not be of any use.5) The psychonautic approach is the most efficient way to findan active ingredient. For example you find that there are fivealkaloids in some plants. You can tell from their structureapproximate dosage and through experimentation it is easy tofind what is active.6) You should make only one trial a day on yourself at themost. Otherwise the chemical may build up in your body if itis not quickly eliminated. The result will be an incorrectassessment of the correct dosage. Daniel Siebert Daniel is an ethnobotanist, educator, and artist. He has been researching Salvia divinorum for over ten years and was the first person to work on the human pharmacology ofsalvinorin-A and to clearly identify this compound as thepsychoactive principal of the plant. He has studied Salvia divinorum in its native habitat and has worked with it under the guidance of Mazatec shamans. His work appears inscientific journals and other publications. Mr. Siebert is thecreator of the popular Salvia Divinorum Research and Informa- tion Center web site at http://salvia.lycaeum.org/. He is also thefounder and moderator of Sagewise, a closed membershipemail-based discussion forum for Salvia divinorum researchers and professionals. He currently resides in Malibu, California,and is completing work on his book Divine Sage. Daniel stated that his first experiment with salvinorin-A was too strong and that he would not repeat such a high dose. But,he has used the pure compound many, many times since then,and sees nothing wrong in using it (provided that the dosageis carefully measured). He owns an analytical balance that canmeasure sub-milligram doses. People who do not have accessto this type of balance, should not experiment with the purecompound, because they would not be able to judge the doseaccurately. One of my own friends consumed a large dose ofa concentrate and said it was the most frightening experience of his life. Everyone at the conference was in agreement that it was extremely undesirable to work with pure salvinorin-Awithout the proper equipment. It is simply too powerful anddifficult to administer. Daniel demonstrated a new way to consume Salvia divinorum by inhalation of the vapors given off by a 1/4 gram of dried leaves. The leaves were heated with a digitally-controlled heat gun at 520 degrees F. He uses a glass pipe witha screen on top and bottom. He recommends the techniquefor health reasons. In a demonstration he showed that afterfully vaporizing the active ingredient there was a barelydetectable smoke. Then he raised the temperature and a hugequantity of bad smelling smoke was released. He recom-mended 1/4 gram of dried leaves for this method and alsowarned that it can produce a very powerful result. Daniel hasdeveloped an extract that is designed for convenient sub-lingual use. This technique gives the user a great deal ofcontrol over dosage, and the effects come on over a 20 minuteperiod. This very safe technique deserves the attention ofresearchers doing double-blind studies because it is very easyto concoct similar tasting extracts. Daniel mentioned briefly the double-blind experiment with which I am involved - using fresh leaves held under the tongue.Daniel went on to describe medical and psychological effectshe has observed in his years of experimentation with Salvia divinorum . It is a diuretic when consumed orally. Feeling nurtured and cared for is a commonly experienced phenom-enon that is most often associated with oral ingestion. It wasbelieved to relieve upset stomach, nausea and anemia, butDaniel's studies do not support these effects. Headaches cansometimes be relieved in low doses. Anthropological evidencesuggests that swollen abdomens can be reduced. A smallpercentage (15%) experience sweating and some people feelhot or cold. Few other effects of a physical nature areobserved. Many people find that very low doses are conduciveto erotic contact. But he emphasized that this is only true forvery low doses. Psychological effects include illusory move-ment or a compulsion to physically move. Space distortionsare common. Sounds can become colors or shapes. Languagedistortions happen and you can completely misunderstandwords. A feeling of being loved and cared for are common.Salvia divinorum in a safe, natural, outdoor environment can37 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1 \"I realized I was mistaken in my belief that the 'magic was in the drug'.

Some of the more unusual effects include people feeling they have become other people, otheranimals, or have moved in time to other eras. Seeing throughthe eyes of an animal is a typical effect that is useful fordivination. A lot of people experience an underlying unity ofconsciousness. Dale Pendel Dale has done a lot of experimental blending of traditional Salvia divinorum techniques with world religious traditions. We have lost our tradition of using sacred plants and Dale hasbeen trying to regain this connection. There are publishedreports indicating that young Mexicans were obtaining driedSalvia divinorum leaves in Huatla de Jim\u00e9nez and smoking them in 'joints' like marijuana for a mild high (D\u00edaz, 1975; Dale's At the time, Salvia divinorum was generally re- garded as a very mild psychoactive herb, at best. It was alsocommonly believed that the leaves were inactive when dried,so many people were doubtful about the reports of MexicanSalvia divinorum smokers. Dale confirmed in his originalexperiments that the dried leaves were in fact active whensmoked, and he was the first to report that smoked Salvia divinorum can produce very powerful visionary effects. He thus helped overturn the old notion that Salvia divinorum wasmerely a mild psychoactive herb. Evenso he recommends the technique ofchewing the leaves for religiousor divinatory use. Dale and friends gave a concert that night called\"Oracular Madness\", whichwas a blend of poetry, chant-ing, music and slides shown byKat Harrison. It was a very enter-taining multimedia presentationthat had a peculiar impact on myself. I found myself whistlingthe haunting musical theme that was chanted and it carried oninto my dreams that night. On the last day of the conference, Rob Montgomery led a discussion of cultivation techniques for those interested ingrowing SD. The plant grew well in neutral or slightly acidic orbasic soil. It benefited from fertilization and lots of watering.Rooting of the plant was so easy that rooting hormone wasnot recommended. The flowers are apparently quite spec-tacular and have a beautiful aroma. The plants are particularly susceptible to attack from aphids and white flies. Tobacco tea was discussed as the ideal organicinsecticide. A handful of organic tobacco was used to make agallon of tea which was either sprayed on the plants or smallcuttings might be immersed in the liquid. Newspapers soakedin the tea could be spread out over the soil to kill the larva stageof these pests. The plant was so easily infested with insectsthat one organic vegetable grower at the conference uses Salvia divinorum as a decoy to keep the insects away from his vegetables. The most dramatic thing about growing Salvia divinorum is the need for shade. You must choose a spot that is out ofdirect sunlight. Under a tree and beside a fence might be anideal spot. A place so dark that few plants could even survivethere was often found to be ideal for this plant. Someattendees at the conference said that hydroponic gardeningmethods were ideal for Salvia divinorum . This would be an interesting field for investigation, considering that the very lowneed for light would make hydroponic gardening very easy.The plant also requires a high level of relative humidity.Attendees from dry areas such as Arizona said that it wasalmost impossible to grow it outdoors in the dry heat.Hydroponic techniques would suit such areas of the world. When I left the conference on Sunday I was impressed by how much I had learned and was humbled by my ignorance ofthe subject. The anthropological discussions and divinationdemonstrations showed me that when we bring \"sacredherbs\" into our culture we must also import the rituals andhealing techniques that have evolved with their use. The herbsare simply tools for healing or divination, possessing littlemagic of their own. The dosage of this herb need only producea marginal effect if combined with an appropriate setting andritual. Through these techniques comes the feeling of protec-tion and guidance that are necessary for benevolent results. Irealized I was mistaken in my belief that the \"magic was in thedrug\". The magic is in the intention one holds in the mindwhile using a visionary herb. After years of experimentationwith psychedelics I am just beginning to get an understandingof their best uses through the study of traditional practices. This visionary herb can easily become an integral part of modern life but there is a need to study the many centuries oftraditional use in other cultures. Based on our current researchand prevailing philosophies we will have to develop our ownrituals to assist in the use of this herb. As our own careful andintentional ways to use Salvia divinorum evolve we will be able to tap its deep potential for healing and learning.38 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1new booksnew booksnew booksnew booksnew books Ketamine: Dreams and aspects of this strangedissociative psychedelic, starting withbasic pharmacology, then from and ravers,to modeling the near-death experience,to problems of compulsive use.

In this report, the test-subjectswho were under the influence of cannabis chose the right target at an average rate that was only slightly above chance expectancy. Those who were under the influence of psilocybin achieved a rate of success of58.3%, which was statistically significant. This was a small experiment with only 12 test-subjects. The process of doing remote viewing, with or without psychedelics, requires an ability to focus attention and to be able to clear away any personal and/or emotional issues that wouldinterfere with perception of external images and cause them to be skewed. I never use the term\"extra-sensory perception\" or \"ESP\" because it implies that there is an EXTRA sense somewhere that accounts for telepathy. This is counter-productive in attempting to understand how psi phenomena works. All our senses can be extended for use and interpretation of incominginformation. One of the uses of psilocybin is that it can contribute to the extension of one's ability to focus attention very precisely on something or some problem until it is understood at a higher level. Another of the many uses of psilocybin is that it facilitates one's ability to accessnon-local spacetime (the hyperspace) which is where remote viewing can be done. Cannabis can be utilized in this manner, as well. However, the quality of the cannabis is important, and one needs to practice with it, to know and understand just how the process of remote viewingworks best. It is also important to remember that the inexperienced users of psychedelics can find themselves in the middle of a major cosmic drama, and if so, this must be resolved first and foremost. No remote viewing should be attempted during such a session that is essential forthe clearing of preconscious material. In my informal studies beginning nearly forty years ago, I have used LSD, mescaline, or psilocybin, if I had an urgent need to communicate with someone at a distance, when a telephone was not available. Each of these substances worked fairly wellunder such needy conditions. At other times, my colleagues and I would use one of these substances to try sending and receiving simple messages just to explore and to study the potentials of this direct mind-to-mind communication process. When we compared ourresponses afterward, we discovered how our memories and internal dialog could skew the results. After a time, I began to realize that what we learned about the process was now part of what we could use at any time. We no longer needed the boost that the strong psychedelics,mentioned above, provided. It was at that time, that I learned that cannabis could be used just as well And even when that was not available, I could focus my attention with my own intention set to do so.The Influence of Psychedelics on Remote Viewing By Jean Millay, Ph.D. (jeanmillay@hotmail.com) (A more complete discussion of this topic can be found in Multidimen- sional Mind:Remote Viewing in Hyperspace, by Stanley Krippner, Ph.D.) \"Those who were under the influence of psilocybin achieved a rate of success of 58.3%, which was statistically significant.\" 44 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1Later, I con- ducted a formal study for my Ph.D.dissertation with college students who formed eleven tele- pathic teams. These were couples (lovers or friends since childhood) who volunteered because they wanted to learn toimprove their own communication with each other. In this first study we did not use psychedelics or cannabis. We used biofeedback to train the volunteers to synchronize their alphabrainwaves between right and left hemispheres, and later with each other. One semester was not enough time for some of the couples to learn EEG synch and some did not receivetelepathic messages any better than chance. However, when all scores were counted at the end of the experiment, we found that those teams who had the best scores in paired EEGphase coherence were also those who had the best (better than chance) average scores in blind match telepathy. This trend was continued in a later study as well. (Both studieswere statistically significant at p< .001.) It is important to notice that the brainwaves were not measured at the same time that the telepathy was tested. In one case, the electrodesinterfered with concentration for telepathy, and in the other, the attempts to communicate telepathically interfered with the intent to synchronize brainwaves. So we cannot say thatone is the \"cause\" of the other, but that both are related to the ability to focus attention in a precise way. (For details, see my book, Multidimensional Mind: Remote Viewing in Hyper-space, available at Amazon.com). In the late 1970's, we conducted another study designed to examine the possible effects that smoking cannabis had onthe EEG of volunteers. In this study we used the same equipment as we had used in the previous study (i.e., two Aquarius Electronics brainwave biofeedback analyzers withthe phase comparator, designed by Tim Scully, Ph.D.). A good grade of cannabis was obtained so that each volunteer would be smoking the same material. In those days, the EEGbiofeedback equipment was often used to judge the quality of mind-altering materials. If a person lost some voluntary control of his/her brainwaves (that she/he had previouslylearned) by using any substance, it was felt to be inferior. (Obviously, if that material was used too often, one would lose some aspect of thought, eventually.) If a person gainedsome ability to exert voluntary control over his/her brainwaves by using some substance, then that material had the potential of being \"mind-expanding.\" This was the rule of thumb, atthat time, and occasionally students at \"Altered State Col- lege\" would request the use of our equipment to test their own material.Because of the intense interest in that community in the actual effects of cannabis, volunteers requested that we do such a study since we had the equip- ment available. We began by establishing the base line of EEGfrequency range for each individual. Then with biofeedback, we also recorded the initial alpha phase-coherent scores for each one, and for each team. Then we introduced a goodgrade of cannabis for each one to smoke, and took the EEG phase-coherent scores again at intervals. In each case, all volunteers recorded a dramatic increase in their individualinterhemispheric alpha phase-coherent scores. However, some of the couples showed an increase in their interpersonal alpha phase-coherent scores and some couples showed adecrease from their baseline scores. Those couples, whose interpersonal alpha phase-coherent scores increased after smoking, described their experiences as being totally focusedon each other, especially on touch. Those couples, whose interpersonal alpha phase-coherent scores had decreased after smoking, reported that they had \"spaced out,\" that isthey no longer focused on each other but enjoyed thinking about separate events, or creative ideas. (Their interhemi- spheric synch scores remained high, but their interpersonalsynch scores decreased.) One suggestion here is: since brainwave biofeedback can help people to increase their ability to increase alpha phase-coherence (along with their ability to focus attention), and if the ability to focus attention is relevant to increased accuracy in telepathy, then when one can learn to increase alphaphase-coherence with the use of a good quality of cannabis, a research study might very well be able to find that cannabis can increase the ability to do successful telepathy amongthose couples who already have established some rapport. We must remember, however, that clarity of mind is always a consistent requirement. Additional research in this area needs to be done by those who can focus attention on the real issues of the multidimen-sional realms available to each of us. With or without psychedelics, telepathy and remote viewing are possible. Psychedelics have introduced millions of us to the concept ofnon-local spacetime and have opened the \"doors of percep- tion\". The doors cannot be closed again!\"I conducted a formal study for my Ph.D. dissertation with college students who formed eleven telepathic teams.\" \"With or without psychedelics, telepathy and remote viewing are possible....\"45 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 1When It Was Cool To Be Kind by Thomas B. Roberts, Ph.D. (TRoberts38@aol.com) Northern Illinois University Just reading it gets you high \u2014 Jim Fadiman has a cool 60's novel out, \"The Other Side of Haight: A Novel\". The story follows a teenage girl, \"Shadow\",and her friends who live in a house in the Haight. They provide a living sample of the people of that time and place without becoming the politically laden caricatures so common in 60'swritings, videos, and movies. Optimistic, naive, caring, crazed, creative, loving, dutiful, experimental, egocentric and ego transcendent, hopeful and bummerful, and mostly young \u2014their thoughts, relationships, feelings, and experiences give us multiple tastes and varied takes of a complex time when it was cool to be kind. Set against this is Midnight Climax, a CIA sponsored whorehouse where unsuspecting clients were dosed with LSD. No, this isn't Fadiman's imagination, as CongressionalHearings divulged. Dr. Langwater, the chief villain, is abeautiful word-drawing of the disregard for humane values and citizens' rights that war-toned policies foster. Add these two collections of different people to the headycocktail of the 60's \u2014 Baby Boomers, the Vietnam War, women's equality, civil rights, LBJ and Nixon, rock music dance concerts, and more \u2014 and \"The Other Side of Haight\"emerges as a true chronicle of a lost reality, or maybe a lost chronicle of a true reality.

After you've put the book down (if you can) and before you start to read again, get lost for an indeterminate amount of time in thecover photo, then flow gently back into the words again.

The following report has been prepared by our President, Kathy Janiger: Editor's Note: Since the preparation of this report, Kathy Janiger has passed away, on February 17, 2001. Kathy brought to our Foundation excellent management skills, anddrawing from her Harvard Business School degree and corporate experience, contributed much insight to the operations and functioning of our Foundation. Much of her last months were devoted to nurturing and supporting her husband as he was recovering from serious heartsurgery. Her sunny disposition, insights, and support will be sorely missed. He experienced it first as the imagination of a child. As a seemingly automatic and unconscious shift to a new set of facts, emotions and sensations about the experience of his young life from the daily experiences of family and farm life. Then one day, he had a thought that maybe these shifts of his reality were coming from him. He conducted an experiment. Apath home from a neighboring farm that crossed the field had, at times, seemed friendly. A place of no concern. And at others, full of threat and danger. A path to be sped along. On this particular day, as he could feel the threatening presences between him and home, he chose towalk slowly and encouraged himself to think of it as the hospitable environment he knew it at times to be. The imagined presences began to dissolve and he began to get perspective on what was to be a lifelong search into the nature of consciousness. Dr. Oscar Janiger (\"Oz\") is best known in these pages as a pioneering researcher of LSD. His large scale (900 subjects) naturalistic study of the phenomenological effects of LSD in the 50's and 60's has been followed up with a project funded by MAPS and has been reported hereas \"An Attempt to Define the Nature of the LSD Experience as a Special State of Consciousness.\" MAPS' forty-year plus follow-up interview study of forty-five participants in the original study found that all but one of the respondents found taking LSD to be a positive experience. Manybenefits were ascribed - openness, creativity, sensory enhancement, emotional richness, insight. One-third of the subjects reported long-term benefits of perceptive/cognitive and behavioral changes (such as a more positive outlook), overcoming shyness, catalyzing career orrelationship changes creating permanent openings to spirituality, emotions and insights. In the same article describing the follow-up study, Oz describes his own experience with LSD: \"I've opened the door to some other extension of my mind or my sensory equipment or perceptual apparatus...[t]hat gave me access to a kind of world that was vastly enlarged, vastly expanded. My senses were made most acute. My mental capacity led me to think in terms of breaking away from familiar - what I call obligatory - reality, where I had to be a certain way.\" It's easy to see how the study of LSD was undertaken by someone with a life-long interest in the nature of consciousness. But how did Oz find LSD in 1954 and what other paths has he gone down to find insight into the nature of reality and experience?Before deciding on medical school, Oz pursued degrees in literature and biology, both of which later served him well in his study of human nature as a psychiatrist. But it was his love of plants that led him to an early awareness of the mind-altering plants used around the world forINTERNATIONAL LIBRARY FOR THE STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS www.hofmann.org P. O.

A student who hadrecently returned from Europe offered Oz the opportunity to experience for himself such a change with a new medicinal marvel, LSD 25. The experience of the drug gave direction toOz's work as a medical researcher, possibilities to his work as a psychiatrist, and an outlet to his curiosity about his funda- mental perceptions. While researching LSD, Oz and Perry Bivens, the student who introduced him to LSD, began to look for other substances that might be hallucinogenic. Oz's knowledge ofplants had made him aware of Ayahuasca and one of its active ingredients, DMT. In 1955, he and Perry converted an oral form of DMT into aninjectible form and Oz became the first known subject to in-gest DMT in the United States. He went on to do studiesof DMT with people such as Alan Watts and Humphry Osmond. He also studied the hallucinogenic effects of tobacco and published a paper on the subject with Dr. Marlene De Rios. Peyote was another area of great interest that led ultimately to a study of the effects of peyote on human chromosomes. This study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and was performed among theHuichol Indians of Mexico who use peyote from birth. No evidence of chromosomal or organic disorders were found. In his ongoing efforts to understand the influences on peoples' states of mind, he undertook a very early study on what later became known as Pre-Menstrual Syndrome (PMS). He conducted a cross-cultural study with Riffenburgh andKersh that undertook to show that PMS was not a neurosis of the effete middle class as was the prevailing view of psychiatry at the time, but a somatic psychic condition that affectedNigerians, Hopis, Japanese and other cultures as well. Oz's research team even found evidence in the observations of the zookeeper at the Berlin Zoo that primates were similarlyaffected. Another area where Oz chose to question the pre- vailing wisdom of the 1950's was to object to the prescribedtherapy for homosexuals and to investigate the origins of the so-called \"problem\". He looked for a biological basis for homosexuality when the gay community was about to estab-lish an identity, and published a paper with Margolese that ignited much controversy. In this century, biologically-based study of homosexuality is commonplace.Always being inspired by his early studies of his uses of plants, Oz got involved with the scientific investigation of unconventional healing methods and became chairman ofthe Research Committee of The Holmes Center. Grants were given to fledgling researchers who have since become icons in their fields, such as Dr. Dean Ornish in cardiac care andStephen LeBerge, Ph.D., in lucid dreaming. His love of nature and his curiosity about conscious- ness also led him to study Cetaceans, primarily Dolphins. Heis on the board of directors of the Delphys Foundation and has taken Olympic swimmers and Japanese athletes to the waters of the Bahamas. Here they studied the same pods of wildDolphins year after year to see if any insights into the behavior of these big- brained mammals can give us a clue to their harmonious and ecologically friendly life. His forty-plus yearfriendship with Dr. John C. Lilly, the preeminent Dolphin researcher and fellow \"Psychonaut,\" has led to many a fascinating conversation for all present. Since the 1970's Oz has had thoughts of a repository for all the information amassed during LSD research. By 1989 he had gathered almost every recognized expert in the fieldonto the Board of Advisors of the Albert Hofmann Founda- tion. The foundation has a website, www.hofmann.org, and is a regular contributor to the MAPS Bulletin. Oz is currently at work on a clinical text about Dissociative Disorder, a little understood state of conscious- ness sometimes compared to the experience of separating from the observer while under the effect of psychedelics. Many have briefly experienced this phenomenon naturally,with varying degrees of fear and wonder. But those stuck in a chronic or extreme state of dissociation seek treatment. Work on this has been set aside for the last year while Oz hasbeen healing from a near-fatal open heart surgery necessi- tated by damage sustained seventy years ago from rheumatic fever, but controlled by a lifetime of exuberant athleticism andNorman Cousin's bromide, laughter. Recovery has been physically and emotionally challenging, but it has also led him in new directions such as writing short fiction and a screen-play that has been sold to Universal Studios. Oz is grateful for the help and support of his friends throughout this difficult time.
