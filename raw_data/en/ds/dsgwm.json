Therefore, the Contractor will not discriminate against any person or business on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orien tation, marital status, parental status, military discharge status or source of income and will take affirmative action to ensure that women and minority businesses will have the maximum opportunity to compete for and perform subcontracts for supplies or s ervices. Pursuant to Section 2 -92-430 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, the Chief Procurement Officer has established a goal of awarding not less than 25% of the annual dollar value of all non -construction contracts to certified MBEs and 5% of the annual d ollar value of all non -construction contracts to certified WBEs. Pursuant to Section 2 -92-430 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, the Chief Procurement Officer has established a goal of awarding not less than 25% of the annual dollar value of all non -constru ction contracts to certified MBEs and 5% of the annual dollar value of all non -construction contracts to certified WBEs. Accordingly, the Contractor commits to make Good Faith Efforts to expend at least the following percentages of the total contract price (inclusive of any and all modifications and amendments), if awarded, for contract participation by MBEs and WBEs: MBE Percentage WBE Percentage 0% 0% This commitment is met by the Contractor's status as a MBE or WBE, or by a joint venture with one or more MBEs or WBEs as prime contractor (to the extent of the MBE or WBE participation in such joint venture), or by subcontracting a portion of the work to one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by the purchase of materials used in the performance of the contract from on e or more MBEs or WBEs, or by the indirect participation of MBEs or WBEs in other aspects of the Contractor's business (but no dollar of such indirect MBE or WBE participation will be credited more than once against a Contractor's MBE or WBE commitment wit h respect to all government Contracts of such Contractor), or by any combination of the foregoing. RFP For Part A: Canine Primary Care Veterinary Services; And Part B: Canine Specialty Veterinary Services Specification No. 483378 38 Note: MBE/WBE participation goals are separate and those businesses certified with the City of Chicago as both MBE and WBE may only be listed on a bidder's compliance plan as either a MBE or a WBE, but not both to demonstrate compliance with the Contract Specific Goals. As noted above, the Contractor may meet all or part of this commitment by contracting with MBEs or WBEs for the provision of goods or servic es not directly related to the performance of this Contract. However, in determining the manner of MBE/WBE participation, the Contractor will first consider involvement of MBEs/WBEs as joint venture partners, subcontractors, and suppliers of goods and ser vices directly related to the performance of this Contract. In appropriate cases, the Chief Procurement Officer will require the Contractor to demonstrate the specific efforts undertaken by it to involve MBEs and WBEs directly in the performance of this C ontract. The Contractor also may meet all or part of this commitment through credits received pursuant to Section 2 - 92-530 of the Municipal Code of Chicago for the voluntary use of MBEs or WBEs in private sector contracts. Pursuant to 2 -92-535, the prime c ontractor may apply be awarded an additional 0.333 percent credit, up to a maximum of a total of 5 percent additional credit, for every 1 percent of the value of a contract self - performed by MBEs or WBEs, or combination thereof, that have entered into a me ntor agreement with the contractor. This up to 5% may be applied to the Contract Specific Goals, or it may be in addition to the Contract Specific Goals. 5.2.

Joint Ventures The formation of joint ventures to provide MBEs and WBEs with capacity and experience at the prime contracting level, and thereby meet Contract Specific Goals (in whole or in part) is encouraged. A joint RFP For Part A: Canine Primary Care Veterinary Services; And Part B: Canine Specialty Veterinary Services Specification No. 483378 40 venture may consist of any combination of MBEs, WBEs, and non -certified firms as long as one member is an MBE or WBE. a. The joint venture may be eligible for credit towards the Contract Specif ic Goals only if: i. The MBE or WBE joint venture partner's share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks and profits of the joint venture is equal to its ownership interest; ii. The MBE or WBE joint venture partner is responsible for a dis tinct, clearly defined portion of the requirements of the contract for which it is at risk; iii. Each joint venture partner executes the bid to the City; and iv. The joint venture partners have entered into a written agreement specifying the terms and con ditions of the relationship between the partners and their relationship and responsibilities to the contract, and all such terms and conditions are in accordance with the conditions set forth in Items i, ii, and iii above in this Paragraph a. b. The Chief Procurement Officer shall evaluate the proposed joint venture agreement, the Schedule B submitted on behalf of the proposed joint venture, and all related documents to determine whether these requirements have been satisfied. The Chief Procurement Officer shall also consider the record of the joint venture partners on other City of Chicago contracts. The decision of the Chief Procurement Officer regarding the eligibility of the joint venture for credit towards meeting the Contract Specific Goals, and the portion of those goals met by the joint venture, shall be final. The joint venture may receive MBE or WBE credit for work performed by the MBE or WBE joint venture partner(s) equal to the value of work performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work. Additionally, if employees of the joint venture entity itself (as opposed to employees of the MBE or WBE partner) perform the work, then the value of the work may be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals at a rate equal to the MBE or WBE firm's percentage of participation in the joint venture as described in Schedule B. The Chief Procurement Officer may also count the dollar value of work subcontracted to other MBEs and WBEs. Work performed by the force s of a non -certified joint venture partner shall not be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals. c. Schedule B: MBE/WBE Affidavit of Joint Venture Where the bidder's Compliance Plan includes the participation of any MBE or WBE as a joint venture partn er, the bidder must submit with its bid a Schedule B and the proposed joint venture agreement. These documents must both clearly evidence that the MBE or WBE joint venture partner(s) will be responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work to be perf ormed, and that the MBE's or WBE's responsibilities and risks are proportionate to its ownership percentage. The proposed joint venture agreement must include specific details related to: i. The parties' contributions of capital, personnel, and equipment and share of the costs of insurance and bonding; ii. Work items to be performed by the MBE's or WBE's own forces and/or work to be performed by employees of the newly formed joint venture entity; iii. Work items to be performed under the supervision of the MBE or WBE joint venture partner; and iv. The MBE's or WBE's commitment of management, supervisory, and operative personnel to the performance of the contract. RFP For Part A: Canine Primary Care Veterinary Services; And Part B: Canine Specialty Veterinary Services Specification No. 483378 41 NOTE: Vague, general descriptions of the responsibilities of the MBE or WBE joint venture part ner do not provide any basis for awarding credit. For example, descriptions such as \"participate in the budgeting process,\" \"assist with hiring,\" or \"work with managers to improve customer service\" do not identify distinct, clearly defined portions of the work. Roles assigned should require activities that are performed on a regular, recurring basis rather than as needed. The roles must also be pertinent to the nature of the business for which credit is being sought. For instance, if the scope of work r equired by the City entails the delivery of goods or services to various sites in the City, stating that the MBE or WBE joint venture partner will be responsible for the performance of all routine maintenance and all repairs required to the vehicles used t o deliver such goods or services is pertinent to the nature of the business for which credit is being sought. 5.4. Counting MBE/WBE Participation Toward the Contract Specific Goals Refer to this section when preparing the MBE/WBE compliance plan and completing Schedule D -1 for guidance on what value of the participation by MBEs and WBEs will be counted toward the stated Contract Specific Goals. The \"Percent Amount of Participation\" depends on whether and with whom a MBE or WBE subcontracts out any portion of its work and other factors. Firms that are certified as both MBE and WBE may only be listed on a bidder's compliance plan as either a MBE or a WBE to demonstrate compliance with the Contract Specific Goals. For example, a firm that is certified as both a M BE and a WBE may only be listed on the bidder's compliance plan under one of the categories, but not both. Only Payments made to MBE and WBE firms that meet BOTH the Commercially Useful Function and Area of Specialty requirements above will be counted towa rd the Contract Specific Goals. a. Only expenditures to firms that perform a Commercially Useful Function as defined above may count toward the Contract Specific Goals . i. The CPO will determine whether a firm is performing a commercially useful function by evaluating the amount of work subcontracted, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and the credit claimed for its performance of the work, industry practices, and other rele vant factors. ii. A MBE or WBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its participation is only required to receive payments in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. The CPO may examine similar commercial transactions, pa rticularly those in which MBEs or WBEs do not participate, to determine whether non MBE and non WBE firms perform the same function in the marketplace to make a determination. iii. Indications that a subcontractor is not performing a commercially useful f unction include, but are not limited to, labor shifting and equipment sharing or leasing arrangements with the prime contractor or a first tier subcontractor. b. Only the value of the dollars paid to the MBE or WBE firm for work that it performs in its Ar ea of Specialty in which it is certified counts toward the Contract Specific Goals. c. For maintenance, installation, repairs or inspection, or professional services, if the MBE or WBE performs the work itself : 100% of the value of work actually performe d by the MBE's or WBE's own forces shall be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals, including the cost of supplies and materials purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE from third parties or second tier subcontractors in order to perform its (s ub)contract with its own forces (except supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliate). 0% of the value of work at the project site that a MBE or WBE subcontracts to a non - certified firm counts toward the Contract Specific Goals. d. If the MBE or WBE is a manufacturer : 100% of expenditures to a MBE or WBE manufacturer for items needed for the Contract shall be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals. A manufacturer is a firm that opera tes or maintains a factory or establishment that produces on the premises the materials or supplies obtained by the bidder or contractor. RFP For Part A: Canine Primary Care Veterinary Services; And Part B: Canine Specialty Veterinary Services Specification No. 483378 42 e. If the MBE or WBE is a distributor or supplier : 60% of expenditures for materials and supplies purchased from a MB E or WBE that is certified as a regular dealer or supplier shall be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals. f. If the MBE or WBE is a broker : i. Zero percent (0%) of expenditures paid to brokers will be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals. ii. As defined above, Brokers provide no commercially useful function. g. If the MBE or WBE is a member of the joint venture contractor/bidder : i. A joint venture may count the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clear ly defined portion of the work of the contract that the MBE or WBE performs with its own forces toward the Contract Specific Goals; or ii. If employees of this distinct joint venture entity perform the work then the value of the work may be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals at a rate equal to the MBE or WBE firm's percentage of participation in the joint venture as described in the Schedule B. iii. A joint venture may also count the dollar value of work subcontracted to other MBEs and WBEs. h. If the MBE or WBE subcontracts out any of its work : i. 100% of the value of the work subcontracted to other MBEs or WBEs performing work in its Area of Specialty may be counted toward the Contract Specific Goals. ii. 0% of the value of work that a MBE o r WBE subcontracts to a non -certified firm counts toward the Contract Specific Goals (except as allowed by (c) above). iii. The fees or commissions charged for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consulting or managerial servi ces or for providing bonds or insurance and assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment, materials or supplies required for performance of the Contract, provided that the fee or commission is determined by the Chief Procurem ent Officer to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. iv. The fees charged for delivery of materials and supplies required on a job site (but not the cost of the materials and supplies themselves) wh en the hauler, trucker, or delivery service is not also the manufacturer of or a regular dealer in the materials and supplies, provided that the fee is determined by the Chief Procurement Officer to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees cus tomarily allowed for similar services. v. The fees or commissions charged for providing any bonds or insurance, but not the cost of the premium itself, specifically required for the performance of the Contract, provided that the fee or commission is dete rmined by the Chief Procurement Officer to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. 5.5. Regulations Governing Reductions to or Waiver of MBE/WBE Goals The following Regulations set forth the standards to be used in determining whether or not a reduction or waiver of the MBE/WBE commitment goals of a particular contract is appropriate. If a bidder determines that it is unable to meet the MBE and/or WBE Contract -Specific Goals on a City of Chicago contract, a written request for the reduction or waiver of the commitment must be included in the bid or proposal. The written request for reduction or waiver from the commitment must be in the form of a signed petition for grant of relief from the MBE/WBE percenta ges submitted on the bidder's letterhead, and must demonstrate RFP For Part A: Canine Primary Care Veterinary Services; And Part B: Canine Specialty Veterinary Services Specification No. 483378 43 that all required efforts as set forth in this document were taken to secure eligible Minority and Women Business Enterprises to meet the commitments. The Chief Procurement Officer or designee shall determine whether the request for the reduction or waiver will be granted. A bidder will be considered responsive to the terms and conditions of these Regulations if, at the time of bid, it submits a waiver request and all supporting documentation t hat adequately addresses the conditions for waiver of MBE/WBE goals, including proof of notification to assist agencies except: Bidders responding to Request for Proposals (RFPs) who have been identified as a short listed candidate and/or a prospective a wardee will be given a designated time allowance, but no more than fourteen (14) calendar days to submit to the Department of Procurement Services complete documentation that adequately addresses the conditions for waiver described herein; and Bidders resp onding to Request for Information and or Qualifications (RFI/RFQs) deemed by the Chief Procurement Officer or authorized designee to be the most responsive and responsible shall submit documentation that adequately addresses the conditions for waiver descr ibed herein during negotiations. Failure to submit documentation sufficient to support the waiver request will cause the bid/proposal to be found non -responsive by the Chief Procurement Officer, and the bid/proposal will be rejected. In such cases the re medies to be taken by the Chief Procurement Officer, in his or her discretion, may include, but are not limited to, forfeiture of bid deposit; negotiating with the next lowest bidder; or re -advertising the bid/proposal. All bidders must submit all require d documents at the time of bid opening to expedite the contract award. 5.5.1. Direct / Indirect Participation Each of the following elements must be present in order to determine whether or not such a reduction or waiver is appropriate. a. The bidder has documen ted the unsuccessful solicitation for either subcontractors or joint venture partners of at least 50% (or at least five when there are more than eleven certified firms in the commodity area) of the appropriate certified MBE/WBE firms to perform any direct or indirect work identified or related to the advertised bid/proposal.

OR b. Subcontractor participation will be deemed excessively costly when the MBE/WBE subcontractor proposal exceeds the average price quoted by more tha n twenty percent (20%). In order to establish that a subcontractor's quote is excessively costly, the bidder must provide the following information: 1. A detailed statement of the work identified for MBE/WBE participation for which the bidder asserts the MBE/WBE quote(s) were excessively costly (in excess of 20% higher). A listing of all potential subcontractors contacted for a quotation on that work item; Prices quoted for the subcontract in question by all such potential subcontractors for that work item . 2. Other documentation which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Chief Procurement Officer that the MBE/WBE proposals are excessively costly, even though not in excess of 20% higher than the average price quoted. This determination will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to the following: The City's estimate for the work under a specific subcontract; The bidder's own estimate for the work under the subcontract; An average of the bona fide prices quoted for the subcontract; Demonstr ated increase in other contract costs as a result of subcontracting to the M/WBE or other firm. 5.5.2.

Attachment B to these Regulations provides the letter format that a prime contractor may use. Proof of notification prior to bid submittal (e.g. certified mail receipt or facsimile transmittal receipt) will be required to be submitted with the bid for any bid/proposal to be deemed responsive. If deemed appropriat e, the Contract Compliance Officer may contact the assist agency for verification of notification. 5.5.3.

The requirements set forth in these Regulations (this subsection 1.5, \" Regulations Governing Reduc tions to or Waiver of MBEWBE Goals \") shall not apply where the Chief Procurement Officer determines prior to the bid solicitations that MBE/WBE subcontractor participation is impracticable. This may occur whenever the Chief Procurement Officer determines t hat for reasons of time, need, industry practices or standards not previously known by the Chief Procurement Officer, or such other extreme circumstances as may be deemed appropriate, such a Waiver is in the best interests of the City. This determination may be made in connection with a particular contract, whether before the contract is RFP For Part A: Canine Primary Care Veterinary Services; And Part B: Canine Specialty Veterinary Services Specification No. 483378 45 let for bid, during the bid or award process, before or during negotiation of the contract, or during the performance of the contract.
