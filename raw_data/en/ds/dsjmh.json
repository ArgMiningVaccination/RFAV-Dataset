What makes Triphala Rose different? The quality of the ingredients and the formula. There are seven different varieties of haritaki, but our Triphala Rose contains a rare, premium version called vijaya. Lower-cost triphalas contain lower-quality haritaki; only the vijaya has the highest benefits. What's more, in addition to the traditional three fruits (haritaki, amalaki, and bibhitaki), we've added a fourth ingredient\u2014cabbage rose, which supports the synergy of the other ingredients and promotes their effectiveness. Our Triphala is crafted with care from sustainably sourced botanicals in India. The fruit is gathered from pristine, unpolluted areas and grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or exposure to environmental pollutants. Once gathered, the fruit is sorted and tested to ensure each batch is of the utmost quality and perfect ripeness. The ingredients are processed so as to not destroy the natural properties of the fruits (no high heat is used during manufacturing). Reviews Jonathan B. Having regular elimination every morning is not only a key to good health but as an older person it has reduced dry skin symptoms. NML I have been using Triphala Plus for over 2 months now. Once I changed my diet with little meat and eating lots of salads and veggies, I still was not regular. When I use Triphala Plus, it helps me stay regular and helps maintain my weight. Ravi R.
