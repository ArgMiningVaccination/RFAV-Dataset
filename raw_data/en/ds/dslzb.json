Sometimes we can become stuck and never reach our full potential! In the fast-paced, modern-day world, we try to be for everyone. Put our emotions and pains aside to just 'get through each day'. Women, especially, have many roles to play - the mother, working woman/business owner, wife/partner, home domestic goddess, friend, financier, and the list goes on.... We can get lost in the myriad of roles and become anxious, overwhelmed, and stressed out! That is not to say we are failing, but the multitude of burdens can create feedback for the body. Physical symptoms can cause emotional distress. Unresolved emotional issues can manifest themselves in physical symptoms. The body needs to be treated as a whole. Looking at the physical, mental and emotional causes for symptoms and ill-health. True healing occurs when we address and treat the body as a whole, not parts! So, if you find yourself in the revolving door of not feeling 100%, feeling burdened and looking for a change but don't know how to change, then you may stay stuck in the symptoms of ill-health. We are the sum of all our habits, thoughts and experiences. Sometimes we can become stuck and never reach our full potential! For effective change, it is best to look for techniques that support you to overcome unproductive habits or unwanted behaviours to help you reach your health and life goals. Have you tried to change habits or behaviours before but found yourself returning to old habits, leaving you feeling frustrated, overwhelmed and powerless. Techniques like Hypnosis and Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) can help to support changes. Hypnosis is a technique that utilises the natural state of selective, focused attention; this state is referred to as a trance. This state is 100% natural, and you probably find yourself in a trance many times throughout the day (probably when watching TV). The deeply relaxed state of trance can open the door to countless possibilities of healing, self-discovery and mindset shifts. I can work with your subconscious mind to help you focus and take action on suggestions relevant to you and your goals. Hypnosis can be used as part of the healing journey in stress, anxiety, weight loss, cravings, insomnia, addictions, performance and motivation. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), aka tapping, is a technique that utilises tapping on specific acupressure points. This tapping balances energy meridians that become disrupted during emotional or mental events. Typically the results are lasting, and positive mindset shifts can occur. Many scientific studies have been conducted on EFT and it has been shown to be effective in conditions such as weight loss, anxiety conditions, pain, cravings, and stress. Meditation has been used for centuries in various cultures. Many recent studies centre on the benefit of meditation on stress reduction, building skills to manage stress, focusing on the present, and increasing creativity. Stress can have profound effects on the body. For example, Deloitte Global found that 1 in 2 working women suffered high-stress levels. Stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline can increase blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels and contribute to chronic heart disease, sleep issues, immune dysregulation, and low energy. Meditation can help support physical, mental and emotional health, helping you reduce stress levels, have a clearer outlook on problems and maintain a positive outlook on your goals and success. Whether you are looking to address small niggly problems before they get out of hand or looking to make big changes to improve your quality of life and health, Teressa Todd and My Naturopath Gold Coast have the techniques to help you achieve your goals.
