It is associated with more thanfour thousand unexpected deaths and occupies 0.5 to 1.9%of emergency department (ED) visits per year (1). According to the 2000 annual report of the American asso- ciation of poison control centers (AAPCC) toxic exposure sur- veillance system (TESS), a total of 2,168,248 poisoned patientsvisited 63 poison control centers for one year in US. Amongthese patients, no toxicity was found in 818,323 (37.7%)patients, and only minimal toxicity in 1,082,047 (49.9%)(2, 3). The previous studies consistently reported that unnec-essary ED visits due to poisonings may be reduced with theuse of proper triage methods (4, 5). This reduction was accom-plished, especially in children, over 50% (4). Those studiesalso suggested that a triage method should be developed forthe efficient control of the out-of-hospital poisoned patients(5, 6). With the requirements aforementioned, 'the guidelinefor the out-of- hospital management of human exposures to minimally toxi c substances' was approved in 2003 by AAPCC consensus panel (the AAPCC guideline) (3). In Korea, there have been 12 local emergency medical infor- mation centers organized by the Ministry of Health and Wel- fare since 2000 (7). Each center collects real-time data fromhospitals to obtain information on the availability of medicalfacilities through an automatic report system, and provides emergency medical advices to the lay persons who are in trou-ble. The Seoul Emergency Medical Information Center (SE- MIC) is responsible for Seoul, which is the largest ci ty in Korea , and 10,276,968 people live in (8). Four physicians with 12 emergency medical technicians (EMTs) are working at the SEMIC as emergency medical advisers. They provide guid-ance of emergency care and information relating hospital data,which were required to the out-of-hospital patients, to callers.The SEMIC collects data from 61 medical institutes in Seouland receives more than 70,000 calls from lay persons per year(7). The calls relating out-of-hospital poisonings occupy 0.5%of the total calls. Until now, however, there has been neithertriage method nor toxic exposure surveillance system for theout-of-hospital poisoned patients. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a triage method to prevent the unnecessary ED visits of out-of-hos-pital poisoned patients.

FromOctober 2003 to September 2004, the calls that lay persons gave to the Seoul Emer-gency Medical Information Center to seek advices on the out-of-hospital poisonedpatients were enrolled. We designed a triage protocol that consisted of five factorsand applied it to the patients. According to the medical outcomes, we classified thepatients into two groups, the toxicity-positive and the toxicity-negative. We arrangedthe factors on the basis of the priority that was determined in order of the odds ratio of each factor for the toxicity-positive and made a flow chart as a triage method. The n we calculated a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative pre-dictive value of the method. We regarded the specificity as the ability of the methodand the sensitivity as the safety. A total of 220 patients were enrolled in this study.The method showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and nega-tive predictive value of 99.2%, 53.4%, 76.2%, and 97.9%, respectively. Our triagemethod prevented 53.4% of the unnecessary emergency department visits of out-of-hospital acutely poisoned patients, safely.

Study setting & population From October 2003 to September 2004, telephone calls that lay persons gave to the SEMIC to seek advices of us onpoisoned patients were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were the calls that were not able to offer adequate histories due to hang - up or inappropriate communication or the calls that werenot able to offer medical outcome during follow-up proce-dures (3). When the responders of SEMIC decided that thepatient had a critical situation requiring prompt resuscita-tion, they ordered the caller to start resuscitation withoutdelay and excluded the case from this study. Study protocol We designed a triage protocol consisted of five factors and applied it to the patients who were consecutively enrolled during the study period (Fig. 1). We used the list, 'the exam-p les of minimally toxic substances approved by the AAPCC panel', to distinguish minimally toxic substances from othertoxic substances (3). We also used four factors to decide pa- tient's disposition on the basis of the AAPCC panel's sugges-tio n, which were patient's intent, symptoms or signs, social environment, and individual patient circumstances (3). From the histories, we found out the identity of the sub- stances involved in the exposures, estimated the maximumamount of the substances, and secured the symptoms or signsthat the patients complained of (3). To identify the ingredi-ents of substances, we investigated web or references recom-mended in the guideline (3). If we failed to identify the ing-redients of substances, we regarded the substances as toxic. We regarded only the substances that were implicated in thelist as minimally toxic (3). According to the protocol, we divided the patients into the two groups, the high-risk group and the low-risk group(Fig. 1). Then, we recommended an immediate ED visit tothe patients in the high-risk group and recommended a close-observation in pre-hospital state to the patients in the low-risk group. To prevent adverse effects, we also recommend-ed they should visit ED as soon as possible, if the patients inthe low-risk group were in trouble during a period of obser-vation (9). Measurements Nine EMTs of SEMIC were educated on the protocol for 4 hr and obtained the histories of patients from callers accord-ing to the data table of TESS reports (10-13). Table 1 showsmedical outcomes. To acquire the medical outcomes of thepatients, follow-up procedures were performed. We made atelephone call to the caller within 3 months after the initialcall. If we had failed to connect the caller or acquire the medi-cal outcome of the patient from the caller till 3rd trial, weregarded the case as the follow-up failure and excluded it fromthis study. According to the medical outcomes, we assignedthe patients to the two groups, the toxicity-positive and thetoxicity-negative. Data analysis To determine of the priority of the factors in the triage pro- tocol, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) of each factor for th e toxicity-positive using chi-square test and Fisher's exact test of the SPSS 11.0 for Windows. On the basis of the priority,we developed a flow chart as a triage method. We also calcu- Factors Yes No 1. Minimally toxic substances? * 2. Un-intentional exposures? 3. Without symptoms or signs? 4.

We regarded the value of specificity as the ability to reduce of the unnecessaryED visits in the toxicity-negative group, and the value ofsensitivity as the safety of the method to recommend no EDvisit in the low risk group.RESULTS From October 2003 to September 2004, a total of 292 calls to seek the medical information relating poisoned patientswere given to the SEMIC by lay persons. Twenty six calls(8.9%) were not able to offer adequate histories. Of thesecalls, hang up were nineteen calls (73.1%) and inappropri-ate communication were seven calls (26.9%). One call (0.3%) required prompt resuscitation and we failed to obtain ade-quate histories from the caller. Forty five calls (15.4%) wereregarded as follow-up failure by us. During the follow-upprocedures, we failed to contact the caller in 32 calls (71.1%),and we failed to obtain medical outcome from the caller in13 calls (28.9%). Finally, two hundred twenty calls (75.4%)were included in this study and each call was attributable toa separate case. Table 2 and 3 display the obtained histories from the callers.

The value of sensitivity and specificity of the triage method was 99.2% and 53.4%, respectively (Table 5). Falsenegative case was shown in only one patient (1/48). The patient was a 32-yr-old male and exposed to small amount of Madecassol ointment by ingestion. After five min-u tes of the exposure, he made a call to the SEMIC without any symptoms or signs. The EMT of SEMIC classified himas the lower risk group and recommended to stay at home with observation. About 30 min later, he felt abdominal pai n and visited an ED. With an infusion of fluid and pain killer,abdominal pain was subsided. He was discharged from the hospital and did not complain of any more symptoms or signs. Of the 172 patients in the high-risk group, 41 patients (23.8%) were assigned to the toxicity-negative.

DISCUSSION The primary goals of the AAPCC guideline are to estab- lish principles to aid in identifying a minimally toxic sub-stance, to provide examples of substances that meet the prin-ciples, and to provide an approach to adding additional sub-stances to the list (3). It is the first standardized guideline forthe triage of the out-of-hospital poisoned patients and com-posed of methods of data collection, a definition of minimall y toxic substances, a consensus of the guideline, a process todetermine if a substance should be added to the minimallytoxic list, and a need of follow-up procedures (3). In the gui-deline, on the assumption that all substances are capable ofproducing toxicity and nothing is completely non-toxic, thepanel defined the minimally toxic substances as those whichproduce little toxicity, minor self-limited toxicity, or clinicallyinsignificant effect at most doses (3). After going over liter-atures and taking into account the expert opinions of its mem- bers, the panel selected 30 examples of minimally toxic sub-stances and then approved 25 among them (3). In the guide-line, the panel also suggested that the decisions regardingpatient disposition should take into account the patient's intent, symptoms, social environment, and individual patien t circumstances (e.g., pregnancy, pre-existing medical condi-tions, and current medications) (3). Of these contents of theguideline, we cited the minimally toxic list and the factorsthat should be considered in decisions regarding patient dis-position because the aim of this study was to develop andevaluate a triage method for the out-of-hospital poisonedpatients (Fig. 1). The sensitivity and the negative predictive value of the triage method were 99.2% and 97.9%, respectively (Table5). It means that the high-risk group designation predictsalmost all the toxicity positive patients. This method can beused safely. The specificity and the positive predictive valueof the method were 53.4% and 76.2%, respectively (Table5). It means that this triage method is able to reduce morethan a half of the unnecessary ED visits of the out-of-hospi-tal poisoned patients. However, the specificity and the posi-tive pr edictive value of the method were not so high. It might be an inevitable result in this study. Since it is impossible toprovide direct physical examinations or immediate therapeu-tic interventions to the poisoned patients by telephones, itis very important to reduce false negatives (3-5, 14). Madecassol ointment was the only one substance caused false negative in this study. It is composed of Centella asiatica products, neomycin, and hydrocortisone and it with antibiotics' (15). Accord-ing to minimally toxic substances approvedby the AAPCC panel', it is included in the minimally toxicsubstances (3). In a few cases, however, the Madecassol oint-ment ingestion has been reported to disturb digestive system and cause gastrointestinal symptoms, which would be fullyrecovered with appropriate therapies (15, 16).The most common cause of the false positives was the sub- stances regarded as toxic (Table 6). More substances should be identified as minimally toxic for the reduction of falsepositives, through the process proposed by the AAPCC panel,involving a review of current literatures, a thorough analysisof poison experience, and prospective validation (3). We designed this protocol with reference to the AAPCC guideline and collected data according to the data table ofTESS reports (2, 3, 11-13). However, there were some limi-tations addressed in the AAPCC guideline and TESS. Firstly, drug identification principles were not developed. Drug iden- tification practices varied from center to center throughoutthe United States and amount estimation depended on thehistories obtained from callers (5, 17). Secondly, the optimalsources for the outcome were not established (3, 5). The TESSdata recognized several different toxic effects as the medicaloutcome categories (10). However, the data had inherent limi- tations and using them alone was problema tic and not satis- factory (3). Additional data sources were required for the med- icaloutcome to provide an accurate perspe ctive on the feasi- bility of the triage method (3). For the additio nal data sources, we obtained more information during follow-up procedureson ED visits, therapeutic interventions, and hospital admis-sions. In addition to the above limitations, there were other limi- tations in this study. Firstly, the distribution of the study pop- ulation inclined toward the patients acutely exposed in safe environments. Most of the calls were given to us by the fami ly members at home (Table 2). In other words, most of the pa-tients were located in safe environments where their familymembers could take care of them. In addition, chronicallyexposed patients were not included (Table 2). Since most ofthe chronically poisoned patients had no idea of poisonings,they called us not to obtain information on poisonings butto obtain information on other problems, such as chronicheadache, chronic diarrhea, depression, or others. Initially,we could not recognize them as poisoned patients and failedto apply the protocol to them. Secondly, all exposures occurredin the restricted region, Seoul. Compared with 2003 annualreport of the AAPCC TESS, most of the demographic find-ings of this study were similar to those of the report, but thesubstances commonly involved in exposures of the two weredifferent (Table 3) (13). Many studies reported that the natureof exposure in one region can differ from that of another, andthe difference is determined by the regional environmentalfactors (17, 18). However, the EMTs of SEMIC providedadvices to the persons lived in Seoul, and they could not ob-tain information on toxic exposures occurred in other regionsthan Seoul in this study. Finally, we failed to identify the ingre- dient of herbs, Korean traditional herbal remedies. Most of the herbs are composed of several unknown plants and wewere not able to find any reference in the ingredient of theherbs. In this study, nine (4.1%) patients took the herbs andfive (2.3%) were intoxicated. The composition and the toxi-Clinical Application of AAPCC Guideline 341 cities of herbs should be identified through the process pro- posed by the AAPCC panel (3). Despite these limitations,this study was the first trial to develop and evaluate a triagemethod to prevent unnecessary ED visits of out-of-hospitalpoisoned patients, with reference to the AAPCC guideline. Our triage method with reference to 'the guideline for the out-of-hospital management of human exposures to mini-mally toxic substances' approved by the AAPCC consensuspanel pr evented more than half of unnecessary ED visits of out-of-hospital acutely poisoned patients, safely.
