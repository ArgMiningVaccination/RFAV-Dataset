This Marine Corps Order (MCO) is also a policy manual fo r the U.S. Marine Corps. The manual provides more detail for mishap, hazard (including near miss) and incident notification, investigation, reporting and record keeping by all Navy and Marine Corps commands, activities, units, installations and facilities , except for mishaps, hazards (including near misses ) and safety incidents that involve a defined naval aircraft . The Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6055.07 of 6 June 2011 and the Secretary of the Navy Instruction (SECNAV INST ) 5100.10L , direct t he Department of the Navy (DON) to establish policies and procedures for mishap investigations and record keeping . This manual implements the DON policies a s directed by both Department of Defense ( DoD ) and Secretary of the Navy ( SECNAV ) policies . The techniques, procedures and best practices (i.e., the how) for safety investigations and reporting on procedures for implementing the policies contained in this manual will be published in a guide that will be managed separately by the Commander, Naval Safety Center (COMNAVSAFECEN) . The title of the guide is \"The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide .\" COMNAVSAFECEN will announce the availability of the guide and future revisions of the guide by ALSAFE message . This manual is its first issuance and therefore should be reviewed in its entirety. This manual was developed to be the primary safety investigation and reporting policy for all Navy and Marine Corps activities, commands, personnel and contractors (i.e., the latter only when under the direct supervision of U.S. Government personnel). Due to the many unique and specific situations associated with aviation -related event s (i.e., excluding aviation ordnance ), these particular event s will b e handled under OPNAVINST 3750.6S and OPNAVINST 4790.2J . The Risk Management Information (RMI) program of record database application is required for reporting, recording and analyzing all mishaps, hazards (including near misses) and incidents . The RMI program of record database is DoD Common Access Card (CAC) enabled and is available on the Naval Sa fety Center (NAVSAFECEN) Web site . This manual may be accessed via the DON Issuances Web site (https://www.secnav.navy.mil/doni/opnav.aspx ) under the \"Manuals\" tab. It may also be accessed via the Marine Corps Publications Electronic Library (http://www.marines.mil/News /Publications/ELECTRONICLIBRARY.aspx ). This manual is approved for authorized registered users and distribution is unlimited.

Purpose . To provide a general introduction to safety reporting and state the various responsibilities for mishap, hazard (including near misses) and incident notification, investigation, reporting and record keeping for the Navy and Marine Corps. 102. General . a. Mishaps result in damaged or destroyed equipment ; injuries and fatalities to Sailors, Marines and civilians ; and degraded Navy and Marine Corps warfighting potential. When mishaps or near misses occur, we must investigate them thoroughly in or der to identify the factors and causes ; then, devise sufficient controls to prevent their reoccurrence. Additionally, as stated in OPNAV M -5100.23 of 5 June 2020, section A, we must continuously assess our operating environment to identify hazardous conditions and risks so that we can take proactive measures to reduce risk before mishaps occur. Finally, we must carefully monitor the risk controls already implemented in order to validate their effectiveness. When risks remain too high, new controls m ust be designed and implemented. This manual explains the responsibilities, requirements, policies and procedures to accomplish all of this effectively. This guidance forms a critical part of the mishap prevention program of the Naval Enterprise. b. The Naval Enterprise is a complex organization with diverse operations, processes and activities. The procedures to notify, investigate and report mishaps will vary based on these circumstances. For example, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O SHA) notification, reporting and record keeping requirements are unique when a work -related injury, illness or fatality involves one or more Department of Defense ( DoD ) civilian personnel or a contractor employee. The OSHA recordkeeping requirements do no t apply to active duty military personnel. This manual is organized in a way to help users understand these differences and more importantly, to help them find the correct procedures to follow depending on the specific circumstances of the event. 103. Policy. a. All Navy and Marine Corps commands and activities must protect DoD property from damage caused by Navy and Marine Corps operations; military personnel from accidental death, injury or work -related illness; and DoD civilian personnel from work -related death, injury or illness. b. All Navy and Marine Corps commands and activities must protect the public from risk of death, injury, illness or property damage because of Navy and Marine Corps operations. c. All Navy and Marine Corps commands and a ctivities must notify, investigate, report and maintain records of all mishaps, hazards (including near misses ) and incidents as required by this OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 1-2 manual. Compliance is essential so that the cumulative impact of mishaps and near misses can be understood, t rends can be analyzed and effective controls can be developed and implemented. Note: This manual does not apply to the reporting of mishaps involving a defined naval aircraft. Instead, refer to OPNAVINST 3750.6S. The reporting of mishaps involving aircraft used in the Naval Introductory Flight Evaluation (NIFE ) Program and used by military flying clubs are covered in this manual because these aircraft are not defined naval aircraft. d. All Navy and Marine Corps c ommands and activities must also take effective corrective actions in order to prevent future mishaps. e. All Navy and Marine Corps commands must protect personnel from coercion, discrimination or reprisal for reporting mishaps and hazards (including nea r misses ). 104. Definition of Terms . a. This manual uses the words \"will,\" \"must,\" \"should,\" \"may\" and \"can\" throughout. \"Will\" and \"must\" are directive in nature and require mandatory compliance. \"Should\" is a strong recommendation, but does not require compliance. \"May\" or \"can\" are optional in nature and do not require compliance. b. Mishap notification, investigation, reporting and record keeping language can sometimes be complicated by the fact that important terms are used differently by a gencies external to the Department of the Navy (DON). To the maximum extent possible, terms in this manual have been clearly defined using authoritative sources. These definitions are sometimes further amplified or qualified to explain exactly how the te rm will be used for the purposes of Navy and Marine Corps mishap notification, investigation, reporting and record keeping purposes. While a detailed glossary of terms is provided in appendix A and a list of abbreviations and acronyms is provided in appen dix B, some of the more important terms are discussed again in subparagraphs 104b(1) through 104b (15) to establish a good foundation for better understanding of this manual. (1) Event . A broad term used to describe an occurrence or series of occurrences. For DON safety reporting purposes, an event can be a mishap, hazard (including near miss es) or an incident. (2) Mishap . A mishap is an unplanned or unexpected event or series of eve nts, that results in damage to DoD property; work -related illness to DoD personnel; injury to on - or off - duty DoD military personnel; injury to on -duty DoD civilian personnel; or damage to non -DoD property or injury or illness to non -DoD personnel, caused by DoD activities. For purposes of DON safety reporting, events that meet the above criteria must also meet the minimum damage and injury or illness thresholds of a Class D mi shap to be considered a mishap. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 1-3 Note: Class E mishap reporting is only a DON requirement under certain specific circumstances that are explained in this manual or when a controlling command directs its subordinates to report Class E mishaps. Controlling commands must put such a requirement in writing. (3) Hazard . Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness or death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property or mission degradation. Hazards are divided into the two categories listed in subparagraphs 104b(3)(a) and 104b(3)(b). (a) An act or event (i.e., near miss) that may have resulted in a mishap where the fatality, injury, illness, property damage or loss of an asset was avoided merely by chance, the actions of an individual or individuals, a small measure of distance or a few moments in time. (b) A workplace condition that might result in injury, health impairment, illness, disease or fatality to any person who is exposed to the condition or which might result in damage to or loss of property or equipment. (4) Incident . A planned or unplanned occurrence or series of occurrences resulting in injury or damage that does not meet mishap reporting criteria or is exempt from safety reporting. (5) Safety Reporting . A general term that encompasses all aspects of the process to notify, report and keep records of mishaps, hazards (including near misses) and incidents required by this manual. (6) Hazard Reporting . The process of reporting a real or potentially hazardous event (i.e., near miss) or workplace condition that could cause in jury, illness or death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property or mission degradation to the Naval Enterprise. Hazard reporting is a subset of safety reporting. See paragraph 417 for more detailed information on hazard reporting. (7) Reportable Mishap . An event that meets or exceeds mishap damage thresholds or mishap injury or illness thresholds of civilian, contractor and military personnel and must be investigated and reported. Note: OSHA uses this term to characterize serious occurrences involving work -related injury or illness of civilian and contractor employees that require the OSHA to be notified. (8) Recordable Mishap . An occurrence involving a civilian or contractor employee that requires the creation of a record due to a work -related injury or illness that met specified criteria established by the OSHA per part 1904 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). For the purposes of Navy and Marine Corps safety reporting, the term's use will be limited to events involving Government civilian and contractor work -related injury and illness reporting to the OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 1-4 OSHA. Contractors must meet the subpart 1904.31 applicability and be supervised by Government personnel on a day -to-day basis. Day -to-day supervision includes supervising not only the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, but also the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished. (9) Reporting Custodian . Commanding officers and, in some cases, officers -in-charge (OIC) of detachment operations of Navy and Marine Corps organizations who are responsible for or otherwise provide information about, assigned assets and personnel. (10) Accounting Organization . The reporting custodian that experien ced the loss of or damage to an owned asset ; or the fatality, injury or work -related illness of an assigned person or persons in a mishap ; and is responsible for or is assigned responsibility for, safety reporting, regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the event's occurrence. There is one accounting organization for each mishap. Note : See subparagraph 403a for the policy to determine the accounting organization when multiple commands are involved in a mishap. The accounting organization assignment is not affected when a convening authority appoints a safety investigation board to investigate the mishap or the accounting organization relies on its higher headquarters to submit a safety investigation report (SI REP) into the RMI on the command's behalf. (11) Notification . To give notice or to inform. For DON safety reporting purposes, notification means an event has occurred which is expected to meet defined thresholds and that certain individuals, commands or activities must be informed of the event. The method of notification (e.g., telephonic, naval message) and the timeliness of notification will often be prescribed. (12) Safety Investigation . A general term that refers to the investigation of mishap s, hazards (including near misses ) and incidents by either a single investigating officer (SIO) or a safety investigation board (SIB) . The purpose of a safety investigation is to prevent mishaps. A safety investigation is not a Judge Advocate General Man ual (JAGMAN) or command investigation used to assign personnel accountability and must not be used to place blame or punish those involved. (13) SIO. An individual who has been directed to perform a safety investigation by a convening authority . The individual is solely responsible for completing the safety investigation and drafting and submitting required report(s) and records. The SIO may receive assistance from subject matter experts (SME) in the performance of their duties. An SIO is oft en an individual assigned to a safety billet (e.g., safety officer or safety manager ), but that is not always a requirement. (14) SIB. A group of individuals who have been appointed to complete a safety investigation by a convening authority . Individu als are assigned to the SIB because either they OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 1-5 are a n SME or they have specific expertise necessary to the investigation. Members of an SIB must be designated in writing for each specific safety investigation. One member of the SIB must be designated th e senior member. (15) Risk Management Information (RMI) Program of Record (POR) . The sole official DON web-based database application for safety reporting. The shortened acronym RMI is synonymous with the RMI POR. Note: Navy and Marine Corps personnel must use the RMI to report mishaps, hazards (including near misses ) and incidents required by this manual. 105. Types of Safety Investigations . There are two different means to conduct safety investigations: Investigation s conducted by an SIO and those conducted by an SIB. a. SIB Investigations. Some events require an investigation by an SIB. The specific criteria for making that determination can be found in chapter 4. Convening Authorities may also direct that an SIB conduct a safety investigation even though it is not required. Safety investigations that are not conducted by an SIB are to be conducted by an SIO. b. SIO Investigations. For events in which a safety investigation by an SIB is not required or dire cted, an SIO conducts the safety investigation. To the maximum extent possible, these SIO investigations should be assigned to a trained safety and occupational health professional or safety officer (primary or collateral duty) per the training requiremen ts in either OPNAV M - 5100.23 of 5 June 2020, paragraph B0607 (i.e., Navy) or MCO 5100.29C volume s 1 and 9 (i.e., Marine Corps) . c. Both types of safety investigations must focus on determining what happened, why it happened and what risk controls are nec essary to prevent re occurrence as further explained in this manual. Note: The Chief of Naval Operations Special Assistant for Safety Matters (CNO N09F) or the Director, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Safety Division (CMC (SD)) may direct an independent safety investigation of any event. These independent safety investigations do not relieve commanders of their responsibilities for safety investigation s and reporting as required by this manual. 106. Deviations and Variances . Only CNO N09F or the Director, CMC (SD) (as appropriate) may authorize any deviation or variance from the policies and procedures contained in this manual. Requests for deviation or variance to policies specified in this manual must be thoroughly justified and submitted via o fficial correspondence (i.e., naval message or naval letter).

Purpose . To provide an overview of the safety reporting process to assist users in determining whether an event meets the criteria as a reportable Department of Defense ( DoD ) mishap and the steps to follow to notify, investigate and report DoD mishaps. This cha pter will also provide information about what constitutes OSHA recordable events applicable when injuries occur to Department of the Navy ( DON ) civilian personnel. Additional details and amplification on reporting DoD mishaps and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA ) recordable events are provided in the chapters that follow. 202. Applicability . This chapter is applicable to all categories of mishaps except those that involve a defined naval aircraft. For mishaps involving a defined nava l aircraft, see OPNAVINST 3750.6S. Note: Aviation ordnance mishaps that do not involve a defined naval aircraft are considered weapons mishaps and the procedures in this manual are applicable. 203. Background . a. Chapter 1 provided a working definitio n of a mishap: An unplanned event or series of events, that resulted in damage to DoD property; work -related illness to DoD personnel; injury to on- or off -duty DoD military personnel; injury to on -duty DoD civilian personnel; or damage to non-DoD propert y or injury or illness to non -DoD personnel, caused by DoD activities. The definition was further qualified by stating that events must also meet minimum damage and injury or illness thresholds to be considered a mishap for reporting purposes . Additional ly, there are some events that meet the definition of a DoD reportable mishap, but are exempted from reporting, per DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011. b. Chapter 1 also provided a definition of a recordable event as an occurrence involving civilian personnel o r contractor employees that requires the creation of a record due to a work - related injury or illness that met specified criteria established by the OSHA per the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 29, section 1904. It is important to note that the te rms recordable or OSHA recordable and the procedures that must be followed for such events, are only applicable to work -related illnesses and injuries to DON civilian personnel and, in some cases, civilian contractor employees. Those responsible for safet y investigations and safety reporting need not concern themselves with OSHA recordable requirements when no work - related illnesses or injuries to DON civilian personnel or civilian contractors has occurred. If the contractor's employee is under the day -to-day supervision of the contractor, then the contractor is responsible for recording the work -related injury or illness. If the DON command supervises the contractor employee's work on a day -to-day basis, then it must be recorded by the DON command. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-2 Note: Day-to-day supervision includes supervising not only the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, but also the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished. 204. Policy . a. All events that meet the definition of a reportable DoD mishap and are not exempted, must be investigated and reported per the guidelines established in this manual, with the exception of mishaps involving a defined naval aircraft. Safety investigation reports ( SIREP) must be submitted in the Risk Management Information ( RMI ) within 30 calendar days of the mishap for SIO investigations or 30 calendar days of convening for SIB investigations. b. Most events that result in damage and injury or illness that fall below the minimum reporting threshold s (i.e., below the Class D threshold for on -duty events and below the Class C threshold for off -duty events) or are specifically exempt from mishap reporting, do not require a safety investigation or report. However, some events trigger mandatory safety reporting requirements no matter the damage, injury or illness. These event types are clearly explained and must be reported per paragraph 218 . Note: Controlling commands are authorized to direct subordinate units to rep ort events below the minimum thresholds set forth in this manual (e.g., some on duty Class E mishaps, off- duty injuries below the Class C level ) if they believe that by doing so furthers their mishap prevention efforts. In those cases, an on duty Class E event can be reported as a Class E mishap in RMI and off -duty injuries below the Class C level must be reported as \"incidents\" in RMI. If done, the controlling command must state the requirement in writing. c. Each mishap must be assigned at least one m ishap category. When more than one mishap category has been assigned to a mishap, one must clearly be identified as the principal category. 205. Mishap Notification, Investigation and Reporting Procedures . After an event has occurred that resulted in damage, injury or illness, follow the steps shown in table 2 -1 to validate a reporting requirement and to determine the procedures to follow and actions to take. Amplification and additional information is provided later in this chapter and in other chapt ers in this manual, as indicated. Step Number Step Description Step Procedure 1a Determine if a mishap occurred. Refer to paragraph 206. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-3 Step Number Step Description Step Procedure Use figure 2 -1 to make an initial determination if a mishap occurred. Then proceed to step 1b to reference more specific reportability criteria. 1b Review reportability criteria to confirm mishap occurrence. Refer to paragraph 207 and chapter appendices 2-A through 2 -E. Use this more detailed information to validate that a mishap has occurred. If yes, continue to step 2 in this table. If no, go to step 11 to determine if another type of safety report is required. 2 Determine if the mishap is exempt fro m reporting. Refer to paragraph 208. Use table 2 -4 to determine if the mishap is exempt from DoD and DON mishap reporting. If not exempt, proceed to step 3 in this table. If exempt, go to step 11 to determine if another type of report is required. 3 Determine the mishap category and sub - category. Refer to paragraph 209. Use tables 2 -5 through 2 -8 to determine the mishap category and sub -categories. If the mishap has more than one category, identify the principal category. Once complete, go to step 4a and 4b in this table. 4a Determine the estimated mishap costs. Refer to paragraph 210. Use table 2-9 and the information in the paragraph to compute an estimated mishap cost. This estimate is needed to complete step 5. 4b Determine the estimated personnel illness or injury category. Refer to paragraph 211. Use the information in the paragraph to compute an estimated illness or injury category. This estimate is needed to complete step 5. 5 Determine a DON mishap class. Refer to paragraph 212. Use figure 2 -2 to determine a DON mishap class. If insufficient information exists immediately following a mishap to accurately determine the mishap class, then OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-4 Step Number Step Description Step Procedure choose the highest mishap class based on the available information. Once complete, go to step 6 in this table. 6 Determine whether the mishap is in a DoD special reporting group. Note: DoD special reporting groups are important in determining some notification requirements. Refer to paragraph 213. Use table 2 -10 to determine whether the mishap is in a DoD special reporting group. Once complete, go to step 7 in this table. 7 Notify appropriate officials based on mishap class, category, DoD special reporting group and amplifying instructions. Using the information from step 6, follow the notific ation procedures provided in chapter 3. Once complete, go to step 8 in this table. 8 Investigate the mishap. Investigate the mishap using the guidelines provided in chapter 4. Once complete, go to step 9 in this table. 9 Report the mishap. Prepare and submit the SIREP using the guidelines provided in chapter 4. SIREPs must be submitted in the RMI within 30 calendar days of the mishap for SIO investigations or 30 calendar days of convening for SIB investigations. If DON civilian personnel suffered work -related illnesses or injuries, go to step 10 in this table. 10 Enter required information into the RMI for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA ) recordable Refer to paragraph 217. Enter required information into the RMI for OSHA recordable events involving civilian personnel . OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-5 Step Number Step Description Step Procedure events involving civilian personnel. Note: OSHA reporting applies only to DON civilian work - related illnesses or injuries. OSHA reporting does not apply to injuries or illnesses of military personnel. 11 Determine if the event that is not a DoD mishap still requires a mandatory safety report. Refer to paragraph 218 and chapter appendices 2 -A through 2 -E to determine whether the event still requires a mandatory safety report. Table 2 -1. Procedures for t he Notification, Investigation and Reporting of DoD and DON Mishaps 206. Step 1a. Determine if a Mishap Occurred . Use figure 2 -1 to make an initial determination if a mishap occurred. Figure 2 -1. Confirming Occurrence of a Mishap Did an event occur resulting in death, injury, illness, or property damage? Was the outcome of the event intended? Mishap Occurred Not a Mishap YES NO NO YES OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-6 207. Step 1b. Review Reportability Criteria to Confirm Mishap Occurrence . Use the criteria in paragraphs 207a through 207i to confirm which events are considered reportable by DoD and DON. Broad guidance on reportability is provided here. Additionally, this chapter has separate chapter appendices for reportable and recordab le event criteria involving Military Personnel (Appendix 2 -A), Civilian Personnel (Appendix 2 -B), Contractors (Appendix 2 -C), Non - Department of the Navy Civilians (Appendix 2 -D) and Materiel and Property Damage (Appendix 2 -E). These chapter appendices pro vide a ready reference that augment the information provided in this chapter. Users should consult each of the various chapter 2 appendices on reportable and recordable criteria for other possible event types that may be applicable. Note: See chapter 7 for the requirements for maintaining written or electronic records of reportable events. a. Events may involve more than one type of mishap. If more than one type applies, then use the most severe one for classification purposes. Be sure to consult each of the various paragraphs and chapter 2 appendices for the criteria and all event types that may be applicable. b. Whether a case involves a work -related injury or illness is determined by the nature of the original incident or exposure which caused the case, not by the resulting condition of the affected employee. (1) In general, injuries are caused by instantaneous events in the work environment. Examples of exceptions to this general rule are a physical training injury over time such as knee damage, carpel tunnel syndrome, cumulative trauma disorder, repetitive strain injury, etc. Therefore, in general, cases resulting from anything other than in stantaneous events are considered illnesses. This concept of illnesses includes acute illnesses which result from exposures of relatively short duration. (2) For on -duty civilian personnel and contractor employees, the OSHA has several exceptions to th e general rule of instantaneous events for work -related injuries. Examples of these general rule exceptions by the OSHA are a fatality, loss of an eye, amputation, loss of consciousness and in-patient hospitalization. These OSHA exceptions are briefly de scribed in subparagraphs 207b(2)(a) through 207b(2)(e) and in chapter appendices 2 -B and 2 -C. (a) Fatality. On -duty work -related injury or illness that resulted in a fatality occurring within 30 days of that work -related injury or illness . A work -related fatality caused by a heart attack must be reported to the OSHA. The local OSHA Area Office director will decide whether to investigate the event, depending on the circumstances of the heart attack. (b) Loss of an Eye. On -duty loss of an eye, tha t occurred within 24 hours of a work - related injury or illness . OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-7 (c) Amputation. On -duty t raumatic loss of a limb or other external body part, that occurred within 24 hours of a work -related injury or illness . (d) Loss of Consciousness. On -duty work -related injury or illness that resulted in a loss of consciousness, regardless of the length of time unconscious . (e) In-Patient Hospitalization. On -duty work -related injury or illness that resulted in the in -patient hospitalization (i.e., beyond observation, diagnostic testing, administrative reasons or counseling) of one or more employees, occurring within 24 hours of that work -related injury or illness) . An in-patient hospitalization caused by a heart attack must be reported to the OSHA. The local OSHA Area Office director will decide whether to investigate the event, depending on the circumstances of the heart attack. c. Some conditions may be classified as either an injury or an illness (but not both), depending upon the nature of the even t that produced the condition. For example, a loss of hearing resulting from an explosion (i.e., an instantaneous event) is classified as a work -related injury; the same condition arising from exposure to industrial noise over a period of time would be cl assified as a work -related illness. d. On and off -duty determination . (1) Use table s 2-2 and 2-3 to make military personnel or DoD civilian personnel on- and off-duty determination s, respectively, for safety reporting purposes . Note: The \"on -duty\" definition is for safety reporting purposes only and bears no relationship to compensation determinations.

Table 2 -3. DoD Civilian Personnel Duty Determinations for Safety Reporting Purposes (2) Work Relatedness for DoD Civilian Personnel. For civilian personnel, work - relatedness is also used to make an on- or off -duty determinations. Work -relatedness is described in subparagraphs 207d(2)(a) and 207d(2)(b). (a) Civilian personnel are considered on -duty when an injury or illness occurs while an employee is working at home, including work in a home office, the injury or illness occurs while the employee is performing work for pay or compensation in the home and the injury or illness is directly related to the performance of work rather than to the general home environment or setting. For example (per 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(7), with DON duty determinations added) , if an employee drops a box of work documents and injures his or her foot, the case is considered work -related and the employee is considered on -duty. If an employee's fingernail is punctured by a needle from a sewing machine used to perform garment work at home, becomes infected and requires medical treatment, the injury is considered work -related and the employee is considered on -duty. If an employee is injured because he or she trips on the fam ily dog while rushing to answer a work phone call, the case is not considered work -related and the employee is not considered on -duty. If an employee working at home is electrocuted because of faulty home wiring, the injury is not considered work -related and the employee is not considered on -duty. (b) Work -relatedness (i.e., being on -duty) is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the wor k environment, unless one of the exceptions in subparagraphs 207d (2)(b)1 through 207d (2)(b)10 specifically applies. If an exception applies, the event or exposure is not considered on -duty: 1. At the time of the injury or illness, the civilian employee was present in the work environment as a member of the general publi c rather than as an employee. 2. The injury or illness involves signs or symptoms that surface at work but result solely from a non -work -related event or exposure that occurs outside the work environment. 3. The injury or illness results solely from voluntary participation in a wellness program or in a medical, fitness or recreational activity, such as blood donation, physical examination, flu shot, exercise class, racquetball or baseball. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-12 4. The injury or illness is solely the result of a civilian employee eating, drinking or preparing food or drink for personal consumption ( i.e., whether bought on the premises or brought in). For example, if the civilian employee is injured by choking on a sandwich while in the workplace, the case would not be considered work -related. Note: If the civilian employee is made ill by ingesting food contaminated by workplace contaminants (such as lead) or gets food poisoning from food supplied by the organization, the ca se would be considered work -related. 5. The injury or illness is solely the result of a civilian employee doing personal tasks that are unrelated to their employment in the workplace outside of the employee's assigned working hours. 6. The injury or illness is solely the result of personal grooming or self - medication for a nonwork -related condition. 7. The injury or illness is intentionally self -inflicted. 8. The injury or illness is caused by a motor vehicle accident and occurs on a company parking lot or company access road while the employee is commuting to or from work. Driving to and from lunch is not considered on -duty. 9. The illness is the common cold or flu. Note: Contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, brucellos is, hepatitis A, plague and Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) are considered work -related if the civilian employee is infected at work. 10. The illness is a mental illness. Mental illness will not be considered work - related unless the civilian empl oyee voluntarily provides his or her supervisor with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care professional with appropriate training and experience (e.g., psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a menta l illness that is work -related. e. Defining military personnel involvement for reportability purposes. All of the personnel in subparagraphs 207e(1) through 207e(5) are considered military personnel, where at least one of the personnel (i.e., military or civilian) involved in an event is assigned to the Navy or Marine Corps. (1) Personnel on active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty for training in the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S . Space Force and U.S. Coast Guard; OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-13 (2) Personnel on active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty for training in the National Guard of the United States under the provisions of either Title 10, U.S. Code (i.e., Federally funded, command and control with the President of the United States through combatant commanders) or Title 32, U.S. Code (i.e., Federally funded, command and control with the State Governor through the Adjutant General); (3) Personnel on active duty in a Naval Militia unde r the provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code; (4) Cadets of the U.S. Military Academy; midshipmen of the U.S. Naval Academy; cadets of the U.S. Air Force Academy; cadets of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy; and midshipmen of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy when engaged in directed training activities with a DoD component or the U.S. Coast Guard; (5) Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets or midshipmen when engaged in directed training activities; officer accession program students when engaged in direct ed training activities; and foreign national military personnel assigned to a DoD component or the U.S. Coast Guard. f. Defining civilian personnel involvement for reportability purposes. All of the personnel in subparagraphs 207f(1) through 207f(3) are civilian personnel, when on duty, where at least one of the personnel (i.e., military or civilian) involved in an event is assigned to the Navy or Marine Corps. (1) Federal Civilian Personnel. All career, career conditional and temporary (full -time, part-time, intermittent) personnel, who are subject to civil service regulations, paid from appropriated Federal funds and covered by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. This excludes civilians paid by appropriated funds on a c ontract or fee basis. (2) Non-Appropriated Fund Civilian Personnel. All civilian personnel whose employment by the U.S. Government is paid by non -appropriated funds and are covered by the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act. This excludes ci vilians paid by non - appropriated funds on a contract or fee basis. (3) Foreign National Civilian Personnel. Includes foreign nationals employed by the U.S. Government in direct ( i.e., appropriated or non -appropriated funds) or indirect hire ( i.e., contract or fee basis) status when the U.S. Government has supervisory control. It excludes those paid by contract or fee basis when the host government has supervisory control. Navy and Marine Corps commands and installations must review and determine if th e host nation injury and illness reporting and compensation systems supersede DoD requirements per the status of forces' agreement. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-14 g. Reportability C riteria for Contractor Personnel I nvolvement. Contractor personnel are non-federal employee s performing under a DoD contract, whether as prime contractor or subcontractor. h. Reportability C riteria for Non-Department of the Navy (Non -DON) Civilians . Persons listed in subparagraphs 207h (1)(a) and 207h (1)(b) are considered Non -DON civilian s. (a) Personnel employed by other Federal or D oD agencies not assigned to the Navy or Marine Corps . (b) All other civilians and foreign nationals not employed by the Navy or Marine Corps (e.g., civilian guest, patron, military family member, etc.). Note: For purposes of this manual, these groups will be collectively referred to as Non-DON Civilians. (2) A Navy or Marine Corps caused non -DON civilian fatality, injury or illness is reportable when the non -DON civilian fatality, injury or illness was caused wholly or in part, by a Navy or Marine Corps operation, activity or evolution. Notes: Examples include family fun day; \"A Day in Their Boots\"; \"Jane Wayne Day\"; -sponsored retirement ceremony; sale; military ball; static display; demonstration of operational capability; Morale, Welfare and Recreation event; Marine Corps Community Services event; etc. The Navy or Marine Corps command or activity responsible for the operation, activity or evolution tha t caused the fatality, injury or illness of affected non -DON civilians will record the mishap. i. Fatality, Injury or Illness of a Health Care Provider Engaged in Patient Care. (1) Navy or Marine Corps Civilian Health Care Provider Mishap. A health c are provider mishap that occurs to a Navy or Marine Corps civilian health care provider engaged in patient care (i.e., medical, dental or pharmaceutical) for a Navy or Marine Corps unit, is a work -related mishap and both an OSHA recordable event and a DON reportable mishap. (2) Military Health Care Provider Mishap. A health care provider mishap that occurs to a military health care provider engaged in patient care (i.e., medical, dental or pharmaceutical) for a Navy or Marine Corps unit is a work -relate d mishap and only a DON reportable mishap. 208. Step 2. Determine if the Mishap is Exempt from Reporting . If a mishap occurred, use table 2-4 to determine if the mishap is exempt from DoD and DON mishap reporting. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-15 Note: Events that are exempt for DoD and DON mishap reporting are not necessarily exempt from reporting to the OSHA. All work -related illnesses and injuries to DON civilian personnel are still considered an OSHA recordable event per Title 29, Code of Federal Re gulations, part 1904, subparts C, D, E and G . For these cases, follow the steps in paragraph 217. Exemption Number Exemption Condition Description 1 Mishaps involving destruction of or serious damage to nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems or nuclear weapons components, resulting in an actual or potential threat to national security or life and property. 2 Damage or injury by direct action of an enemy to include maneuvering conducted relative to hostile fire or a perceived hostile threat or hostile force, not including suspected cases of friendly fire. Amplification: An injury or fatality that occurred in a combat zone and was the result of an actual or suspected case of \"friendly fire\" is not exempt. 3 Injuries associated with non-occupational diseases, when the disease, not the injury, is the proximate cause of the lost time, such as diabetes and its resultant complications like loss of vision; but , not including complications of the injury (such as the infection of a cut aggra vated by a work -related activity) that result in lost time. 4 Injuries resulting from altercations, attack or assault, unless injuries of this type were incurred in the performance of official duties. Amplification: Violence or the threat of violence, a gainst on -duty personnel (workplace violence) is not exempt. Examples of workplace violence include on-duty cases of injury or illness resulting from sexual assault, being assaulted while standing duty or conducting an inspection, civil disorders, riots, sabotage, terrorist activities and arson. Note: Sexual assault is a \"Privacy Concern Case.\" 5 Injuries sustained before entry into Military Service or employment by the U.S. Government, unless the injuries were specifically aggravated or accelerated by current tenure of service. 6 Injuries resulting from pre -existing musculoskeletal disorders, unless the injuries were specifically aggravated or accelerated by current tenure of service. 7 Intentional, controlled jettison or release, during flight, of ca nopies, cargo, doors, drag chutes, hatches, life rafts, auxiliary fuel tanks, missiles, drones, rockets, non -nuclear munitions and externally carried equipment not essential to flight when there is no injury, no reportable damage to the aircraft or other property and, in the case of missiles, drones or non-nuclear munitions, when the reason for jettison is not malfunction. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-16 Exemption Number Exemption Condition Description 8 Replacement of component parts due to normal wear and tear, which is beyond the scope or definition of the affected time between overhaul of component and when any associated damage is confined to the component part. Notes: This exemption only applies to items that are normally used until they fail or until predetermined wear limits are reached. The need for replacement may not b e evident until malfunction or failure of the part. Resultant damage to other components is reportable. 9 Attempted or consummated suicide, murder or intentionally self -inflicted injuries. 10 Inpatient hospitalization for treatment where the patient is retained beyond the day of admission solely for administrative reasons unless other reporting criteria are met (e.g., medical treatment beyond first aid). 11 Inpatient hospitalization solely for observation, counseling or diagnostic testing or for adminis trative reasons not related to the immediate injury or occupational illness, unless other reporting criteria are met (e.g., medical treatment beyond first aid). 12 Injuries resulting from minimum stress and strain (simple, natural and nonviolent body posi tions or actions, as in dressing, sleeping, coughing or sneezing).

Afloat Mishaps Resulting from or During the Operation of a DoD Vessel, Including DoD Diving or Swimmer Operations f. Exposure to Chemical Agents . Military munitions containing chemical agents are not in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps inventory; however, personnel could be injured if exposed to old chemical agents accidentally during either r ecovery or clean -up operations. In the unlikely event that this occurs, refer to DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011 to determine the correct mishap category, DoD special reporting requirements and notification requirements. 210. Step 4a. Determine the Estimate d Mishap Cost . Note: The process outlined here will be used both to determine initial estimated costs and to finalize mishaps costs during the mishap investigation process. a. The total cost of an event is determined by adding all actual or estimated c osts. For initial estimates, include costs that are both known and reasonably available. Actual costs are preferred, if known. When determining final mishap costs, use actual costs. b. Calculated personnel costs resulting from fatalities, injuries and illnesses (i.e., to include disabilities) must not be used to determine a mishap class. However, unplanned military and civilian labor costs will be used to determine a mishap class. Note: Calculated personnel costs resulting from fatalities, injuries and illnesses will be collected when applicable but will only be used for internal DoD analysis, not for mishap class determination. c. Cost estimates are prepared solely for safety purposes. They are not intended to reflect, in any way, the extent of any party's damages or liability for purposes of administrative claims or litigation. Therefore, when prepared in written form, all cost estimates must conspicuously state: \"This estimate is prepared solely for safety purposes. It is not intended to ref lect, in any way, the extent of any party's damages or liability for purposes of administrative claims or litigation.\" OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-22 d. When damage occurs to Navy or Marine Corps property as a result of non -U.S. Government (i.e., contractor or private citizen) activit ies, any damage to non -U.S. Government property is not considered in determining costs. For example, a parked Navy van is damaged, while off base, by a light pole knocked over by a private vehicle. Only the Navy van damage costs would be considered. e. Property damage cost information, including estimates, will be provided by the activity experiencing the loss. f. Use table 2 -9 to determine mishap costs. Additional amplification on determining mishap property costs is provided subparagraph 210g and in The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide .

Restitution does not focus on a claimant's losses. Table 2 -9. Mishap Cost Determination g. Mishap property cost determination. Use the guidance in subparagraphs 210g(1) through 210g(10) to determine the total costs of damage to DoD property and non -DoD property as a result of a mishap. (1) Calculate the total property cost of a mishap by adding all of the costs associated with one or more relevant cost subcategories listed in table 2 -9. (2) Do not include the costs in subparagraphs 210g(2)(a) or 210g(2)(b) when calculating the cost of a mishap: (a) Any further DoD property damage or fuel loss resulting from rescue or salvage. (b) The cost of intentionally jettisoned items. (3) Computing the direct cost of damage to DoD or non -DoD property. Use the actual cost of repair or replacement (including work hours for repair) or the best official estimate available. When multiple plausible total cost estimates are availab le, use the estimate most likely to represent the actual mishap cost to the government. (4) When components are damaged to the extent they must be sent to a repair facility, the cost of damage must be reported as the actual cost for repairs, if such fig ures are available. (5) If actual repair costs cannot be determined: (a) Use the established standard repair costs of the repair facility, if available or (b) Use the standard repair costs disseminated by NAVSAFECEN , if available or (c) If neither of the repair costs figures in subparagraphs 210g(5)(a) and 210g(5)(b) are available, the reported cost for repair will be computed at 15 percent of the initial unit cost. (6) For components, including engines or engine modules that are damaged b eyond economical repair use the replacement cost, not the initial cost. The man -hours required to remove and replace the engines or engine modules must also be included. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-25 (7) Include in the cost the man -hours spent to remove undamaged parts to gain acces s to those that are damaged. Do not include man -hours spent removing or disassembling undamaged parts to gain access to areas where damage is suspected unless damage is found. (8) Include man -hours spent in anticorrosive work following salt water immer sion, as the result of the mishap. (9) Do not include those man -hours spent setting up or staging support equipment in preparation for the repair effort. (10) Do not include the costs to rent commercial equipment or space to perform repair work. 211. Step 4b. Determine the Estimated Personnel Illness or Injury Category . The definitions in subparagraphs 211a through 211k , available both here and in the glossary, will assist in making an estimated personnel illness or injury determination that may be needed in Step 5. a. Fatality. A death resulting from a mishap or work -related injury or illness. b. First Aid. First aid means doing any of the actions in subparagraphs 211b(1) through 211b(14). (1) Using a non -prescription medication at nonp rescription strength (for medications available in both prescription and non -prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed health care professional to use a non -prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical t reatment for record keeping purposes); (2) Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, such as hepatitis B vaccine or rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment); (3) Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin ; (4) Using wound coverings , such as bandages, Band -Aids, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly bandages or Steri -Strips (other wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, etc., are considered medical treatment); (5) Using hot or cold therapy; (6) Using any non -rigid means of support, such as elastic bandages, wraps, non -rigid back belts, etc. (devices with rigid stays or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are considered medical treatment for record keeping purposes); OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-26 (7) Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings, neck collars, back boards, etc.); (8) Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure or draining fluid from a blister; (9) Using eye patch es; (10) Removing foreign bodies from the eye using only irrigation or a cotton swab; (11) Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs or other simple means; (12) Using finger guards; (13) Using massages (physical therapy or chiropractic treatment are considered medical treatment for record keeping purposes); or (14) Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress. c. Hospitalization. The admission of personnel to a hospital or shipb oard medical facility on an in -patient basis. d. Illness and Disease. A non -traumatic physiological harm or loss of capacity produced by systemic; continued or repeated stress or strain; exposure to hazardous noise, toxins, poisons, fumes, etc. or other continued and repeated exposures to conditions of the environment over a long period of time. For practical purposes, an occupational (i.e., work -related) illness or disease are any reported condition that does not meet the definition of injury. Illness includes both acute (i.e., extremely severe, short -term and dangerous) and chronic illnesses (i.e., present over a long period of time, recurring, cumulative effects or habitual), such as, but not limited to, noise - induced hearing loss, a skin disease or disorder, respiratory conditions or poisoning. Illnesses include: (1) Skin Diseases or Disorders. Illnesses involving a worker's skin that are caused by work exposure to chemicals, plants or other substances. Examples: Contact dermatitis, eczema or rash caused by primary irritants and sensitizers or poisonous plants; oil acne; friction blisters, chrome ulcers; and inflammation of the skin. (2) Respiratory Conditions. Illnesses associated with breathing hazardous biological agents, chemicals, dus t, gases, vapors or fumes at work. Examples: Silicosis, asbestosis, pneumonitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis or acute disease, tuberculosis, occupational (i.e., work -related) asthma, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, toxic inhalation injury, such as metal fume fever, chronic obstructive bronchitis and other pneumoconioses.

(4) Noise -Induced Hearing Loss. A change in hearing threshold relative to the baseline audiogram of an average of 10 decibels (dB) or more in either ear at 2000, 3000 and 4000 hertz (Hz) and the employee's total hearing level is 25 dB or more above audiometric zero (also averaged at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz) in the same ear(s). Note: Hearing losses from either a punctured eardrum or an acoustic trauma from a one - time blast or over -pressure are injuries, not illnesses. (5) All Other Occupational Illnesses. All o ther occupational (i.e., work -related) illnesses. Examples: Heatstroke, sunstroke, heat exhaustion, heat stress and other effects of environmental heat; freezing, frostbite and other effects of exposure to low temperatures; decompression sickness; effect s of ionizing radiation (e.g., isotopes, X-rays, radium); effects of nonionizing radiation (e.g., welding flash, ultraviolet rays, lasers); anthrax; bloodborne pathogenic diseases, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C; brucellosis; malignant or benign tumors; histoplasmosis; and coccidioidomycosis. e.

The injury is identifiab le as to the time and place of occurrence and member or function of the body affected and is caused by a specific event or series of events in a single day or work shift. f. Light D uty. Applicable only to military personnel. The civilian equivalent of light duty is restricted work activity or job transfer. A duty status recommended after treatment of an injury that stipulates exactly the limitations on a military member during the recommended period, equivalent to placing a civilian in a restricted work status. When an injury or work - related illness results in light -duty days, assigned light duty days are not counted as lost workdays. On light duty, the military member normally remains at their original duty station but is gainfully employed even t hough not p erforming their normal duties . g. Limited Duty. Applicable only to military personnel. The civilian equivalent of limited duty is restricted work activity or job transfer. A military duty status formally assigned a s a result of a medical bo ard. Time spent on limited duty is not chargeable as lost time regardless of OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-28 the cause for assignment to limited duty. Under limited duty, the military member may be reassigned from their permanent duty station to a temporary duty station until the medic al issue is resolved . h. Medical Treatment. The management and care of a patient to combat disease or disorder. For the purposes of this manual, medical treatment does not include the actions in subparagraphs 211h(1) through 211h(3).

Medical treatment does not include first aid treatment even though provided by a physician or other lice nsed health c are professional. i. Permanent Partial Disability. An injury or work -related illness that does not result in death or permanent total disability, but, in the opinion of competent medical authority, results in permanent impairment through loss of the use of any part of the body with the following exceptions: teeth, fingernails, toe nails, tips of fingers or tips of toes without bone involvement, repairable hernia, disfigurement or sprains or strains that do not cause permanent loss of motion. Note: OSHA's defini tion of \"a mputation\" for civilian personnel fingertip amputati ons with or without bone loss , medical amputations resulting from irreparable damage and amputations of body parts that have since been reattached. j. Permanent Total Dis ability. A non -fatal injury or work -related illness, in the opinion of competent medical authority, permanently and totally incapacitates a person to the extent that he or she cannot follow any gainful occupation. Note: The loss or loss of use, of both hands, both feet, both eyes or a combination of any of these parts of the body as a result of a single mishap, must be considered as a permanent total disability. k. Restricted Work Activity or Job Transfer. Applicable only to civilian personnel. Restricted work activity or temporary transfer from that work occurs when, as a result of a work - related injury or illness, a supervisor or health care professional keeps or recommends keeping, a civilian employee from doing the routine functions of his or her job or from working the full work day or full work shift that the employee would have been scheduled to work before the OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-29 injury or illness occurred. The employee has not lost work time, but is restricted from routine functions. The military eq uivalent of restricted work is either l ight duty or limited d uty. 212. Step 5. Determine a DON Mishap Class . Use figure 2 -2 to assign a DON mishap class. (Figure 2 -2 continued on the next page) Did the mishap result in death? YES NO Did the mishap result in permanent total disability? Did the mishap result in total cost of damages to DoD or non-DoD property of $2.5 million? NO NO YES YES Class A mishap YES Did the mishap result in the hospitalization for inpatient care of 3 personnel as a result of a single mishap (not including individuals hospitalized for observation, diagnostic, or administrative purposes that were treated and released) Did mishap result in permanent partial disability? Did the mishap result in total cost of damages to DoD or non-DoD property of $600,000 but < $2.5 million? NO NO YES Class B mishap YES NO OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-30 Figure 2 -2. Assigning a DON Mishap Class Notes: Class E mishap reporting is only a DON requirement under certain specific circumstances that are explained in this manual or when a controlling command directs its subordinates to report Class E mishaps. Controlling commands must put such a requirement in writing. Was the mishap a work -related event in which the resulting total cost of damages to DoD or non -DoD property was greater than $0, but less than $25,000? Class E mishap YES YES YES Was the mishap a work -related event in which an injury or occupational illness resulted in medical treatment beyond first aid, loss of consciousness, light or limited duty for military personnel, or restricted work or job transfer for on - duty Navy and Marine Corps civilian employees? Was the mishap a work -related event in which the resulting total cost of damage to DoD or non -DoD property was $25,000, but < $60,000? Class D mishap NO NO Did mishap result in a nonfatal, work -related injury or illness that resulted in the loss of one or more days away from work, not including the day or shift that the mishap occurred (i.e., a Lost Time Case)? Did the mishap result in total cost of damages to DoD or non-DoD property of $60,000, but < $600,000? NO NO Class C mishap YES YES OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-31 213. Step 6. Determine Whether the Mishap is in a DoD Special Reporting Group . Use table 2 - 10 to determine if t he mishap falls into a DoD special reporting group. DoD special reporting groups will help you determine who must be notified. Notification requirements are in chapter 3. DoD Special Reporting Group* Characteristics of DoD Special Reporting Group Serious A Class A mishap; OR A Class B mishap resulting in inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel. Civilian Catastrophic A mishap involving a civilian fatality; OR A mishap resulting in inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel where at least one is a civilian. Mishap with Fatality A mishap associated with death. Explosives A Class A, B, C or D mishap resulting in damage or injury from: An explosion or functioning of explosive materials or devices (except as a result of enemy action); Inadvertent actuation, jettisoning and releasing or launching explosive devices; or Impacts of ordnance off -range. OR A mishap in which explosives are present, even if there is no explosion. Note: Explosives present at the site of a mishap must have had direct involvement with the occurrence for this characteristic to be relevant; the proximity of explosives at a mishap site, by itself, does not qualify as a characteristic for this subcategory. Serious Explosives A serious mishap AND an exp losives mishap. OR An explosives mishap including: DoD military, civilian or contractor fatality; Greater than $ 600,000 property damage; Greater than 72 hours lost production; Major weapons system loss (tank, aircraft, ship or large missile); or Proba ble high public interest. Friendly Fire Friendly fire incidents OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 2-32 DoD Special Reporting Group* Characteristics of DoD Special Reporting Group *A mishap may be included in more than one DoD Special Reporting Group. Table 2 -10. DoD Special Reporting Groups 214. Step 7. Notify Appropriate Officials Based on Mishap Class, Category, DoD Special Reporting Group and Amplifying Instructions . Using the information from step 6, follow the notification requirements provided in chapter 3. 215. Step 8. Investigate the Mishap . Investigate the mishap using the guidelines provided in chapter 4. 216. Step 9. Report the Mishap . Prepare and submit the SIREP using the guidelines provided in chapter 4. SIREPs must be submitted in the RMI within 30 calendar days of the mishap for SIO investigations or 30 calendar days of convening for SIB investigations. 217. Step 10. Enter Required Information into the RMI for OSHA Recordable Events Involving Civilian Personnel . a. The OSHA is only concerned with events involving work -related fatalities, injuries or illnesses of on -duty Navy or Marine Corps civilian personnel. All work -related fatalities, injuries or illnesses of military personnel, regardless if they are on - or off -duty, are not OSHA recordable. Lastly, the OSHA is not concerned with events involv ing only property damage. b. Enter the required information in RMI for each OSHA recordable event so that an OSHA 301 Injury and Illness Incident Report and OSHA 300 can be generated. If the user cannot access RMI, manually fill out OSHA 300 and OSHA 301 or an equivalent form as a temporary measure until RMI access is reestablished. See Appendix D for details about obtaining copies of the OSHA forms. Paragraphs 217b(1) and 217b(2) provide a brief description of each form.

To explain when mishap and event notifications are required, who must be notified, the methods to complete notification and the timeliness of notifications for selected Navy and Marine Corps mishaps and events. 302. General . For certain categories and types of mishaps and events, timely notification is required. Notifications are necessary to inform leaders of important events and serve as a trigger for activities that need to begin immediately after a mishap or event has occurred such as environmental response operations, public affair preparations and safety investigations. Notifications also ensure experts from certain specialties become involved very quickly, to minimize damage (e.g., laser events, explosive mishaps, mishaps with environmental impact) or to ensure essential actions are taken quickly following a mishap. 303. Notification Requirements . Some notification requirements are set in Federal law or regulation (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Act), others are established in Department of Defense ( DoD ), Department of the Navy ( DON ) or Service policy (e.g., Navy policy or Marine Corps policy). Policies establishing notification requirements can be grouped into three broad categories: a. Official DoD, Navy and Marine Corps notification requirements using the OPREP -3 reporting system found in DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011, OPNAVINST F3100.6J of 22 December 2009, MCO 3504.2A of 7 August 2013 and this manual. b. Special reporting group notification requirements found in DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011 and other DON directives. c. Occupational S afety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) notification requirements applicable only for work -related illness and injuries to Navy and Marine Corps civilian personnel found in 29 CFR 1904. Note: OSHA notification requirements are also reiterated in OPNAV M-5100.23 of 5 June 2020. 304. Notification Methods . There are four methods used to complete notification: voice, naval message, electronic mail and the Risk Management Information ( RMI ). 305. Initial Notification Considerations . a. For some mishaps, it may be unclear initially the extent of the damages and injuries and the classification of the mishap, raising questions whether notifications are required. In these instances, if the mishap has the potential to cross the threshold, complete the notifi cations. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 3-2 b. Since complete information is often not available immediately after a mishap, commands must strive to meet the notification timeline even if all of the details are not known. Additional information may be provided later as it becomes known. c. Follow -up notifications should be used, as necessary, to report essential information. 306. Official Notifications . Official notifications for mishaps and other selected safety events use the Operational Report -3 (OPREP -3) Reporting System. Voice rep orts are also required. a. OPREP -3 reporting guidance is not explained in detail in this manual. Instead, commands must consult the authoritative Service instruction to ensure full compliance with OPREP -3 reporting. See the Safety Reporting Resources s ection in this manual for on -line availability of these policy directives. This manual reiterates when OPREP -3 notification is required for mishaps and selected safety -related events and explains who must be notified. (1) The Navy policy directive gove rning the OPREP -3 reporting system is OPNAVINST F3100. 6K (Special Incident Reporting Procedures). (2) The Marine Corps policy directive governing the OPREP -3 reporting system is MCO 3504.2A (Operations Event/Incident Report (OPREP -3) Reporting). b. Commands must ensure that the plain language address designator COMNAVSAFECEN NORFOLK VA is an INFO addressee on any naval message notifications when COMNAVSAFECEN notification is required. c. Commands must ensure that NAVSAFECEN_SDO@navy.mil (i.e., COMN AVSAFECEN) is a copy addressee on any electronic mail notifications when COMNAVSAFECEN notification is required. d. Prior to submitting the \"last report this incident,\" units should check with their operational chain of command to ensure there are no other requests for information by higher authority. e. Review the mishap reporting guidance to determine if the event meets safety reporting requirements. On the final record message report, include a mandatory \"RMKS\" set, which must include one of the statements in subparagraphs 306e(1) through 306e(3), as appropriate. (1) \"MISHAP REPORT NOT \"MISHAP TO REPORT SUBMITTED\" Sep 2021 3-3 Note: While the OPREP -3 reporting system is used to make official notification of mishaps and other safety -related events, OPREP -3 reporting does not relieve commands of the requirement to investigate and submit SIREPs per this manual. 307. Special Reporting Group Notifications . Some safety -related events are not specifically addresse d in the OPREP -3 reporting system but notifications are required to ensure specific commands and activities receive notice in a timely manner. 308. OSHA Notifications . a. Navy and Marine Corps Civilian Personnel. OSHA notification requirements are specified in OPNAV M -5100.23 of 5 June 2020 and in this chapter. OSHA notifications are in addition to official notifications and special reporting group notifications and apply only to work -related injuries and illnesses to Navy and Marine Corps civilian personnel. b. Contractor Employees. Contractors are responsible for making notifications to the OSHA for their employees. If the contractor's employee is under the day -to-day supervision of the contractor, then the contractor is responsible for recording the injury or illness. If the DON command supervises the contractor employee's work on a day -to-day basis, then it must be recorded by the DON command. Day-to-day supervisi on includes supervising not only the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, but also the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished. 309. Notifications . Use the information in chapter app endix 3 -A to complete required notifications. Eventually, the content of notifications must be entered into the RMI for proper event record keeping. However, until RMI entries are completed, any notifications made outside of the RMI must reference the da te-time-group of the initial notification and any previous follow -up notifications. This requirement ensures an accurate account of all notifications made. Note: Some mishap and event types may meet multiple notification requirements.

Table 3 -A-1. Notification Requirements for Mishaps, Events and DoD Special Reporting Groups OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-1 CHAPTER 4 SAFETY INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS 401. Purpose . To provide guidance on when and by whom, a safety investigation board (S IB) is appointed or a single investigating officer (SIO) is directed , identifying the members of the board and their responsibilities and discussing the purpose of assistants. The chapter also includes the requirement to establish st anding SIBs ; the process for determining the controlling command and accounting organization for mishaps , including mishaps that involved multiple units; and provisions for joint SIBs. 402. General . An SIB or SIO is established to determine causal factors and make recommendations to prevent re occurrence of reportable mishaps or to investigate the presence of hazards that could lead to mishaps . At the discretion of a convening authority, an SIB may also be appointed to determine causal factors and make recommendations to prevent re occurrence of serious near misses (i.e., hazards) that had the potential of being serious recordable mishaps. The COMNAV SAFECEN and Director, CMC (SD) are the final authorities for determining deviatio ns for any of the requirements in this chapter. Further guidance on SIBs or SIOs will be in The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide . 403. Determining Responsibility for Oversight and Investigation . a. Determining the Accounting Organization . (1) The accounting organization is the reporting custodian that experienced the loss of or damage to , an owned asset ; or the fatality, injury or work -related illness of an assigned person or persons in a mishap ; and is responsible for or is assigned responsibility for, safety reporting, regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the event's occurrence. There is one accounting organization for each mishap. (2) When multiple Navy and Marine Co rps commands are involved in a mishap, the accounting organization will normally be the command sustaining the highest level o f loss in the event . The cognizant controlling command or controlling commands may determine other compelling reasons that exist for assigning investigative responsibility differently. If agreement cannot be reached, CNO N09F will make the determination. b. Determining the Controlling Command. Controlling command determination is typically based upon the administrative con trol chain of command of the accounting organization . The controlling command will act as the convening authority , unless that responsibility has been delegated per subparagraph 107i(3). Use table 4-1 for additional guidance in making controlling command determinations. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-2 Rule Number If a mishap involves... Then, the controlling command ... 1 the armed forces of friendly nations and Navy or Marine Corps units and the only forces lost or injured were by the armed forces of friendly nations , will be determined by the combatant commander. 2 the armed forces of friendly nations and Navy or Marine Corps units and the forces lost or injured were by both the armed forces of friendly nations and Navy or Marine Corps units, will be determined by chief of naval operations ( CNO ) N09F, after consulting with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ASD (Readiness) and the combatant commander as to what role the other involved nations will play in the investigation. 3 a friendly fire incident while Navy or Marine Corps units were under the operational control of a combatant command, is Marine Corps or Navy controlling command whose forces suffered the preponderance of loss or injury. Note: Unless otherwise agreed or as the combatant commander may direct. 4 both Navy and Marine Corps units, is the controlling command whose subordinate unit in the administrative control ( ADCON ) chain of command suffered the preponderance of loss or injury. 5 only a Marine Corps unit, is the Marine Corps controlling command in the operational control (OPCON) chain of command of the subordinate unit involved. 6 only a shore Navy unit, is the controlling command in the ADCON chain of command of the subordinate unit involved. 7 only afloat Navy units under a single type comman der (TYCOM), is normally the TYCOM of the subordinate unit(s) involved. 8 only afloat Military Sealift Command units, is COMSC (PM1) for Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force civilian mariner manned vessels. is COMSC (PM2) for special mission civilian mariner manned vessels. is COMSC (PM3) for USNS Kaiser. 9 only afloat Navy units under multiple TYCOMs, but the same fleet commander, will be determined by that fleet commander. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-3 Rule Number If a mishap involves... Then, the controlling command ... 10 Navy units under different echelon 2 commanders , is the controlling command whose subordinate unit in the ADCON chain of command suffered the preponderance of loss or injury. 11 only afloat Navy units under different fleet commanders, will be determined by CNO N09F after consultation with the fleet commanders. 12 a ship during a defined CNO Maintenance Availability Period and Naval Sea Systems Command is the contracting authority for the work related to the mishap, Note: Outside of this occurrence, the guidelines in subparagraph s 403a(1) and 403b apply. is Naval Sea Systems Com mand. Note: A mishap occurring aboard a DoD vessel that resulted from shipyard, vessel repair facility or private contractor operations is a ground (industrial) mishap, not an afloat mishap. Note: In the event of disagreement over controlling command assignment, CNO N09F has the authority to make the final determination for mishaps involving only Navy units and for mishaps involving both Navy and Marine Corps units. Director, CMC (SD) has the authority to make the final determination for mishaps invol ving only Marine Corps units. Table 4-1. Controlling Command Determination c. Use table 4 -2 as additional guidance for the assignment of accounting organizations for mishaps involving military personnel. Rule Number If a military personnel mishap occu rs... Then, the accounting organization... 1 at a DoD or DON command, unit, activity or establishment. will be that DoD or DON command, unit, activity or establishment . 2 on official travel between the affected person's parent command (i.e., per permanent duty station orders) and another DoD or DON command, unit, activity or establishment; and the affected person is in an on -duty status. will be the affected person's parent command. 3 on official travel between the affected person's additional duty (ADDU) command (i.e., per permanent duty station orders) and will be the affected person's ADDU command. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-4 Rule Number If a military personnel mishap occu rs... Then, the accounting organization... another DoD or DON command, unit, activity or establishment; and the affected person is in an on -duty status. 4 to an affected person and that affected person was subsequently either transferred or temporarily assigned to either a medical hold unit or to a transient personnel unit. will be the command where the affected person was originally injured. 5 will be the command where the affected person was originally injured for any follow -on reports. 6 to an affected person and that affected person was subsequently permanently transferred from the command where the original injury occurred. will be the command where the affected person was originally injured. 7 will be the affected person's gaining command for any follow -on reports. 8 in an area that is not remote and the affected person is in an off -duty status. will be the affected person's parent command. 9 in a remote area; the affected person is assigned to a DON permanent duty station; and the affected person is in an off -duty status. will be the commander of the nearest Navy or Marine Corps activity, when requested by the affected person's permanent duty station. 10 while the affected person is en route to a new duty station under permanent change of station orders. will be the affected perso n's gaining command. RESIDENT STUDENTS 11 while the affected person is an on - duty resident student, under official orders assigned to a DON -operated post-secondary education institution and away from that institution on non-DoD or non -DON property. Note: Examples of DON -operated post-secondary education institutions include Service colleges (e.g., Naval Postgraduate School, U.S. Naval War College and Marine Corps University), U.S. Naval Academy, Naval Academy Preparatory School, etc. will be that DO N-operated post -secondary education institution. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-5 Rule Number If a military personnel mishap occu rs... Then, the accounting organization... 12 while the affected person is a Navy or Marine Corps on -duty resident student, under official orders assigned to a DoD -operated (i.e., non-DON) post -secondary education institution and away from that institution on non -DoD or non -DON property. Note: Examples of DoD -operated (i.e., non -DON) post -secondary education institutions include Service colleges (e.g., Joint Forces Staff College, National Defense University, U.S. Army War Colleg e, Air War College and Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences), U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, etc. will be that DoD -operated (i.e., non -DON) post-secondary education institution. 13 while the affected person is a Navy or Marine Corps on -duty resident student, under official orders assigned to a non -DoD or non -DON operated post -secondary education institution and on non -DoD or non - DON property. will be the naval activity already assigned by Commander, Naval Personnel Command (PERS -44) to provide administrative support for that resident student.

Appointment of a Safety Investigation Board . a. Convening authorities (discussed in chapter 1) are responsible for directing an SIB to investigate any of the mishaps or hazards (including near misses ), under their cognizance . b. Required Use of Event Numbers . The RMI POR database mandated by this manual automatically generates an event number that is unique to each particular mishap or hazard . All naval messages, reports and correspondence related to a particular mishap or hazard will include use of this event number . This requirement must be followed from initial notification through the final endorsement (i.e., to include record keeping and disposition). Note: For situa tions in which the safety officer or safety manager does not have access to the RMI to submit the initial RMI entry, OPREP -3 notifications can be released without the event number. c. Assigning the SIB and Initial Endorsing Chain . The convening authorit y will use the RMI to direct a mishap investigation that requires an SIB and to assign the initial recommended endorsing chain. d. Appointment Letters . Members of SIBs should be appointed in writing by the convening authority within 24 to 48 hours, but not to exceed 96 hours of the convening authority's knowledge of the mishap or hazard . Guidance on the appointment letter format is in The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide . e. Restrictions . (1) Activities of the SIB become the primary duty of all appointed members until the completion and release of the SIREP, by the senior member , via the RMI POR database mandated by this manual. (2) Personnel appointed to an SIB or acting as a consultant SME to an SIB, may not be appointed to, nor serve on, any other investigative board a ssociated with the same mishap or hazard . (3) Personnel appointed to an SIB or acting as a consultant SME to an SIB, may not participate in drafting any endorsement related to the mishap or hazard that the SIB is investigating. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-8 406. Standing Mishap Investigation Boards . a. Controlling commands will establish and maintain at least one standing board to enable rapid investigative response to mishaps within their command that require a safety investigation by an SIB . b. A standing board consists of a minimum of two personnel , a senior member and a safety representative, who are assigne d to the standing board in writing . c. Standing board members must meet the training requirements in subparagraphs 406c(1) and 406c(2): (1) Complete either the Ground Mishap Investigation Course (CIN: A-493-0078 equivalent ), Mishap Investigation Course (CIN: A-493-0078) or an equivalent course approved by either the NAVSAFECEN or CMC (SD). (2) Be familiar with the requirements of this manual. d. A standing board must be deployed to a mishap location within 72 hours of their knowledge of that mishap in order to begin the safety investigation process. The standing board will continue the investigation until properly relieved by the SIB appointed to investigate that specific mishap. Note: Convening authorities may choose to use standing board members on the appointed SIB. 407. Composition of a Safety Investigation Board . a. The convening authority or the Marine Corps general officer delegated responsibility for appointing SIB members and the senior member of an SIB, may confer and agre e on board appointees based on the type and severity of the consequence of the mishap or hazard . Table 4-4 lists the minimum composition requirements for an SIB.

Course (CIN: A- 493-0078) or an equivalent course approved by either the Naval Safety Center or CMC (SD). Table 4-4. Minimum Composition Requirements for a Safety Investigation Board b. As required, a competent medical authority may provide valuable information, assist the board in collecting and coordinating the analysis of medical evidence, address medical issues on the specifics of the injuries or occupational (i.e., work -related) illnesses, advise board members on the use of medical evidence and help identify human factors. The concern of the medical expert is medical, physiological, psychological, social and behavioral factors that may reveal human causal factors of the mishap. 408. Safety Investigation Board Member Responsibilities . Activities of the SIB become the primar y duty of all members until completion and release of the SIREP via the RMI by the senior member. Personnel appointed to an SIB may not be appointed to, nor serve on, any other investigative board associated with the same mishap. Members of the SIB shoul d not participate in drafting any endorsement related to that mishap. Detailed SIB responsibilities are provided in subparagraphs 408a through 408m : a. Conduct a thorough and impartial investigation by visiting the mishap site immediately upon appointment and actively participate in the safety investigation. b. Request technical assistance for the safety investigation from the convening authority, when required. c. SIB members must not consult with the commander of the mishap command, mishap command's chain of command or the SIB member's chain of command regarding the content of a SIREP prior to its release. This does not prevent the senior member or other board member from interviewing the commander as a witness to the mishap. Note: The exercise of command influence to edit, modify or in any way censor the content of a SIREP prepared by an SIB is contrary to the direction of this manual and is prohibited. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-11 d. Extend to the NAVSAFECEN mishap advisor unrestricted access to all evidence, summaries of witness' statements and proceedings (including access to all witness interviews). Allow the advisor to keep either COMNAVSAFECEN or Director, CMC (SD), as appropriate, apprised of the status of the safety investigation. e. Board members must n ot discuss privileged information in the presence of non -board members and must properly safeguard all PSI in their possession. f. Determine, which witnesses will be offered a promise of confidentiality in strict compliance with guidelines found in parag raph 804. g. Interview all witnesses. Ensure that all witnesses understand and sign either JNAVMAR 5102/1 Advice to Witness or JNAVMAR 5102/2 Advice to Witness (Promise of Confidentiality , if a written statement is provided. Note: Individual intervie ws provide the best environment to ensure candid and forthright statements from witnesses or persons involved. Group interviews are not recommended because of the possible negative effect this technique might have on the willingness of some witnesses to speak openly and honestly. A witness that has been offered a promise of confidentiality must always be interviewed individually. See the Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide, which contains more information on interview techniques and best practices. h. Members must not share any information with any other investigating team ( e.g., Judge Advocate General, N aval Criminal Investigative Service , command, local authorities, etc.) without first discussing it with the appointed NAVSAFECEN mishap a dvisor. i. Prepare and release a HAZREP for any hazard discovered during the course of the investigation that has the potential for widespread applicability. This requirement is separate from the release of the SIREP. j. If, during the investigation, one of the non -reportable provisions of paragraph 208 appears to apply , then contact the convening authority and COMNAV SAFCEN to request permission to terminate the safety investigation. k. If criminal conduct that is causal to the mishap is discovered in the course of conducting the safety investigation, the SIB must suspend the investigation, preserve the evidence and immediately notify the convening authority and COMNAVSAFECEN. Naval Criminal Investigative Service or Federal or local law enforcement, should also be notified, depending on jurisdiction at the location of the mishap and the mishap circumstances. The con vening authority will review the pertinent circumstances and consult with COMNAVSAFECEN and the appropriate naval legal authority to determine whether the mishap investigation will proceed. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-12 Note: The convening authority should consider various factors i n making this decision, including the seriousness of the mishap, the seriousness of the alleged misconduct, the potential for litigation or prosecution and the potential adverse impact on the safety privilege. If the mishap investigation is terminated, th e convening authority may determine that due to the unique circumstances of the event or the event's aftermath, a hazard investigation is warranted and direct the SIB to conduct this investigation. l. Direct the preparation and release of the SIREP within 30 calendar days of convening the board. SIREPs must not refer to disciplinary or administrative action in connection with the mishap. If necessary, request an extension from the convening authority w ith the reasons. m. Transfer custody of all relevant documentary evidence, board members' personal notes original copies of summaries of all statements, photographs , negatives and tape recordings to NAVSAFECEN. No copy must remain with the unit or in the possession of board members. Note: The SIO or SIB should upload all pertinent explanatory figures, photos, tables, and other supporting documents in the exhibits section of RMI. n. Development of a power point out -brief for use by the convening authority is recommended. The out -brief should be uploaded as an RMI investigation exhibit for preservation purposes. 409. Safety Investigation Board Assistants . To ensure a thorough safety investigation, the SIB may require assistance from personnel not officially appointed as a member of the SIB. The individuals requested by the board will proceed to the mishap site or other location as determined by the senior member. a. Trained Safety Investigation Adviso r. The COMNAVSAFECEN will appoint a trained safety investigation advisor for all Class A mishaps and all live fire mishaps resulting in an injury and may provide an advisor for other mishaps or hazards (including near misses) when it would be beneficial to the investigation. The advisor will meet the minimum training specified in table 4 -4 and should be present at the convening of the board, when logistically feasible. The safety investigation advisor normally will not be a m ember of the SIB, but will serve to assist and advise the board in the safety investigation process (e.g., witness interviewing techniques, cause factor analysis, cause mapping and human factors analysis ). The advisor may depart before the completion of t he investigation if both the senior member and COMNAVSAFECEN agree. When agreed to by COMNAVSAFECEN and the convening authority , the COMNAVSAFECEN advisor may be appointed as a member of the SIB. Note: NAVSAFECEN investigators are subject matter experts in the mishap investigation deliberative process and investigative techniques. While they are not members of the SIB, their full participation in all SIB activities and deliberations is required in order to facili tate OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-13 standardization of the investigative process; conduct of detailed causal factor analysis; development of sound mishap recommendations; and to protect PSI. b. Consultant Subject Matter Expert . The consultant subject matter expert ( SME ) should be involved at a mishap site as early as possible for preliminary inspection of the wreckage or to inspect other end items, systems or processes where there may not be associated wreckage (e.g., small arms, shipboard systems) and for discussion with any personne l involved in the mishap or recovery operation. All non-Navy and non-Marine Corps personnel that are consultant SMEs will be asked to provide a written report to the board on their findings. All Navy and Marine Corps consultant SMEs will also provide a written report to the board on their findings. These report s may be added to the privilege d evidence section of the SIREP. All n on-Navy and non- Marine Corps personnel consultant SMEs will be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA ) to pro tect mishap information discussed during consultation. Note: Consultant SMEs are permitted to provide information and reports to other concurrent investigators (e.g., from the legal investigation) provided PSI and discussions with the SIB are not part of the information provided. c. Consultant Competent Medical Authority . All non-Navy and non-Marine Corps personnel that are consultant competent medical authority (CMA) SMEs will be asked to provide a written report to the board on their findings. All Navy and Marine Corps personnel consultant CMA SMEs will also provide a written report to the board on their findings. These report s may be added to the privilege evidence section of the SIREP. All n on-Navy and non-Marine Corps personnel consultant CMA SMEs will be asked to sign a n NDA to protect mishap information discussed during consultation. 410. Joint Safety Investigation Boards . a. Mishaps involving two or more Service components are covered by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center; Air Force and Naval Safety Centers; Commandant of the Marine Corps (Safety Division); and the U.S. Coast Guard Health, Safety and Work -Life Directorate per appendix C. b. For maritime event s involving units or personnel of two or more North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations, the provisions of NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 1179, Combined Investigation of Maritime Incidents, become effective. 411. National Transportation Safety Board Investigations . The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate Naval Introductory Flight Evaluation (NIFE ) Program student and military flying club mishaps. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-14 a. Naval participation is as a party, appointed by the NTSB, as arranged by the Commander, Nava l Education and Training Command (NETC) for NIFE mishaps per OPNAVINST 3750.16C (Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation) . The CNO N09F will arrange naval participation as a party -in-agreement with NTSB for military fly ing club mishaps. The naval party will not serve on any other concurrent safety board while appointed to the NTSB accident investigation. This does not preclude a separate and concurrent safety investigation from being conducted by COMNAVS AFECEN , as dire cted by CNO N09F or Director, CMC (SD), as long as it does not interfere with the NTSB accident investigation. NETC will conduct SIO investigations or establish an SIB to conduct a parallel but separate investigation, if military students or staff are involved. b. A separate safety investigation may be conducted for military flying club mishaps. The sponsoring flying club facility's aviation safety o fficer (ASO) or the ground safety officer (GSO), if no ASO is available, will conduct the separate safety investigation and then complete a SIREP through the RMI POR database mandated by this manual . 412. Single Investigating Officer Investigations . These a re investigations where a n SIO has been directed to perform a DON safety investigation by a convening authority . The individual is solely responsible for completing the safety investigation and drafting and submitting required reports and records. Essentially, an SIO investigates any mishap, near miss or hazard not investigated by a n SIB. The SIO may receive assistance from subject matter experts (SME) in the performance of their duties. An SIO is often an individual assigned to a s afety billet (e.g., safety officer or safety manager ), but that is not always a requirement. 413. Safety Investigation Timeline . The safety investigation should be completed within 30 days of the mishap. The investigation should place a greater priority on a thorough, complete and accurate SIREP than on trying to finish in the 30 -day timeline. If the investigation cannot be completed within the required time period, the SIB or SIO must request an extension from the convening authority in the RMI . The SIB should remain convened until all aspects of the investigation are completed. See figure 5 -1 for a depiction of a nominal SIREP endorsement timeline. 414. Unclassified Information Collected During Safety Investigations . SIBs and SIOs must ensure that all unclassified information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators , is not released outside safety channels except when expressly permitted in this manual. See chapter 8 for protection of PSI. a. SIB senior members and SIOs will ensure that everyone working on the safety investigation is briefed on these restrictions. b. The SIB or SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical experts who, although not members of the board, can analyze information o r wreckage (e.g., small arms, OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-15 shipboard systems), on behalf of safety investigators. Non-DON personnel must have the applicable NDA in place with NAVSAFECEN prior to receiving access to privileged materials. 415. Classified Information Collected During S afety Investigations . SIBs and SIOs must ensure that all classified information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators, is handled per its required security classification level and is not released outside safety channels except when expressly permitted in this manual. See chapter 8 for protection of classified information that includes PSI. a. SIB senior members and SIOs will ensure that everyone working on the safety investigati on is briefed on these restrictions. b. The SIB or SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical experts who, although not members of the board, have the proper security clearance and need -to-know and can analyze information or wreckage or other end items, systems or processes where there may not be associated wreckage (e.g., small arms, shipboard systems), on behalf of safety investigators. Non-DON personnel must have the applicable NDAs in place with NAVSAFECEN prior to receiving access to privileged materials. c. The SIB or SIO must omit any portion of a report that warrants security classification and substitute the word \"CLASSIFIED\" in its place and submit a classified supplement. In the unlikely event that a meaningful unclassifie d report cannot be produced, submit a classified report. 416. Safety Investigation Process . This paragraph provides an overview of the safety investigation process. Safety investigators should reference The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide developed by NAVSAFECEN for a detailed explanation of this process. a. Determining and Documenting Factors. The narrative of a SIREP is comprised of factors that collectively answer the \"why\" an event occurred. Factors are based on the weight of evidence, professional knowledge and good judgment of the investigators. The analysis contained in factors lead to the findings and recommendations. Factors that directly led to injury, damage or a hazardous event are c onsidered causal and result in causal findings. All Class A and B mishaps must contain at least one causal factor. (1) Factors. A factor is any action or condition, discovered in the course of an investigation, which in the investigator's opinion , contributed to the eventual outcome. Determining factors ( i.e. and eliminating non-factors) enables investigators to focus the investigation from all the issues under examination to those specific areas that are significant in the event sequence. Factor s explain why causes, such as human error, supervision or equipment failure , occurred. Factors are not mutually exclusive , but are often interrelated ; and in some OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-16 cases , influence each other. Factors are the basis for primary findings and recommendations . Most events involve multiple factors. When applicable, include a discussion of related human factors using the DoD Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (DoD HFACS). (2) Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion. Non-factors worthy of discussion typically fall into one of three categories: areas uncovered during the investigation that did not cause the event or influence the outcome but should be fixed due to the potential to be a factor in a future event (e.g., incorrect information in a maintena nce technical order), areas that were thoroughly investigated and subsequently ruled out as factors ( i.e., in order to provide context to the audience on why these areas are not factors) and areas that may be considered an interest item to the convening au thority (e.g., risk management and crew resource management). Non-factors worthy of discussion are the source for other findings and recommendations of significance . Not all non-factors worthy of discussion result in other findings and recommendations of significance ; but, all other findings and recommendations of significance must have a corresponding non-factor worthy of discussion . b. Determining and Documenting Causes. A cause is a condition , which , if corrected, eliminated or avoided, would likely have prevented or mitigated the event damage or injury. In most instances , a causal condition or factor is correctable by commanders, supervisors or individuals. (1) Cause does not imply blame , it highlights that if the factor was corrected, eliminated or avoided, the mishap or hazard or incident would not have happened . (2) Risk management is a persistent process that must be conducted in all organizations . Improper risk management at any level of command can be causal in an event . In ca ses where an event has identified hazards , there is a responsibility to assess the associated risks, evaluate risk mitigation options, implement risk management measures, evaluate the residual risks, document approval at the appropriate level to accept the expected residual risks in terms of consequences and probability of occurrence and monitor the effectiveness of the risk control measures implemented. Each recurrence of an event requires a reassessment of the prior risk management decisions. Do not cit e risk acceptance as causal when all risk management functions were properly accomplished and a quantified level -of-risk was accepted at the appropriate level. (3) Not every factor is causal. Some are effects or the expected result o f a previously identified cause even though their inclusion only sustains the sequence leading to the event. (4) Environmental conditions such as lightnin g, high wind, solar wind, meteorites or flood ing may be causal only if all reasonable avoidance and damage and injury mitigation actions were taken. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-17 (5) For human factors, the action that could have prevented a failure resides within the human realm and not on an object or publication. Publications or objects should almost never be found causal. Rather, the party res ponsible for ensuring the publications are correct or the party responsible for ensuring an object does not fail with catastrophic consequences , is causal. In such cases, there may be process or organizational failures and appropriate parties must be identified as responsible for these failures. (6) Failure to provide a system or procedure may only be causal i f a party should reasonably have been expected to know the omission was deficient prior to the mishap. (7) Occasionally , an investigator may no t be able to conclusiv ely determine a specific causal action. In these special cases, the investigator may choose to list two or three of the most probable causes for each option. In rare instances, the causal event may be unknown. c. Determining and D ocumenting Findings. Findings establish lines of evidence . Findings are used to establish factors. All Class A through Class E SIREPs must have findings . (1) Each finding is a single event , condition or data point, which is important in the mishap or hazard . Each finding is an essential step in describing the complete event sequence ; however, not every finding is causal. Findings must be concise ( i.e., one sentence) and will not include any more inform ation than is necessary to explain the event , condition or data point . Sequence -sustaining findings may be included and do not need to be linked to a factor. (2) Each finding must have a logical connection to preceding findings. If no logical relation ship exists, the sequence of the event has not been correctly described. (3) Ensure that critical events required to sustain the event sequence have not been omitted. Conversely, do not include events interesting to the reader, but not necessary to sus tain the event sequence. (4) Ensure that the sequence starts when the initial action (s) occu rred, which may be prior to the day of the mishap (e.g. , design problems, improperly written directives, an inadequate training program). (5) Ensure that the event sequence continues to the point where all da mage or injury has occurred and the initial rescue or recovery actions have been accomplished. Note: Do not include actions that follow rescue or r ecovery actions unless they specifically led to further damage or injury. (6) Include injuries occurring during the event at the appropriate c hronological point in the event sequence. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-18 (7) Findings are arranged in chronological order and numbe red consecutively. (8) Write each finding as a full sentence, not a bullet or bullets . Use active voice where the subject accomplishes the action . Use past tense since the events occurred in the past. State the source of the findings at the end of each finding statement. (9) Do not include people's names, call signs, DoD HFACS codes, gender pronouns or names of military bases or installations in the findings. Instead, u se terms such as \"the mishap vehicle, \" \"the mishap vehicle operator,\" etc. (10) After developing the findings, apply the \"Findings Test\" for validation as listed in subparagraphs 416c (10)(a) through 416c (10)(e). (a) Is the Finding necessary to sustain the event sequence? (b) Is the Finding a single event or condition? (c) Is the Finding specific enough? (d) Is the Finding relevant or simply interesting to the reader? (e) Does the Finding logically connect to the preceding finding? Read the last finding. Ask \"why?\" Then, read the preceding finding. Does it answer the \"why?\" Continue for each finding. d. Causal Findings. Identify causal findings by selecting the \"Causal\" button when entering findings in the RMI . Do not list causes under a separate heading. Word a causal finding as a clear and simple statement of a single condition or action. Causal fin dings must have a supporting causal factor detailed in the analysis and formal report. (1) Causal findings will always be worded in an active voice a nd in past tense. A causal finding will identify the causal agent ( i.e., who), the action taken ( i.e., what) and the reason for the deficiency ( i.e., why). Why the action or lack of action occurred should be fully explained in the narrative and may be included in the causal finding. (2) After determining the causal findings, apply the \"Cause Test\" for validation as listed in subparagraphs 416d 416d (2)(d). (a) Is the causal finding correctable by commanders, supervisors or individuals? (b) Is the causal finding a clear and simple statement of a single condition or event? OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-19 (c) Is the causal finding in the active voice and past tense and does it follow the format of who did what to whom or what and why? (d) Is the causal finding an effect or an expected result of a previously identified cause, even though its inclusion sustains t he event sequence? If so, it is not causal. e. Determining and Documenting Recommendations. Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate identified hazards ; or, if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard's potential consequences. If no recommendations are made in an on -duty Class A or B investigation, then investigators will explain their rationale in the report narrative. Ensure that the invest igation supports the recommendations. Do not make recommendations for the sole purpose of having recommendations. Recommendations require the assignment of a risk assessment code (RAC). (1) Developing feasible and effective recommendations is a method ical process, which seeks to identify risk mitigation alternatives. It is essential to know precisely what deficiency or identified hazard, is being addressed ; and, to stay focused on it. (2) All recommendations should target one or more of the hazards identified and documented during the investigation. It is also sometimes prudent to make two or more recommendations against one hazard. Developing sound recommendations also requires recognition of the system safety hierarchy of controls (i.e., \"order of precedence\" ) concept ( i.e., design changes, safety devices, warning devices or training and procedures) which recognizes that not all risk mitigation alternatives are equal. Figure 4 -1 depicts a hierarchy of controls representation from the National In stitute for Occupational Safety and Health Web site . Design fixes are among the most preferable solutions because they can often completely eliminate the hazard ; however, these types of fixes often have the highest upfront costs. In all cases , use a hierarchy of controls to develop risk mitigation alternatives. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-20 Figure 4 -1. Hierarchy of Controls (3) Based upon the specific information discovered during the investigation, selected alternatives should be formulated into feasible and effective rec ommendations and other alternatives discarded. The purpose of using the hierarchy of controls is to ensure investigators consider the entire range of available options and not just the cheap and easy ones ...which , usually have the least mishap prevention va lue. (4) A great deal of debate usually surrounds what is feasible and effective. Sometimes , a risk mitigation alternative is technically feasible and effective, but it is clearly not economically feasible or it has unacceptable mission consequences. In this case, discard the alternative. In other cases , it may not be clear that an alternative is either technically feasible or economically feasible. In these cases, include a recommendation for formal evaluation. (5) Most recommendations will be associated with causal findings, but not all causal findings will have recommendations. For example, a causal finding may not have a recommendation if the deficiency is already prohibited in policy ( i.e., instruction, technical order, etc.). Likewise, findings that are not causal may also have recommendations written against them. (6) Recommendations may vary in scope. Some actions can be taken at unit level. Other recommendations require a TYCOM, SYSCOM or other agency actions. (7) If a recomme ndation depends on tests or analyses that are incomplete when the report is transmitted, explain this and provide a reference to the tests or analyses (e.g. , deficiency report, study or contract number). OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-21 (8) Recommendations should require the action age ncy to correct a deficiency rather than to implement a particular solution. The action agency normally has greater expertise than the investigators and should be given the opportunity to develop the optimal solution for a problem. (9) Avoid recommendat ions that only require a study or evaluation. Action should be required based upon results of a recommended study. In most cases , it is not necessary to recommend a study or evaluation since studies or evaluations are implicit in the process. The recomm endation can simply require corrective action. (10) General, vague, sweeping or open -ended recommendatio ns that cannot be closed by the action agency are not appropriate. Write recommendations that have a definitive closing action. (11) Do not recom mend briefing personnel on the ev ent. Such a briefing is a basic commander responsibility and a normal function of safety offices at all levels of command. (12) Do not recommend reminding personnel of the import ance of simply doing their jobs properly. However, recommendations to place CAUTIONS and WARNINGS in technical order guidance relating to the adverse consequences of not doing one's job properly , may be appropriate. Recommendations for a specific action such as refresher training, impl ementing in - process inspections, etc., to ensure job duties are being properly performed , may also be appropriate since they are specific and can be closed. (13) Include only one action for each recommendation. Rather than sub -grouping recommendations (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c , etc. ), use a new recommendation number. Do not create a recommendation in the RMI to state that there are no recommendations. (14) Since recommendations are stand -alone items, when writing them , follow the guidance in subparagraphs 416e(14)(a) through 416e (14)(d). (a) Spell out acronyms in each recommendation. (b) Include the item to which the recommendation applies. (c) Do not write \"Recommend...\" at the beginning of the recommendation. (d) Do not write \"NAVSEA should...\" in the recommendation; just start with the required action. The action agencies are the office of primary responsibility (OPR) and office of collateral responsibilities (OCR). (15) Determining the appropriate action agencies for each recommendation. Assign action agencies for all recommendations. An OPR is required for every recommendation. Although an OCR is not required, they are appropriate for many recommendations. List only OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-22 one OPR per recommendation. More than one OCR may be listed for an in dividual recommendation. OPRs and OCRs will be assigned by name and UIC for a given recommendation. OPRs will have the authority to update and recommend the recommendation for closure. f. Other Findings of Significance and Other Recommendations of Significance. Guidance for developing and documenting primary findings and recommendations applies similarly to every Other Finding of Significance and Other Recommendation of Significance. Spell out acronyms in each Other Finding of Significance and Other Recommendation of Significance. (1) Other Findings of Significance are findings that the safety investigators believe could contribute to future mishaps, but were not part of the event seque nce. Other Findings of Significance are derived from Non -Factors Worthy of Discussion. (2) Other Recommendations of Significance are recommendations resulting from Other Findings of Significance. Each Other Finding of Significance will be followed by one or more corresponding Other Recommendation of Significance. Assign an OPR and office of collateral responsibility (as required) to each Other Recommendation of Significance. 417. Hazard Reporting . a. General . Hazard reporting provides a means for units to report a real or potential hazardous condition that could cause injury, illness or death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property or mission degradation to the Naval Enterprise. Hazard reporting is an important part of the DON m ishap prevention program because hazard reporting alerts NAVSAFECEN, CMC (SD) and safety officers and managers of hazardous conditions where risk is elevated so that risk controls can be devised and implemented before a mishap occurs. This approach to man aging safety and risk aligns with an important goal of the Navy Safety Management System to transition from reactive safety and risk management to proactive safety and risk management. Hazard reporting also facilitates tracking, trending and widespread dissemination of hazard information to alert naval communities. Communication of hazards to Navy and Marine Corps systems command(s) and acquisition program manager(s) provides important information to systems safety processes so that newly developed and pr ocured systems are designed with safety features already incorporated. b. Hazard Categories . Hazards are divided into the two categories listed in subparagraphs 417b(1) and 417b(2): (1) An act or event (i.e., near miss) that may have resulted in a mi shap where the fatality, injury, illness, property damage or loss of an asset was avoided merely by chance, the actions of an individual or individuals, a small measure of distance or a few moments in time. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-23 (2) A workplace condition that might result in injury, health impairment, illness, disease or fatality to any person who is exposed to the condition or which might result in damage to or loss of property or equipment. c. Importance of Hazard Reporting . It is essential that commanding officers encou rage and command safety programs foster, hazard reporting. Hazards that affect organizations outside the command or activity must be reported to higher authority. HAZREPs may include descriptions of corrective action (risk controls) undertaken by the com mand, which would benefit other commands facing similar problems. Local hazard reporting programs are not a substitute for reports outlined in this manual. Note: HAZREPs do not replace hazard abatement program requirements found in either OPNAV M -5100. 23 of 5 June 2020 or MCO 5100.29C, volume 6 . d. Purposes of Hazard Reports . Hazard reporting is used for five broad purposes listed in subparagraphs 417d(1) through 417d(5): (1) To report a hazardous condition and the mitigating action taken, so that others may take similar action. (2) To report a hazardous condition and recommend corrective action to others. (3) To report a hazard condition so that another organization may determine and take appropriate corrective action. (4) To document a continuing hazardous condition in order to establish risk severity and exposure for trending purposes. (5) To report a hazardous act or event (i.e., near miss) that may have resulted in a mishap where the fatality, injury, illness, property damage or loss of asset was avoided merely by chance, the actions of a single person, a small measure of distance or a few moments in time. Recommended corrective actions should also be provided. e. Hazard Identification . Individuals or commands with direct, first -hand knowledge of the circumstances surrounding a hazard are the most effective at identifying and reporting hazards and suggesting possible mitigating strategies. Some methods used in anticipating or identifying hazards before a mishap occurs include: Analysis of mishap data; observation and investigation of near misses; reports of unsafe acts or hazards by personnel; safety inspections; industrial hygiene surveys; safety assessments ; job hazard analyses; and the review of policies, procedures, instruct ions and operations. Risk management, applied in the planning stages of an operation, will identify hazards at the earliest possible opportunity. An essential element of an effective command safety program, risk management includes a review of operating procedures, analysis OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-24 of equipment failures, etc., for hazard detection and assessment. Additional information on hazard identification is provided in OPNAV M -5100.23 of 5 June 2020, chapter B5. f. Hazard Assessment . Two vital parts of hazard assessment are classifying the hazard according to the severity of the expected damage and determining the probability or likelihood that the identified hazard will occur. This assessment results in the assignment of a RAC. A RAC of 1 or 2 is considered a severe h azard while a RAC of 3, 4 or 5 is considered routine. Severe hazards should receive priority when allocating resources for corrective actions. For U.S. Navy, s ee OPNAVINST 3500.39D, enclosure (1), for detailed methods of determining severity and probabil ity and a risk assessment matrix that is used to determine a RAC. For U.S. Marine Corps, see MCO 5100.29C, volume 2. g. Hazard Investigations . (1) The quality of a HAZREP depends directly on the quality of the investigation into its attendant circumstances. Typically, hazards are investigated by an SIO. However, for some hazardous conditions and events (e.g., near misses) potential severity of the condition or event may warrant more investigative rigor than what is typically provided by an SI O. In these circumstances, convening authorities are encouraged to consider appointing an SIB to conduct the investigation. (2) HAZREPs are not privileged. Promises of confidentiality are prohibited for hazard investigations. See paragraph 804 of thi s manual for further guidance on promises of confidentiality. (3) The contents of HAZREPs may be divulged to outside agencies in response to FOIA request. Therefore, when submitting a HAZREP, do not include information such as names, dates, locations or any other details that could be traced to a specific mishap. Do not include any PSI in HAZREPs. Do not provide any personally identifiable information in HAZREPs. (4) Near miss events should be treated as a rare gift by commanders and safety profess ionals because they afford us the opportunity to examine both latent conditions and active failures that could have caused a mishap, but the event did not result in loss of life, injury or significant property damage. Near miss events should be investigat ed and reported whenever discovered. h. HAZREP Submission Criteria . A HAZREP is intended to be submitted when the elimination and control of a given hazard has a command -wide or community -wide implication in reducing mishaps. Subparagraphs 417h(1) ugh specific submission criteria: MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-25 (1) All identified hazards and near misses where information is considered valuable if shared with other commands or communities or the Naval Enterprise. (2) A previously unrecognized hazard so that a nother agency may determine appropriate corrective action to eliminate the hazard. (3) Any other unusual hazard discovered during maintenance, repair, inspections or evolutions where notifying other activities may prevent similar mishaps. The intent is not to conflict with other regular maintenance reporting requirements or any portion of the activity's overall safety program, but to assist in coordination of the total safety effort. (4) Events that are not a DoD mishap, but still require a safety re port per paragraph 218 of this manual. Note: Hazards that involve a defined naval aircraft are reported using the procedures in OPNAVINST 3750.6S. (5) The RMI must be used to submit HAZREPs described in this manual. HAZREPs should include recommending corrective action to eliminate the identified hazards and must include recommended corrective actions when a severe hazard has been identified (i.e., RAC 1 or 2). HAZRECs with recommendation actions beyond the submitting command must be endor sed using the process described in chapter 6 of this manual. (6) SIBs must give careful consideration to using the HAZREP to disseminate important hazard information discovered during the course of their investigation. While hazards that are found to b e causal will eventually be identified and discussed and that information disseminated as part of a SIREP, the importance of the hazard information may warrant earlier dissemination in a HAZREP before a SIREP has been released. SIBs should err on the side of early dissemination of hazard information. Additionally, during the course of their investigations, SIBs many times discover hazards that are not found to be causal in the mishap under investigation. SIBs must use the HAZREP to disseminate this hazar d information. (7) Submit HAZREPs with a severe RAC (i.e., RAC 1 or 2) within 72 hours of detecting the hazard. Submit all other HAZREPs as soon as possible. (8) HAZREPs are usually unclassified. Omit any portion of a HAZREP that warrants a security classification; substitute the word \"CLASSIFIED\" in its place and submit a separate classified supplement. In the unlikely event that a meaningful unclassified HAZREP cannot be produced unless classified information is used, submit a classified message report. Send classified supplements and classified HAZREPs to NAVSAFECEN at NAVSAFECEN_CLASSIFIED_MISHAP@navy.smil.mil . OPNAV VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 4-26 (9) Individuals reluctant to identify themselves may enter and submit an anonymous report to COMNAVSAFECEN using the NAVSA FECEN ANYMOUSE program. This method is pertinent when unique situations or embarrassing circumstances exist. NAVSAFECEN protects the confidentiality of these anonymous reports and takes action or coordinates action with the appropriate action agency. If the circumstances warrant, NAVSAFECEN may also submit the ANYMOUSE as a HAZREP after removing identifying information. Information about the NAVSAFECEN ANYMOUSE program, including how to submit an ANYMOUSE, is available online at Web site: https://navalsafetycenter.navy.mil/Contact -Us/Anymouse - Submission/ . i. HAZREP Censorship . It is contrary to the spirit of the Navy and Marine Corps mishap prevention program for perso nnel in the chain of command to edit, change or censor the contents of a HAZREP. The HAZREP endorsement process provides senior commands with the only acceptable method to express disagreement with the contents of a HAZREP. j. Hazard Recommendation (HAZ REC) Management . Open HAZRECs will be managed in the RMI following the procedures explained in chapter 6 of this manual. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-1 CHAPTER 5 SAFETY INVESTIGATION ENDORSEMENT PROCESS 501. Purpose . To explain the process, roles, responsibilities and timelines to review, endorse, finalize and close out safety investigation reports Safety Investigation Reports (SIREP) and hazard reports (HAZREP ), from the time the investigation is complete and the SIREP or HAZREP is released by the safety investigation board (SIB) or single investigating officer (SIO), until the release of the final endorsement to the SIREP or H AZREP. 502. Applicability . The endorsement process described in this chapter applies to all SIREPs and HAZREPs that require endorsement, whether the investigation was conducted by an SIB or by an SIO. 503. General . a. The process described in this chapter to review, endorse and close out SIREPs represents a major break from the previous process . The previous endorsement process relied on a specifically defined endorsing chain that typically mirrored the operational chain of command, to conduct a fo rmal and sequential review and endorsement of a SIREP, from an SIB investigation . Each command in the endorsing chain reviewed both the SIREP and the previous endorser(s) comments and recommendations, then added their own endorsement. This previous proce ss was extremely lengthy, often requiring more than a year from mishap occurrence to final endorsement and closeout. b. The new methodology described in this chapter adopts most of the U.S. Air Force's Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE) process when S IREPs and HAZREPs require endorsement. The MOFE process relies on a concurrent 45-calendar day review and endorsement period (i.e., Concurrent Comment Period) for all endorsers and interested parties, except for the final endorser. While there remains a requirement for those identified as required endorsers to critically review the SIREP or HAZREP during the Concurrent Comment Period, there is no requirement for endorsers to provide comments if they concur with the entire SIREP or HAZREP as written by the SIB or SIO. The absence of a comment is considered tacit approval of the SIREP or HAZREP. c. Once the Concurrent C omment Period ends, a second 45 -calendar day review and endorsement period (i.e., Deliberation and Adjudication Period) begins for the fin al endorser. During this period, the final endorser will review and adjudicate all comments and recommendations that have been made by the endorsers, then complete and release the final endorsement. With the release of the final endorsement, the investig ation is officially considered closed. The new endorsement process will dramatically shorten the timeline from the release of a SIREP or HAZREP, to the final endorsement and closeout. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-2 d. The new, concurrent endorsement process does not minimize the impo rtance of endorsers and is a critical final step to finalize a SIREP or HAZREP. For mishaps , endorsers must still carefully review and evaluate the SIREP and ensure that the SIB or SIO completed a sufficiently rigorous investigation that uncovered all of the root causes of the mishap. The same applies for hazard investigations requiring endorsement, except the endorsers should focus on the sufficiency of the investigation in describing the characteristics of the hazard and its underlying causes. Endorser s must also verify that the controls recommended by the SIB or SIO are sufficiently strong enough to mitigate the identified risks and are sufficiently practical and feasible to implement. Note: The terms \"review and endorsement process,\" \"endorsement p rocess,\" and \"MOFE process\" may be used interchangeably to describe the process explained in this chapter. The acronym \"MOFE\" and the term \"final endorsement\" may also be used interchangeably to describe the product released by the final endorser that fin alizes the SIREP or HAZREP and officially closes the investigation. 504. Determination of the Requirement for Endorsement . All SIREPs and HAZREPs that contain recommendations or corrective actions must be endorsed. 505. SIREP Endorsement Process Steps and Timeline . This section describes each step in the endorsement (i.e., MOFE) process. Figure 5-1 illustrates a nominal endorsement timeline. a. Step 1. Report Submission . The SIB or SIO completes the investigation and submits the SIREP or HAZREP into the RMI POR . b. Step 2. Convening Authority Review . The convening authority safety officer or safety staff conducts an administrative review of the entire SIREP or HAZRE P submitted by the SIB or SIO. This review must be completed within 10 business days. This review will: (1) Ensure the investigative guidance and documentation standards established in this instruction have been met; (2) Ensure adequate evidence an d analysis is presented and sufficient to support the investigation's findings, conclusions and accepted causal factors; (3) Ensure Department of Defense (DoD) HFACS codes are assigned and sufficient; OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-3 Figure 5-1. Nominal Endorsement Timeline 20 30 40 60 70 50 90 0 10 80 100 110 120 SIB/Single Investigating Officer completes investigation and enters SIREP into RMI Convening Authority Review. Required endorsers identified (10 calendar days) NA VSAFECEN completes Quality Control (QC) check. (14 calendar days) Concurrent Comment Period begins. Required endorsers notified. Concurrent Comment Period (45 calendar days) Deliberation and Adjudication Period (45 calendar days) Concurrent Comment Period ends. All required endorsers and optional endorsers have completed their review of the SIREP/HAZREP and necessary comments have been added into RMI Adjudication and Deliberation Period ends. Final endorsement released, officially closing the investigation. Adjudication and Deliberation Period begins. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-4 (4) Ensure recommendations and action agents are assigned for each accepted causal factor; (5) Determine if the SIREP or HAZREP requires endorsement (i.e., requires entry into the MOFE process) per guidance in paragraph 504; and (6) When an endorsement is required, identify the specific commands or activities that are required endorsers per paragraph 506 and enter the endorser information in the RMI. Note: During Step 2, the conve ning authority identifies the specific commands or activities that are required endorsers and informally lists the commands or activities by name and UIC in the Comments for Approval Authority box.\" T he NAVSAFECEN will take the list provided by the convening authority and enter the list of commands and activities into the MOFE during its quality control review (Step 3). c. Step 3. NAVSAFECEN Quality Control Review . The NAVSAFECEN conducts a quality control review of the SIREP or HAZREP. Omissions or deficiencies identified during this review are addressed with the SIB or SIO directly or through the convening authority safety officer or safety staff. This review must be completed within 14 business days. Once this review is complete, the SIREP or HAZREP will be released by the NAVSAFECEN and the report enters the concurrent comment period . The unendorsed SIREP or HAZREP is also available for viewing in the RMI database. d. Step 4. Concurrent Comment Period . The 45 -calendar day concurrent comment period begins when the NAVSAFECEN quality control checks are completed. During this period, all required endorsers must and other authorized individuals may, review the SIREP or H AZREP concurrent ly. Endorsers must assess the overall rigor and thoroughness of the safety investigation, evaluating the findings, causal factors, recommendations and DoD HFACS codes that were assigned by the SIB or SIO. Endorsers who have substantive co mments must enter those comments into the RMI POR database within 45 calendar days. Endorsement c omments should follow the format provided in chapter appendix 5 -A. Required endorsers who concur with the findings, causal factors, recommendations and DoD H FACS codes in the SIREP or HAZREP and have no comments after completing their review, have no further required actions, with two exceptions as listed in subparagraphs 505d (1) and 505d (2). (1) The convening authority must provide comments even if \"concur as written\" is the only applicable comment made. Note: The RMI offers a free text box to enter comments during the concurrent comment period . Endorsers must first identify a reference point from the SIREP before entering comments. Typically, the ref erence point will be a finding, causal factor, DoD HFACS code or OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-5 recommendation. See chapter appendix 5 -A for more information on organizing endorsement comments. (2) Action agencies with OPRs that are assigned a recommendation or recommendations, must provide comments informing the convening authority on the feasibility of the recommendation, give advice to ensure the recommendation is properly worded or aligned and provide a status if available. Note: The RMI can provide an e -mail notification wh en a SIREP or HAZREP has entered the concurrent comment period once the command or activity e -mails have been manually added into the RMI. UAs should refer to The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide for details on establishing e-mail notifications. e. Step 5. Deliberation and Adjudication Period . Once the 45 -calendar day concurrent comment period concludes , the 45 -calendar day deliberation and adjudication period begins. During this time, the final endorser will review and adjudicate all comments and complete the final endorsement. When complete, the final endorsement is released and entered into the RMI database. The MOFE represents the independent final evaluation and position on the ca uses, findings, recommendations and DoD HFACS codes of a safety or hazard investigation. Release of the final endorsement officially closes the investigation. 506. Determining SIREP and HAZREP Endorsers . The commands, activities and individuals listed i n subparagraphs 506a(1) through 506a(12) and in subparagraphs 506b(1) through 506b(4), are either required or optional reviewers, as indicated, during the concurrent comment period for all SIREPS and HAZREPs that require endorsement. a.

(2) Component commanders of unified commands when the mishap occurred during contingency operations. (3) Individual(s) found causal in the formal SIREP. (4) DON agencies outside the investigating command, if their functions were involved in the mishap or hazard (optional). Note: Unsolicited comments by other agencies and organizations reviewing the formal SIREP may comment on the findings, human factors and recommendations even though they are neither in the chain of command, nor a designated action command o r agency. 507. Endorsement Prohibitions . a. Endorsements or extracts from endorsements must not be appended to or included in, JAGMAN investigation reports, nor any other reports. b. Endorsements must not include any reference to disciplinary action or any other administrative action in connection with the mishap being endorsed. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-7 508. Extension of the Concurrent Comment Period . a. Required endorsers may request an extension of the concurrent comment period . Requests must provide sufficient justifica tion. Requests for an extension will be denied if requested after the 45 -day concurrent comment period has concluded. b. Only CNO N09F (i.e., for Navy investigations) and Director, CMC SD (i.e., for Marine Corps investigations) are authorized to grant e xtensions. 509. Reopening an Investigation . a. The authority to reopen an investigation rests only with the convening authority and CNO N09F (i.e., for Navy investigations) or Director, CMC SD (i.e., for Marine Corps investigations). b. If any endorser concludes that an investigation is incomplete or a SIREP or HAZREP is inadequate, they must recommend the reopening of the investigation by plainly stating this recommendation with specific justification when providing comments during the concurre nt comment period . Note: Disagreement with a particular factor or recommendation is insufficient grounds to reopen an investigation. Disagreements of this kind should be addressed in the endorser comments during the concurrent comment period. c. When an investigation is reopened, the convening authority or higher authority who has directed the reopening, must clearly specify the areas of concern or deficiencies to the SIB or SIO. d. Reopened investigations will be completed within 30 days unless an extension is requested by the SIB and approved by the convening authority. 510. Introduction of New Information . If, during the deliberation and adjudication period , CNO N09F (i.e., for Navy investigations) or Director, CMC SD (i.e., for Marine Corps investigations), learns facts that were not available to safety investigators or that shed new light on the published findings, causes and recommendations, they must take one of the actions in subparagraph s 510a or 510b. a. Reopen the investigation. b. Include the new facts as a \"Comments for MOFE\" by selecting the \"Provide Comments for MOFE\" link. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 5-8 511. Submission of Comments after the Concurrent Comment Period . Comments cannot be entered into the RMI once the concurrent comment period has closed. Comments may be submitted via e -mail to the NAVSAFECEN , but are considered unofficial comments and might not be used during the MOFE deliberation. Subparagraphs 511a through 511d list the NAVSAFECEN e -mail addresses by directorate. a. Aviation Safety Programs Directorate (Code 10): NAVSAFECEN_CODE10_AVIATION@navy.mil . b. Shore Safety Directorate (Code 20): c.

Commandant of the Marine Corps (Safety Division) Ground: HQMC_SAFETY_DIVISION@usmc.mil . 512. Final Endorsement . The final endorsement ( i.e. MOFE) will address factors , recommendations, other recommendations of significance, designated action agency responsibilities and DoD HFACS coding. The final endorsement is used to: a. Provide comments about factors to address procedural errors, changes to causal or not causal, additions or deletions or to add information not available to the SIB. Provide specific information to support the requested changes. b. Provide comments about recommendations to address procedural errors, changes to designated action agencies or to make additions or deletions. (1) If changes to designated action agencies are required, provide contact information for the newly -designated action agency, to include the name, rank or GS grade, office symbol, DSN or commercial ph one number and Government e -mail address. Additionally, comments may address the recommendation narrative to clarify intent or correct errors. (2) If a recommendation has already been completed and the action agency has provided sufficient documentatio n of actions taken, the final endorser may close the recommendation in the MOFE. c. The final endorser will be: OPNAV M -5102.1 Sep 2021 5-9 (1) CNO N09F (i.e., for Navy investigations) and Director, CMC SD (i.e., for Marine Corps investigations) for all Class A mishaps and all explosive mishaps; (2) CNO N09F (i.e., for Navy investigations) and Director, CMC SD (i.e., for Marine Corps investigations) for all safety investigations they directed; or (3) The convening authority for all other class mishaps and hazard investigations that require endorsement. Note: CNO N09F (i.e., for Navy investigations) and Director, CMC SD (i.e., for Marine Corps investigations) have the authority to be the final endorser for any safety investigation. When exercising this prerogative, they will coordinate with the convening authority . 513. Significant Changes to Findings . If the fi nal endorser adds a person to a causal finding or significantly changes an individual's role in the findings, the final endorser will notify the individual through his or her command safety representative and afford the individual an opportunity to submit comments. Comments are not required. a. The individual will be provided with pertinent sections of the draft final endorsement to review. b. No others may provide further comment (i.e., the individual's command). c. The individual has 15 calendar da ys to provide comments. d. The individual may request an extension with justification to the final endorser who may grant an extension. e. The MOFE must not be released until after the individual has had an opportunity to respond . OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 5-A-1 Appendix 5 -A APPENDIX 5 -A MOFE ENDORSEMENT TEM PLATES Templates are provided in paragraphs 1 through 4 of this appendix to organ ize the Memorandum of Final Endorsement ( MOFE ) comments. 1. General Endorsement Guidelines . a. The convening authority (CA) must provide comments even if \"Concur as Written\" is the only applicable comment made. b. The absence of comments by endorsers other than the CA is considered tacit approval of the SIR EP or HAZREP and will be considered equivalent to commenting \"Concur as Written.\" 2.

OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-1 CHAPTER 6 MANAGING MISHAP AND HAZARD RECOMMENDATIONS 601. Purpose . To provide procedures and guidelines for managing open mishap recommendations (MISREC) and hazard recommendations (HAZREC) and for determining, managing and accepting the risks associated with those MISRECs and HAZRECs. Authorities and procedures to modify, cancel and close open M ISRECs and HAZRECs are also explained. 602. General . Safety investigations result in MISRECs and HAZRECs developed by the Single Investigating Officer ( SIO) or Safety Investigation Board ( SIB) designed specifically to address hazards identified during th e investigation. MISRECs and HAZRECs are scrutinized during the endorsement process and approved by the final endorser as discussed in chapter 5. Some MISRECs and HAZRECs are completed and closed out quickly while others take considerable time to complet e, primarily due to the complexity of the required actions. These open MISRECs and HAZRECs increase the risk to naval operations and activities; therefore, a systematic process is required to assess the increased risk and present this information to naval leaders so that the elevated risk is understood and accepted at the right level. Effective management of MISRECs and HAZRECs forms an essential component of the Department of the Navy's (DON) mishap prevention efforts. See OPNAV M -5100.23 of 5 June 2020 for more information on risk management and hazard identification, reporting, prevention, control and abatement within the Navy safety management system . See also MCO 5100.29C, volume 1 (Marine Corps Safety Management System Overview) and MCO 5100.29C, v olume 2 (Risk Management). 603. Policy . a. The Risk Management Information ( RMI ) must be used to manage the life cycle of MISRECs and HAZRECs from their approval by the final endorser to final disposition and closeout. b. Offices of Primary Responsibility ( OPR ) of open MISRECs and HAZRECs must provide an update at least every six months until the MISREC or HAZREC is closed. c. Hazard Review Boards (HRB) must be established at the controlling command level to manage open MISRECs and HAZRECs and the risk assessment process per the requirements defined in this chapter. See paragraph 608 for more information on HRBs. d. A formal risk assessment is required for all open MISRECs and HAZRECs and the risk assessment must be approved and signed at the appropriate level. (1) For MISRECs from Class A and B mishaps and all risk assessment code (RAC) 1 and 2 HAZREPs, the OPR's controlling command must approve and sign the risk assessment. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-2 (2) For MISRECs from Class C, D and E mishaps and all RACs 3 and 4 HAZREPs, the OPR's commander or commanding officer must approve and sign the risk assessment. e. The approval authority to close out MISRECs and HAZRECs when the actions taken are different than the proposed actions or where no action has been taken or will be taken, is CNO N09F for the Navy or Director , CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps . See paragraph 605 for MISREC and HAZREC closeout procedures and paragraph 606 for assignment of approval authority . 604. Managing Open MISRECs and HAZRECs . a. Use of the RMI is required to manage updates and final disposition of MISRECs and HAZRECs. b. The OPR must provide MISREC and HAZREC updates in the RMI every six months until the MISREC or HAZREC is closed. In cases where the O PR does not have sufficient RMI privileges to submit the update, the OPR must work with the RMI user administrator (UA) of their assigned command to post updates to the RMI. MISREC and HAZREC updates will include the items in subparagraphs 604b(1) through 604b(8): (1) Actions taken and actions planned. (2) Results of development and testing. (3) Significant problems encountered. (4) Delays and delay causes. (5) Rationale and any supporting risk assessment to justify decisions made. (6) Concurrence or non -concurrence by other affected commands or activities. (7) Percent of equipment modified, if applicable. (8) Justification for any risk that was transferred to a lower echelon. 605. Closing Out MISRECs and HAZRECs . a. The OPR must request closure in the RMI of every MISREC and HAZREC from the appropriate authority who determines if the closing action is acceptable. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-3 b. A risk assessment must accompany all requests for MISREC or HAZREC closeouts when the actions taken a re different from the proposed actions or where no action is taken. See subparagraph 603d for details on risk assessments. c. The OPR must upload supporting documentation with requests for closeout (e.g., technical publication pages, risk assessment, tr aining plans or HRB results). d. Acceptable MISREC and HAZREC closeout actions are provided in subparagraphs 605d(1) through 605d(4): (1) Recommended changes have been completed to all applicable publications and those publications have been issued . Include supporting details such as publication name and number, date of publication and the affected page numbers in the publication. (2) Recommended modifications to all applicable equipment, systems or items have been completed. Development and appr oval of the technical change or changes is insufficient grounds for requesting a MISREC or HAZREC closeout since the elevated risk remains. MISREC or HAZREC closeout must not be requested until modifications or design changes have been implemented on all applicable equipment, systems or items. (3) Recommended studies or evaluations have been completed, conclusions were validated and actions on all validated requirements were completed. In these cases, the OPR must include detailed rationale, to include a risk assessment, to support their conclusions. (4) Recommended changes to training have been completed. If the training changes were incorporated into a publication, see paragraph 605d(1). Otherwise, corrective action annotations must include, as a minimum, the implementation method of the new training, the date implemented and the currency requirement for the training. e. The approval authority will approve closeout only after all actions have been completed and properly annotated. f. For MISRE Cs and HAZRECs closed without action taken (i.e., to include no action taken), document the risk assessment and approved closeout in the RMI. g. For MISRECs and HAZRECs that were not implemented because of the planned retirement of a system, piece of equ ipment or item, the retirement date must be annotated. If the system, piece of equipment or item has not yet been completely removed from service at the time that the MISREC or HAZREC closeout is requested, an approved and signed risk assessment must be s ubmitted. See subparagraph 603d. for details on approving risk assessments. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-4 606. Reassignment of OPR Responsibilities . Action agencies have the authority to reassign OPR responsibilities to other individuals within their command. 607. Assignment of Approval Authority . a. The approval authority to close out MISRECs and HAZRECs when the actions taken are different than the proposed actions or where no action has been taken or wi ll be taken, is CNO N09F for the Navy or Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps . b. Use table 6-1 to determine the approval authority to close out MISRECs and HAZRECs when the actions taken are the same as the proposed actions. Rule If the MISREC or HAZREC action agency is... And the MISREC or HAZREC involves a ... Then authority to close the MISREC or HAZREC is... 1 an O -5 level command (e.g., battalion, ship, squadron, submarine), Class A mishap, CNO N09F for the Navy, Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps. 2 Class B or C mishap, controlling command of the action agency . 3 Class D or E mishap, the immediate superior in command of the O -5 command. 4 RAC 1 or 2 hazard, CNO N09F for the Navy, Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps. 5 RAC 3 or 4 hazard, the immediate superior in command of the O -5 command. 6 an O -6 level command (e.g., base, battalion, Marine amphibious group, ship, submarine, type wing), Class A mishap, CNO N09F for the Navy, Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps. 7 Class B, C, D or E mishap, controlling command of the action agency . 8 RAC 1 or 2 hazard, CNO N09F for the Navy, Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-5 Rule If the MISREC or HAZREC action agency is... And the MISREC or HAZREC involves a ... Then authority to close the MISREC or HAZREC is... 9 RAC 3 or 4 hazard, controlling command of the action agency . 10 a systems command or a controlling command , CNO N09F for the Navy, Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps. 11 the Naval Safety Center or CMC (SD), CNO N09F for the Navy, Director, CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps. Table 6-1. Determination of MISREC and HAZREC Approval Authority 608. Hazard Review Boards . a. Each controlling command will either establish an HRB or incorporate the requirements of this paragraph into the charter or operating instructions of an existing council or committee formed per OPNAV M -5100.23 of 5 June 2020, chapter B4 (i.e., Navy controlling commands) or MCO 5100.29C, volume 1, chapter 6 (i.e., Marine Corps controlling commands) . (1) The HRB will meet at least semiannually. A memorandum for the record must be created for each HRB meeting and retained at the controlling command for three calendar years beyond the current calendar year. (2) The HRB should be chaired by the controlling command's safety officer or safety manager. Collective bargaining agreements may require an employee representative to be a member of entities affecting employee health or safety, such as an HRB. Additional representation is left to the discretion of the controlling command . b. The broad purpose of an HRB is to evaluate hazards that exist within the operating environment of a command and its subordinate commands to better understand the risks associated with those hazards, determine whether stronger risk controls are needed and keep the commander informed of those risks. At a minimum, HRBs will: (1) Manage all open MISREC s from Class A and B mishaps and all open RACs 1 and 2 HAZRECs assigned to OPRs within the command including subordinate commands. (2) Periodically reevaluate the effectiveness of risk controls that were put in place when MISRECs and HAZRECs were implem ented in order to determine if these controls are having OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-6 the desired effect. In cases of elevated risk, make a recommendation to the convening authority to convene a hazard investigation by an SIO or SIB. (3) Evaluate risk assessments prepared by OPRs for sufficiency. Submit risk assessments to the commander for review and signature. (4) Review and approve updates from OPRs for open MISRECs and HAZRECs. Upload all approved updates into the RMI. (5) Provide a brief or written report to the comman der at least semiannually. At a minimum, the brief or report must include the information in subparagraphs 608b (5)(a) through 608b (5)(e): (a) Total number of open MISRECs from Class A and B mishaps and RACs 1 and 2 HAZRECs held by OPRs within the comm and, including subordinate commands. (b) The status of all open MISRECs from Class A and B mishaps and RACs 1 and 2 HAZRECs held by OPRs within the command, including subordinate commands and identification of those that have been open for more than tw o calendar years. (c) Number of MISRECs and HAZRECs that have been closed since the last brief or report. (d) A review of all previously approved risk assessments still in effect. (e) Areas of elevated risk that warrant increased attention or i nvestigation. c. Echelons of command below the controlling command are encouraged , but not required , to establish a similar HRB process to manage MISRECs from Class C through E mishaps and RACs 3 through 5 HAZREPs. Note: While an HRB is not required below the controlling command level, all open MISRECs and HAZRECs must be tracked by the action agency and command responsible for signing off the completed MISRECs and HAZRECs per table 6 -1. 609. Managing the MISREC and HAZREC Process at the Service Leve l. a. OPNAV N09F for the Navy and CMC (SD) for the Marine Corps are responsible for managing the overall MISREC and HAZREC process. Specific responsibilities include those listed in subparagraphs 609a (1) through 609a (5): (1) Track HA ZRECs. OPNAV -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 6-7 (2) Create and manage an independent, standardized process to evaluate the risks associated with open MISRECs and HAZRECs. (3) Create and keep current a prioritized list of open MISRECs and HAZRECs. (4) Periodically communicate prioritized r isks from this evaluation to controlling commands and other senior Navy and Marine Corps leaders in order to remove barriers that are preventing the completion of necessary actions to close MISRECs and HAZRECs. (5) Work closely with and provide assistan ce to the HRBs for controlling commands in the execution of their responsibilities. b. CNO N09F is solely responsible for the requirements in subparagraphs 609b (1) and 609b (2): (1) Verifying that specified actions required by MISRECs and HAZRECs have been completed by the appropriate action agencies . (2) Editing, calling complete or otherwise closing out languishing and obsolete MISRECs and HAZRECs. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-1 CHAPTER 7 RECORD KEEPING 701. Purpose . To provide the record keeping requirements for Navy and Marine Corps events (i.e., mishaps , hazards (including near misses) and incidents), except those events involving a defined naval aircraft. For events involving defined naval aircraft , refer to OPNAVINST 3750.6S . 702. General . Record keeping of events is vital to provide safety information to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA ), Department of Defense ( DoD ) and Department of the Navy ( DON ). These records are required by F ederal law and provide information to identify unsafe acts and condit ions and to supply corrective measures. Therefore, all OSHA recordable and DON reportable events are to be reported electronically , as required by this manual , to Commander, Naval Safety Center ( COMNAVSAFECEN ). 703. Electronic Record Keeping . The DON established a new unclassified system of records entitled, \"Risk Management Information System (RMI).\" RMI is a DON program of record and replaced the DON's legacy unclassified system of records entitled, Web -Enabled Safety System . RMI collect s information from active duty Service members, reservist Service members, DOD civilians and members of the public on fatalities, injuries, work -related illnesses and pertinent information for property damage incurred during DON operations, required of Federal Government agencies by the OSHA . The data maintained in this system will be used for analytical purposes to improve the DON's mishap prevention policies, procedures, standards and operations, as well as to ensure internal data quality assurance. a. RMI Information Sharing . RMI collects personally identifiable information ( PII) from the following existing DoD information systems: Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS); Marine Sier ra Hotel Aviation Readiness Program (M -SHARP); Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS); Defense Manpower Data Center Reporting System (DMDCRS); Navy and Marine Corps Medical Readiness Reporting System (MRRS); Aeromedical Services Information Managem ent System (ASIMS); Medical Protection System (MEDPROS); Corporate Enterprise Training Activity Resource Systems (CeTARS); Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS); Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation (DECKPLATE); Defense Civilian Payroll System (DCPS); Global Combat Support Systems - Marine Corps (GCSS -MC); Injury Verification Feed (IVF); Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS); Total Force Structure Management System (TFSMS); Enter prise Safety Applications Management System (ESAMS) - Injury/Illness Reporting and Tracking System (IIRTS); Force Risk Reduction (FR2); Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS); Person -Event Data Environment (PDE); Medical Mishap and Compensation Systems ( MMAC); PNS Occupational Accident and Injury Reporting System (POAIRS); Defense Injury and Unemployment Compensation System (DIUCS); Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS); Marine OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-2 Corps Training Informati on Management System (MCTIMS); Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS); and Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation (DLHWC). b.

RMI Measures and Safeguards to Address Privacy Risks . RMI include s, but is not limited to, the privacy risk measures and safeguards listed in subparagraphs 703c(1) through 703c(6). (1) Access controls. Access controls limit access to the application or specific functional areas therein. These controls consist of workflows, privileges and use r roles and DoD public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates and CAC -based log on. User roles are granted only to a level that is required for their job. (2) Confidentiality. Data is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes. (3) Integrity. Data is reviewed to ensure that it has not been altered or destroyed in an unau thorized manner. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-3 (4) Audits. Audit logs are kept and reviewed regularly by NAVSAFECEN staff to assess the adequacy of maintaining, managing and controlling events that may degrade the security posture of the application. Audit logs track events includ ing security audit startup and shutdown, changes in access control, successful and unsuccessful identification, authentication and authorization events. (5) Training. Security training is provided on a continuous basis to keep users alert to the securi ty requirements. Visual effects are used as constant reminders to ensure users always remain a ware of their responsibilities. (6) Physical Security. Consists of placing servers in a secure and protected location, limited access to individuals who have a need to access them. Access to each application is limited to authorized and appropriately cleared personnel as determined by the system manager. Physical entry is restricted by use of locks, guards and is accessible only to authorized, cleared person nel. The Navy RMI program will be hosted in the Air Force safety center's (AFSEC) site. The AFSEC site is based on Amazon GovCloud architecture. 704. Civilian Privacy Concern Cases . a. Privacy concern cases are cases that include sensitive PII which may require additional access restrictions and handling procedures. Privacy concern cases involve the types of on-duty civilian personnel work -related injuries or illnesses listed in subparagraphs 704a(1) through 704a(6) per 29 CFR 1904.29(b)(7) : (1) An injury or illness to an intimate body part or to the reproductive system; (2) An injury or illness resulting from a sexual assault; (3) Mental illness es; (4) HIV infection, hepatitis or tuberculosis; (5) Needlestick injuries and cuts from sharp object s that are contaminated with another person's blood or other pot entially infectious material; and Note: \"Sharps\" refers to medical sharps such as scalpels, blades, disposable scissors, suture equipment, stylets and trocars, broken test tubes and glass.\" (6) Other illnesses, if the employee independently and voluntarily requests that his or her name not be entered into the RMI . OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-4 b. Privacy concern cases may not have the employee's name and other PII searchable or visible to every user in the RMI . Instead, in the RMI, the word \"privacy case\" will be displayed in the space normally used for the employee's name. This will protect the privacy of the injured or ill employee when another employee, a former employee or an authorized employee representative is provided access to the RMI. Note: If a person entering the injury or illness in the RMI has a reasonable basis to believe that information describing t he privacy concern case may be personally identifiable even though the employee's name has been omitted in the RMI, that person may use discretion in describing the injury or illness in the RMI. The person must enter enough information to identify the cau se of the event and the general severity of the injury or illness, but need not include details of an intimate or private nature. For example, a sexual assault case could be described as \"injury from assault,\" or an injury to a reproductive organ could be described as \"lower abdominal injury.\" c. RMI will keep a separate, protected list of the case numbers and employee names for privacy concern cases . Per 29 CFR 1904.29(b)(10), privacy concern cases and their associated PII may only be disclosed in the limited situations listed in subparagraphs 704c(1) through 704c(3): (1) To an auditor or consultant hired by the employer to evaluate the safety and health program ; (2) To the extent necessary for processing a claim for workers' compensation or other insurance benefits; or (3) To a public health authority or law enforcement agency for uses and disclosures for which consent, an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not required under Department of Health and Human Services Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR 164.512. Note: Examples of public health authorities: Defense Health Agency, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, NAVSAFECEN , CMC (SD), military treatment facilities, fleet surgeons, force su rgeons, health care providers, safety investigators, etc. d. Procedures for handling and documenting privacy concern cases are in The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide . 705. Log of Work -Related Injuries and Illnesses . 29 CFR 1904.29, DoDI 6055.07 6 5100.8, MCO 8025.1E and OPNAV M -5100.23 of 5 June 2020 , require that a log (i.e., automated or manual) be maintained for on -duty civilian personnel of all work -related illnesses and inju ries beyond first aid treatment . The log must contain all of the fields found in OSHA Form 300. Chapter 2 lists DON reportable and OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-5 DoD and DON policy mandates that a similar log be maintained for on - and off -duty militar y personnel. OPNAVINST 5100.19F requires a similar log for military personnel afloat , regardless of duty status . a. All required information will be reported via the RMI , if feasible, so that an OSHA Form 300 can be downloaded, accessed and maintained electronically as the log of work -related injuries and illnesses for the command, unit or activity . b. RMI entries serve as the activity work -related ill ness and injury log (OSHA Form 300) to meet OSHA, DoD and DON record keeping requirements. c. The report function in the RMI allows the required separate civilian on -duty, military on - duty and military off -duty log of work -related injuries and illnesses (OSHA Form 300) to be downloaded or printed off by the activity , as needed. The injury log entry may also be printed off in PDF from the RMI . d. Ensure that civilian and military entries, on the log of work -related injuries and illnesses, are maintained as separate logs when downloading or printing from the RMI. e. The injury log entry feature i n the RMI may be used to replace the afloat injury report discussed in OPNAVINST 5100.19F . RMI allow s printing or electronic routing of data entered as an injury log to notify the commanding officer and the safety officer of the mishap and for entry into a deck log . f. 29 CFR 29(b)(3) requires OSHA recordable civilian personnel injuries or illness es to be recorded on the OSHA 300 and OSHA 301 within seven calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred. Entry into the RMI fulfills the OSHA requirement. g. If the RMI is not available to maintain an electronic log of work -related injuries and illnesses , then commands , units and activities must create a temporary log using the minimum required information in the OSH A 300 or download the OSHA 300 and maintain the log manually. See Appendix D. This temporary log must be maintained until such time that the information can be entered into the RMI. 706. Injury and Illness Incident Report . Entering the required injury and illness information in RMI fulfills the requirement to complete the OSHA 301 , Injury and Illness Incident Report. 707. Summary of Work -Related Injuries and Illnesses . All Navy and Marine Corps commands, units and activ ities employing civilian personnel must generate an OSHA 300A for each establishment annually for the preceding calendar year. Paragraphs 707a through 707f provides amplification of this requirement. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-6 a. The commander, commanding officer or officer -in-charge must certify that he or she has examined the log of work -related injuries and illnesses and reasonably believes, based on his or her knowledge of the process by which the information was recorded, that the annual summary is correct and complete. b. The commander, commanding officer or officer -in-charge must sign and date each OSHA 300A before posting. c. OSHA 300A must be posted in a conspicuous location no later than the first day of February each calendar year and remain in place until the thirtie th day of April. When posted, ensure the summary is not altered, defaced or covered by other material. d. Commands, units and activities must confirm successful submission of all DON reportable and OSHA recordable mishap data to the RMI database within 6 0 days of the end of the calendar year so that OSHA 300A is accurate through the end of the calendar year. In case of discrepancies, contact the NAVSAFECEN RMI help desk for assistance. e. Summaries for military personnel are optional; however, if poste d, they must be separate from civilian personnel summaries. f. These summaries may be printed from the pre -formatted reports section of the RMI. 708. Annual Report of Civilian Work -Related Injuries, Illnesses and Fatalities to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . a. In January of each calendar year, C NO N09F will use the RMI to provide each echelon 2 command a count of employees by UIC , as well as civilian OSHA 300 Log of Work -Related Injuries and Illnesses , for each subordinate command. While all commands are required to review any local mishap logs to ensure that the RMI information is accurate, the RMI information provided will be dated due to latency issues with the RMI processing , as well as preparation time. Special attention will be needed during the review for a period of approximately 60 days prior to the date of the NAVSAFECEN -provided log. The BLS requires that all injuries and illnesses during the calendar year be recorded . Other information technology system -generated list s of injuries and illnesses are n ot acceptable formats because these other systems do not include all of the required fields. However, these other systems may be us ed to assist in data gathering. b. Additional guidance on this annual report will be issued by NAVSAFECEN (Navy) and CMC (SD) (Marine Corps) that will precede a DON TRACKER tasker. 709. Record Retention and Disposition . OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 7-7 a. All SIREPs, work -related illness and i njury logs and event and hazard records must be retained for at least five years following the end of the calendar year in which they occurred. These records may be retained in electronic or hard copy format. For records readily available through the RMI , local electr onic or hard copy records retention is optional or as directed by local instruction or order. b. When ever possible, such parts of a mishap report held by NAVSAFECEN, available in hard-copy format only, should be converted to electronic format before dest ruction of the hard copies. The entire electronic file must be maintained by NAVSAFECEN for at least 30 years or until the end of the life cycle of the system involved in the mishap. At that time, the entire file may be transferred to the Naval Historica l Center. c. Upon completion of the SIREP by an SIB or SIO , members must not retain any notes pertaining to the investigation. All statements, diagrams, photographs, notes, etc., acquired or created during the investigation, must be forwarded to and ret ained by NAVSAFECEN. d. Upon completion of any safety investigatio n, activities and commands must destroy any privileged materials gathered during that investigation. e. Service and health records must be handled per MILPERSMAN 6150 -010 (Transfer of Outpatient and Dental Treatment Records, Officer and Enlisted) and MCO P1070.12K (Marine Corps Individual Records Administration Manual (Short Title : IRAM)). See Safety Reporting Resources section for online availability of these policies. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-1 CHAPTER 8 PROTECTION OF PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION 801. Purpose . To explain the concept of safety privilege and why it exists; to describe the special handling, use and release requirements for privileged safety information (PSI); and to assign authorities and responsibilities for the protection of PSI. 802. Background . a. Safety privilege is based on a natio nal defense need for rapid and accurate assessment of the causes of mishaps to prevent a re occurrence and maintain mission readiness. The Navy and Marine Corps protect PSI to ensure commanders quickly obtain accurate mishap information so that effective r isk controls can be implemented as soon as possible. This privilege creates restrictions on handling and releasing information in safety investigation reports. b. The ability of safety investigators to obtain critical safety information during an invest igation is dependent upon the trust that has been developed by protecting safety information, especially PSI, from misuse and unauthorized disclosure. Safety information must be used only for safety purposes. c. While protection of PSI from unauthorized disclosure is essential for the long term viability of the Department of the Navy's (DON) safety program, unnecessary impediments to the free flow of safety information to those with a need -to-know are a risk to mission readiness. Achieving the balance b etween the protection of PSI and the timely dissemination of safety information, to those with a need -to-know, can be accomplished if policies are written clearly and personnel know and understand those policies. 803. PSI. Information that is reflective of a deliberative process in the safety investigation or given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confidentiality, which the safety privilege protects from being released outside safety channels or from being used for any purpose except mish ap prevention. It includes products such as draft and final findings, evaluations, opinions, preliminary discussions, conclusions, mishap causes, recommendations, analyses and other material that would reveal the deliberations of safety investigators, inc luding reviews and endorsements. It also includes information given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confidentiality and any information derived from that information or direct or indirect references to that information. Note: Informati on in a statement given under a promise of confidentiality that is also available in a source that is not privileged, may be releasable, but that determination can only be made by Commander, Naval Safety Center ( COMNAVSAFECEN ). OPNAV M 804. Concept of Safety Priv ilege . Case law and statutory authority grant protection to certain information generated during safety investigations. This safety information is protected from public release and non -safety uses under executive privilege. The concept of privilege is important to the safety investigation process because it: a. Encourages safety investigators and the endorsers of Safety Investigation Reports (SIREP ) to provide complete , candid and forthright information, opinions, conclusions and recommendations concer ning a mishap; and b. Helps to overcome the reluctance of a witness to reveal complete and candid information to a safety investigator about the events surrounding a mishap. Witnesses may believe that the information could be embarrassing or detrimental to themselves, fellow Service members, their command, employer or others. A promise of confidentiality gives safety investigators a means by which to assure hesitant witnesses that they may voluntarily reveal information to the safety investigator without incurring personal jeopardy or causing harm to others in the process. A promise of confidentiality ensures that the statement will not be released under any circumstances. Separate and apart from offering a promise of confidentiality, a witness may also elect to withhold i nformation by exercising their constitutional right to avoid self -incrimination. Note: Safety investigators must not compel witnesses to provide a statement, nor will they administer an oath to witnesses prior to taking statements. 805. Promise of Conf identiality . In certain safety investigations and under specific circumstances as described in this paragraph , safety investigators can give a promise of confidentiality to any witness who provides evidence for the investigation to encourage frank or open communications. Use form JNAVMAR 5102/ 2 for this purpose. For safety investigations not requiring a promise of confidentiality to a witness, use form JNAVMAR 5102/1. Both forms are available from the Defense Logistics Agency Web site at https://forms.documentservices.dla.mil/order . Subparagraphs 805a through 805i provide promises of confidentiality requirements: a. Must be explicit and cannot be implied from the investigator's status or function. b. Must be documented in all instances in which a witness provides information pursuant to a promise of confidentiality. Witnesses are not sworn. Requiring them to take an oath prior to making a statement is prohibited. c. May be given only as needed to ensure forthright cooperation of the witness concerned and must not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses. d. Must be limited to the information given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confidentiality . Howe ver, witnesses need not limit their statements to matters to which they OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-3 could testify in court. Invite witnesses to express opinions and speculate on possible causes of the mishap. e. Must advise the witness in writing as to why they are providing their statement and of the limitations placed on the release of the statement they are providing. f. Must inform the witness that the promise of confidentiality applies only to information given to the safety investigator and not to the same information if gi ven to others. If the witness provides similar or identical information to another investigative body, that information, as a part of a non -safety investigation, is not protected from release by the safety privilege. g. May be given by safety investigat ors in all investigations of friendly fire mishaps and mishaps involving complex systems and military -unique items, operations or exercises. (1) Examples of mishaps that meet this requirement include those involving U.S. warships, weapons systems, military combat and tactical vehicles and ordnance and explosives. (2) Examples of mishaps that do not meet this requirement include those involving GMVs, falls from buildings, fi res in facilities and work -related illnesses not involving complex systems or military -unique items and unrelated to military operations or exercises. h. Must not be used in any off -duty mishap investigation. i. May be authorized for other mishap categories or in individual cases only by the Secre tary of the Navy ( SECNAV ) when SECNAV determines the authorization is in the interest of national security. (1) Single Investigati ng Officers ( SIO) and senior members of Safety Investigation Boards ( SIB) who believe a promise of confidentiality is needed for mishap categories other than those listed in subparagraph 804(g) must submit a formal request with justification to COMNAVSAFECEN through the convening authority . (2) COMNAVSAFECEN may request additional supporting information to make a decision, disapprove the request and return to the SIO or SIB senior member or favorably endorse the request and submit to the SECNAV via the assistant secret ary of the Navy (installations , energy and environment ) and deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for safety (DASN(S)) for final decision. Note: SECNAV may choose to delegate this decision authority in whole or in part to COMNAVSAFECEN. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-4 806. Protection of Safety Information, Including PSI . COMNAVSAFECEN is DON's custodian of safety information, including PSI and safety data and is responsible for establishing the appropriate policies, procedures and safeguards necessary to protect this inform ation as required by DoDI 6055.7 of 6 June 2011. 807. Privileged Safety Information . PSI includes the types of information described in subparagraphs 807a through 807c : a. Information given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confidential ity and any information derived from that information or direct or indirect references to that information. Note: SIOs and SIBs may share their list of witnesses with other non -safety investigations, if requested; however, information from interviews an d witness statements to an SIO or SIB, whether or not they are given under a promise of confidentiality, must not be shared with other non-safety investigative bodies. b. Products of deliberative processes of safety investigators, including those product s listed in subparagraphs 807b (1) through 807b (7): (1) Draft and final findings, evaluations, opinions, preliminary discussions, conclusions, mishap causes, recommendations, analyses and other material that would reveal the deliberations of safety inves tigators. (2) Draft and final diagrams and exhibits if they contain information that depicts the analysis of safety investigators. (3) Animations that incorporate privileged safety information. Un -interpreted animations made exclusively from flight recorder raw data, including military flight operations quality assurance data, are not protected by the safety privilege and are generally releasable. However, prior to release, especially in cases where the product is derived from aggregate data, such animations must be reviewed for sensitive national security content. Animations found to include information that could compromise national security to any degree must be handled appropriately. (4) Photographs, films and videotapes that are staged, reconstructed or simulated reenactments of possible or probable scenarios developed by or for the analysis of the safety investigator. However, photographs depicting a measuring device or object contrasted against mishap evide nce for the sole purpose of demonstrating the size or scale of the evidence are not considered privileged safety information and may be released. (5) Life sciences material that contains analysis by a safety investigator. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-5 (6) Notes taken by safety in vestigators in the course of their investigation, whether or not they are incorporated, either directly or by reference, in the final safety investigation report. (7) Reviews and endorsements of safety investigation reports. c. Portions of SIREPs. Th e preparation of a SIREP requires the SIO or SIB, to analyze the information gathered and to develop the findings, analysis, conclusions, causal factors and recommendations. Therefore, those parts of the SIREP are privileged. Note: During the safety in vestigation process, the ideas and opinions of SIOs and SIB members are protected from disclosure. No individual or entity outside of the investigative process may compel SIOs and SIB members to divulge their ideas or opinions developed or offered during the safety investigation process. 808. Unauthorized Uses of PSI . PSI must not be: a. Used, shared or released except as provided in this manual; b. Used to support disciplinary or adverse administrative action, to determine the misconduct or line-of-duty status of any personnel or used as evidence before any evaluation board; c. Used to determine liability in administrative claims or litigation, whether for or against the U.S. Government; or d. Released in response to requests for informat ion pursuant to section 552 of Title 5, U.S. Code (Freedom of Information Act), as amended by Public Law 114 -185 (Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act of 2016) and SECNAVINST 5720.42G (Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program) or in response to discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, except as specifically provided in this manual. 809. Unauthorized Dissemination or Disclosure of PSI . a. Navy and Marine Corps personnel having personal knowledge of the con tents of a SIREP must not release this information to others, except as permitted by this manual. b. Navy and Marine Corps personnel must not provide PSI to persons and activities outside DON. Forward any requests for safety information, including PSI by personnel outside DON to COMNAVSAFECEN. See paragraph 811 for additional details. c. Navy and Mari ne Corps personnel must not provide PSI to contractors, even those under contract with the DON unless a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) has been established. Only OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-6 COMNAVSAFECEN is authorized to approve NDAs for contractor personnel. When an NDA is in plac e, contractor personnel are authorized access to safety information, including PSI, in strict compliance with the terms of the NDA. d. A compromise of PSI occurs when unauthorized personnel are knowingly, willfully or negligently given access to PSI. Unauthorized personnel include those who do not have a safety need -to-know, even personnel within DON. Personnel who learn of an unauthorized release of PSI must immediately report it to their chain of command. e. Suspected instances of unauthorized pub lic disclosure of PSI must be reported promptly and investigated by the appropriate commander to determine the nature and circumstances of the unauthorized disclosure, the extent of the disclosure, any ramifications on protecting it from further release and the corrective and disciplinary action to be taken. f. Commanders will notify COMNAVSAFECEN of all instances of unauthorized disclosure of PSI. g. The unauthorized dissemination or disclosure of PSI by military personnel is a criminal offense punisha ble under Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The unauthorized dissemination or disclosure of PSI by civilian personnel may subject them to disciplinary action per the DON Civilian Human Resources Manual (DON CHRM). 810. Importance of Safety In formation for Mishap Prevention . The timely sharing of safety information, including PSI to others within the DoD is a critical component of Navy and Marine Corps mishap prevention efforts. Safety information is an invaluable tool to raise awareness and to educate personnel at all levels from senior leaders to junior petty officers and noncommissioned officers about hazards that exist in their operating environment. Armed with this information, risks can be mitigated and mishaps prevented. Safety inform ation is also critical to the development of effective risk controls that help lower the risk of operations and activities across the department. The necessary balance that must be achieved is the widest possible dissemination of safety information, inclu ding PSI, to those who need this information to manage risk while carefully protecting PSI through implementation of proper safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Good judgment is critical in determining effective handling actions and preserving t his delicate balance. 811. Guidelines for the Proper Use, Access, Dissemination, Disclosure and Protection of PSI and Safety Information within the DON . Navy and Marine Corps personnel must abide by the guidelines provided in subparagraphs 811a through 8 11d for the use, access, dissemination, disclosure and protection of PSI and safety information. a. PSI must be used for safety purposes only, specifically, preventing mishaps and reducing injuries, work -related illnesses and property damage resulting fr om mishaps. Access to PSI for OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-7 safety purposes is authorized for the following Navy and Marine Corps military and civilian personnel under any one of the circumstances and restrictions in subparagraphs 811a (1) through 811a (6): (1) Those in positions of leadership when the safety information containing PSI is applicable to their unit's or their unit's subordinate units', operating environment, operations and activities; (2) Those assigned to safety positions when the safety information containing PSI i s applicable to their unit's or their unit's subordinate units', operating environment, operations and activities; (3) Those assigned to positions for which the safety information containing PSI is directly applicable to their work in devising risk cont rols for identified hazards or to correct deficiencies identified in mishap recommendations ( MISREC ) or hazard recommendations (HAZREC ); (4) Those in supervisory positions when the safety information containing PSI is applicable to their subordinates' o perating or work environment, operations or activities; (5) Those assigned to positions for which the safety information containing PSI is directly related to their specific individual operating or working environment, operations or activities and acces s to this information would raise awareness about hazards and risks they may face; or Note: For those listed in subparagraphs 811a(1) through 811a( 5), access is limited to safety information, including PSI, from SIREPs or portions thereof or training materials derived from SIREPs. Access to interviews and statements given under a promise of confidentiality and notes and materials generated by an SIO or SIB during investigations and deliberations apart from the actual SIREP is prohibited. Training mat erials created using safety information, including PSI, must never disclose the identities of personnel involved in the mishap. (6) Those who are responsible for endorsing a SIREP and members of their staff in direct support of reviewing and endorsing a SIREP. Access is limited to the safety information from the investigation that resulted in the SIREP, including PSI and all privileged and non -privileged evidence. b. Personnel entrusted with PSI, must understand the special handling requirements that are required and comply with those requirements as delineated in this manual. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-8 c. Special Handling Requirements. Special handling is required for PSI. The term \"special handling\" means assurance that access to documents containing PSI and training produ cts derived from PSI are protected from unauthorized disclosure. (1) Marking PSI. Special handling includes properly marking PSI. Chapter appendices 8-A and 8-B provide dissemination control marking requirements for unclassified and classified documents and material, respectively, including information in electronic form that contain PSI. Use of these markings is mandatory for all PSI. (2) Electronic transm ission and storage of PSI. Distributing SIREPs and other PSI on local area networks, e -mail or electronic bulletin board systems is authorized, provided access is controlled and authorized by the commander, commanding officer, master (i.e., for military sealift command vessels), officer -in-charge or safety officer. Access to storage systems containing PSI must always be controlled to exclude those who do not have a need -to-know and are not authorized access to PSI. The electronic transmission of PSI must be encrypted and such information must only be transmitted through DoD electronic mail (e -mail) systems. Use of personal, corporate or commercial e -mail systems to send or receive PSI or PII is prohibited. (3) Storage of PSI. PSI stored locally must be protected from unauthorized access by outside entities, contractors and Navy and Marine Corps personnel who do not have a need to know (e.g., they are not directly concerned with safety and mishap prevention). (4) Sharing of PSI. Personnel granted a ccess to safety information containing PSI are authorized to share this information with similarly situated DON personnel that fall within one of the categories listed in subparagraphs 811a(1) through 811a(6) . (e.g., safety officers sharing safety information within the same warfare community or with members of safety committees; deckplate safety managers sharing safety information with supervisors and employees aboard a shipyard). Key factors to keep in mind are that the safety information must be shared for mishap prevention purposes and that special handling is required by all involved personnel to protect the PSI from unauthorized release. (5) Uncontrolled distribution of PSI. Uncontrolled distribution of PSI (e.g., placing PSI in reading ra cks, on general access message boards or on bulletin boards) is prohibited. Route printed SIREPs or other PSI in file folders with proper markings. This helps ensure access is given only to those who need to know the content for safety and mishap prevent ion purposes. Accountability must be maintained throughout the handling process, to include returning the circulated SIREPs or other PSI, to a safety professional for proper filing, disposal or destruction. (6) Distributing SIREPs and other PSI on loca l area networks, e -mail or electronic bulletin board systems is appropriate, provided access is controlled and authorized by the commander, commanding officer, master (i.e., for military sealift command vessels), officer -in- charge or safety officer. See chapter appendices 8-A and 8-B for marking requirements. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-9 Wherever possible, e -mails containing such information must be digitally signed and encrypted for transmission. d. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Flow and Dissemination of Information. Navy and Marine Corps military and civilian personnel who are parties to an NTSB investigation may relay to their respective organizations any information necessary for purposes of mishap prevention or remedial action as soon as the NTSB has made an init ial release of its investigation report. Information concerning the mishap or incident, must not be released to any person who is not a party representative to the investigation (i.e., including non -party representative employees of the party organization ), before initial release of the investigative report by the NTSB, without prior consultation and approval of the NTSB investigator -in-charge per 49 CFR 831 (Investigation Procedures). 812. Sanitizing PSI . Sanitizing safety reports or extracts from safety reports requires completely obscuring the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, deliberative processes resulting from the investigationand s tatements made under a promise of confidentiality. After a safety report has been successfully sanitized, the report that remains is no longer privileged. a. COMNAVSAFECEN is solely authorized within the DON to create sanitized safety reports that are n o longer privileged. b. Some mishaps, because of widespread publicity or unique circumstances, cannot be adequately sanitized. COMNAVSAFECEN is responsible for making this determination. c. Sanitized safety reports are not necessarily releasable to the public since they may still contain personally identifiable information, contractor proprietary information or information protected by the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, Arms Export Control Act or Export Administration Act. d. NAVSAFECEN w ill develop detailed procedures and processes to produce and disseminate sanitized safety information as part of the DON's comprehensive mishap prevention program in strict compliance with the DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011. 813. Requests for Safety Informat ion. a. COMNAVSAFECEN is the DON's sole authorized release authority for safety information, including PSI. COMNAVSAFECEN will only release safety information when warranted and only when sufficient safeguards are in place. Additional guidelines for COMNAVSAFECEN in making a release determination are found in paragraph 816. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-10 b. It is forbidden for anyone with personal knowledge of the contents of a safety investigation or of any other PSI, to release or share this information, except as this manual permits. c. Except for the authorized exchange of safety information stated in paragraph 810, Navy and Marine Corps commands and personnel receiving requests for safety information, including PSI, from persons, commands, activities and other entities both w ithin DON and external to DON must forward those requests to the NAVSAFECEN. Use the amplifying guidance provided in subparagraphs 813c(1) through 813c(4) to forward the request to the appropriate NAVSAFECEN staff member or section.

The USN or USMC unit fulfilling supervisory responsibilities over the non -DoD civilian will ensure strict compliance with the NDA. 817. Release of Historical Safety Information . Safety information, including SIREPs, that concerns mishaps occurring more than 30 years after the date of that mishap, is considered historical safety information. COMNAVSAFECEN is the sole authority within DON authorized to release historical safety information under all of the conditions in subparagraphs 817a through 817c . a. COMNAVSAFECEN must determine the release will have no damaging effect on the national defense or the viability of the military safety privilege; b. The release complies with DoD guidance contained in DoD 5400.11 -R, Department of Defense Privacy Program , 14 May 2007 ; DoD Instruction 5400.11, DoD Priva cy and Civil Liberties Programs, 29 Jan 2019 ; DoD Manual 5400.11, Volume 2, DoD Privacy and Civil Liberties Programs: Breach Preparedness and Response Plan, 6 May21 ; DoD Manual 6025.18 Implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule in DoD Health Care Programs, 13 March 2019 ; DoD Manual 5400.07, DoD FOIA Program, 25 January 2017 ; and c. The release must not include information given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confidentiality and any information derived from that information or direct or indirect references to that information. 818. Additional Guidelines for the Release of Safety Information, Including PSI . This paragraph is applicable only to COMNAVSAFECEN. a. Requests for PSI by Congress . The procedures for the release of PSI to Congress are guided by the 1989 Aspin -Rice Agreement and codified in DoDI 6 055.07 of 6 June 2011. (1) COMNAVSAFECEN is solely responsible within DON for releasing PSI to Congress. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-15 (2) Such release will be in strict compliance with the procedures found in DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011. b. Release of Safety Information to the Naval Inspector General and Inspector General of the Marine Corps . Pursuant to SECNAVINST 5430.7 R upon request of either the Naval Inspector General or Inspector General of the Marine Corps for PSI, NAVSAFECEN must provide an un -redacted copy of the full SIREP and enclosures. Prior to release, the PSI must be clearly labeled and marked \"Privileged Safety Information - Not for further release without the written consent of SECNAV.\" c. Protection of PSI from Use in Cou rt Proceedings. COMNAVSAFECEN must strictly comply with the procedures outlined in DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011, enclosure 5, paragraph 10 concerning protection of PSI when parties to civil litigation or criminal trials attempt to compel its release. d. Sharing PSI with Foreign Military Safety Agencies. (1) COMNAVSAFECEN may share relevant PSI involving similar systems with military safety agencies of allied or partner nations for mishap prevention purposes when all of subparagraphs 818d (1)(a) through 818d (1)(c) apply. (a) A reciprocal international agreement with the Foreign Defense Organization has been concluded per DoDI 5530. 03, International Agreements, 4 December 2019, prior to sharing either PSI or sanitized information; (b) Adequate prot ection of PSI exists and where the recipient agency agrees to provide similar safety information to the DoD ; and (c) There are s igned NDAs approved by COMNAVSAFECEN . (2) Whenever appropriate, COMNAVSAFECEN should share non -privileged safety information such as aggregate data or sanitized reports in lieu of privileged reports. (3) Information (the witness statement) given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confidentiality, any direct references to that information and any inf ormation that could be used to identify the source who provided the information, must not be shared. (4) COMNAVSAFECEN must establish procedures for sharing safety information with foreign military safety agencies that comply with all of the requirement s of DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-16 e. Sharing Privileged Safety Information with Non -DoD U.S. Government agencies. (1) COMNAVSAFECEN may establish reciprocal formal agreements for sharing relevant safety information with other Federal agencies regarding similar airframes or systems for mishap prevention purposes, but only where adequate protection of PSI exists to maintain the safety privilege and where the recipient agency agrees to provide similar safety information to the DON. (2) Whenever appropriate, COMNAVSAFECEN should share non -privileged safety information such as aggregate data or sanitized reports in lieu of privileged reports. (3) Information (the witness statement) given to a safety investigator pursuant to a promise of confide ntiality, any direct references to that information and any information that could be used to identify the source who provided the information, must not be shared. (4) COMNAVSAFECEN must establish procedu res for sharing safety information with non-DoD U.S. Government agencies that comply with all of the requirements of DoDI 6055.07 of 6 June 2011. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-A-1 Appendix 8 -A APPENDIX 8 -A DISSEMINATI ON CONTROL MARKINGS FOR UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND MATERIAL CONTAINING PRIVILEGED SAFE TY INFORMATION 1. Purpose . To provide dissemination control and caveat marking requirements for unclassified documents and material, including information in electronic form, that contain privileged safety information (PSI). 2. General . Privilege and PSI are discussed in chapter 8. The term \"marking\" includes certain concepts of identifying information safeguarding or dissemination controls. Markings must be conspicuous and immediately apparent. DoDI 5200.48 of 6 March 2020 provides guidance for the correct marking of Controlled Unclassified Information ( CUI) that requires the application of access and distribution controls and protective measures. However, the DoDI 5200.48 does not address PSI. The CUI markings \"For Official Use O nly\" and \"FOUO\" are now legacy markings per DoDI 5200.48 of 6 March 2020. It is important to note that legacy FOUO information is not automatically CUI. DoD material bearing legacy markings is not required to be redacted or re - marked while it remains und er DoD control or is accessed online and downloaded for use within the DoD. However, any such document or new document created with information derived from legacy material, must be marked as CUI, if the information qualifies as CUI and the document is being shared outside the DoD. Optionally, when transmitting or transferring legacy information, the marking requirement can be satisfied by using SF 901 CUI Coversheet , as depicted in figure 8-A-1) or transmittal document or an indicator in an e -mail. DoD legacy marked information stored on a DoD access -controlled Web site or database does not need to be remarked as CUI, even if other agencies and contractors are granted access to such Web sites or databases. This chapter appendix provides specific Nav y and Marine Corps guidance for unclassified documents and material containing PSI. Chapter appendix 8-B provides specific Navy and Marine Corps guidance for classified documents and material containing PSI. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-A-2 Appendix 8 -A Figure 8 -A-1. SF 901 CUI Coversheet a. CUI Basic Control Marking s. The CUI basic control marking is applied by the DoD to unclassified information when disclosure to the public of that particular record or portion thereof, would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more of FOIA exemptions (b)(2) through (b)(9). In the case of unclassified PSI, it is protected by courts from public release under executive privilege in the rules of evidence and by FOIA OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 8-A-3 Appendix 8 -A exemption (b)(5) for \"deliberative process pr ivilege.\" However, because access to basic CUI information is much broader than what is needed to protect PSI, specific dissemination controls are needed. These additional dissemination controls are imposed by the DoD through the use of CUI specified category markings . b. CUI Specified Category Markings . The DON uses the CUI specified category marking \"CUI//SP -PSI\" to indicate additional dissemination control of PSI beyond that used for CUI basic information. Chapter 8 provides information on the c oncept of privilege pertaining to event safety information, the authority for the dissemination of event safety information in general and PSI in particular, the procedures for obtaining it and the special handling requirements for such material. 3. Dissemination Control Marking Requirements . a. Markings General . In unclassified documents and material containing PSI, including printed information in electronic form (e.g., naval messages and e -mails) containing PSI, the CUI specified control marking \"CUI//SP -PSI\" must be included as a banner at the top of the outside of the front cover (if there is one), the title page, the first page and the outside of the back cover (if there is one). Each internal page containing PSI information must be marked wi th the banner \" CUI//SP-PSI\" at the top in bold text . It is optional, but a best practice, to include the same exact banner at the bottom. For consistency with classified systems, the document may be marked with the banner \" UNCLASSIFIED//CUI //SP-PSI\" in bold text ; in such case, internal pages must be marked with this banner at both the top and bottom. Figure 7 -7 of SECNAV M - 5216.5 of June 2015 provides an illustration of legacy markings (e.g., \"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" and \"FOUO\") on correspondence. U se \"CUI//SP-PSI\" in place of both legacy markings \"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" and \"FOUO\" as depicted in that illustration ; however, at a minimum, the banner must be marked at the top of each page (i.e., a banner marking at the bottom of each page is optional b ut must be exactly like the top banner marking) . b. Correspondence Serial Numbers . (1) SECNAV M -5216.5 of June 2015, subparagraph 3a(2)(c), specifies use of the legacy marking \"FOUO\" for serializing unclassified correspondence containing CUI. However , per DoDI 5200.48 of 6 March 2020, use of the CUI marking supersedes the use of the FOUO marking in any new documents. Therefore, new, unclassified documents containing CUI that are intended to be serialized (i.e., which is optional), must be serialized per subparagraph 3b(2). (2) A serial number is not required on unclassified correspondence. However, if a serial number is used on unclassified correspondence containing PSI, the serial number must be immediately preceded with the dissemination control phrase \"CUI,\" as depicted in figure 8-A-2. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-A-4 Appendix 8 -A Figure 8-A-2. Sample Use of Dissemination Control Phrase CUI with Correspondence Serial Numbers c. Privileged Safety Warning Statement . All unclassified documents containing PSI must be marked on the first page of multi -page documents with the warning statement shown in figure 8- A-3, until sanitized or redacted. Figure 8-A-3. Privileged Safety Information Warning Statement for Unclassified Documents d. Portion Markings . Subjects and titles, as well as individual sections, parts, paragraphs or similar portions of an unclassified PSI document must be marked to show that portion contains information requiring specific protection. Use of the unclassified marking \"(U)\" as a portion marking for unclassified information within CUI documents or mater ials is not required. Use either the parenthetical notation \"(U//CUI //SP-PSI),\" or \"(CUI//SP -PSI)\" to identify information as unclassified PSI for this purpose. Place this notation immediately before all text in that portion . e. Naval Message and Elect ronic Mail (E -mail) Markings . Unclassified electronically transmitted naval messages and e -mail that contain PSI, must be marked with the specified dissemination control markings as required by this chapter appendix. (1) Naval Messages . (a) Printed Copies . See paragraph 3a of this chapter appendix . (Serial Number) 5102 Ser Code 30/CUI3566 14 Jul 21 PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI): Information in this document mark ed CUI//SP -PSI is specified Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Privacy information may also be present. The information in this document is from a limited use, controlled distribution, safety investigation report and is exempt from mandatory disc losure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5). Dissemination or disclosure of this PSI is controlled by OPNAVINST 5102.1E/MCO 5102.1C. Unauthorized dissemination or disclosure of PSI in this report by military personnel is a criminal offense punishable under Article 9 2, Uniform Code of Military Justice. Unauthorized dissemination or disclosure of PSI in this report by civilian personnel will subject them to disciplinary action under chapter 752 of the Department of the Navy Civilian Human Resources Manual. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-A-5 Appendix 8 -A (b) Portion Markings . Subjects, as well as individual sections, parts, paragraphs or similar portions of a n unclassified naval message containing PSI must be marked to show that portion contains inf ormation requiring specific protection. Use the parenthetical notation \"(U//CUI //SP-PSI)\" to identify information as unclassified PSI for this purpose. Place this notation immediately before all text in that portion . (c) Privileged Safety Information Warning Statement . In addition to the markings specified in paragraphs 3e(1)(a) and (b) of this chapter appendix, unclassified naval messages containing PSI must also include the figure 8-A-4 warning statement in an isolated block immediately following the narrative line (i.e., abbreviated in the naval message as \"NARR\"). This warning statement must remain on any naval message until it is either sanitized or redacted of any PSI. Figure 8-A-4. Privileged Safety Information Warning Statement for Unclassified Naval Messages (2) E-mail. (a) Printed Copies . See paragraph 3a of this chapter appendix . (b) Subject Line Indicator Marking . A subject line indicator marking is optional, but a best practice. If used, place the marking at the end of the subject. An example of a subject line indicator marking is \"[Contains CUI//SP -PSI].\" ************************************************************ PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION ( PSI): INFORMATION THIS DOCUMENT MARKED CUI/ /SP-PSI IS FOR SPECI FIED CONTROLLED UNCLASSIF IED INFORMATION (CUI ).

(d) Portion Markings . Individual sections, parts, paragraphs or similar portions of an e-mail containing unclassified PSI must be marked to show that portion contains information requiring specific protection. Use the parenthetical notation \"(CUI//SP -PSI)\" to identify information as unclassified PSI for this purpose. Place this notation immediately before all text in that portion . f. Attachment Markings . (1) Transmittal Documents . Transmittal documents are documents that have information enclosed with or attached to , them. An example is a letter, memo or staff summary sheet with unclassified enclosures. The transmittal document itself may or may not contain unclassified PSI. (a) Transmittal documents that contain unclassified PSI must be marked per paragraphs 3a through 3d of this chapter appendix and must also include the following message that CUI//SP -PSI is present: \"The attachment contains CUI//SP -PSI.\" (b) Transmittal documents that do not contain unclassified PSI, but have at least one enclosure or attachment containing unclassified PSI and have no classified material enclosures or attachments, must be marked with the following banner: \"When enclosure is removed, thi s document is Uncontrolled Unclassified Information \" or \"When enclosure is removed, this document is CUI// SP-PSI; upon removal, this document does not contain CUI\" in a conspicuous location on the first page of the transmittal document. (2) E-mail. (a) E-mail Bodies. E-mail bodies that do not contain unclassified PSI, but have at least one enclosure or attachment containing unclassified PSI, must be marked with the following statement beginning two spaces below the banner marking : \"When attachment i s removed, this e -mail is Uncontrolled Unclassified Information \" at the top of the first page (i.e., immediately before any e -mail body content is added ).

Purpose . To provide dissemination control and caveat marking requirements for classified documents and material, including information in electronic form that contain either unclassified privileged safety information (PSI) classified PSI or both. 2. General . Privilege and PSI are discussed in chapter 8. The term \"marking\" includes certain concepts of identifying the classification of the information and identifying any information safeguarding or dissemination controls. Markings must be conspicuous and immediately apparent. DoDM 5200.01 Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 ( Department of Defense ( DoD ) Information Security Program - Marking of Classified Information )) provides guidance for the correct mar king of classified information. However, the DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 does not address PSI. This chapter appendix provides specific Navy and Marine Corps guidance for classified information that also contains PSI. a. \"CUI\" Basic Contr ol Markings . The Department of the Navy ( DON ) deems unclassified PSI to be in a Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) specified category that requires the application of specific access and distribution controls and protective measures per DoDI 5200.4 8 of 6 March 2020 (CUI). Unclassified documents and materials containing PSI must use chapter appendix 8-A for dissemination control markings. The CUI basic control marking is applied by the DoD to unclassified information when disclosure to the public o f that particular record or portion thereof, would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions (b)(2) through (b)(9). In the case of unclassified PSI, it is pro tected by courts from public release under executive privilege in the rules of evidence and by FOIA exemption (b)(5) for \"deliberative process privilege.\" However, because access to basic CUI information is much broader than what is needed to protect PSI, specific dissemination controls are needed. These additional dissemination controls are imposed by the DoD through the use of CUI specified category markings. b. Classified Information Dissemination Control . Classified information requires the application of access and distribution controls and protective measures per DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 . Giving a classification to PSI should be discouraged by originators to the greatest extent possi ble because of the increased handling burdens it places on the safety community in disseminating that information efficiently and in a timely fashion to prevent mishap or near miss re occurrences. Not every person in every potential community of interest w ill have access to classified information. However, should the originator require that the PSI be classified, the classified PSI should be marked per the requirements in this chapter appendix. Marking classified PSI per this chapter appendix will ensure that any eventual OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-B-2 Appendix 8 -B declassification of that PSI could change it to being CUI with a specified category of PSI (CUI//SP -PSI). Declassification requirements are discussed in paragraph 4 of this chapter appendix. Classified documents and materials containing either unclassified PSI, classified PSI or both, must use this chapter appendix for any dissemination control markings. c. Controlled Unclassified Information Specified Category Markings . The DON uses the CUI specified category marking \"CUI//SP -PSI\" to indicate additional dissemination control of PSI beyond that used for CUI basic information. Chapter 8 provides information on the concept of privilege pertaining to mishap and near miss safety information, the authority for the dissemination of mishap a nd near miss safety information in general and PSI in particular, the procedures for obtaining it and the special handling requirements for such material. 3. Dissemination Control Marking Requirements . a. Markings General . Pages of classified documents and material that do not contain any PSI, but do contain classified information, are marked as usual per DoDM 5200.01 Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 . Figures 7 -5 and 7 -6 of SECNAV M -5216.5 of June 2015 ( DON Correspondence Manual) provide illustrations of c lassification markings on classified correspondence. b. Correspondence Serial Numbers . A serial number is required on all classified correspondence. SECNAV M -5216.5 of June 2015, sub paragraph 7 -2.3a(2)(c), provides format guidance on the use of classification letters (e.g., C, S or TS) with correspondence serial numbers. Note: Other than for unclassified correspondence containing PSI, which only uses a CUI dissemination control marking for correspondence serial numbers, there is no special mar king of serial numbers for classified correspondence to indicate the presence of PSI. c. Privileged Safety Warning Statement . All classified documents containing PSI must be marked on the first page of multi -page documents with the warning statement sho wn in figure 8 - B-1, until sanitized or redacted. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 8-B-3 Appendix 8 -B Figure 8-B-1. Privileged Safety Information Warning Statement for Classified Documents d. Pages Containing PSI and Classified Information . Classified documents and material containing PSI must be marked per DoDM 5200.01 Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 and DoDI 5200.48 o f 6 March 2020, except that pages containing both PSI and classified information, must be marked with the classification and caveat banner \"[CLASSIFICATION]// PSI\" on the top and bottom. Note: Brackets are not to be used in the actual document or materia l banner. They are used here before and after the classification only to indicate the relative placement location of a classification marking. e. Pages Containing PSI, but No Classified Information . Classified documents and material containing PSI must be marked per DoDM 5200.01 Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 and DoDI 5200.48 of 6 March 2020, except that pages containing PSI, but no classified information , must be marked with the CUI specified control banner \" CUI//SP -PSI\" on the top and bottom. f. Portion Markings . Subjects, titles and each section, part, paragraph or similar portion of a classified document containing PSI must be marked to show that portion contains information requiring specific protection. Do not commingle CUI specified categor y PSI, classified PSI or non-PSI containing classified information within the same portion.

Classified e -mail bodies that contain PSI must be marked with the following banner or a similar one: \"[CLASSIFICATION]// PSI\" at the top of the first page of the body , immediately before any e -mail body content is added. The classification level in the banner marking reflects the overall classification of the e -mail (i.e., includes the subject line, text of the e -mail, any classified signature block, attachments, included messages and any other information conveyed in the body of the e -mail), not just the classification of the PSI. A similar banner marking must be at the end of the e -mail body, after the signature block. Note: Brackets are not to be used in t he actual e -mail banner. They are used here before and after the classification only to indicate the relative placement location of a classification marking. 1. This banner marking may be either left justified or centered and must have a single line space immediately following it. 2. This banner marking must be repeated at the top of every forwarded or reply e-mail to ensure the marking remains conspicuous to e -mail recipients upon opening of the e - mail. (c) Automated Marking Tools . Some org anizations use automated tools to mark electronic messages (e.g. organizational messages, e -mails and text or instant messages). It remains the individual's responsibility to properly mark classified messages, including banner marking, portion markings and classification authority block when an automated tool is used. (d) Portion Markings . Subjects, as well as individual sections, parts, paragraphs or similar portions of a classified e -mail containing PSI must be marked to show that portion contains information requiring specified protection. Do not commingle CUI specified category PSI, classified PSI or non-PSI containing classified information within the same portion. If the author wants to annotate the classification of a reference or attachment that has an unclassified title, a parenthetical note may be included after that title (e.g., \"(Document is classified Secret)\"). Use table 8-B-1 to identify notations for portions of classified e -mails that contain PSI. Place these notations immediately before all text in that portion . h. Attachment Markings . (1) Transmittal Documents . Transmittal documents are documents that have information enclosed with or attached to them. An example is a letter, memo or staff summary sheet with classified or PSI-containing enclosures. The transmittal document itself may or may not contain CUI//SP-PSI, non -PSI containing classified information or classified PSI. Paragraphs 3b, 3c and 3f of this chapter appendix provide requirements for correspondence serial n umbers, a PSI warning statement and portion marking for the transmittal document itself. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 Sep 2021 8-B-8 Appendix 8 -B (a) Unclassified Transmittal Document Banner Lines . 1. Unclassified Transmittal Document Contains PSI, Transmitted Information is Classified . Unclassified tr ansmittal documents that contain PSI and transmits classified PSI or non-PSI containing classified information, must be marked with a banner line that has the highest classification level (and the PSI control marking , if applicable) of any information in t he transmittal document or transmitted by it. Mark the transmittal document with an appropriate instruction, beneath the lower classification banner, indicating that it is CUI //SP-PSI when separated from the classified enclosures (e.g., \"CUI //SP-PSI when separated from classified enclosures\" or \"CUI //SP-PSI when Attachment 2 is removed\"). 2. Unclassified Transmittal Document Does Not Contain PSI, Transmitted Information is Classified . Unclassified transmittal documents that do not contain PSI, but transmit classified PSI or non -PSI containing classified information, must be marked with a banner line that has the highest classification level (and the PSI control marking , if applicable) of any information transmitted by it. Mark the transmittal d ocument with an appropriate instruction, beneath the lower classification banner, indicating that it is unclassified when separated from the classified enclosures (e.g., \"UNCLASSIFIED when separated from classified enclosures\" or \"UNCLASSIFIED when Attachm ent 2 is removed\"). (b) Classified Transmittal Document Banner Lines . 1. Classified Transmittal Document Contains PSI, Transmitted Information is Classified . Classified transmittal documents that contain PSI and transmit classified PSI or non - PSI containing classified information, must be marked with a banner line that has the highest classification level (and the PSI control marking , if applicable) of any information in the transmittal document or transmitted by it. Mark the transmittal document in the same manner as any other classified document containing PSI, to include banner, portion markings, classification authority block and any required warning or special notices. 2. Classified Transmittal Document Does Not Contain PSI, Transmitted Information is PSI . Classified transmittal documents that do not contain PSI, but do transmit classified or unclassified PSI, must be marked with a banner line that has the highest classification level (and the PSI control marking , if applicable) of any i nformation in the transmittal document or transmitted by it. Mark the transmittal document with an appropriate instruction, beneath the lower classification banner, indicating that it remains classified when separated from the PSI -containing enclosures (e.g., \"[CLASSIFICATION] when separated from PSI enclosures\" or \"[CLASSIFICATION] when Attachment 2 is removed\"). 3. Classified Transmittal Document Does Not Contain PSI, Transmitted Information is Not PSI . Classified transmittal documents that do not contain PSI or transmit PSI, will be marked in the same manner as any other non -PSI containing classified document, to OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 8-B-9 Appendix 8 -B include banner, portion markings, classification authority block and any required warning or special notices. i. Specified Control Markings for Privileged Safety Information Contained in Media or Material (Including Hardware and Equipment) . Examples of this media or material are computer files and other electronic media, audiovisual media, chart, maps, films, sound recordings, microfilm, microfiche, etc. See DoDM 5200.01 Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 , enclosure (3) and The Navy and Marine Corps Safety Investigations and Reporting Guide , for guidance on how to mark this media or material. However, continue to use the specified control markings in a manner similar to that specified in this chapter appendix, as applicable. 4. Declassification . DoDM 5200.01 Volume 2 of 24 February 2012 , enclosure (3), provides guidance on declassification markings for classified information. However, when a classified document or material that contains PSI will be declassified, the holder must, prior to declassification or removal of any classification m arkings, consult with the Staff Attorney at the NAVSAFECEN . The Staff Attorney at the NAVSAFECEN may direct the holder to change either some or all of the classified PSI markings to those markings specified in chapter appendix 8-A for controlled unclassif ied information (i.e., CUI //SP-PSI). OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 9-1 CHAPTER 9 RMI ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT 901. Purpose . To explain the roles, permissions and terminology for Risk Management Information ( RMI ) account management. 902. Background . RMI roles, permissions and terminology are significantly different from that used for the legacy Web-enabled safety system (WESS) and apply to users irrespective of functional community. WESS used centralized account management; the RMI does not. WESS account roles and permissions are no longer applicable in the RMI. 903. Policy . a. All Department of the Navy ( DON ) RMI users must have a U. S. Navy ( USN ) or U. S. Marine Corps ( USMC ) workplace assigned to use the RMI. b. Only the RMI account roles applicable to Navy and Marine Corps RMI users can be assigned. See subparagraph 905.c for additional details. c. Commands must have a User Administrator assigned or coordinate with higher headquarters to fulfill UA responsibilities on behalf of the command . See paragraph 906 for details. 904. Assignment of RMI Permissions . The RMI account type, categ ory, module access and job functions are identified during the RMI account creation process and elevated and approved by User Administrators (UA) at or above the unit level. 905. User Account Types and Categories . There are two account types in the RMI, basic and elevated and two account categories, primary and secondary. a. Account Types . (1) Basic Account. A basic account permits access to common, open areas of the RMI, such as publications and references and file sharing. This type of account will have the basic account role and a workspace. (2) Elevated Account. Elevated accounts have access to unprotected information and one or more types of protected information. Information may be protected by safety privilege, Privacy Act, Health Insu rance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or another formal mechanism . Security roles are used to provide and control appropriate access. This account will have additional roles than those found in a basic account. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 9-2 b. Account Categories . (1) Primary Category. By default, every RMI user has a primary account. This account contains their demographic information (e.g., employment status, grade, name, assigned organization, assigned office symbol, email, etc.) and assigned RMI roles (permissions ). (2) Secondary Category. A secondary account is required when a user needs an account listing an organization different from the one on their primary account. Examples of when a secondary account is necessary include: (a) An RMI user is assigned to two or more organizations with separate reporting hierarchies. For example, a user may work Monday through Friday as a civilian in a DON safety office and periodically works as a military member in a reserve organization's safety office. (b) An RM I user is assigned to one organization and because of geographic proximity, is assigned to manage users at a geographically nearby organization with a separate reporting hierarchy. c. RMI Account Roles . There are two broad kinds of RMI account roles, those roles that are applicable to Navy and Marine Corps RMI users and those that are listed in the RMI, but never assigned to Navy and Marine Corps users. (1) Chapter appendix 9-A provides the list of RMI account roles that are applicable to Navy and Marine Corps RMI users and their definitions. (2) Chapter appendix 9-B provides the list or RMI account roles that can be seen when using the RMI, but are never assigned to Navy and Marine Corps RMI user s. Notes: RMI was developed from and is closely associated with the U.S. Air Force's Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Some account roles that are visible in the RMI are never assigned to Navy and Marine Corps users. These roles are applicab le to AFSAS users from other Services and defense activities. Some RMI account roles that are applicable to Navy and Marine Corps users may not yet be available until full RMI implementation is achieved. Until then, specific availability of account roles for Navy and Marine Corps users will be disseminated by Comman der, Naval Safety Center ( COM NAVSAFECEN ) via All Safety messages. 906. (UA) . UAs perform an important role in RMI account management. Specific policies, requirements and responsibilities assigned to UAs are delineated in this paragraph. a. UA Policie s and Requirements . OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 9-3 (1) UAs fulfill an inherently governmental role, therefore, the UA role must only be assigned to DON uniformed Service members or U.S. Government civilians. (2) Only two UAs are authorized per unit (e.g., Unit Identification Code ) unless a waiver is granted . Note: Units requesting more than two UAs, must submit a waiver request in writing to COMNAVSAFECEN (Attn: Executive Director) with sufficient justification. (3) UAs must be designated in writing by the command or activit y commander or commanding officer. A template for the designation letter is available in chapter appendix 9-D. (4) UAs must sign an RMI User Agreement acknowledging their responsibilities and the limitations of their authority. A template for the user agreement is available in chapter appendix 9-E. Note: Both the designation letter and the RMI User Agreement must be uploaded to the UA's profile in the RMI. (5) COMNAVSAFECEN assigns the UA role to Navy echelon 2 and Marine Corps major command UAs. Navy echelon 2 UAs and Marine Corps major command UAs then assign the UA role to those in subordinate commands. In all cases, the UA designation letter and RMI User Agreement must have been uploaded to the UA's profile in the RMI, before the UA assignment can be made. (6) UAs must be completely familiar with the special handling requirements of PSI per chapter 8 of this manual. (7) UAs must administer the guidelines for special handling of PSI per chapter 8 of this manual within their unit. Note: UAs who fail to protect PSI will have their UA and RMI account roles suspended or revoked. (8) UAs are responsible for ensuring that roles are properly assigned and only given to those with a legitimate need. UAs are permitted to assign RMI roles per the guidelines in this chapter applying the specific restrictions explained in subparagraphs 906a(8 )(a) through 906a(8)(c) : (a) RMI roles must only be assigned to DON uniformed and Government civilian personnel within their unit or subordinate units. For all other categories of personnel, UAs must forward RMI access requests to COMNAVSAFECEN for co nsideration. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 9-4 (b) RMI roles must not be assigned to other personnel including those from other DON organizations, other Military Services, non -Department of Defense ( DoD ) U.S. Government agencies, contractors, foreign exchange personnel, liaison personne l or any other non-DON personnel unless a Non-Disclosure Agreement ( NDA ) has been approved by COMNAVSAFECEN. If COMNAVSAFECEN has approved an NDA, UAs are permitted to assign RMI roles in strict compliance with the NDA, but only for personnel from the abo ve categories who are assigned within their unit or subordinate units. See paragraphs 815 and 816 for additional details and the criteria used by COMNAVSAFECEN for determining approval of NDAs. (c) RMI roles must not be assigned to contractors, foreig n exchange or liaison personnel or any non -DON civilians , unless an NDA has been approved by COMNAVSAFECEN. If an NDA has been approved, UAs are permitted to assign RMI roles in strict compliance with the NDA, but only for contractors, foreign exchange or liaison personnel or non -DON civilians within their unit or subordinate units . b. UA Responsibilities . (1) UAs assign RMI account roles for personnel in their organization and those personnel below their command or activity in the organizational hier archy, including subordinate command UAs. Chapter appendix 9-C provides important information for making RMI account role determinations based on functional roles and billet types. Note: In some cases, personnel will be assigned multiple RMI account r oles simultaneously, while in other cases, a single RMI account role is all that is required. (2) UAs must validate requester need before assigning RMI roles to personnel. RMI roles must only be assigned to personnel with a legitimate need. Additional ly, only the account roles necessary to complete assigned tasks will be assigned to personnel. (3) UAs manage RMI account roles for personnel in their organization and those personnel below their command or activity in the organizational hierarchy, incl uding subordinate command UAs. This includes making RMI account changes and addressing issues with the RMI accounts they administer. (4) UAs must ensure those assigned access to PSI, have read chapter 8 of this manual and understand all special handlin g requirements before RMI account roles are assigned.

Accounting Organization . The reporting custodian that experienced the loss of or damage to , an owned asset ; or the fatality, injury or work -related illness of an assigned person or persons in a mishap ; and is responsible for or is assigned responsibility for, safety reporting, regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the even t's occurrence. There is one accounting organization for each mishap. Note: See chapter 4, subparagraph 403a for the policy to determine the accounting organization when multiple commands are involved in a mishap. The accounting organization assignment is not affected when a convening authority appoints an SIB to investigate the mishap or the accounting organization relies on its higher headquarters to submit a SIREP into the RMI on the command's behalf. 2. Act of God. An event that directly and exclusively results from the occurrence of natural causes or phenomena that could not have been prevented by the exercise of foresight or caution; an inevitable accident. 3. Action Agency . A command or activity that has an office of primary responsibilit y (OPR) or office of collateral responsibility (OCR) assigned responsibility for the completion of a mishap recommendation (MISREC) or hazard recommendation (HAZREC). See also \"Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)\" and \"Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR ).\" 4. Active Status . (Afloat only). Ships which are currently assigned for duty in the active fleet are in an active status. 5. Aerial Delivery Incident . Any actio n or event preventing an airdrop item from functioning as it was intended or designed.

Aerial Delivery Malfunction . The failure of an airdrop item to function as it was intended or designed. Note: Some examples of mal functions include, but are not limited to: Failure of a main canopy to properly deploy, static line breaking, parachute panel or gore blowout, cargo parachute release failure and a JPADS that lands off the drop zone (DZ) for reasons other than improperly loaded data. 7. Aerial Delivery Malfunction Phase Categories . Airdrop load malfunctions categorized by the phase in which they occur: a. Extraction Phase. The period of time that begins with the activation of the aerial delivery system and continues until the extraction force transfers to recovery parachute deployment. b. Deployment Phase. The period of time that begins with the transfer of force from extraction to recovery parachute deployment and continues until load impact. c. Release Phase. The period of time after load impact when the parachute release should occur. Note: Investigations are restricted to factors that could have caused or contributed to a malfuncti on or incident to conserve time and effort. Observing the malfunction or incident can normally determine the phase of the occurrence. 8. Afloat Mishap . A mishap occurring aboard or resulting from or during the operation of a DoD or U.S. Coast Guard vess el, including mishaps during Navy or Marine Corps diving or swimmer operations; mishaps occurring while loading, off -loading or receiving services at dockside; and mishaps occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare training op erations.

Examples of stationary objects: Vessel made fast to a pier, vessel at anchor (i.e., not dragging anchor), moored buoy (i.e., not dragging anchor), bridge, dock, pier, wharf, jetty, quay, etc. A vessel or buoy dragging anchor is a moving vessel or buoy, respectively. An OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 A-3 Appendix A exception, is a case when two anchored vessels strike each other and neither of them are dragging anchor nor have veered nor surged additional rode. This case would be a collision because the last vessel to anchor could h ave chosen a different location to anchor or used a different length of rode . The important distinction is that a moving vessel can play an active role in avoiding collision; whereas, a stationary object cannot. See also \"Collision, Vessel.\" 10. Ammunition .

The passage of direct or alternating electrical current through the body or a body part. 66. Electronic Cigarette . A battery -operated device that is typically designed to resemble a traditional cigarette and is used to inhale a usually nicotine -containing vapor. Also, referred to as an e-cigarette, personal vaporizer or electronic nicotine delivery system. Note: Electronic cigarettes contain a liquid solution typically consisting of nicotine, various chemical substances (such as propylene glycol or glycerol) and often flavoring. The solution is heated by the battery producing the aerosol or vapor inhaled by the user . 67. Event . A broad term used to describe an occurrence or series of occurrences. For DON safety reporting purposes, an event can be a mishap, hazard (including near miss ) or an incident. 68. Exigent Circumstances . Specific event where it is clearly evident that rapid intervention to prevent the immediate loss of life or property is required. 69. Explosion . A violent chemical reaction within a chemical compound or mixture or mechanical mixture evolving heat and pressure. An explosion is a reaction that proceeds through OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 A-11 Appendix A the reacted material toward the unreacted material at sonic velocity (by a shock wave process). The result of the chemical reaction is exertion of high pressure on the surrounding medium, forming a propagating shock wave. Ignition a nd rapid reaction of the confined energetic material builds up high local pressures leading to violent pressure rupturing of the confining structure. Metal cases are fragmented (brittle fracture) into large pieces that are often thrown long distances. Un reacted or burning energetic material is also thrown about. Fire and smoke hazards will exist. Air shocks are produced that can cause damage to nearby structures. The blast and high velocity fragments can cause minor ground craters and damage (e.g., brea kup, tearing, gouging) to adjacent metal plates. Blast pressures are lower than for a detonation. 70. Explosive Event . Any event involving conventional ordnance, ammunition, explosives, explosive systems and devices resulting in an unintentional detonation, firing, deflagration, burning, launching of ordnance material (including all ordnance impacting off -range), leaking or spilled propellant fuels and oxidizers (less Otto fuel II).

Any deviation, out -of-the-ordinary or deficient action or condition discovered in the course of a safety investigation, which in the opinion of the SIB or SIO, contributed to the eventual outcome. Determining mishap factors (and eliminating non -factors) enables safety investigators to focus the investigation to those specific areas that are significant in the mishap. Note: RMI has three options in the drop down menus: factors,\" \"factors (non -causal but contributing)\" and \"non -factors worthy of discussion. There is a fourth type of factor, the \"non -factor,\" but the non -factor is not available in the drop down and, instead would be listed in the narrative. 75. Factors (Non -Causal But Contributing) . Factors which were present but not necessarily causal. 76. Fatality . A death resulting from a mishap or work -related injury or illness. Note: A fatality includes a mishap or complications of a mishap that resulted in a death. 77. Findings . The conclusions of the safety investigator.

Any unintentional fire occurring on any naval installation (i.e., includes shipyards and industrial operations) , ship, submarine or aircraft (to include a small fire in which no personnel were injured and the material property damage was limited to the originally ignited materi el and not propagated to other materials). Fire is an unintended state, process or instance of combustion in which fuel or other material is ignited and combined with oxygen, giving off smoke, sparks or flame. Smoke or sparks may or may not be present. However, if unexpected smoke or sparks exist, a fire should be assumed to exist (this i s especially relevant to Class \"C\" fires when the smoke or sparks cease after power is secured). Evidence of previously unreported combustion or explosion must also be reported upon discovery. Reports solely based on acrid odor (no evidence of combustion upon inspection) are not required. b. Materiel damage of mechanical and structural systems that meet mishap dollar cost thresholds. Dollar cost thresholds for report ing based on replacement or repair costs that are caused solely by an overheat condition (e.g., materiel warping, discoloration, etc.) must be reported as a mishap due to materiel failure. Overheat conditions are where materiel destruction is solely due t o high temperature and there is no evidence of self -sustained combustion. Electrical or electronic overheat conditions where there is evidence of combustion must be reported as a fire. 79. First Aid . First aid, for purposes of this instruction and 29 CF R Part 1904, are not required to be recorded or reported, using the following definition of first aid: a. Using a non -prescription medication at nonprescription strength (for medications available in both prescription and non -prescription form, a recomme ndation by a physician or other licensed health care professional to use a non -prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical treatment for record keeping purposes); b. Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, suc h as hepatitis B vaccine or rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment); c. Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin; d. Using wound coverings , such as bandages, Band -Aids, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly bandages or Steri -Strips (other wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, etc., are considered medical treatment); e.

Any real or potential condition that can cause inj ury, illness or death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property or mission degradation. Hazards are divided into two categories: a. An act or event (i.e., near miss) that may have resulted in a mishap where the fatality, injury, illness , property damage or loss of an asset was avoided merely by chance, the actions of an individual or individuals, a small measure of distance or a few moments in time. b. A workplace conditio n that might result in injury, health impairment, illness, disease or fatality to any person who is exposed to the condition or which might result in damage to or loss of property or equipment. Note: Safety investigators use the term to explain causes of mishaps. Hazards are detected through safety investigati ons, inspections, industrial hygiene surveys, observations, safety program evaluations or from other activity reports. 91. Hazard Report (HAZREP) . A report of a hazardous condition or near -miss that occurred. 92. Hazard Reporting . The process of report ing a real or potentially hazardous event (i.e., near miss) or workplace condition that could cause injury, illness or death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property or mission degradation to the Naval Enterprise. Hazard reporting is a subset of safety reporting. See paragraph 417 for more detailed information on hazard reporting. 93. Hazard Review Board (HRB) . An entity established to evaluate hazards that exist w ithin the operating environment of a command and its subordinate commands, to better understand the risks associated with those hazards, determine whether stronger risk controls are needed and keep the commander informed of those risks. HRBs are required at the controlling command level and are encouraged at lower levels of command. See chapter 7 for details. 94. Hazard Severity . An assessment of the worst potential consequence is likely to occur as a result of deficiencies. Hazard severity categories are: a. Category I - Catastrophic: the hazard may cause a fatality or loss of a facility. b. Category II - Critical: may cause severe injury, severe occupational (i.e., work -related) illness or major materiel or property damage. c. Category III - Marginal: may cause minor injury, minor occupational (i.e., work -related) illness or minor materiel or property damage. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 A-17 Appendix A d. Category IV - Negligible: probably would not affect personnel safety or health, but is nevertheless in violation o f specific criteria. 95. Health Care Provider . A physician, family nurse practitioner, pharmacist, physician assistant, nurse, independent duty corpsman or other licensed or non -licensed health care professional. 96. Heat Strain . The body's physiological response to heat stress (e.g., sweating). Note: The body's natural way to keep the core body temperature from rising to unhealthy levels is through an increase in heart rate and sweating. When these are not enough to keep the co re body temperature from rising, the result is heat -related illness or death. Elevated core body temperatures may cause the following illnesses (listed from most severe to least severe): Heat stroke , heat exhaustion (i.e., includes both salt-depletion and water -deficient heat exhaustion) , heat cramps , heat syncope (i.e., fainting), heat rash (i.e., miliaria heat stress as a h eat-related illness; whereas, the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center classifies it as an injury. For safety reporting purposes, it is an illness. See NMCPHC TM-6260.6A (June 2007), \"Prevention and Treatment of Heat and Cold Stress Injuries\" for m ore information. Availability of this document is provided in the Safety Reporting Resources section. 97. Heat Stress . The net heat load to which a worker is exposed . Note: Physical exertion, environmental factors and clothing worn all contribute to heat stress. The OSHA classifies heat stress as a heat -related illness; whereas, the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center classifies it as an injury. For safety reporting purposes, it is an illness. See NMCPHC TM-6260.6A (June 2007), \"Prevention and Treatment of Heat and Cold Stress Injuries\" for more information. Availability of this document is provided in the Safety Reporting Resources section. 98. High -Risk Training . a. Marine Corps. Is in the formal sc hool setting as: Basic or advanced individual or collective training, essential for preparing Marines and units for combat, that exposes students and instructors to the risk of death or permanent disability despite the presence of and adherence to proper safety controls. A list of courses considered high -risk training is provided in MCO 1553.2 D. b. Navy. Basic or advanced individual or collective training, that exposes students and instructors to the risk of death or permanent disability if safety prec autions are not instituted and adhered to during execution. Formal traditional and non -traditional and unit level training will OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 A-18 Appendix A be considered high risk when a deliberate or in-depth initial risk assessment has identified evolutions that have the potential to expose instructors or students to moderate risk assessment code 3 (RAC 3), serious (RAC 2) or critical (RAC 1) risks as defined in OPNAVINST 1500.75D or as designated by higher authority. Some examples of high -risk training are aviation, parachute, water survival, self -contained underwater breathing apparatus (\"SCUBA,\" for USMC \"scuba\"), underwater breathing device (UBD), rescue swimmer, blaster, diver, EOD, live combat arms, firefighting, mountaineering, helicopter rope suspension, confidence and Tarzan courses and sea -air-land training. 99.

Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) . See \" DoD HFACS.\" 103. Illness or Disease . A non -traumatic physiological harm or loss of capacity produced by systemic; continued or rep eated stress or strain; exposure to hazardous noise, toxins, poisons, fumes, etc. or other continued and repeated exposures to conditions of the environment over a long period of time. For practical purposes, an occupational (i.e., work -related) illness or disease are any reported condition that does not meet the definition of injury. Illness includes both acute (i.e., extremely severe, short -term and dangerous) and chronic illnesses (i.e., present over a long period of time, recurring, cumulative effect s or habitual), such as, but not limited to, noise - induced hearing loss, a skin disease or disorder, respiratory conditions or poisoning.

Noise -Induced Hearing Loss. A change in hearing threshold relative to the baseline audiogram of an average of 10 decibels (dB) or more in either ear at 2000, 3000 and 4000 hertz (Hz) and the employee's tot al hearing level is 25 dB or more above audiometric zero (also averaged at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz) in the same ear(s). Note: Hearing losses from either a punctured eardrum or an acoustic trauma from a one - time blast or over -pressure are injuries, not il lnesses. e. All Other Occupational Illnesses. All other occupational (i.e., work -related) illnesses. Examples: Heatstroke, sunstroke, heat exhaustion, heat stress and other effects of environmental heat; freezing, frostbite and other effects of exposu re to low temperatures; decompression sickness; effects of (e.g., isotopes, x -rays, radium); effects of nonionizing radiation (e.g., welding flash, ultraviolet rays, lasers); anthrax; bloodborne pathogenic diseases, such as acquired immu ne deficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C; brucellosis; malignant or benign tumors; histoplasmosis; and coccidioidomycosis. 104.

Laser Surface Danger Zone (LSDZ) . The target area in addition to horizontal and vertical buffer zones. It reflects the minimum land and air requirement, to include terrain mitigation, needed to safely employ a given laser. The LSDZ accounts for direct hazards (i.e., main beam) and indirect hazards (i.e., reflections). The boundaries of the LSDZ depend on which of the two overlapping zones, direct or indirect, are larger. If there are no specular reflectors on the range and the laser does not present a diffuse reflection hazard, there will not be an indirect hazard zone. LSDZs must accommodate stationary firing points (i.e., fixed positions) as well as mobile firing positions, in addition to fixed and moving t argets. See also \"Surface Danger Zone\" for ground -to-ground employment of ground weapons firing or demolition. 114. Life Sciences Material .

Light Duty . A duty status recomme nded after treatment of an injury that stipulates exactly the limitations on a military member during the recommended period, equivalent to placing a civilian in a restricted work status. When an injury or work -related illness results in light -duty days, assigned light duty days are not counted as lost workdays. On light duty, the military member normally remains at their original duty station but is gainfully employed even though OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 A-21 Appendix A not performing their normal duties. Applicable only to military personnel. The civilian equivalent of light duty is restricted work activity or job transfer. 116. Limited Duty . A military duty status formally assigned as a result of a medical board. Time spent on limited duty is not chargeable as lost time regardless of the cause for assignment to limited duty. Under limited duty, the military member may be reassigned from their permanent duty station to a temporary duty station until the medical issue is resolved. Applicable only to military personnel. The civilian equiva lent of limited duty is restricted work activity or job transfer. 117. Lost-Time Case . A non -fatal traumatic injury that causes any loss of time from work after the day or shift on which it occurred; or non -fatal non -traumatic illness or disease that causes any loss of time from work. Note: When determining if a mishap is a Lost -Time Case, you must count the number of calendar days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether the person was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days or other days off are included in the total number of calendar days, if the employee would not have been able to work on those days. If the employee is out for an extended period of time, use an e stimate of the days that the employee will be away and update the day count when the actual number of days is known. You may \"cap\" the total days away at 180 calendar days. Also, include the number of calendar days away recommended by a physician or othe r licensed health care professional. However, the days away must be recorded whether the injured or ill employee follows a physician or licensed health care professional's recommendation or not. End the count of days away from work on the date the physic ian or other licensed health care professional recommends that the employee return to work. 118. Lost Time Case Rate (LTCR) . The number of Lost Time Cases multiplied by 100, then divided by the number of employees. See also \"Total Case Rate (TCR).\" 119. Lost Workdays or Days Away from Work . The total number of full calendar days, weekends included, that a person was unable to work as a result of a reportable injury or illness as recommended by a physician or licensed health care professional , excluding the day of the mishap and the day returned to duty or work. a. For Navy and Marine Corps military personnel, these include days of sick in quarters, inpatient hospitalization, convalescent leave and command -directed removal from duties as a result of a reportable injury or illness. b. Navy and Marine Corps reserve personnel, in a not physically qualified (NPQ) status sustained as a result of a reportable injury at any time en route to, during or returning from drill or during annual training, is consid ered lost time. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 A-22 Appendix A c. For Navy and Marine Corps civilian personnel, this includes continuation of pay (COP) leave, annual leave, sick leave, days hospitalized and leave without pay granted or a full work shift missed because of a work -related illness or inju ry. Note: When determining lost workdays or days away from work, you must count the number of calendar days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether the person was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days or other days off are included in the total number of calendar days, if the employee would not have been able to work on those days. If the employee is out for an extended period of time, use an estimate of the days t hat the employee will be away and update the day count when the actual number of days is known. You may \"cap\" the total days away at 180 calendar days. Also, include the number of calendar days away recommended by a physician or other licensed health car e professional. However, the days away must be recorded whether the injured or ill employee follows a physician or licensed health care professional's recommendation or not. End the count of days away from work on the date the physician or other licensed health care professional recommends that the employee return to work. 120. Marine Corps and Navy Combat Craft .

Situation . This memorandum of understanding (MOU), establishes the working relationship, responsibilit ies and understanding among U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard (hereafter known as the \"[S]ervices\") relative to a multiple component safety investigation and reporting of mishaps and incidents involving personnel, equipment and facilities. For the purposes of this MOU, the term \"safety entities\" includes the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center, Air Force and Naval Safety Centers, Commandant of the Marine Corps (Safety Division) and the U.S. Coast Guard Health, Safet y and Work -Life Directorate. This MOU replaces the MOU titled, Memorandum of Understanding Among The U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center, Air Force and Naval Safety Centers, Commandant of the Marine Corps (Safety Division) and The U.S. Coast Guard Health an d Safety Directorate for Safety Investigation and Reporting of Multiple Component Mishaps, dated 10 April 2006. 2. Purpose . DoD Instruction 6055.07 [of 6 June 2011] directs the DoD Components to determine a lead DoD Component to investigate and report ea ch multiple component mishap. The purpose of this document is to clarify responsibility for leading the safety investigation of a mishap when more than one [S]ervice's assets are involved and to provide guidance for the establishment of a single multiple -component investigative board and the selection of investigators from multiple agencies. Additionally, guidance is provided regarding preservation of physical evidence at a mishap site, statistically capturing losses, dissemination of reports, responsibil ity for recommendations, and the spirit of cooperation and professionalism expected. 3. Scope . This MOU serves to establish agreements, responsibilities, procedures, and funding requirements for multiple component safety investigations involving the [S]ervices. Authority for investigation of military mishaps is contained in DoD Instruction 6055.07 [of 6 June 2011] , DoD [S]ervice directives and Coast Guard COMDTINST M5100.47 series. 4. Multiple DoD Component Mishap Definition . A Multiple DoD -Component M ishap is defined as a single mishap, involving two or more Components in autonomous operational or training roles, resulting in injuries or damage to any of the involved Components. The OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 C-2 Appendix C provisions of this MOU are also applicable to mishaps involving the U .S. Coast Guard as well as joint agencies or joint programs where only one [S]ervice experiences a loss and two or more [S]ervices are or were involved in development and acquisition of a system. 5. Understandings, Agreements and Responsibilities . a. The [S]ervice safety chiefs must determine which [S]ervice has primary responsibility for investigating and reporting each Class A, multiple component mishap. Only Class A mishaps will require direct coordination between the respective Component Safety Chie fs. Class B or lower mishaps can be coordinated, and investigative lead can be delegated, below the Component Chief level. Normally, the convening authority for the investigation is the [S]ervice experiencing the greater loss, although other factors such as operational roles must also be considered. The convening [S]ervice's safety investigation directives must be used in investigating and reporting the mishap. The [S]ervice safety chiefs have the authority to agree, on a case -by-case basis, to an alter nate approach to a safety investigation, to include not participating in the lead [S]ervice's investigation. b. The safety center which first becomes aware of a Class A, B, C, or D multiple component mishap must provide immediate telephonic or email noti fication to the other involved [S]ervices' safety centers. Each [S]ervice must make available operational and technical experts for the safety investigation board as required. The [S]ervice owning or controlling the facility where a mishap occurs or the [S]ervice that is geographically closest, will secure, protect, document and preserve the mishap site to prevent contamination or removal of evidence. The securing [S]ervice must make every effort to document the mishap site during and after search, recovery and criminal investigations and minimize disturbances to the mishap scene until released by the multiple component president or senior member. c. Multiple component safety investigation boards must be comprised of the representatives listed in subparagraphs 5c(1) through 5c(4). (1) Each involved [S]ervice safety chief may send safety investigators to participate in the board. These investigators will be voting (primary ) board members, who are experts in the program, operation or u tilization of the facilities, personnel or equipment involved in the mishap. Those investig ators must be granted access to all relevant information, both privileged and non - privileged, and related board deliberations. (2) Other board members, including members from joint or DoD agencies, may be required as determined by the involved safety centers. (3) The board president or senior member must authorize all external communications. Voting (primary ) board members, non -voting (non-primary ) technical a dvisors and observers must not discuss privileged or non -privileged investigative proceedings with their parent [S]ervice without approval of the board president or senior member. OPNAV M -5102.1 MCO 5100.29C VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 C-3 Appendix C (4) Voting (primary ) board members work solely for the safety investigatio n board president or senior member and will be released at the discretion of the safety investigation board president or senior member. d. The multiple component safety investigation board president or senior member must allow legal investigation investi gators access to the mishap site and non -privileged physical evidence per the controlling guidance of the [S]ervice leading the safety investigation. e. The convening [S]ervice's safety center must promptly provide all involved [S]ervices safety centers a complete, un -redacted copy of all the joint safety investigation board's reports and subsequent endorsements. Supporting documents must be provided upon request. Safety centers may further distribute any reports within DoD and th e U.S. Coast Guard for mishap prevention purposes. The [S]ervice producing the safety investigation report must respond to requests for copies of portions of the report, to include requests from other DoD or U.S. Coast Guard staff sections, organizations and commands. f. The involved safety centers will negotiate and agree upon a review and comment process for the multiple component safety investigation board's report. g. The [S]ervice preparing the report must clearly identify recommendations targeted toward other [S]ervices or agencies and forward the recommendations to the other [S]ervices' safety center or to joint, DoD, or U.S. Coast Guard agencies when appropriate. Each [S]ervice's safety center will, in turn, forward applicable recommendations t o the appropriate agency, organization or elements in their [S]ervice. Each [S]ervice's safety center will track to completion the status of those recommendations and inform any other involved [S]ervice's safety entity of actions taken. h. When there is a suspected material failure, the board president or senior member must submit the item(s) in question to the [S]ervice appropriate facility for analysis. The [S]ervice whose facility conducts the analysis must fund the analysis. i. Each [S]ervice must provide funding for travel, per diem, rental car, and other expenses incurred by its representatives. The nearest military installation to the mishap site must provide administrative and host base support, including organic site security, while the board president or senior member is present. Other expenses (special equipment, consultants, experts, etc.) must be borne by the investigating [S]ervice. Each [S]ervice must provide funding for salvage and wreckage recovery of its own assets. j. When briefi ngs are requested, the [S]ervice safety chiefs must coordinate requirements. k. The [S]ervice that is determined to have ownership of the mishap must account for all fatalities, injuries and property damage in that [S]ervice's mishap statistics. The [S] ervices recognize that this is not an obvious interpretation of D0DI 6055.07 [of 6 June 2011] reporting OPNAV VOL 9 27 Sep 2021 C-4 Appendix C requirements, but have obtained DoD concurrence for this approach. Consistently reporting all losses in conjunction with a single event without regard to assignment of the assets assures proper prioritization of mishap prevention resources. 6. Effective Date, Periodic Review, Modification and Termination . This agreement is effective on the date of the last signature and will remain in effect until resc inded, revised, or superseded. This agreement may be cancelled at any time by mutual agreement or by any safety entity with at least 30 days advanced written notice. All safety centers must review this agreement every three years and it may be modified b y mutual consent of the signatories. A written request for modification must be provided to the other safety entities at least 60 days prior to the proposed date of changed. //s// //s// THOMAS M. BEDELL TIMOTHY J.
