In the developed world, glanders has been eradicated. However, prior use of B. mallei as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed B. mallei as a biodefense concern. This threat requires the development of new glanders medical countermeasures (MCMs), as there is a lack of an effective vaccine and lengthy courses ofmultiple antibiotics needed to eradicate B. mallei . Here, we present a literature review of human glanders in which we discuss the clinical epidemiology and risk factors, potential routes of exposure, symptoms, the incubation period, and specific diagnostics. This review focuses on pulmonary glanders, as this is the most likely outcome of abiological weapons attack. Additionally, we outline current treatment regimens and propose a clinical definition of human pulmonary glanders infection. Keywords: Burkholderia, Mallei, Aerosol, Biodefense, Animal models, Transmission, Infectious routes, Laboratory acquired infection Introduction Glanders is a highly contagious and often fatal zoonotic disease primarily of solipeds such as horses, mules, and donkeys. It was first described by the Greeks in 450 - 425 BC and again by the Romans in 400 -500 AD. Throughout history glanders has been known by other names including equinia, malleus, droes, and farcy [1-5].Glanders is primarily characterized lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. nat- ural reservoir of Burkholderia mallei . Donkeys are prone to develop acute forms of glanders while horses are more likely to develop chronic and latent diseases. Mules are susceptible to acute and chronic forms of the disease aswell as latent infections [6-8]. B. mallei infec- tions occurred worldwide, but over the last 100 years the occurrence of glanders has decreased with the reduced economic reliance on solipeds as the primary mode oftransportation, the implementation of testing all solipeds for glanders, and euthanizing those that are confirmed positive. The last naturally occurring human case in theUnited States was reported in 1934 [9]. Glanders in solipeds and humans has also been eradicated fromCanada and Western Europe [10,11]. However, sporadic infections of animals are still reported in Far East Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East [12-14]. Although human epidemics havenot been recorded, isolated outbreaks in human popula- tions and the deliberate use of B. mallei as a biological weapon have been documented [15,16]. Although glanders has been eradicated from many parts of the world, the threat of B. mallei being used as a weapon is very real. In fact, B. mallei was one of the first biological warfare agents used in the 20th century, specifically during World War I [1]. These malicious at- tacks on the opposing force 's animals were designed to impair the movement of troops and artillery, ultimately sabotaging a campaign. The former Soviet Union was also alleged to have used weaponized B. mallei against opposition forces in Afghanistan between 1982 and 1984 [2]. While the United States began work on biological warfare agents in the 1940 's including B. mallei , it did not weaponize B. mallei . However, during this work, seven individuals working in the US labs became infected. B. mallei has been considered a potential threat since the 1940 's because of its high infectivity, degree of incapacita- tion, and agent availability [5]. As further evidence that glanders is still considered a potential biological threat, the * Correspondence: cgelhaus@mriglobal.org 1Battelle, 505 King Ave, Columbus, OH 43201-2693, USA 2MRIGlobal, 425 Volker Blvd, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA \u00a9 2013 Van Zandt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Thus, diagnosis and treatment may be delayed. Therefore, we have reviewed the glanders literature to provide a description of human disease whichwill assist researchers developing medical countermeasures for glanders by creating a clinical definition against which animal models of human glanders can be qualified. Description of human glanders Clinical epidemiology and risk factors Zoonotic transmission of B. mallei from solipeds to humans appears to be uncommon, even in cases of fre- quent and close contact with infected animals. However,rigorous examination regarding the rarity of transmis- sion has not been conducted. Hypotheses to explain this low incidence include low organism concentrations at theinfection sites or a high infectious dose required to cause disease in humans [9]. Despite the low incidence of animal to human transmission occupational exposure remains akey risk factor among veterinarians, veterinary students, farriers (hoof care workers), flayers (hide workers), trans- port workers, soldiers, slaug hterhouse personnel, farmers, horse fanciers, and stable hands [9]. Subclinical infections in horses and mules also pose a hidden risk to humans, al- beit a low risk. While infection by ingesting contaminatedfood and water has occurred, it does not appear to be a sig- nificant route of entry for human infections [18-20]. Human-to-human transmission is also rare. However, it may occur during occupational exposure in medical practice or at autopsies [3,9,19,21]. Transmission has also occurred in home settings, where the care of glanders-infected individuals has led to the infection of other fam- ily members [21]. While laboratory workers have rarely been infected, their close contact with high concentrations of virulent organism puts them at a higher risk for infection. Eight cases of laboratory acquired glanders have been reportedbetween 1943 and the present at US research centers, spe- cifically Fort Detrick, Maryland. Seven of the eight Fort Detrick laboratory-acquired infections occurred prior tomodern biological containment practices [22]. The first six cases occurred during the performance of normal labora- tory procedures that could generate aerosols such as wash-ing, centrifugation, and aerating B. mallei cultures. In contrast to zoonotic transmission, aerosols of B. mallei are highly infectious [22]. Unfortunately, the seventh case isnot well described in published literature. The eighth case may have resulted from inconsistent use of personal pro- tective equipment particularly latex gloves [3,9,23].Routes of infection Glanders is transmitted by direct invasion of abraded orlacerated skin; inhalation with deep lung deposition; the nasal, oral, and conjunctival mucous membranes. The occupational exposures de- scribed above most often occur through exposed skin,particularly the hands, arms, neck, and face [9]. B. mallei is not believed to penetrate normal intact skin, although wounds or penetrations during the likely exposure inter-val were not identified in many cases [9]. Indeed, most laboratory-acquired infections are not associated with in- jury or a recollection of injury [24]. In the case of theeighth case mentioned above, a break in the skin or a specific exposure-associated laboratory incident (needle stick or broken glassware) was not recalled or identified.However, this patient reported collecting a personal blood sample via a finger-stick for diabetic monitoring prior to entering the laboratory [9]. In light of the lack ofglove use, the finger-stick site may have been the poten- tial entry point of the bacteria. The clinical manifestation of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy in this patient wasconsistent with percutaneous infection. Six of the eight cases above were described in Howe and Miller 's report which detailed glanders cases occurring within one year among Fort Detrick laboratory personnel working with B. mallei (referred to as Malleomyces mallei in the report), including two notable cases [22]. Twoworkers (patients one and two) were present when a flask containing B. mallei was dropped and broken thus poten- tially creating aerosol droplets. Both patients were admittedto the hospital on the same day, approximately two weeks after the incident and were the only personnel present in the lab when the flask was dropped. The other four pa-tients (patients three to six) were actively engaged in wash- ingB. mallei growth from agar plates for the preparation of vaccines approximately 10 -14 days prior to the on- set of their symptoms. While all workers wore the required protective clothing at the time and used caution while performing their duties, the possibility that they inhaled anaerosol could not be eliminated. Patient four also failed to heat kill the B. mallei sample they were working with prior to making dilutions for turbidity measurements two weeks before symptom onset. Approximately two weeks before their admission to the hospital, patients five and six hadengaged in procedures involving the aeration of cultures. They recalled that on at least two occasions, the containers had been opened immediately after the air current hadbeen turned off, rather than after a period of delay long enough to avoid the escape of aerosolized organisms into the room. Additionally, these two patients were workingwith a strain of organism of higher virulence than the other four. These events strongly suggest aerosol route of infec- tion by B. mallei can result in human glanders cases, espe- cially in the laboratory setting [22].Van Zandt et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:131 Page 2 of 7 http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/131Time between exposure and symptoms The acute form of disease has a typical incubation period of 1 -14 days [25], while the chronic form of the disease has an incubation period of up to 12 weeks. A localized infection typically follows within one to five days of exposure and may be characterized by swellingof the affected area and a weeping discharge. Acute pul- monary infections may require anywhere from 10 -14 days of incubation before symptoms appear [25]. Septicemiamay develop immediately after exposure or up to two weeks after initial infection. Pneumonic disease usually has a rapid onset and is almost uniformly lethal between 10and 30 days in untreated cases [22]. Figure 1 summarizes the time between exposure and symptoms. An important feature of the eight cases that have occurred since 1943 isthat at least half of the patients not only felt better but also experienced improved clinical signs for a period of time after the first wave of symptoms and prior to a secondwave of symptoms. This period of temporary improvement has the potential to be misinterpreted as eradication of dis- ease by patient and physician. Such temporary improve-ment should not limit recommended treatments. Diagnostics The definitive diagnosis of glanders requires isolation of the organism and positive identification. Radiology may reveal abcesses in multiple organs including lungs, liver,and spleen, but these abcesses are indistinguishable from those caused by other disease and specific diagnosis is required [26]. While there is no validated in vitro diag- nostic test for glanders, experimental serological tests, such as agglutination and complement fixation tests [27-29], and PCR based tests [30] have been used on alimited and experimental basis in solipeds as an alternative to isolating the organism. An indirect hemagglutinationassay (IHA) used to diagnose melioidosis in endemic re- gions can also be used to diagnosis glanders [31]. Briefly, the IHA uses Burkholderia antigens to coat sheep red blood cells prior to their incubation with serum from suspected melioidosis (or glanders) patients. In the re- sulting reaction the antigen-coated sheep RBCs agglu-tinate or form a pellet if the patient is seropositive for B. pseudomallei orB. mallei (i.e., possesses antibodies to these pathogens) [31,32]. Since antibodies from glan-ders and melioidosis patients cross react with antigens present on a variety of Burkholderia species, the IHA assay is not a specific diagnostic test and other glanders-specific diagnostic tests are needed [31,33]. The mallein test is used for veterinary diagnostic purposes and in- volves injecting purified protein derivatives intradermallyto observe a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, simi- lar to the tuberculin test for tuberculosis [34]. However, this test is not used in human diagnostics. Features of human clinical glanders General symptoms Many forms of glanders have been described, including chronic, disseminated, pulmonary, and septicemic. The variety of infections is largely explained by various routesof infection. Localized infections are generally regionally confined and typically characterized by foci of suppuration. The abscesses can ulcerate and drain for long periods oftime. However, localized infections may disseminate, lead- ing to pulmonary, septicemic, or multi-tissue infection [9]. The most common clinical features of the eight laboratory-acquired infections from Fort Detrick included (in order of most common occurrence) afternoon to evening low-grade fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias including back-ache, lymphadenopathy, and chest pain. Approximately half of the patients not only felt better but were also Time to Onset of Infection Exposure Onset of Localized Infection 1-5 Days10-14 Days Progression to Septicemia ~ 2 WeeksOnset of Acute Pulmonary Infection Death due to Lethal Pneumonic Disease10-30 DaysOnset of Chronic Disease~12 Weeks Figure 1 Time from exposure to symptoms.Van Zandt et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:131 Page 3 of 7 http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/131clinically better for a period of time after the first wave of disease symptoms. This period lasted from a few days to 2 months then patients developed clinical signsof infection. Mucosal involvement Involvement of the eye and conjunctiva in a B. mallei in- fection presents with excessive lacrimation and photopho- bia. Nasal involvement is characterized by inflammationand swelling of the nose, which is common following in- halation of B. mallei . This may be followed by copious nasal discharge. Additionally, infection may invade thenasal septum and bony tissues, causing fistulae and tissue destruction [9]. The face may swell and regional lymph nodes may become inflamed. Infection may also extendlower in the respiratory tract, resulting in bronchitis which can be accompanied by cough and mucopurulent sputum production. Constitutional signs and symptoms such asfever and chills typically occur within the first few days fol- lowing infection. Additional ly, these symptoms may persist through treatment and be severe. Common signs andsymptoms can include, but are not limited to, fever or low- grade fever in the afternoon to evening; chills with or with- out rigors; and severe headache [9]. Cutaneous involvement Cutaneous manifestations include papular lesions thatmay erupt anywhere on the body with a more chronic, indolent course of infection. B. mallei entry through an abrasion is typically followed by an inflammatory response,including pain and swelling. In these cases, a glanders node may appear as a single blister, gradually developing into an ulcer that may become hemorrhagic [18,35]. A local-ized infection with a discharge typically develops at the entry site. Inflammation may extend along regional lym- phatics and cause lymphangitis with numerous foci ofsuppuration along their course. The endotoxins present inB. mallei strains affect the smooth muscle of the lym- phatics [9] by enhancing the irritation and inflammationseen in the lymphatics. Pulmonary involvement A pulmonary infection typically results in pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, pleuritis, and plural effusion. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection can include cough, dys-pnea, chest pain, and mucoplurent sputum. Nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever (often exceeding 102\u00b0F), chills, headache, myalgias, lymphangitis, sorethroat, pleuritic chest pain, cough, dyspnea, gastrointestinal signs often accompany re- spiratory infections [9]. Many symptoms may take up to2 to 3 weeks to develop. Nonspecific signs, such as dizzi- ness, rigors, myalgia, nausea, night sweats, severe head- ache, tachycardia, weight loss, and mucosal eruptions arealso usually present and may indicate a disseminated infection [9]. Dissemination of infection Dissemination from local cutaneous or mucosal infec- tion result in septicemia and the colonization of internalorgans such as the spleen, liver, and lungs with the de- velopment of abscesses [9]. Ultrasonography and com- puted tomography may reveal multiple, small discreteabscesses in both the liver and the kidney [23]. These in- fections are typically associated with septic shock and high mortality. Treatment of human glanders Because of the rarity of human glanders cases, limitedinformation exists regarding the use of antibiotics for the treatment of infected humans. However, B. mallei infections have responded to antibiotic therapy despiteslow recovery times after delayed diagnosis or disseminated disease. B. mallei has been reported to be susceptible to many antibiotics in vitro [36-43]. Because B. mallei is a fac- ultative intracellular pathogen, aminoglycosides and other antibiotics that are incapable of penetrating host cells are most likely not useful for the treatment of infection[40,41,43]. Most B. mallei strains exhibit resistance to sev- eral antibiotics (Table 1), due in part to the exclusion of an- tibiotics from host cells [3,9,15,18]. Antibiotic efficacy has been tested against glanders in solipeds, hamsters, guinea pigs, and sulfadiazine effectively treatedacute glanders streptomycin were not effective [42]. Additionally, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin have been tested as post-exposure therapeutics in hamsters Table 1 Antibiotics to which B. mallei is commonly resistant in vitro [40,44] Antibiotic Minimum inhibitory Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:131 Page 4 of 7 http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/131infected intraperitoneally with 2 \u00d7 107CFUs of B. mallei [43]. This study demonstrated that doxycycline therapy is superior to ciprofloxacin therapy when administeredup to 48 hours after infection. It should be noted that some of these hamsters had a relapse of symptoms two to three weeks after discontinuation of ciprofloxacintreatment and four to five weeks after discontinuation of doxycycline treatment [43]. Additionally, doxycycline was able to provide 70% protection to hamsters following alow dose (5 \u00d7 10 2CFUs or 16 LD 50s) aerosol challenge [9,45]. All tested antibiotics were ineffective against a high dose (5 \u00d7 103CFUs or 160 LD 50s) of B. mallei by aerosol [45]. The majority of human glanders cases occurred before antibiotic treatment was available, and over 90% of infectedpeople succumbed to disease [48]. Of the human glanders cases recorded since the 1940s, several have been treated successfully with antibiotics [9,22,23,49,50]. Sulfadiazinewas used to successfully treat six of the previously discussed laboratory-acquired infections at Fort Detrick, as well as two additional cases of non-laboratory acquiredglanders described in 1951 [22,49]. The seventh case was successfully treated with a tetracycline derivative, aureomycin. In the most recent case of laboratory-acquiredglanders, the patient initial l yr e c e i v e da1 0 - d a yc o u r s eo fa first-generation cephalosporin but symptoms persisted for af e ww e e k s .T h ep a t i e n tt h e nr e c e i v e da1 0 - d a yc o u r s eo fclarithromycin, but symptoms returned 4 days after treat- ment was stopped. The patient was then successfully treated with imipenem and doxycycline intravenously for1 month followed by oral azithromycin and doxycycline for 6 months [9,23]. Given the lack of historical data, current treatment regi- mens for human glanders are not well understood at this point in time, and no FDA approved treatment or treat- ment regimen exists. An exhaustive review of current andexperimental treatments for both glanders and melioidosis has been published, but this review also describes the lack of clinical information for glanders treatment [51]. How-ever, in order to manage laboratory exposures, treatment recommendations have been made [52]. Symptomatic case treatment of glanders requires a concurrent two pronged approach consisting of both an intensive intravenous (IV) therapy and oral eradication therapy. IV medication op-tions are imipenem, meropenem or ceftazidime with or without trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). IV dosing schedule should last a minimum of 10 days andmay be longer depending on the severity of illness. Oral therapy timing is also dependent on the severity of the dis- ease and may run 12 weeks to as long as 12 months in dur-ation. The treatment of choice for oral antibiotic therapy options are TMP-SMX as noted above with or without a secondary oral medication of doxycycline. Alternatetherapies for TMP-SMX resistant B. mallei chloram- phenicol, quinolones, or amox icillin-clavulanate as noted in the Occupational Health Manual from the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) [52]. Since B. mallei andB. pseudomallei are similar, it is postulated th at drug therapy experiences should be similar as well. Thus, doxycycline, amoxicillin- clavulante and quinolones monotherapies than TMP-SMX and chloramphenicol. Dosing regimen recommendations are shown in Table 2. Disease outcomes in humans The mortality rate for the pulmonary form of glanders has been reported to be 90-95% without treatment andup to 40% with treatment. The reported mortality rate for the septicemic form of glanders is greater than 95% without treatment and as high as 50% with treatment.The mortality rate for the untreated cutaneous form of glanders is 90-95% if it becomes systemic and as high as 50% with treatment. In the case of chronic glanders, themortality rate may be as high as 50% despite treatment [53]. It should be noted that the previously reported mortality rates are likely to be extrapolations from therelated disease melioidosis and that lack of recent hu- man cases makes determining mortality difficult. A brief period of apparent recovery is a common clinical featurethat can easily lead to delayed treatment and complica- tions. However, despite the fact that three of the eight U.S. laboratory patients experienced a two month delayin effective treatment they were all successfully cured. These high success rates may reflect the quality of sup- portive care each patient received and the availability ofappropriate antibiotics. The most recent patient had dis- seminated disease, and required ventilator assistance as well as a prolonged course of multiple antibiotics beforeimproving. This patient was treated with imipenem and doxycycline, and there was rapid improvement. After two weeks, the imipenem was replaced by azithromycin, andthe patient completed a six-month course of treatment with azithromycin and doxycycline [9,23]. In order to Table 2 Treatment recommendations Intensive IV therapy Oral eradication therapy Imipenem 25 mg/kg up to 1 g every six hours TMP-SMX 8/40 mg/kg up to 320 mg/1600 mg every 12 hours Meropenem 25 mg/kg up to 1 g every eight hours Doxycycline 2.5 mg/kg up to 100 mg every 12 hours Ceftazidime 50 mg/kg up to 2 g every six hours Amoxicillin-clavulanate 500 mg every eight hours or 875 mg every 12 hours for adultsVan Zandt et al.

Clinical definition of human pulmonary glanders The following first two criteria and at least one of lasttwo criteria are proposed for diagnostic confirmation ofacute pulmonary glanders infection in humans. 1. Development of constitutional symptoms such as fever, rigors, myalgias, fatigue, headache, severe malaise, and pleuritic chest pain [ 22]. 2. Chest X-Ray exhibiting new onset of infiltrates either segmental or lobar which may appear as nodular opacities. May also exhibit cavitary lesions or abscesses not only in the lungs but virtually anyremote sites such as spleen, liver, subcutaneous tissue and muscle. 3. Positive isolation of B. mallei organism from sites such as cavitary lesions or abscesses not only in the lungs but virtually any remote site such as spleen, liver, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle as well assecretions, sputum, blood, and urine [ 52]. 4. Positive Burkholderia species non-specific IHA titer Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interest.
