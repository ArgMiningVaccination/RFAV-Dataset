INTRODUCTION AND MISSION Indian Health Service The Indian Health Service (IHS), an Agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the principal Federal Agency charged with the mission of raising the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level. The goal is to ensure that comprehensive , culturally acceptable personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people . The strateg ic goals include building and sustaining healthy communities; providing accessible, quality health care; and fostering collaboration and innovation across the I ndian health care systems. The IHS provides a wide range of clinical, public health, community, and facilities infrastructure service s to approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who are primarily members of 573 federally recognized Tribes in 37 states. Comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services are prov ided through a network of more than 850 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. These facilities are predominantly located in rural primary care settings and are managed by IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs. United States Government and Indian Nations The provision of federal health services to American Indians a nd Alaska Natives is based on a special relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States. The Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as numerous treaties and court decisions, have affirmed this special relationship and the plenary power of Congress to create statutes that benefit Indian people. Principal among these statutes is the Snyder Act of 1921, which provides the basic authority for health services provided by the F ederal Government to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indian Health Service and Its Partnership with Tribes In the 1970s, F ederal Indian policy was re-evaluated leading to adoption of a policy of Indian self-determination. This policy promotes Tribal administration of Federal Indian programs, including health care. Self-Determination does not lessen any F ederal obligation, but provides an opportunity for Tribes to assume the responsibility of providing health care for their members. IHS partners with Tribes on health care delivery in the context of regular Tribal consultation. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 (IHCIA), as amended, provided new opportunities for the IHS and Tribes to deliver quality and accessible health care. The IHCIA includes specific authorizations such as improvements for urban Indian health programs, Indian health professions programs, and the aut hority to collect from Medicare and Medicaid and other third -party insurers for services rendered at IHS or Tribal facilities. Under the ISDEAA, many Tribes have assumed the administrative and program direction roles that were previously carried out by the Federal Government. Tribes currently administer over half of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts. The IHS directly administers the remaining resources and manages facilities where Tribes have chosen not to contract or compact health programs. This Budget represents the President's annual report to Congress on IHS programs and its achievement of the goals of IHCIA as required by 25 USC Sec. 1671. CJ-1 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FY 201 9 President's Budget to Congress Overview of Budget The FY 2019 Budget reflects the President's strong support of health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. While n ational priorities dictate austerity in non- essential programs, this budget reflects the importance of providing health care, consistent with statutory authorities, to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) , prioritizing medical service delivery by bolstering the clinical servi ces portion of the Indian Health Service (IHS) budget by $413 million above the annualized Continuing Resolution (CR) FY 2018 level. This supports the President's agenda to address the Nation's prioritie s through careful investments of taxpayer resources . This budget proposes to eliminate the Health Education , Community Health Representatives, and the Tribal Management Grant programs While these programs contribute to community- based care, the Budget prioritiz es IHS' mission to provide quality direct health care services .. These reductions along with modest reductions in other services and facilities enable IHS to request a 11 percent increase over the FY 2018 annualized CR level in Clinical S ervices, with a 8 percent overall budget increase for IHS. Tribal consultation is important to the IHS budget process. The core of the agency's formulation process consists of the priorities and recommendations developed with Tribes through an independent annual budget formulation process1. This process is one to which the IHS is strongly committed , and which helps IHS ensure that this budget is relevant to the health needs and priorities of AI/AN people. The tribal priorities identified in the consultation process are also instrumental to inform senior officials of other U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies of the health needs of the American Indian and Alaska Native population, so that they have the opportunity to include those priorities in their individual budget requests. The Tribal budget consultation process is a key component of the IHS priority to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships that advance the IHS mission. Summary of Budget Submission . The total discretionary budget authority for IHS is $5.4 billion, a n increase of $413 million above the FY 2018 annualized CR level . The changes include the following: Staffing and Operating Costs for Newly -constructed Facilities: +$159.1 million above the FY 2018 annualized C R level for new staffing of six newly-constructed health care facilities scheduled to complete in FY 2018 and 2019, and one additional facility expansion. These funds will allow new facilities to expand the provision of health care in areas where the existing capacity is overextended, while balancing the need to maintain existing services across the country . These funds include $13 7.6 million in clinical services and $21. 5 million in other lines. Clinical Services : +$102.2 million above the FY 2018 annualized CR level, an increase that will sustain funding for direct clinical health services. The proposed funding level supports operating levels consistent with anticipated final FY 2018 funding levels. 1 The requirements for consultation are contained in statutes and various Presidential Executive orders including the: Indian S elf- Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law (P.L.) 93 -638 as amended; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94 - 437, as amended; Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies from President William J. Clinton, April 29, 1994; Presidential Executive Order 13084,Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, May 14, 1998; Presidential Ex ecutive Order 13175,Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, November 6, 2000; and Presidential Memorandum, Government -to-Government Relationship with Tribal Governments, September 23, 2004. CJ-2 Accreditation Emergencies: +$29 million above the FY 2018 annualized CR level of $29 million, for a total of $58 million for IHS to assist health care facilities that are experiencing challenges meeting CMS Conditions of P articipation and/or maintaining accreditation , which are important for their ability to bill and collect from third party payers. These funds will supplement services and facilities costs at targeted facilities. New Tribes +$1,969,000 - Additional funding is typically requested when a new Tribe is federally -recognized or reinstated so that the increase in healthcare service needs does not impact or diminish the existing Agency base budget, which supports direct service Tribes. Based on currently available information, the request reflects estimated amounts for health care services to the Pamunkey Tribe of Virginia; the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (Oklahoma), formerly a part of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, for mental health services; and the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians (Californ ia). Opioid Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Support (OPTRS) +$150 million - new funding for grants as part of the $10 billion in new funding for the Department of Health and Human Services to combat the opioid epidemic and address mental health . These funds will expand efforts to prevent opioid abuse, and help AI/ANs seeking treatment to access overdose- reversing drugs, treatment, and recovery support services. Program Discontinuations: -$80.9 million below the FY 2018 annualized CR level, for discontinuation of the Health Education , Community Health Representatives, and Tribal Management Grant programs in FY 2019. These programs have supported IHS's mission , but direct clinical services and staffing for newly constructed facilities are priori tized . Other Services Reductions : -$7.5 million below the FY 2018 Annualized CR level in other net Services program reductions. This includes the reductions to Urban Indian Health Program ( -$0.9 million), Indian Health Professions (-$5.6 million), and Self - Governance ( -$1 million). Funding for direct clinical services and staffing for newly constructed facilities are prioritized . Facilities Reductions : -$40.5 million below the FY 2018 annualized CR level to facilities program reductions. This inc ludes reductions to Health Care Facilities Construction ( - $37.7 million) and for Medical Equipment (-$2.9 million). Funding for direct clinical services and staffing of newly constructed facilities are prioritized. CJ-3 Overview of Agency Performance Since 1955, the IHS, in consultation with Tribes, Urban Indian programs, and Indian organizations, has worked diligently to ensure that comprehensive, culturally acceptable personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people.2 This FY 201 9 performance budget represents the IHS' s progress in providing health care services to approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 36 states. In pursuing our mission to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level, IHS's strategic goals relate to: people, partnerships, quality, and resources. The IHS operates a health services delivery system providing a range of clinical, public health, community , and environmental services. This system integrates health services delivery through IHS facilities, purchased by IHS through contractual arrangements with providers in the private sector, and delivered through tribally operated programs and urban Indian health programs. IHS performance improvement is a concerted effort by all members of the Indian health system working together to improve a comprehensive set of existing performance measures. This includes all clinic -based, hospital -based, and community- based programs administered by federal, tribal and urban programs. The IHS budget request reflects Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) measures that support our strategic goals and improvement of AI/AN health outcomes. Listed below under each goal are highlights of the Agency's achievements and performance expectations, as appropriate. People - Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, caring workforce collaborating to achieve the IHS mission. In FY 2016, IHS and Tribes provided 13,882,221 outpatient visits to 1,626,826 AI/ANs. IHS and Tribes provided 39,276 direct care admissions in FY 2016. In FY 2019, it is expected the IHS user population will increase by approximately 56,189 compared to the FY 2017 user population of 1,638,686. In FY 2019, IHS expects to maintain current efforts to support the IHS workforce and modify the number of current health professions award s for scholarships and loan repayment. In FY 2019, IHS will continue recruitment and training efforts aimed at strengthening the IHS health professions workforce, including implementing a global recruitment plan to recruit for critical vacancies across the Agency. To reach health professions students, IHS has established partnerships with the Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau of Health Workforce , by participating in nationwide virtual career fairs to promote National Health Service Corps scholarship and loan repayment opport unities. IHS has also partnered with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a workgroup to increase capability and improve quality through training and workforce development as well as sharing of educational and training opportunities for IHS staff. Partnerships - Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships that advance the IHS mission. IHS has numerous partnerships with HHS sister agencies, other federal departments, and countless academic, professional, and other organizations. The bullets below represent a few examples of these important partnerships: 2 The IHS produces statistical information and publications that measure and document the progress in assuring access to health care services and improving the health status of AI/ANs, publications are available at: https://www.ihs.gov/dps/index.cfm/publications . CJ-4 The IHS and VA partnership allows eligible AI/AN veterans more choices of where to access care. The VA provides reimbursement to IHS and tribal facilities for direct care services. In FY 201 9, IHS anticipates a collection of $28 million in VA reimbursements. To increase access to behavioral health services for native youth, IHS partners with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) under a 10- year agreement. The agreement allows each agency to establish local partnerships between IHS federally operated mental health programs, BIE -operated elementary and secondary schools, and BIA OJS-operated juvenile detention centers to provide mental health assessment and counseling services, which includes telebehavioral health services. In FY 2019, IHS will report results for depression screening among AI/AN youth aged 12-17. IHS is working with the Pediatric Integrated Care Collaborative (PICC) which is part of the Johns Hopkins Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care. PICC works with national faculty, pediatric primary care providers, mental health professionals and families to increase the quality and accessibility of child trauma service by integrating behavioral and physical health services in Native communities. In FY 2017, 10 IHS and Tribally operated sites participate d in a new year long project to integrate trauma -informed care at IHS and tribal facilities. Quality - Excellence in everything we do to assure a high- performing Indian Health system. The IHS 2016- 2017 Quality Framework explicitly set the goal of establishing the Office of Quality Health Care to lead all quality and safety work for IHS and report to the Deputy Director for Quality Health Care. The related goal for FY 2018 is to enact a budget for the Office enabling initial critical staffing, training resource procurement, and analytic software to support data-driven decision making. The Office of Quality Health Care will continue the work of the Quality Framework Steering Committee in completing implementation of the Framework, in addition to leading future strategic planning that builds on the Framework's success. In FY 2018, IHS is implementing several efforts to strengthen the delivery of high quality health care at IHS direct service facilities. The FY 2019 target is to maintain 100 percent accreditation and/or certification at IHS-operated hospitals and outpatient clinics. IHS is working with The Joint Commission for accreditation, training , and education services to strengthen quality and patient safety. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) now includes IHS hospitals in the nationwide Hospital Improvement and Innovation Networks contract for public and private sector hospitals to reduce adverse health events by 20 percent and hospital readmissions by 12 percent. An IHS Telehealth contract is providing telehealth services at six hospitals and many health centers and other facilities throughout Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota , and North Dakota. IHS is leveraging telehealth services as a means of strengthening access to care at its facilities in all 14 Great Plains Area facilities, which serve 130,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives. Resources - Secure and effectively manage the assets needed to promote the IHS mission. As of October 1, 2016, IHS and Tribes operated 168 service units, 48 hospitals and 560 a mbulatory centers. Urban Indian health programs operated 42 Urban Indian organizations of which there were 21 full ambulatory care programs, 6 limited ambulatory care programs, 6 outreach and referral programs, 7 residential alcohol and addiction treatment programs and 2 hybrid programs. CJ-5 Performance Management IHS cascades performance goals and objectives and performance -related metrics Agency -wide. Specific measures cascade from senior executive performance plans to those of subordinate managers and supervisors. From there they cascade into employee performance plans, whic h ensures that performance of all employees relates to key agency performance objectives. Agency leadership periodically reviews progress in meeting these Agency performance objectives, holding regular discussions with senior executives to identify challe nges to success and determine feasible solutions. Agency leadership then implements those solutions, making specific adjustments or taking corrective actions that eliminate or minimize obstacles preventing the achievement of desired results. The connecti on between performance objectives, performance measures , and employee accountability enables Agency leadership to direct the efforts of the workforce more accurately, and to make more informed and effective decisions. The impact is greater success in meet ing the full array of Agency mission requirements. Performance Reporting Tribes administer over one -half of IHS resources through Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) contracts and compacts and the Agency's performance management activity primarily reflects the IHS programs. However, there are several Tribal programs that choose to participate in GPRA/GPRAMA performance reporting. The IHS budget measures are focused on monitoring population health (clinical measures) and strategies to assess program trends and management (non- clinical measures). Consistent with the GPRA/GPRAMA, IHS continues to report valid and reliable clinical measures. Additionally, IHS' measures support the following HHS performance products, including the FY 2019 Annual Performance Plan and Report (APP/R). In FY 2019, IHS proposes to report on two GPRAMA measures to be included in the HHS APP/R: Intimate Partner (Domestic) Violence (IP DV) Screening Increase tele-behavioral health encounters nationally IHS has reported electronic population level results for GPRA/GPRAMA clinical measures since 2002. Beginning in FY 2018, IHS will use the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM) to report clinical measure results. This is a major performance reporting change for the Agency, as measure results can be calculated using any data (RPMS, non-RPMS or Fiscal Intermediary) submitted to the National Data Warehouse (NDW) . With this change, IHS will report aggregated federal, tribal and urban (I/T/U) results for the first time. Tribal programs continue to have the option to participate. The IDCS DM , IHS' centralized performance data mart, produces aggregated, clinical performance measure results at an on-demand basis. Since the IDCS DM will use all data exported to the NDW including non-RPMS tribal and urban data, budget measures previously reported from RPMS cannot be compared to IDCS DM results because of the following reasons: User Population Estimates : The IDCS DM will standardize the use of the User Population estimates as the denominator for the clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measures; Reporting Year: The GPRA/GPRAMA year of July 1-June 30 will change to match the User Population Estimates year of October 1-September 30. National clinical GPRA/GPRAMA results now include urban data. CJ-6 The FY 2019 Budget Request reflects the reporting transition to the IDCS DM system . The current clinical performance measures reported in individual program narratives are displayed first with their FY 2017 target and result with a note in the FY 2018 target column stating this measure is to \"retire and replace\". The replacement clinical measures with new HHS Unique Identifier numbers are added in numerical sequence of each Outputs and Outcomes table. The new replacement measures state the FY 2018 and FY 2019 IDCS DM target s.

SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 Budget submission for Clinical Services of $ 3.7 billion is $352.7 million above the FY 2018 Annualized CR level . Included in the budget is additional funding of $84.3 million for Current Services, $138 million for Staffing of New and Replacement Facilities , $2 million to address funding needs for 3 New Tribes, $29 million for accreditation emergencies, and $99 million for Clinical Services program increases. The detailed explanation of the request is described in each of the budget narratives that follow this summary . Hospitals and Health Clin ics, which supports essential personal health services and community based disease prevention and health promotion services. Health services includ e: inpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care; and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, physical therapy, and other services . Specialized programs are conducted to address: diabetes ; maternal and child health; youth services; communi cable diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis; women's and men's health; geriatric health ; disease surveillance ; and healthcare quality improvement. The B udget proposes an increase of $267.7 million for a total of $2.2 billion for Hospita ls and Health Clinics. Dental Health , which supports preventive care, basic care, and emergency care, with approximately 90 percent of services covering basic and emergency care. Basic services are prioritized over m ore complex rehabilitative care such as root canals, crowns and bridge s, dentures, and surgical extractions . The demand for dental treatment remains high due to the high dental caries rate in American Indian and Alaska Native ( AI/AN) children; however, a continuing emphasis on community oral health promotion/disease prevention is essential to impact long-term improvement of the oral health of AI/AN people. The B udget proposes an increase of $22.4 million for a total of $ 203.8 million for Dental Health . Mental Health , which supports a community-oriented clinical and preventive mental health service program that provides outpatient mental health and related services, crisis triage, case management, prevention programming, and outreach services. The Budget proposes an increase of $ 11.7 million for a total of $ 105.2 million for Mental Health. Alcohol and Substance Abuse , which supports an integrated behavioral health approach to collaboratively reduce the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN CJ-70 communities. The Budget proposes an increase of $18.4 million for a total of $ 235.3 million for Alcohol and Substance Abuse. Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) , supports the purchase of essential health care services not available in IHS and Tribal h ealthcare facilities including inpatient and outpatient care, routine emergency ambulatory care, transportation, specialty care services (mammograms, colonscopies, etc.), and medical support services (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imagi ng, physical therapy, etc.). The demand for PRC remains high as the cost of medical care increases. The PRC program continues to emphasize adherence to medical priorities, enrolling patients in alternate resources available to them (such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance), negotiating discounted rates with medical providers, and implementing improvements recommended by Tribes and oversight authorities. The Budget proposes an increase of $32.4 million for a total of $ 955 million for Purchased/Referred Care. The majority of clinical services funds are provided to 12 Area (regional) Offices which distribute resources, monitor and evaluate activities, and provide administrative and technical support to 168 Federal and Tribal Service Units (local level) for 608 healthcare facilities providing care to approximately 2.2 million AI/ANs primarily in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved.

Permanent Allocation Method ... ..................................... Direct Federal , P.L. 93 -638 contracts and compacts, Tribal shares, interagency agreements, commercial contracts, and grants PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Hospitals and Health Clinics (H&HC) funds essential , personal health services for approximat ely 2.2million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The Indian Health Service (IHS ) provides medical and surgical inpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care, and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, and physical therapy. The IHS and Tribes primarily serve small, rural populations with primary medical care and community- health services, relying on the private sector for much of the secondary and most of the tertiary medical care needs. Some IHS and Tribal hospitals provide secondary medical services such as ophthalmology, orthopedics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, radiology, general and gynecological surgery, and anesthesia. The IHS system of care is unique in that personal health care services are integrated with community health services. The program includes public/community health programs targeting health conditions disproportionately affecting AI/ANs such as diabetes, maternal and child health, and communicable diseases including influenza, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis. Although the health status of AI/ANs has improved significantly in the past 60 years since the inception of the IHS, the average life expectancy at birth is 73. 7 years (data years 200 7-2009) compared to the U.S. all races life expectancy of 78. 1 years. 1 More than 60 percent of the H&HC budget is transferred under P.L. 93-638 contracts or compacts to Tribal governments or Tribal organizations that design and manage the delivery of individual and community health services through 22 hospitals, 289 health centers , 73 health stations , 150 Alaska v illage c linics , and 15 school health centers. The remainder of the H&HC budget is managed by direct federal programs that provide health care at the service unit and community level. The federal system consists of 26 hospitals, 53 h ealth centers, 30 health stations, and 4 school health centers. 1 Life Expectancy, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Data Years 2007 -2009 Report . Indian Health Service Division of Program Statistics, Indian Health Service, United States Department of Health and Human Services, December 2014. CJ-72 Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health information is done through a network of t ribally - operated epidemiology centers in collaboration with a national IHS coordinating center leading to the identification of health conditi ons as well as promoting interventions. Information technology supports personal health services (including the Electronic Health Record and telemedicine) and public health initiatives (such as Baby Friendly Hospitals and Improving Patient Care) that are primarily funded through the H&HC budget. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following are brief examples of specific activities funded through H&HC that are helping improve the quality of services throughout the IHS healthcare system: Quality Framework -In 2016, IHS published the IHS 2016-2017 Quality Framework to establish a plan for substantial improvement activities necessary to ensure the quality and safety of care provided to AI/AN patients. The Quality Framework established the vision of providing patient- centered, timely, effective, safe, and reliable health care of the highest quality and to accomplish that, two Quality Goals: 1) Improve health outcomes for patients receiving care; 2) Provide a care delivery service all patients trust. To achieve these Go als, five Quality Priorities were identified: 1) Strengthen Organizational Capacity to Improve Quality of Care and Systems; 2) Meet and Maintain Accreditation for IHS Direct Service Facilities; 3) Align Service Delivery Processes to Improve Patient Experience; 4) Ensure Patient Safety; 5) Improve Transparency and Communication Regarding Patient Safety and Quality to IHS Stakeholders. Implementation of the plan began prior to its publication and has continued through FY 2017 under the oversight of the Quality Framework Steering Committee with significant progress. The Quality Framework explicitly set the goal of establishing the Office for Quality Health Care to lead all quality and safety work for IHS and report to the Deputy Director for Quality Health Care. The related goal for FY 2018 is to identify a budget for the Office enabling initial critical staffing, training resource procurement, and analytic software to support data-driven decision making. The Office of Quality Health Care w ill continue the work of the Quality Framework Steering Committee in completing implementation of the Framework, in addition to leading future strategic planning that builds on the Framework's success. An Acting Deputy Director for Quality Health Care cur rently directs the Quality Framework Steering Committee's implementation activities. In May 2017, acquisition of credentialing and privileging software was announced and implementation activities began immediately. A two -phased implementation strategy was developed by a dedicated IHS Information Technology project team working with the vendor. Phase I was completed on November 9, 2017, by half of the IHS Direct Service Areas. Lessons learned from Phase I were incorporated into Phase II implementation to accelerate progress. Implementation across all IHS Direct Service Areas will be complete by January 31, 2018. Credentialing software will standardize processes for credentialing tasks, streamline applications, automate reminders and notifications, facilitate electronic verifications of credentials through CJ-73 approved sources, provide portability of credentials throughout IHS Direct Service facilities, and enhance the review of credentials by recommending authorities and governing boards. In early January 2017, hospital Governing Board (GB) Bylaws for inpatient acute care hospitals were stan dardized across IHS. Bylaws must now include the following, at a minimum: Frequency of formal governing board meetings: At least twice per year, but may meet more often if desired/necessary to meet the needs of the service unit. Membership of the GB: The minimum number of GB members is determined by the Chair (Area Director) and ensures adequate representation of disciplines to carry out the required activities. All GB members have a vote and the majority of voting members must represent the Area Office and may also include similar representation from Service Units. Due to the inherent federal functions of governing federal facilities, members of the Governing Board must be IHS federal employees/officers. Tribal consultation is encouraged through CEO commu nications with Tribal Leadership, and Tribal representatives may be invited to open forums or town hall meetings in order to provide input. Meeting Agendas: At a minimum, Governing Board meeting agendas must include the following elements: Quality of Care - including quality improvement and quality assurance/compliance Patient Safety Hospital/Facility Operations These three primary components ensure a baseline of standards IHS- wide while maintaining maximum flexibility for the Areas and Service Units to amend their respective bylaws based upon needs specific to their locations and service populations. A Quality Accountability Dashboard Working Group was established by the Steering Committee to develop metrics that will allow oversight and management of com pliance with policy or regulatory requirements to ensure quality and safety of care. The measure definitions, data collection tool, and dashboard have been piloted for the 4 th Quarter of FY 2017. The dashboard will be publicized in January 2018 and updated quarterly. Changes in healthcare may occasionally necessitate modifications to the dashboard and IHS will remain vigilant for such needs . The success of developing this dashboard has also led to development efforts related to the other three agency priorities: People, Partnerships, and Resources. All IHS hospitals are being aligned under a single source of accreditation to ensure a standardized approach and consistent standards across the system. To support this activity and ensure sustainment, IHS develop ed an acquisition plan to contract with a single accreditation organization for surveys and accreditation technical assistance at all IHS Direct Service hospitals. This will achieve economy of scale and a uniform knowledge base of accreditation stan dards, best practices for quality and safety, and cross- agency support for accreditation readiness activities. The contract was awarded to The Joint Commission on September 29, 2017 for accreditation of all IHS direct service hospitals. Similarly , a cont ract was also awarded to the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) to provide accreditation services to IHS direct service ambulatory health centers. A Patient Experience of Care Survey Working Group was established by the Steering Committee to develop a standardized patient experience of care survey instrument for use at all IHS CJ-74 healthcare facilities. The anonymous surveys are completed and the results analyzed by each IHS healthcare facility, separately. The analysis will determi ne what actions, if any , are required . The instrument was finalized in March 2017 and the first phase of pilot testing of survey administration using electronic tablets (to facilitate data collection and reporting) has been completed. Continued piloting and expansion of the number of facilities implementing this tool will continue into FY 2018. A Patient Wait Times Working Group was established by the Steering Committee to develop standards for primary care patient wait times for appointments. The Worki ng Group completed standard development in June 2017, establishing the following standards: 28 days or less for primary care non -follow-up appointments, and 48 hours or less for primary care urgent visit appointments. This standard has been incorporated into a measure for the Quality Accountability Dashboard so that it can be monitored routinely and improved. The IHS Patient Safety Event Reporting System, WebCident, is under evaluation for replacement to improve the user interface. Aligned with efforts to improve adverse event reporting, IHS has begun implementing the Just Culture model to ensure appropriate supervisory responses to adverse events and to support earlier identification and reporting of risk before manifesting as an adverse event. This mod el is also expected to improve staff satisfaction with work and retention of staff. Nine Area Office personnel received certification training in Just Culture in November 2017 to increase training capacity to support implementation across IHS in 2018. IHS has continued its productive partnerships with the Premier Inc. Hospital Improvement and Innovation Network (HIIN) and HealthInsight New Mexico Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) with its Partnership to Advance Tribal Health (PATH). The Premier HI IN provides technical assistance and learning platforms to reduce Hospital Acquired Conditions and Readmissions. They coach hospital care teams and staff on best practices, lessons learned, and quality improvement activities aligned with these goals. The HealthInsight NM QIO and PATH provide leadership development learning opportunities, care team effectiveness enhancement, patient safety resources, patient/family engagement technical assistance, and system level assessments. Leaders across IHS are intim ately familiar with the 2016 -2017 Quality Framework and not only embrace and support current implementation activities, but also look for innovative methods to implement local initiatives aligned with principles of the Framework. Volunteerism to participa te in Quality Framework pilots and Working Groups has become common, indicating very strong interest and support for continued efforts. Improving Patient Care (IPC) Program 2.0 -The purpose of the IPC Program is to promote the development and application of the quality improvement processes and to promote the implementation of the Patient -Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of care to improve the health and wellness of AI/ANs. The IPC program provides a regional model of collaborative learnin g to develop proficiency in quality improvement. Data management and analysis are used drive improvements. S uccess will be measured in FY 2018 and beyond by achievement of clinical and process industry -benchmarks, as well as ultimate recognition or certification of participating sites as P CMHs . Participating teams report on clinical outcome measures aligned with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA ) measures and some additional clinical process measures In 2017, the IPC program completed on- site training for care teams in 9 of the 12 IHS Areas for over 400 clinicians and staff. The IPC program provided 1000 subscriptions to the Institute for CJ-75 Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School to support I/T/U facili ty staff in their quality improvement efforts with enrolled of over 400 staff. In 2017, the IPC program began the development of reporting systems for the 21 P CMH measures. In 2017, began the development of a web based collaborative learning environment to support quality improvement and PCMH information dissemination and knowledge exchange. As of the end of FY 2017, 32 percent of the IHS health care facilities providing ambulatory care services have obtained PCMH designation from either the Joint Commis sion or the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. Nursing - Nursing represents the largest category of health care provider s in the Indian health system and has a major impact on patient safety and health care outcomes. According to the 2017 IHS Nurse Position Report (NPR) , there are 2044 R egistered Nurses (R Ns) and 392 Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN s) employed in IHS. The 2017 IHS NPR identified a RN/Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) vacancy rate of 19 percent and a LPN vacancy rate of 11 percent. Nurses are actively engaged in the transformation of the health care system by placing more emphasis on prevention, wellness, and coordination of care. The IHS adopted the Baby -Friendly\u00ae Hospital Initiative (BFHI) as the official standard of care for AI /AN mothers and babies in FY 2011. IHS received 100 percent Baby -Friendly \u00ae designation of all its obstetric care h ospitals in FY 2014 . Baby -Friendly \u00ae designated hospitals are re- surveyed every 5 years. IHS has sustained 100 percent (n=10) Baby -Friendly\u00ae designation. This IHS initiative promotes breastfeeding to reduce the risk that AI/AN children will develop obesity, diabetes, and other obesity- related conditions in the future. 2 IHS nurses are instrumental in promoting and sustaining Baby-Friendly\u00ae practices and promoting breastfeeding as the exclusive feeding choice for AI/AN infants in their first six months of life. IHS nurses support the BFHI through enhanced team- based care, self- management support, and the integration of Baby-Friendly\u00ae practices with primary care services. In FY 2017, t he percentage of babies at the age of 2 months who were exclusively or mostly breastfed was over 30 percent , which is an increase of 5.6 percent since the beginning of the BFHI. IHS is committed to maintaining Baby Friendly \u00ae practices and designation into FY 2018 and beyond. Trauma Care - Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability among the AI/AN population under age 45, and AI/AN trauma death rates are three times higher than U.S. all races rates.3 Local IHS hospitals are frequently t he nearest emergency medical facility that can receive patients with traumatic injuries from emergency medical services providers (Paramedics, EMTs). Of the 2 6 IHS emergency departments (EDs) , 24 are located at inpatient facilities and 2 are in health centers; 74 percent are more than 50 miles from the nearest designated trauma center at any level and 52 percent are more than 100 miles. According to the FY 2016 IHS emergency department memo, there were 396,766 direct outpatient ED visits and 15,100 d irect i npatient ED visits for the 2 6 IHS facilities . Recruitment and retention of competent and proficient staff for EDs at certain facilities has posed a significant challenge to continuity of emergency services in FY 2017. A coordinated effort to address this challenge across all levels aims to improve recruitment and retention activities . 2 Ip, S. Chung M., Raman G., et al. Breastfeeding and Maternal Infant Health Outcomes in Developed Countries . Evid Rep Technol Assess. 2007 (153): 1 -186. 3 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service, Trends in Indian Health 2014 Edition (Released March 2015), ISSN 109 5-2896 CJ-76 Trauma Center designation is determined by state and local municipal ities based on unique criteria such as: trauma readiness, resources available, policies, patient care, and performance improvement. Currently, out of 24 IHS hospitals with an ED , only one is designated a L evel III (provides prompt assessment, resuscitation, surgery, intensive care, and stabilization of injured patients and emergency operations) and one other is designated a Level IV (provide s evaluation, stabilization, and diagnostics for injured patient s prior to the transfer of the patient to a higher Level Trauma Center ). Adequate staffing levels and capabilities, as well as state of the art equipment, are essential for quality care. Eme rgency medicine physicians, RNs, Advanced Practice Nurses ( APNs ), and other highly trained staff are essential for crisis and disaster management to improve patient outcomes. For RNs from rural IHS emergency departments and critical care areas, t he IHS Ca pstone program develops critical thinking skills, competence and confidence in trauma nurses in the emergency department setting . This program includes population specific services, pediatric emergency services, and geriatric trauma. In FY 2017, 6 RNs completed the IHS Capstone program. HIV/AIDS Program - AI/AN people face significant health disparities in rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). From 2005 to 2014, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a 63 percent increase in HIV rates among gay and bisexual AI/AN men alone, while the overall HIV rate for all AI/AN increased by 19 percent . Racial and ethnic differences in HIV/AIDS survival from 2006-2011 showed that AI/A Ns had the lowest survival rate after an AIDS diagnosis of any race. 4 Nearly all communities served by IHS have been affected by HIV; as of FY 2016, more than 95 percent reported at least one patient with an HIV diagnosis. The HIV/AIDS Program goal is to prevent new HIV infections and ensure access to quality health services for AI/ANs living with HIV/AIDS . IHS increased overall prenatal HIV screening to 87 percent in FY 2016 - a 15 percent increase over FY 2006 data. In FY 2016, IHS included HIV screening of 13 -64 year- olds in its nationally reportable quality of care metrics. This resulted in 80,000 unique AI/AN patients receiving HIV screening for the first time. The overall HIV screening rate has increased by 22 percent . Some of the highest performing IHS facilities have achieved HIV screening levels of more than 70 percent for th e eligible population. To improve access to care in remote areas IHS HIV/AIDS Program provides technical support to IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health sites on screening and treatment, and the use of te le- health. The HIV/AIDS Program goal is to ensure access to quality health services for AI/ANs living with HIV/AIDS and those at risk of contracting HIV and commonly co-occurring infections. Hepatitis C V irus (HCV) infections can result in illness varying in severity from mild -lasting a few weeks, to serious- a lifelong illness ending in death by liver failure. The likelihood of liver damage is related to the duration and severity of untreated infection. HCV death rates among AI/ANs are more than twice the national average compared to other ethnic groups. The CDC estimate 3.5 million persons have HCV in the US, and approximately 120,000 of those are in Indian Country. AI/ANs have the largest increase of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer compared to any other race/ethnic groups. The IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) data identifies 34,000 IHS patients with HCV and estimates nearly 200 new 4 https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/aian/index.html CJ-77 cases each year. This data does not include up to 50 percent of patients who remain undiagnosed. IHS data also identifies fewer than 1,000 HCV patients currently undergoing treatment. The CDC a nd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all persons born from 1945-1965 should be screened for HCV. IHS aligned program initiatives with The National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan (NVHAP) 2017 -2020, to eliminate new viral hepatiti s infections, increase knowledge of hepatitis diagnoses, improve access to high quality health care and curative treatments, and eliminate stigma and discrimination. IHS clinical data shows that screening for HCV among AI/ANs born from 1945-1965, increase d from 8 percent in 2012 to 54 percent in 2017. This achievement is due in part to the development of technical support tools like electronic health records (EHR) clinical reminders, publication of IHS policy guidelines for HIV and HCV, and creation of cl inical linkages to care. IHS anticipates higher costs associated with HCV care in FY 2018 and 2019 associated with the increased rate of diagnosis (based on increased screening of Baby -Boomers and women of reproductive age) and the substantially high cost of curative medications. Domestic Violence Prevention Program (DVP P) (formerly known as the Domestic Violence Prevention Initiative ) - Domestic and intimate partner violence has a disproportionately large impact on AI/AN communities. According to the CDC, 45.9 percent of AI/AN woman have experienced intimate partner violence - the highest rate of any race or ethnicity in the U.S. 5 In addition, it is estimated that one out of every three AI/AN women is sexually assaulted in her lifetime,6 and AI/AN vic tims of intimate and family violence are more likely than victims of all other races to be injured and need hospital care.7 DVP P is a nationally -coordinated program that provides culturally appropriate domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and intervention resources to AI/AN communities with a focus on providing trauma informed services. The DVP P focuses on domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, and coordinated community responses, as well as providing forensic healthcare services to victims of domestic and sexual violence. In FY 2015, IHS established a new five- year funding cycle for the DVP P that will operate from 2015-2020. IHS received an additional $4 million in FY 2017 and issued 26 new awar ds to participate in the DVPP. A total of 83 grantees and federal awardees work to meet the following goals: Build Tribal, Urban Indian Health Programs and Federal capacity to provide coordinated community responses to AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, Increase access to domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, crisis intervention, and behavioral health services for AI/AN victims and their families, Promote trauma- informed services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence and their families , Offer health care provider and community education on domestic violence and sexual violence, 5 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. 2010.

The second year concluded on September 29, 201 7 with 100 percent of projects submitting their progress reports. Evaluation of the data for year two will be available in March 2018. TRIBAL SHARES H&HC funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall H&HC budget line is reserved for federally inherent functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount DVP P 2015 $1,836,789 ,000 ($8,967,278) 2016 $1,857,225 President's Budget $2,189,688 ,000 ($8,967,278) BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 budget submission for Hospitals and Health Clinics of $2,189,688,000 is $267,652,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR level . FY 2018 Base Funding of $1,922,036,000 - suppo rts the largest portion of clinica l care at IHS and T ribal health facilitie s, including salari es and benefits for hosp ital/clini c administra tion; salaries and benefits for physicians, nur ses, and ancillary sta ff; pharm aceuticals; and medical suppli es. These funds make up the lump sum r ecurring base distributi on to the Ar eas each fiscal year. In addition, an amount of H&H C funding that initially is a llocated to H eadquarters e ach year is reallocated o n a non-r ecurring basis to Ar eas during the fi scal year and s upports national activiti es. Also included in the base is funding to provide technical assistance to IHS facilities to promote efficient, effective, high quality care to the AI/AN population. The IHS will strengthen its quality system to ensure alignment with and attainment of national standards for quality and patient safety for inpatient and outpatient facilities. This will in clude accreditation preparation, readiness, and survey activities; bringing health care quality expertise to IHS; and development and/or dissemination of education tools and experiential opportunities to ensure staff competencies in quality assurance and q uality improvement. FY 2019 Funding Increase of $267,652,000 includes: Current Services : +$45,319,000 for current services including: o Pay Costs +$ 31,759,000 - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o Inflation +$13,560,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. CJ-79 Staffing for New Facilities +$103,646,000 - These funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to ex pand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The following table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/ Tribal Positions Red Tail Hawk Health Center, Chandler , AZ $26,702,000 245 Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ $4,574,000 43 Fort Yuma Health Center (Replacement), Winterhaven , $5,330,000 48 Muskogee (Creek) Nation Health Center (JV), Eufaula, OK $6,444,000 59 Yukon -Kuskokwim Primary Care Center (JV), Bethel, AK $39,065,000 216 Cherokee Nation Regional Health Center (JV), Tahlequah, OK $21,531 ,000 165 Grand Total: $103,646 ,000 776 New Tribes +$1,969,000 - Additional funding is typically requested when a new Tribe is federally -recognized or reinstated so that the increase in healthcare service needs does not impact or diminish the existing Agency base budget, which supports direct service Tribes. The Pamunkey Tribe of Virginia was recognized in January 2016 and funding of approximately $1,135,000 is requested to establish healthcare services for their estimated 337 members. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (Oklahoma), formerly a part of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, has an estimated need of $99,000 for mental health services for their estimated 1,299 members. The Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians (California) requests an estimated $519,000 for 192 members. Accreditation Emergencies +$29,000,000 - Additional funding to assist IHS -operated hospitals that are at risk or out of compliance with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Conditions of Participation.

Cooperative Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS) Tribal Epidemiology Center (TEC) Program was first authorized and funded by Congress in FY 1996. The intent has been to develop public health infrastructure by augmenting existing Tribal organizations with expertise in epidemiology and public health via Epidemiology Centers. Funding is distributed to the TECs through cooperative agreements to Tribes and Tribal organizations such as Indian health boards. The TECs play a critical role in IHS' overall public health infrastructure. Operating within Tribal organizations, TECs are uniquely positioned to provide support to local Tribal disease surveillance and control programs, and assess the effectiveness of public health programs. All TECs monitor the health status of their constituent Tribes, produce a variety of reports annually or bi-annually that describe activities and progress towards public health goa ls, and provide support to Tribes who self -govern their health programs. The TEC program funds eleven TECs that provide comprehensive geographic coverage for all IHS administrative a reas and one additional TEC serving AI/AN populations residing in major urban centers nationally. The IHS Division of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention (DEDP) functions as the national coordinating center and provides technical support and guidance to TECs. The DEDP and TECs collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate health information in addition to identifying diseases to target for intervention, suggesting strategies, and testing the effectiveness of implemented health interventions. The TEC Progr am supports Tribal communities by providing technical training in public health practice and prevention-oriented research, and promoting public health caree r pathways for Tribal members. Over 90 percent of the TEC Program budget is distributed through cooperative agreements based on a 5- year competitive award cycle. In the current award cycle, all 12 TECs were awarded an annual average of $ 341,00 0 (beginning FY 2016). The next 5- year competitive award cycle will encompass FYs 20 21-2026 and projected at similar funding levels for each TEC. CJ-88 The TECs are fundamental to the IHS' partnership with Tribes by supporting epidemiology and public health functions critical to the delivery of healthcare services. Independent TEC goals are set as directed by their constituent Tribes and health boards. The DEDP tracks these goals and objectives as written in their cooperative agreements (i.e., surveillance of disease and control programs and collecting epidemiological data for use in determining he alth status of Tribal communities). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Data Projects that Engage Local Resources Data generated locally and analyzed by TECs enable Tribes to evaluate Tribal and community- specific health status for planning the needs of their Tribal membership. Immediate feedback is provided to the local data systems and leads to improvements in Indian health data overall. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (Section 130) includes language to designate the TECs as public health authorities . To ensure the security of the agency data access, data sharing agreements are required, before TECs access IHS -generated data sets. TECs assist Tribes with projects such as conducting behavioral risk factor surveys to establish a base of measurement for successfully evaluating intervention and prevention activities related to behavioral health needs. Because national surveys (e.g., Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey) do not consistently capture representati ve data for AI/AN populations, TEC s have had an essential role in piloting adapted versions of these national surveys to include AI/AN populations. These surveys provide baseline and trend data used by Tribes and Urban Indian Health organizations (U IHOs ) to identify health -related needs and to prioritize interventions and prevention services. For example, one TEC combines these survey s and other data to generate reports on the health disparities of urban Indians and distributes nationally to all UIHOs to identify health priorities, seek opportunities for new data collection, and support competitive, evidence-driven applications for funding opportunities to address these priorities. Disease Surveillance and Evaluation In the expanding environment of Tribally -operated health programs, TECs provide additional public health services, such as disease control and prevention programs, in areas such as sexually transmitted disease control, HIV, and cancer prevention. TEC efforts build capacity in the Indian health system by evaluating and monitor ing the effectiveness of health and public health programs. This allows TECs to assess access, use, and/or quality of care and develop recommendations for the targeting of services needed by the populations served. Collaboration The DEDP collaborates with the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , and other federal agencies to supplement TEC activities , create stronger interagency partnerships, and prevent costly dupli cation of effort. TECs support national public health goals by working to improve data for the Government Performance and Results Act, agency performance reports, and monitoring of the Healthy People 2020 objectives at the Tribal level. Health status rep orts across all TECs will lead to a more comprehensive picture of Indian health. In the long term, these activities create opportunities for IHS to improve the delivery of services by calling attention to health disparities or concerns experienced by the population the Agency serves.

IHS HIT provides support for the IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) programs that care for 2.2 million American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people across the Indian health system. IHS provides the technology infrastructure for a nationwide health care system, including a secure wide area network, enterprise e-mail services, and regional and national Help Desk support for approximately 20,000 network users. IHS HIT also supports the mission -critical health care operations of the I/T/U with comprehensive health information solutions including an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and more than eighty applications. IHS' EHR received 2014 certification for meeting requirements set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) which established standards and other criteria for structured data that EHRs must use. The IHS HIT program directly supports better ways to 1) care for patients , 2) pay providers , and 3) refer care when needed 4) recover costs, and 5) distribute information, resulting in better care, wiser spending of our health dollars, and healthier communities, economy, and country. The HIT Program is dedicated to providing the most innovative, effective, cost -efficient, and secure HIT system in the federal government. The HIT program is comprised of two Mission Delivery IT investments: 1) Health Information Technology Systems and Support (HITSS); 2)National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS); and three Part 3 IT investments; 1)Infrastructure, Office, Automation, and Telecommunications (IOAT); 2) IT Security and Compliance; 3) IT Management. These investments support federal and tribal priorities for improving the delivery of healthcare and are fully integrated with the Agency's programs and are critical to carrying out the IHS mission and priorities. 1) HITSS is and enterprise wide enterprise health information system that underlies the clinical, practice management and revenue cycle business processes at I/T/U facilities across the CJ-92 country. The IHS investment encompasses the RPMS EHR that is certified according to criteria publish ed by the O NC and is in use at approximately 430 health care facilities across the country. In pursuit of expanding capabilities, the HITSS Program Management Office (PMO) continued the deployment of new health information sharing and patient engagement feature s, collectively called the RPMS Network, through out FY 2017 and began its planning efforts for the IHS implementation of the IT requirements for the Medicare Access & Children's Health Insurance Program ( Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015) and other quality improvement initiatives. 2) NPIRS is an enterprise- wide data warehouse and business intelligence environment that produces reports required by statute and regulation and provides a broad range of clinical and administrative information, and associa ted analytical tools, to managers at all levels of the Indian H ealth system. This investment, is evolving to add rigor to the analytic platform, adding additional data domains, defining a data governance framework, adopting industry standards and best practices to exploit Business Intelligence capabilities , and is enabling IHS to produce and make more informed, quality decisions against agency- level measurement, performance and enterprise data. 3) IOAT program provides the technical infrastructure for federal and some tribal healthcare facilities and is the foundation upon which all health IT services are delivered. The IOAT investment includes a highly available and secure wide -area network which includes locations with unique telecommunication challenges, a national e-mail and collaboration capability that is designed specifically to support health care communication and data sharing, enterprise application services and supporting hardware including s ervers and end - user devices. The IT infrastructure incorporates government and industry standards for the collection, processing, storage, and transmission of information and is poised to respond to new and pioneering opportunities. 4) IT Security and Co mpliance is an enterprise- wide IT Security Program which creates information security policy, secur es centralized resources, and provides cybersecurity training for employees and contractors. 5) IT Management investment is an enterprise-wide program that supports IT Management, Capital Planning, Strategic Planning, Enterprise Arc hitecture, IT Finance, and IT Vendor Management activities in support of the two Mission Delivery IT investments. This program serves to promote compliance with federal law and mandates and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of all IHS HIT investments. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Office of Information Technology (OIT) achieved numerous accomplishments during FY 2017, some examples follow: FY 2017 Accomplishments and Progress to Date People Office of Information Technology (OIT) staff presented current HIT initiatives at various Tribal or Tribal health board conferences and meetings such as TribalNet, National Tribal Health Conference, Tribal Technical Advisory Group, National Indian Health B oard (NIHB), NIHB Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Reform Policy Committee, IHS Tribal Self CJ-93 Governance Advisory Committee and the Direct Service Tribes Advisory Committee quarterly meetings, etc. OIT staff regularly participated in Tribal Delegation Meetin gs at IHS Headquarters and attended the Alaska Area Pre- negotiation/Negotiation meetings to address IT/HIT issues. IHS Senior Leadership also visited Cherokee Nation and Muscogee Creek Nation to view Tribal Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization eff orts. A representative from the Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Chief Technology Officer attended the IHS Information Systems Advisory Committee (ISAC) September 2017 bi-annual meeting to provide HHS technical support and share information with IHS, and participated in the IHS visit to the Muscogee Creek Nation to view commercial EHR systems in use at this Tribal site. Continued deployment of the new health information sharing and patient engagement capabilities in support of improving how we deliver services. Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) Network accomplishments include: o RPMS Direct Messaging: Over 20,000 messages were exchanged between patients, providers, administrators, and message agents through approximately 13,771 Unique Direct e -mail Addresses. o Personal Health Record (PHR): PHR implementation is underway with approximately 11,000 PHR Users . Fifty -six percent of these registered PHR users were verified/linked to their IHS Medical Record. The remaining 44 percent are registered but not yet verified/linked. In response to issues identified by field and program staff, OIT significantly reduced 4,750 active RPMS/RPMS EHR service desk tickets by 80 percent and closed over 4,400 tickets with approximately 350 remaining open. Provided a total of 337 HIT training courses to 6,707 IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) users. This included 78 classroom/satellite sessions with 706 participants and 259 eLearning/eLearning hands-on sessions with 6,001 participants. Added 166 training recordings with 4,598 views in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 for a total of 243 recordings since the FY 2015 recording repository inception culminating in 12,515 views. In support of Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program Reform, the OIT consistently provided RPMS practice management training to I/T/U users and worked closely with Office of Resource Access and Partnership to keep PRC software maintained and up -to-date. Partnerships The ISAC held two semi- annual meetings (June in Chicago/September in Oklahoma City) . Both meetings were well attended with an aggregated total of over 85 I/T/U participants, both in person and by teleconference. The agenda included reports and updates on the latest projects and initiatives within the HIT realm. The discussions which came out of the meeting included the current and future state of the IHS HIT platform including the EHR and the current IHS cyber- security efforts for the protection of the network, as well as infrastructure updates. The OIT conducted four highly attended Tribal listening sessions to share IHS efforts and solicit Tribal input on how best to modernize and improve our HIT Systems and Support CJ-94 (HITSS) investments, including the RPMS EHR (approximately 1,000 participants). The current IHS EHR platform is relate d to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) EHR platform (VistA); however, the VA is adopting a commercial system to replace VistA. Options discussed at the listening sessions will be issued in a report in Fiscal Year 2018. The OIT conducted 15 Tribal Co nsultation and Urban Confer sessions on the draft IT Service Catalog, generating considerable Tribal participation with over approximately 125 participants. The final report will be issued in Fiscal Year 2018, and IT Service Catalog implementation will fo llow. The IHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) began reporting on the IHS's monthly \"All Tribal and Urban Indian Organization Leaders\" conference calls to share IHS IT/HITSS information. Reports have been well received. Collaboration with Tribal health programs and other federal agencies is key to the success of the HIT Program. IHS worked closely with the Office of the National Coordinator for HIT, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, VA, and other federal entities on IT initiatives to ensure that the direction of its HIT systems are consistent with other federal agencies. Collaborating with the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance to facilitate making IHS HIT innovations and advances available to the broader public. Quality Health Information Technology Modernizing the way provider credentialing and privileging is carried out across the Agency to facilitate the hiring of qualified providers and ensuring patient safety. IHS acquired and is now uti lizing a centralized electronic credentialing database across all federally operated facilities. Planning for system changes required to support implementation of Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA). Participated in the IHS MACRA Working Group in providing Headquarters/field staff with information, webinars, and a quality initiative boot camp on the Quality Payment Program and MACRA requirements. Implemented and successfully completed the first year of a predictable, quarterly release schedule for the IHS electronic health records system software applications, to improve the efficiency of the development and release processes and to continuously de monstrate value for end- users. Realigned HIT software development contracts to improve on their efficiency and effectiveness, to move to a responsive, agile development process, and to leverage the benefits of performance-based contracting. Specifically, consolidated four legacy contracts under one prime contractor with an additional sub- contractor. This streamlines the acquisition of resources and administrative overhead and provides greater consistency for the implementation of organizational process improvements related to the software development life-cycle. Continued implementation of a VA -developed Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) solution, which is designed to prevent medication errors in healthcare settings and improve the quality and saf ety of medication administration, across the Indian health system. The CJ-95 overall goals of BCMA are to improve accuracy, prevent errors, and generate online records of medication administration. National Patient Information Reporting System Completed initial deployment of the new Integrated Data Collection System (IDCS), which will improve the quality, effectiveness, and utility of GPRA reporting. Supported quality improvement initiatives for the Great Plains Area. Implemented a new system to facilitate the improved Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting capabilities for the Urban Indian Health Program. UDS reporting is required performance reporting for HRSA -funded health centers. Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications In support of bandwidth modernization, implemented network circuit upgrades to provide additional bandwidth at over 50 IHS hospital and clinics to improve access to the HIT and administrative applications essential to support daily operations. Upgrades ensur e IHS is positioned to meet future bandwidth needs, simplifies the process to add bandwidth as growth is needed, and reduces costs. In support of the OMB Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI), implemented a high- density blade server environment and upgraded Storage Area Network to improve IHS Headquarters data center hosting capabilities of HIT, infrastructure and administrative applications. Cybersecurity The IHS Cybersecurity Program was selected as one of 50 organizations (and people within them) t o win a CSO Magazine's CS050 award for developing and implementing security initiatives that drive business value. The IHS was selected due to the quality of our cybersecurity program and security initiatives that demonstrate outstanding business value and thought leadership. IHS was recognized at the CSO50 Security Conference + Awards in May 2017, focusing on \"Aligning Proactive Security with Modern Threats,\" in Scottsdale, Arizona. Resources Health Information Technology Continued planning for the deployment of systems changes needed in support of the proposed Meaningful Use (MU) 3 initiative. Challenges to this initiative include diminution of the MU incentive funding, together with inflationary costs that will constrain the ability of the HIT investm ents to maintain current services or to enhance systems. Participated in the \"New Medicare Card\" project team to address impacted RPMS applications and provided information/outreach to IHS facilities to assist in preparing for the new Medicare Beneficiary Identifier. Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications Implemented a new Microsoft Active Directory domain to support secured centralized authentication of IHS HIT applications. CJ-96 Implemented the Information Technology Service Management (ITS M) project to consolidate and standardize ITSM governance, processes and tools. Engaged a contractor who has begun IT process data collection. Initiated work on the IHS Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) contract (GSA Networx replacement) to ensure all items on the Networx contract are transitioned smoothly to the EIS contract. The IHS is required to take on a much larger role with the EIS contract which requires cross- organization involvement and to enhance service options available on contract and lower overall costs. Continue to work through HHS Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) changes to provide segmentation between non- Federal networks and IHS through a TIC, control access to IHS network resources on an as-needed basis only, and have only IHS controlled networks on the IHS wide area network to create a defined network security boundary. Initiated an IT Access Control (ITAC) replacement project aimed at utilizing a commercial product to eliminate the overhead of maintaining an in-house appl ication, provide system integration for automation, add efficiency and enforce security standards, and ensure IHS meets requirements for IT security. Cybersecurity Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation efforts are underway to fortify the cybersecurity of computer networks and systems and provide a standard toolset across IHS and Government giving insight to network security and the IHS and Federal level. This aids IHS in identifying vulnerabilities rapidly, provides a common operational picture of network health/ integrity, allows comparison of cross- agency performance using common objective data, and reduces total costs for purchasing cybersecurity tools/ services through commodity of scale. Enterprise Patch Management efforts are ever present through depl oyment of critical Windows security patches to systems that remain unpatched the 1st Tuesday of the following month that the patch is released. This will secure IHS IT systems to the highest possible levels. Performed nine system security assessments resu lting in \"Authorizations to Operate.\" To comply with HHS policy, all weaknesses from security assessments are captured and reported to HHS on a monthly basis. Implemented a comprehensive \"Plan of Action and Milestones\" process. All weaknesses from previous assessments and audits are now formally tracked and updated. Quarterly reviews are now occurring which requires staff to provide remediation updates to their reported weaknesses. Capital Planning and Investment Control Effective implementation of the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) is critical for IHS to demonstrate good stewardship of the funding we have been entrusted with, and to enable IHS to effectively negotiate for increased funding necessary to continue to improve our capabilities a nd service delivery to all IHS customers. The HHS CIO delegated authority related to FITARA to the IHS CIO, who subsequently implemented the following IT resource acquisition process changes Agency -wide: CJ-97 o Implemented IT acquisition control reforms in the U nified Financial Accounting System to route all IT Category approvals through OIT to comply with FITARA governance requirements. o Established an enterprise-wide IT Approved Equipment List with examples and correct Object Class Codes. o Created IHS Enterpris e contracts to combine buying power to lower IHS operating costs, including mobile services, laptop/desktop, Apple iPad, and various software. Policies and Procedures Completed the following approved and published Indian Health Manual (IHM) issuances: o Part 8 Chapter 1, \"Chief Information Officer\" o Part 8, Chapter 17, \"Agency- Issued Mobile Devices Including Cellular Telephones, Smartphones, and Tablets\" o Part 8, Chapter 23, \"Resource and Patient Management System Network\" o Administrative Delegation #52, \"Security of Information Technology Systems\" o Administrative Delegation #54, \"Operating Division Chief Information Officer (CIO) Delegation of Authority, FY 2017\" Work is underway to develop the new Part 10, \"Cybersecurity,\" a major policy change that will improve the security posture of the Agency. Collaboration with Tribal health programs and other federal agencies is key to the success of the HIT Program. IHS works closely with the O NC, CMS, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , VA, and other federal entities on IT initiatives to ensure that the direction of its HIT systems are consistent with other federal agencies. In addition, IHS has routinely shared HIT artifacts (e.g., design and requirement documents, clinical quality logic, etc.) with both public and private organizations. IHS considers the RPMS suite , built on the shared technology with the Department of Veteran's A ffairs' VistA system, to be a public utility and collaboration with the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance (OSEHRA) will facilitate making the innovations and advances that IHS has made in HIT available to the broader public. Through continued mainten ance and enhancement of the IHS HIT suite, the agency Quality Framework initiatives has foundational data to gener ate baselines and adapt performance metrics. Some of this data has supported the recognition that the agency and patients are experiencing progressive health improvements in patient diabetic populations. Immediate Priorities and Challenges The IHS HIT P rogram continues to face increased demand for systems improvements and enhancements, rising costs , and increased IT security requirements driven in part by medical advances, and ever-growing and more complex requirements for health information technology capabilities. These requirements come from government and industry initiatives, program needs of health programs , and operational requests of I/T/U health care facilities. Virtually any new program initiative has information technology requirements for functionality, modality, data collection , and reporting which then must be added to a clinician's work flow and managed within th e HIT portfolio. CJ-98 The largest priority and challenge involves the IHS RPMS system and its dependency on the Veteran's Administration for software development . RPMS is impacted by the VA's recent announcement to adopt the Military Health System \"Genesis\" solution to replace their current legacy Health IT platform, VistA. This move will impact the IHS as the RPMS system is dependent on the VA's VistA system through shared software development. The IHS adopts software developed by the VA and adapts it for use in RPMS. Thus , the VA's decision means that a significant supplier of software source code that modernizes and supports RPMS will eventually decline over time. The IHS previously adopted the VA software with minimal funding expenditure in support of a similar but different agency missio n. The loss of the VA as a source of software code will raise the cost of continuing to use the RPMS system , and/or require IHS to procure commercial -off-the- shelf (COTS) replacements for RPMS In addition, CyberSecurity challenge include minimizing u nsecured systems and data to reduce the possibility of identity theft, risk to patient health data, system breaches and loss of business continuity in the event of a disaster . System breach or intrusion into an unsecure network puts patient data at risk and im pacts the IHS mission by delaying or halting patient care and harms IHS patients which may lead to a lack of trust in patient services. Human resource shortages and slow staff backfill contributes to challenges in keeping up with evolving technology and new Federal, Department and Agency projects/initiatives including FITARA Implementation . FUNDING 2019 President's Budget $182,149,000 TRIBAL SHARES H&HC (IT is funded out of H&HC) funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall H&HC budget line is reserved for federally inheren t functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 budget submission for Health Information Technology is $182,149,000, which is the same as the FY 2018 Annualized CR level. This funding will continue progress made in the past several years by keeping infrastructure costs as low as possible and maintaining a high level of productivity and commitment by both federal and contractor staff supporting the IHS-developed health information solutions. IHS uses open 1This represents the total cost of HIT within IHS federal programs. The majority is from Hospitals & Health Clinics budget line with a small amount from Direct Operations for federal personnel and travel. CJ-99 source tools where possible to minimize acquisition costs and is reducing use of more costly assisted acquisition providers such as the General Services Adm inistration. However, following the announcement by the V A, the IHS is considering the sustainability of the entire RPMS HIT platform. Efforts are underway to examine alternatives to replacing RPMS as the IHS HIT platform. The IHS must work through thorough analysis activities that result in informed decision making of any replacement option . Any change in the EHR platforms will impact the quality of direct patient care , increase cost recovery and promote continuous health improvements such as, expanded telehealth care services and predictive popul ation health analytics. These potential returns highlight the value of health IT and its impact on the agency mission.

The DHP is a service-oriented program providing basic dental services (e.g., diagnostic, emergency, preventive, and basic restorative care) , which represents approximately 90 percent of the dental services provi ded. In FY 2017, the dental program provided a total of 3,828,214 basic dental services. More complex rehabilitative care (e.g., root canals, crowns and bridges, dentures, and surgical extractions) is provided where resources allow and account for the additional 257,112 dental services provided in FY 2017. The DHP provided these services through 1,371,172 dental visits in FY 2017 in 404 dental programs in 35 stat es. The demand for dental treatment remains high due to the high incidence of dental caries in AI/AN children. Over 80 percent of AI/AN children ages 6-9 and 13-15 years suffer from dental caries, while less than 50 percent of the U.S. population in the same age cohort have experienced cavities.12 In addition to this disparity in prevalence, there is a significant disparity in severity of dental disease. AI/AN children ages 2 -5 years exhibit an average of four decayed teeth, while the same age group in the U.S. population averages one decayed tooth.3 A continuing emphasis on community oral health promotion/disease prevention is essential in order to address the current high prevalence, reduce the severity of oral disease and improve the oral health of A I/AN people. Prevention activities improve health and reduce the amount and cost of subsequent dental care. The DHP measures performance in part through the delivery of preventive services. The DHP maintains data and tracks three key program objectives: 1 Phipps KR, Ricks TL, Blahut P.

Across all age groups, AI/ANs suffer disproportionately from dental disease. When compared to other racial or ethnic groups, AI/AN children 2-5 years old have more than double the number of decayed teeth and overall dental caries experience as the next highest ethnic group, U.S. Hisp anics, and more than four times that of U.S. white children.4 In the 6- 9 year -old age group, 8 out of 10 AI/AN children have a history of dental caries compared with only 45 percent of the general U.S. population, and almost half of AI/AN children have untreated tooth decay compared to just 17 percent of the general U.S. population in this age group. 5 In the 13-15 year-old age group, eight out of 10 AI/AN dental clinic patients have a history of tooth decay, compared to just 44 percent in the general U.S. population, and almost five times as many 13-15 year- old AI/AN youth have untreated decay compared to the general U.S. population. 6 In adults, the disparity in disease is equally as pronounced. 64 percent of AI/AN adults 35 -49 years have untreated decay compared to just 27 percent of the general U.S. population, and across all other age groups studied (50-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75 and older), AI/AN adults have more than double the prevalence of untreat ed tooth decay as the general U.S. population. In addition, the rate of severe periodontal disease in AI/AN adults is almost double that of the general U.S. population. 7 PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHS Early Childhood Caries (ECC) Collaborative was a na tionwide initiative that was conducted from 2009 to 2017 and focused on preventing tooth decay in AI/AN children under the age of 71 months. Dental caries are the most common health problem in children, almost eight times more common than childhood asthma , and have significant consequences such as delayed speech development, more missed school days when children begin school, poor self- esteem, and a greater chance of tooth decay in permanent teeth.8 AI/AN children suffer disproport ionately from this disease, with more than double the number of decayed teeth as the next highest minority population, U.S. Hispanics, and more than 3 times the number of decayed teeth as U.S. White children. 9 The ECC Collaborative began with the goal of reducing dental caries in the AI/AN population through a coordinated, nationwide collaborative utilizing not only dental programs but also medical and community partners such as medical providers, public health nurses, community health representatives, pharmacists, and Head Start teachers. By the end of this initiative, the IHS had increased access to dental care for AI/A N children under 71 months by 7.9 percent and 4 Indian Health Service.

CJ-102 significantly increased prevention and early intervention efforts (sealants increased by 65.0 percent, the num ber of children receiving fluoride varnish increased by 68.2 percent, and the number of thera peutic fillings increased by 161 percent), resulting in a net decrease of dental caries prevalence from 54.9 percent in 2010 to 52.6 percent in 2014, and an even m ore dramatic decrease in dental caries experience from 33.4 percent to 27.1 percent in 1- 2 year -olds, one of the largest decreases in caries experience evident in dental literature over such a short time span .10 To support this initiative, the IHS conducted a nationwide surveillance of 1- 5 year -old AI/AN children through two coordinated efforts of 8,451 children in 20103 and 11,873 in 2014 - the largest oral health surveillance sample size ever of this age group in the AI/AN population.11 While the national initiative has since ended, the IHS DHP continues to promote evidence -based best practices in ECC primary and secondary prevention including early access to dental services, dental sealants in primary and permanent teeth, fluoride varnish applicat ions, and secondary prevention tactics such as interim therapeutic restorations and silver ion antimicrobials aimed at reducing the spread of dental caries once it has begun . In recent years, the DHP has utilized field dental programs in conjunction with its Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers (DSC) to achieve national performance objectives and IHS Area initiatives. The DSCs were designed and implemented in FY 1999 and FY 2000 to augment the dental public health infrastructure necessary to best meet the oral health needs of AI/AN communities. A new five -year cycle began September 15, 2015 with eight DSCs, three are funded by program awards and five are funded through grants. The primary purpose of a DSC is to provide technical support, traini ng, and assistance in clinical and preventive aspects of dental programs providing care to AI/AN communities. As a direct result of the advocacy efforts of the DSCs, the number of key preventive procedures has increased significantly in recent years. For example, the number of dental sealants placed per year has tripled in the last decade, and the number of patients receiving topical fluoride treatments has more than doubled in the last five years. In FY 2013, the DHP began tracking the coverage or prevalence of children and adolescents receiving sealants and topical fluoride, rather than simply counting procedures. These assessments allow improved comparisons with data from the U.S. population compiled by the Healthy People 2020 initiative. Congressional appropriations created initial funding for the DSCs in FYs 1999 and 2000. In the ensuing years, these DSCs had an immediate positive impact on the direct delivery of dental care in a number of ways: All centers advocated for an appropriate focus on the dental Government Performance and Results Act ( GPRA) performance objectives to increase specific clinical services. All centers provided continuing education opportunities to enhance the quality of care delivered. Several centers provided on -site clinical and community based program reviews to enhance the quality of care, assuring that field programs maintained a high level of expertise with respect to challenges such as infection control, preparing for accreditation and certification reviews, and patient scheduling practices aimed at maximizing access to care. 10 Ricks TL, Phipps KR, Bruerd BB.

CJ-103 Several centers provided an array of health education materials or designed materials customized to the specific needs of the IHS Areas they serve. These materials have increased the quality of IHS oral health education efforts throughout Indian Country. Several centers provided or arranged for direct clinical services that otherwise would not have been provided. The aggregate accomplishments of the DSCs have resulted in an increase in clinical preventive care, an increase in overall clinical services, and an enhancement of the quality of clinical and community based care delivered by the dental field programs. Access to dental services is a prerequisite to the control of oral disease in susceptible or high -risk populations. The access to care GPRA objective is currently aligned with Healthy People 2020 methodology as a percentage of patients who have visited the dentist within the previous 12 months. The access to care goal in FY 2017 was 29. 7 percent and the performance was 29.5 percent . While this measure was not met, it was a significant improvement from FY 2016 and represented the highest access rate in the IHS since dental access first began being measured in the 1990's . The dentist to population ratio in the IHS system continues to be very low when compared to the ratio in the U.S. private sector. This low dentist to population ratio and an increase in population growth in the AI/AN population will continue to present a challenge in achieving the access rate goal. The IHS has 1,023 dentists (including part -time) in our system, according to the IHS Dental Directory. 12 In 2017, there were 2,895,571 American Indian/Alaska Natives in the U.S., according to the most recent user population estimate.13 That means that in the IHS system we have approximately 1 dentist per 2,830 patients served. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were an estimated 153,500 dentists in the U.S. in 201614 serving a population of 325,719,178,15 meaning that there is approximately 1 dentist per 2,122 people served. Topical fluorides and dental sealants have been extensively researched and do cumented in the dental literature as safe and effective preventive interventions to reduce tooth decay. In FY 2013, the tracking of dental sealants and the tracking of patients receiving topical fluoride measures changed from simple counts of procedures o r patients to the percentage of children receiving either sealants or topical fluorides. New annual targets were set for these two objectives as of July 1, 2013. In FY 2017, 31.9 percent of 1-15 year -old children received topical fluoride, an increase of 0.8 percent from FY 2016 and surpassing the annual goal of 29.9 percent. In FY 2017, 18.5 percent of 2-15 year-old children received dental sealants, an increase of 0.4 percent from FY 2016 and surpassing the annual goal of 16.6 percent. The DHP continues to assess the care provided by its programs. Through an annual continuous surveillance program, the DHP monitors disease burden and progress across all age groups, a process that began in its current form in 2010 with a combination of community- based, school - based, and clinic -based surveillance methodologies. In 2017, the DHP surveyed AI/AN children 6-9 years of age, following up on surveillance conducted in 2011-2012. While this age group continues to suffer disproportionately from dental dise ase - 86 percent of 6 -9 year -old AI/AN children have tooth decay compared to 56 percent of the U.S. population and 6-9 year- old AI/AN 12 Indian Health Service, Department of Health and Hum an Services.

CJ-104 children had three times the rate of untreated decay as the U.S. white children - this survey showed, for the first time, a significant decrease in dental disease in this age group. Specifically, compared to a similar oral health survey conducted in 1999, AI/AN children 6- 9 years of age had a decrease of 5 percent in tooth decay overall and a 17 percent decrease in tooth decay in permanent teeth, while untreated decay dropped from 73 percent in 1999 to just 47 percent in 2017. These changes mark the most significant decline in dental disease ever measured on a national scale in the DHP. 16 The DHP has also made significant improvements in the way dental services are delivered. Through the implementation of an electronic dental record, over 90 percent of IHS and Tribal dental programs have been transformed to and electronic system that will improve the quality and delivery of d ental services. A second improvement was the release of 20 new dental clinic efficiency and effectiveness standards by which IHS and Tribal dental programs can measure clinical productivity, staffing ratios, and specific clinical efficiency indicators against national averages. A third way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through the development of new national protocols for the early screening and treatment of periodontal disease in adults. A fourth way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through ongoing support of long- term training (LTT) of general dentist to build the cadre of dental specialists in the IHS and Tribal dental programs. Dentists completing DHP- sponsored LTT to become specialist such as pediatric dentists, periodont ists, and endodontists have a service payback obligation to serve AI/AN patients. In the past 2 years, an Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon, an endodontist, and periodontist have returned from LTT to serve A I/AN patients. A fifth way the DHP is improving the del ivery of services is through the adoption of an integrated care model, specifically in promoting depression screenings by dental health providers through a collaboration with the IHS Behavioral Health Program. A final way the DHP continues to improve the delivery of services is through a sustained (20+ years) continuing dental education (CDE) program. The IHS CDE program provides American Dental Association Commission for Continuing Education Provider Recognition approved quality education with over 200 clinical and public health courses to IHS and Tribal dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, and dental public health leadership.

Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self- Determination compacts and contracts ; Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service ( IHS) Mental Health/Social Services (MH/SS) is a community -based clinical and preventive service program that provides ongoing vital outpatient mental health counseling and access to dual diagnosis services, mental health crisis response and triage, case management services, community -based prevention programming, and outreach and health education activities. The most common MH/SS program model is an outpatient service staffed by one or more mental health professionals providing individual, family, and group psychotherapeutic services and case management. After hour s emergency services are generally provided through local emergency departments and contracts with non-IHS hospitals and crisis centers. Inpatient services are generally purchased from non -IHS hospi tals or provided by state or county hospitals providing mental health services. Intermediate level services such as group homes, transitional living support, intensive case management, and related activities are typically offered through state and local r esources. Additionally, slightly more than one- half of the Tribes administer and deliver their own mental health programs. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Specific focus areas that meet the Agency's priority relating to People, Partnerships and Quality for the IHS MH/SS program are: Suicide Prevention : In 2015, the suicide rate for AI/AN adolescents and young adult ages 15 to 34 (19.5 per 100,000) was 1.5 times than the national average for that age group (12.9 per 100,000). [1] Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among all AI/AN across all ages. [1] Strategies to address behavioral health, alcohol, substance use disorder, and suicide prevention require comprehensive clinical strategies, and approaches. The IHS utilizes and promotes collaborati ons and partnerships with patients and their families, including Tribes and Tribal organizations, Urban Indian health programs, federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public and private organizations. The 2017 - 2022 National AI/AN Suicide Prevent ion Strategic Plan CJ-109 advances the 2012 National Suicide Strategic Plan with culturally relevant approaches and strategies specific for AI/AN communities.1 The IHS utilizes a suicide surveillance reporting tool to document incidents of suicide in a standardized and systematic fashion. The suicide surveillance tool captures data related to a specific incident of suicide, including date and location of act, method, contributing factors, and other useful epidemiological information to better understand the issue, identified risk factors and target resources appropriately. Zero Suicide Initiative: In FY 2015, IHS launched the Zero Suicide Initia tive in partnership with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an approach developed by the Education Developmental Center 's (EDC) Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) . Zero Suicide is a priority to transform health systems to significantly reduce suicides for those individuals under our care. The initiative include s educating healthcare providers on screening for suicide, conducting suicide risk assessments, and ensuring the infrastructure exists to support evidence- based suicide care. IHS contracted with EDC 's SPRC which held two AI/AN Zero Suicide Academies with 2 0 IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian organizations in attendance. In FY 2017, IHS received $3.6 million to fund pilot sites to implement the Zero Suicide model. IHS funded 8 IHS and Tribal sites to participate in its first cohort of the Zero Suicide Initiati ve. These projects will operate from November 15 to November 14 for a three year funding cycle, dependent on appropriations. Trauma -Informed Care : Developing and implementing a trauma informed care approach to address childhood trauma, including historical trauma, is necessary to comprehensively address the root causes of violence, suicide, depression, anxiety, self- harm, and chronic physical diseases. IHS has worked to implement the p rinciples of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and impact of trauma, facilitates healing, avoid s re-traumatization, and focus es on strength and resilience. In September 2016, the MH/SS and Improving Patient Care and the Johns Hopkins University partnered to develop a tribal specific Pediatric Integ rated Care Collaborative (PICC), a pilot project to increase the quality and accessibility of child trauma services by integrating behavior and physical health services in patient centered medical homes. T en PICC pilot sites attend ed in- person and virtual quality improvement learning collaborative sessions to receive tailored technical assistance to integrate trauma informed care into pediatric primary care. The goal of the pilot site project is to harvest lessons learned to apply for sc reening of trauma in the pediatric population, engaging families, and developing policy recommendations for the Indian health system . In FY 2018, IHS will onboard seven new sites who will work alongside the previous ten sites in a quality improvement model. Lessons learned from the PICC will be used by I HS to incorporate into a standalone trauma informed care policy in the Indian Health Manual. In 2016, IHS contracted with the University of New Mexico (UNM) to develop an online training curriculum relat ed to trauma and trauma -informed care tailored for IHS staff, clini cal staff, and supervisors. UNM adapted the Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) model to be culturally appropriate and for use in AI/AN communities. UNM provided 19 separate online 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Web -based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) [Online]. (2013, 2011) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC (producer). Available from http://www.cdc.gov/injury/ wisqars/index.html CJ-110 training s in 2017 with the goal of facilitating organizational change built around five core values: safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, and empowerment. Staff training focused on recognizing trauma and its impact, becoming trauma informed, treating trauma, and ensuring supervisors at all managerial levels understand the impact of trauma and historical trauma in employee performance, coworker relationships, and well-being. Behavioral Health Integration Initiative (BH2I) : IHS supports changing the paradigm of mental health and substance abuse disorder services from being episodic, fragmented, specialty, and/or disease focused t o incorporating it into the patient -centered medical home. The statistics facing AI/AN peoples for suicide, alcohol -related deaths, domestic a nd sexual violence, and homicide require the Indian health system to develop a system of comprehensive screening and effective intervention to reduce morbidity and early mortality. IHS launched an Improving Patient Care learning intensive focused on behavioral health integration wi th primary care. The intensive focus ed on the key areas of the B ehavioral Health Integration Initiative (B H2I): formalizing integration across the system, developing care teams, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing clinical processes. The goal was increased depression screening in primary care clinics through utilization of the Public Health Questionnaire (PHQ) ( PHQ -2 and PHQ-9). Despite setting the goal of improving screening rates, the learning intensive did not result in significant improvements. The seven participating teams reported progress in advancing their organizational strategy for behavioral health integration. IHS will plan to include additional measures that reflect organizational change for behavioral health integration outside of focusing solely on screening rates. In FY 2017, IHS received $6 million to launch its BH2I. In September 2017, IHS funded 12 IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian organizations to integrate behavioral health with primary care services in their local health facilities. Additionally, IHS contracted with a technical assistance provider to guide pilot project through the implementation of their integrated care work with expertise from psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and social workers. The contractor will also complete an evaluation of the BH2I to assist IHS in determining the impact o f BH2I. TeleBehavioral Health and Workforce Development : The IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) was established in 2009, utilizing funds from the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, to assess the feasibility of providing behavioral health services via televideo. Due to the rural nature of many IHS and Tribal facilities, our patients face many issues surrounding access to care, particularly specialty car e. Providers working in these remote areas often face barri ers in maintaining the required continuing education (CE) credit s required for licensure and up to date on current clinical guidelines . The TBHCE assists IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian healthcare providers and facilities in overcoming these challenges by providing a range of telebehavioral health services and training. There are 2 5 sites receiving direct care services through the TBHCE. These services include, adult counseling, child counseling, family counseling, trauma/P ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (P TSD ) counseling, child psychiatry, adult psychiatry, and addiction psychiatry. In FY 2017, the TBHCE provided more than 4051 hours of behavioral health services to over 8101 patients. Additionally, the TBHCE hosts a robust weekly schedule designed to meet the specific training needs of IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health care providers. In FY 2017, the TBHCE awarded 4336 hou rs of CE credits and over 8,900 hours of training during 118 online seminars.

Permanent Allocation Method ......... Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self- Determination contracts and compacts, Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Alcoholism, addiction, and alcohol and substance abuse are among the most severe public health and safety problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, families, and communities. The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is to raise the behavioral health status o f AI/AN communities to the highest possible level through a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services that are community- driven and culturally competent. The ASAP addresses the Agency's priorities of People, Partnerships, and Quality through these collaborative activities, and works to integrate substance abuse treatment into primary care. For instance, the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (SASP) (formerly known as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initi ative -MSPI ) provides community developed and delivered prevention and intervention resources to address the dual crises of methamphetamine and suicide in AI/AN communities. In general, AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately from substance abuse disorders compared with other racial groups in the United States. The age -adjusted AI/AN drug -related death rate is 4.1 deaths per 100,000 population for the three -year period 1979-1981, as compared to the AI/AN death rate of 22.7 in 2007-2009. This is an increase of 454 percent since drug-related death rates were first introduced for AI/AN populations in 1979. The 2007-2009 AI/AN rate is 1.8 times greater than the U.S. all races rate of 12.6 for 2008. 1 PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As alcohol and substance abuse treatment and prevention have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via Tribal contracting and compacting, IHS' role has transitioned to providing support to e nable communities to plan, develop, and implement 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service. Trends in Indian Health 2014 Edition. Released March 2015. ISSN 1095 -286 CJ-116 culturally informed programs. Organized to develop programs and program leadership, the major IHS ASAP activities and focus areas are: Integrated Substance Abuse Treatment in Primary Care : IHS continues to support the integration of substance abuse treatment into primary care and emergency services. Integrating treatment into health care offers immediate and same -day opportunities for health care providers to identify patients with substance use disorders, provide them with medical advice, help them understand the health risks and consequences, obtain substance abuse consultations, and refer patients with more severe substance use-related problems to treatment. 2 One integration activity is Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), which is an early intervention and treatment service for people with substance use disorders and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS is broadly promoting SBIRT as an integral par t of a sustainable , primary care- based , behavioral health program through reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). IHS has incorporated screening and SBIRT as national measures to be tracked and reported. IHS provides annual national training on SBIRT. G uidelines for clinical documentation in the electronic health record have also been instituted. Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) : MAT is an approach that uses Food and Drug Administration approved pharmacological treatments, often in combination with psychosocial treatments, for patients with opioid use disorders.3 In FY 2017, IHS provided two sessions for providers to be eligible for MAT waivers with a total of 18 physicians trained. Proper Opioid Prescriber T raining: IHS provide d four sessions of its mandatory five -hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. In FY 2017, IHS trained 96 percent of its workforce on proper opioid prescribing. IHS offers on demand training to capture new employees who require training, as well as refresher courses every three years. Pain and Opioid Use Disorder Case Consultation Services: To provide clinical support for providers, IHS launched weekly Pain and Addiction consultations, in partnership with the University of New Mexico. Healthcare providers receive a no -cost consultation from an expert panel. In F Y 2017, IHS offered 42 case consultation session on pain and addiction. Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) : YRTCs provide residential substance abuse and mental health treatment services to AI/AN youth. Congress authorized the establishment of these YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authorized for the California Area. The Sout hern California facility , Desert Sage, opened in FY 2017. The Alaska and Portland Area s divided their funds to provide residential treatment services for two programs. The second treatment facility for the Portland Area opened in October 2017. Indian Children's Program (formerly, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD )): Training and technical assistance on FASD is provided through the IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence ( TBHCE ) Indian Children Program (ICP). The focus of the ICP is traini ng clinicians on developmental and neurobiological issues that can affect AI/AN children, and providing expert consultation to help clinicians successfully diagnose, manage, and/or treat these conditions. A training series on FASD was offered in FY 2017 with nine webinars and eight expert case consultations. In FY 2018, IHS will offer a four hour course for community health workers on FASD and Autism Spectrum Disorder. 2 U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare.

CJ-117 Information Systems Supporting Behavioral Health Care : The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) includes functionality designed to meet the unique business processes of behavioral health ( BH) providers and support BH- related initiatives. Standardized instruments and clinical decision support tools ar e available to support routine and effective screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence and smoking status. Additionally, surveillance tools are available to capture suicide data at the point of care. Aggregate national RPMS be havioral health data is maintained to support local, national and other program reporting requirements as well as quality performance measurements for numerous screening and prevention initiatives including screening for alcohol and substance use, depressi on, domestic violence, smoking, and suicide data collection. Partnerships : IHS is collaborating with other agencies working in the field of substance disorders such as the Substance Abuse and Mentla Health Administration (SAMHSA) , Veterans Health Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration, Office of National Drug Control Policy, and CMS to ensure that the best available information, training s, protocols, evaluations, performance measures, data needs, and management skills are incorporat ed and shared with all agencies and organizations working on substance use disorders. The Department of the Interior (DOI) through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the IHS ha ve a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention, which was amended in 2011 as a result of the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Through this MOA, BIA, BIE, and IHS coordinate and implement plans in cooperation with Tribes to assist Tribal governments in their efforts to address behavioral health issues. The MOA includes coordination of data collection, resources, and programs of IHS, BIA, and BIE. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) requires interagency coordination and collaboration among HHS (IHS and SAMHSA), DOI (BIA/BIE), Department of Justice (Office of Justice Programs/Office of Tribal Justice), and the Office of the Attorney General. The co ordination of Federal efforts and resources will assist in determining both the scope of alcohol and substance abuse problems as well as effective prevention and treatment programs. The MOA required by Section 241 of the TLOA was signed on July 29, 2011 by the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services and the Interior and the Attorney General to: (1) determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse problems faced by Tribes; (2) identify and delineate the resources each entity can br ing to bear on the problem; (3) set standards for applying those resources to the problems; and (4) coordinate existing agency programs. In FY 2017, the IHS and BIA continued their formal partnership to reduce deaths from prescription drug and heroin overdoses by providing naloxone, a medication that reverses the effects of heroin or prescription opioid overdose and saves lives. ASA Grant and Federal Award Programs Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (SASP): The SASP, formerly known as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, is a nationally -coordinated $31.975 million program providing funds for culturally appropriate substance use and suicide prevention programming in AI/AN communities. The program funds 175 projects. The goals of SASP are to: 1) i ncrease IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) capacity to operate successful methamphetamine prevention, treatment, and aftercare and /or suicide prevention, CJ-118 intervention, and postvention services through implementing community and organizational needs assessment and strategic plans; 2) develop and foster data sharing systems among I/T/U behavioral health service providers to demonstrate efficacy and impact; 3) identify and address suicide ideations, at tempts, and contagions among AI/AN p opulations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies; 4) i dentify and address methamphetamine use among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, treatment, and aftercare strategies ; 5) i ncrease provider and community education on suicide and methamphetamine use by offering appropriate trainings; and 6)promote positive AI/AN youth development and family engagement through the implementation of early intervention strategies to reduce risk factors for suicidal behavior and substance use. SASP projects were awarded for funding in at least one of four purpose areas and work to a ddress the corresponding SASP goal listed above. SASP Purpose Areas are: 1) Community Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning; 2) Suicide Prevention, Intervention, and Postvention, 3) Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Aftercare, and 4) Generation I ndigenous (Gen- I) Support. In year 2, 99 percent of projects submitted progress reports as a requirement of funding. Year 2 evaluation information will be available in March 2018. Preventing Alcohol -Related Death s (PARD) : In September 2017, IHS funded one Tribe and a city government for a total of $2 million to participate in the PARD to implement alcohol detoxification services, including shelter services, for individuals with alcohol use disorders at risk for death. YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project: In December 2017, IHS utilized $1.8 million to implement a pilot project for aftercare services for Native youth discharged from residential substance use treatment. Two YRTCs are funded to develop approaches to aftercare, reco very, and other support services for Native youth that can be used across other IHS and tribal YRTCs. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount SASP $235,286 ,000 ($15,475,000) ($16,500,000) TRIBAL SHARES Alcohol and Substance Abuse funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A portion of the overall Alcohol and Substance Abuse budget line is reserved for federally inherent functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. CJ-119 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 budget submission for Alcohol & Substance Abuse of $235,286,000 is $18,416,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR level. FY 2018 Base Funding of $216,870,000 - This funding will maintain the program's progress in addressing alcohol and substance abuse needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele-behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services.

Direct Federal, PL 93-638 Tribal Contracts and Compacts, Commercial contracts, and Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Snyder Act provides the formal legislative authority for the expenditure of funds for the \"relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians.\"1 In 1934, Congress provided the specific authority to enter into medical services contracts for American Indians and Alaska Natives.2 These, among other authorities3 established the basis for the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program.4 The PRC Program is integral to providing comprehensive health care services to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The Indian health system delivers care through direct care services provided in an IHS, Tribal or Urban Indian Health Program (I/T/U) facility (e.g., hospitals, clinics) and through PRC services delivered by non-IHS providers. The general purpose of the PRC Program is for I/T/U facilities to purchase services from private health care providers in situations where: 1) No IHS or Tribal direct care facility exists, 2) The direct care element is not capable of providing required emergency an d/or specialty care, 3) The direct care element has an overflow of medical care workload, and 4) Full expenditure of alternate resources (e.g., Medicare, private insurance) has been met and supplemental funds are necessary to provide comprehensive care to eligible Indian people. 1 The Snyder Act, Public Law 67-85, November 2, 1921, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 13. 2 The Johnson O'Malley Act of April 16, 1934, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 452. 3 Transfer Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 1601, et seq. 4 The Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2014, Public Law 113-76, January 18, 2014, adopted a new name for the IHS Contract Health Services (CHS) program to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC). The IHS will administer PRC in accordance with all law applicable to CHS. CJ-123 In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements for direct services at an IHS or Tribal facility, PRC eligibility is determined based on residency within the service unit or Tribal PRC service delivery Area; authorization of payment for the each recommended medical service by a PRC authorizing official; medical necessity of the service and inclusion within the established Area IHS/Tribal medical/dental priorities; and full expenditure of all alternate resources (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, state or other health programs, etc.). Alternate resources must pay for services first because the IHS PRC Program is the payer of last resort.5 Services purchased may include hospital, specialty physician, outpatient, laboratory, dental, radiological, pharmaceutical, or transportation services. When funds are not sufficient to purchase the volume of PRC services needed by the eligible population residing in the PRC service delivery area of the local facility, IHS PRC regulations require I/T/U PRC programs to use a medical priority system to fund the most urgent referrals first. Medical priority (MP) levels of care are defined as follows: MP Level I: Emergent or Acutely Urgent Care Services are defined as threats to life, limb and senses MP Level II: Preventive Care Services are defined as primary health care that is aimed at the prevention of disease or disability. MP Level III: Specialty Services are considered ambulatory care which include inpatient and outpatient care services MP Level IV: Chronic Tertiary and Extended Care Services are defined as requiring rehabilitation services, skilled nursing facility care MP Level V: Excluded Services are services and p rocedures that are considered purely cosmetic in nature, i.e., plastic surgery A PRC rate, a capitated rate based on Medicare payment methodology, is used to purchase care, and Medicare participating hospitals are required to accept this rate as payment in full for all hospital -based health care services (Pub. L. 108-173). This allows IHS to purchase care at a lower cost than if each service were negotiated individually. Physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services are purchased at the PRC rate. However, agreements or contracts can be negotiated with individual providers of supplies or services using the provider's most favored customer rate as a ceiling for negotiation. Program funds are administered and managed at IHS Headquarters, at each of the 12 IHS Areas, and at IHS and Tribal facilities across the nation. The PRC Program also administers the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF). Created in 1988, the CHEF was established for the sole purpose of meeting extraordinary medical costs associated with treatment of victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses.6 The CHEF is used to reimburse PRC programs for high cost cases (e.g., burn victims, motor vehicle accidents, high risk obstetrics, cardiology, etc.) after a threshold payment amount of $25,000 is met. The CHEF is centrally managed at IHS Headquarters and is available to IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs annually on a first come basis. The PRC Program contracts with a fiscal intermediary (FI), currently Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico, to ensure payments are made in accordance with IHS' payment policy, and coordinate benefits with other payers to maximize PRC resources. All IHS-managed PRC programs and some Tribal ly-managed PRC programs use the FI to ensure the use of PRC rates 5 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621e, CJ-124 for inpatient services and PRC or negotiated rates for physician and non -hospital providers of supplies and services. PRC funding provides critical access to essential health care services and remains a top request by Tribes in the budget formulation recommendations. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Rates - On March 21, 2016, the IHS published in the Federal Register the Final Rule with comment period for Payment for Physician and Other Health Care Professional Services Purchased by Indian Health Programs and Medical Charges Associated with Non-Hospital Based Care. The Final Rule became effective on May 20, 2016, with an implementation date of March 21, 2017. The regulation is consistent with the recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO)7 and the HHS Office of Inspector General8 and could potentially achieve substantial PRC savings that may be used to expand IHS beneficiary access to care. The rates were originally referred to as Medicare -like rates (MLR) for hospital based services but are now identified as PRC rates based Medicare payment methodology for all hospital based services, physician and non -hospital providers of supplies and services. The Final Rule established payment rates that are consistent with all federal health care programs; aligns IHS provider payments with inpatient service rates; and enables the I/T/U health programs to expand beneficiary access to medical care. Changes to the rule include: an applicability provision to specify that the rule applies to I/T/Us but only to the extent the tribally - operated programs agree to \"opt-in\" via their ISDEAA contract or compact; a definition section including Notification of a Claim, Provider, Supplier, Referral and Repricing Agent; flexibility that allows PRC programs to negotiate rates that are higher than the PRC rate based on Medicare methodology, but equal to or less than the rates accepted by the provider or supplier's most favored customer; in the absence of Medi care payment methodology for a service, the IHS payment amount will be calculated at 65 percent of billed charges from the provider or supplier . Medical Priorities - Recent program funding increases have allowed some of the IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs to approve referrals in priority categories other than Medical Priority I (life or limb), including some preventive care services, thus increasing access to patient care services. In FY 2016, 70 percent of IHS-operated PRC programs were able to purchase services beyond Medical Priority I - Emergent or Acutely Urgent Care Services. Prior funding increases as well as increased third-party collections and Medicaid expansion ensure programs can purchase preventive care beyond emergency care services, such as mammograms or colonoscopies. The IHS PRC Workgroup helped IHS develop a more accurate form for reporting denied and deferred PRC services each year. In FY 2016, PRC denied and deferred an estimated $423,634,760 for an estimated 92,354 services for eligible AI/ANs. Because Tribally -managed programs are not required to report denials data, it is difficult to provide a verifiable and complete measure of the total unmet need for the entire system. Therefore, the denied services estimate is based on actual data from federal programs and estimated Tribal data. 7 Government Accountability Office, Indian Health Service: Capping Payment Rates for Nonhospital Services Could Save Millions of Dollars for Contract Health Services (April 2013) 8 Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, IHS Contract Health Services Program: Overpayments and Potential Savings (Sept. 2009). CJ-125 Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) - In FY 2017, all high cost cases submitted for reimbursement from the CHEF through mid -November were funded. It is estimated that more cases may qualify for CHEF reimbursement but were not reported by the local IHS and Tribally - managed PRC programs. Catastrophic case requests are reimbursed from the CHEF until funds are depleted. The implementation of PRC rates for inpatient and non -hospital providers of supplies and services as well as the increase of I/T/U beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare and Private Insurance ensures the CHEF is able to reimburse PRC programs for high cost catastrophic events and illnesses that occur through the end of the fiscal year. FUNDING HISTORY Funding History PRC CHEF Total FY $903,457,000 $51,500,000 $954,957,000 TRIBAL SHARES Purchased and Referred Care funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 budget submission for Purchased/Referred Care of $954,957,000 is $32,435,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR. The FY 2018 base funding will provide for the following approximate services: o 32,200 inpatient admissions o 742,100 outpatient visits o 41,400 patient travel trips The FY 2019 funding increase of $32,435,000 would provide the following additional estimated services: o 1,076 Inpatient admissions o 24,824 Outpatient visits o 1,386 Patient travel trips FY 2019 Funding Increase of $32,435,000 includes: Current Services +$22,464,000 for current services includes: Inflation +$22,464,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Staffing for New Facilities +$3,662,000 - to fund one healthcare facility that is planned to open in FY 201 8. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. Additional PRC is included in the request to address the additional PRC need resulting from replacing an inpatient facility with an outpatient facility. The following table displays this request. CJ-126 New Facilities Amount FTE Fort Yuma Health Center (Replacement), Winterhaven, CA $3,662,000 0 Clinical Services +$6,308,000 for Purchased and Referred Care costs. Performance Impact Since 2011, the GAO has published four reports on the PRC program.9 The IHS PRC Workgroup has reviewed the recommendations and the Agency is implementing a majority of the GAO recommendations, including the capitated rate rule described above and many programmatic and policy improvements. In addition, the program has identified several risk categories and is working to ensure proper policies and procedures are in place to maintain programmatic consistency across all Areas. These ongoing activities continue to be monitored by PRC staff at the IHS Area office and Headquarters level. In its 14-57 GAO report, the GAO recommended the PRC program to change the IHS GPRA measure into two measures by modifying the IHS's claims data system to track: (1) by an established timeframe for payment specific to authorized IHS referrals10 (2) by an established timeframe for payment specific to authorized self referrals11 In the FY 2018 Budget, IHS adopted the GAO recommendation in recognition of the differences in payment processes for these two types of authorized referrals using CY 2017 data for a baseline. : The number of days to medical claims payment is based on medical industry standards for a Preferred Provider Organization, such as Kaiser Permanente, the average days to medical claims payment is as follows: OUTPUTS / OUTCOMES Measure Year and Most Recent Result / Target for Recent Result / (Summary of Result) FY 2018 Target FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Target +/-FY 2018 Target PRC -2 Track IHS PRC referrals (Outcome) FY 2017: 69.0 days Target: 60.0 days (Target Not Met) 60.0 days 60.0 days Maintain PRC -3 Track PRC self-referrals (Outcome) FY 2017: 61.0 days Target: 45.0 days (Target Met) 45.0 days 45.0 days Maintain GRANT AWARDS .

The PHN Program provides quality, culturally sensitive health promotion and disease prevention nursing care services through primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services to individuals, families, and community groups: Primary prevention interventions aim to prevent disease and include such services as health education/behavioral counseling for health promotion, risk reduction, and immunizations. Secondary prevention interventions detect and treat problems in their early stages. Examples include health screening of high -risk populations, screening for diabetes and hype rtension, fall risk assessments, and school health assessments. Tertiary prevention interventions prevent or limit complications and disability in persons with an existing disease. The goal of tertiary prevention is to prevent the progression and complications associated with chronic and acute illness by providing optimal care for the patient. Examples include chronic disease case management, self -management education, medication management, and care coordination. PHNs support population- focused services t o promote healthier communities through community based direct nursing services, community development, and health promotion and dis ease prevention activities. PHNs are licensed, professional nursing staff available to improve care transitions by providing patients with tools and support that promote knowledge and self-management of their condition as they transition from the hospital to home. The PHN expertise in communicable disease assessment, outreach, investigation, and, surveillance helps to manage and prevent the spread of communicable diseases. PHNs contribute to several agency's primary prevention efforts such as providing community immunization clinics , administering immunizations to homebound American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), and t hrough public health education, inspiring AI/AN people to engage in healthy lifestyles and ultimately live longer lives. CJ-130 PHNs conduct home visiting services for: Maternal and pediatric populations, including childhood obesity prevention through breastfeeding promotion, screening for early identification of developmental problems, and parenting education; Elder care services including safety and health maintenance care; Chronic disease care management; and Communicable disease investigation and treatment. PHNs perform a community assessment to identify high-risk populations and implement evidenced based interventions to address identified areas . This activity targets fragmentation in services and improves care continuums , including patient safety , and patient services. Interventions are monitored with data collection and evaluated for outcome with an emphasis on producing a good return on investments in terms of service provided. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The PHN Program aligns with the Agency's priorities and contributes to patient care coordinati on activities and access to quality, culturally competent care that aims to promote health and quality of life through a community populations focused nurse visiting program which serves the patient and family in the home and in the community. The PHN Program assesses the care provided in meeting the agency's priority Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measures and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to strengthen the economic and social well -being of Americans across the lifespan. GPRA reporting begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. PHN Data Mart reports for GPRA year 2017 reflect a total number of individual PHN patient related encounters was 362,358; and, some of the PHNs accomplishments in GPRA screening activities include the following encounter numbers : Tobacco Screening (7,812) Depression Screening (10,280) Domestic Violence Screening Alcohol Screening ( 11,262) (9,625) Adult Influenza Vaccines ( 19,081) In 2017, the PHN Program sustained efforts to support the IHS' goal to decrease childhood obesity and prevent diabetes by supporting Baby Friendly designation by accomplishing the following activities: providing patient education, assessment and referral services for prenatal , postpartum and newborn clients during home visits , and utilizing a standardized PHN electronic health record template to document intervention . To assess how the PHN program delivers services, PHN data mart provides a mechanism to evaluate this evidence- based prevention service of promoting breastfeeding during the nurse home visit. For GPRA year 2017 , there were a total of 12,895 PHN patients encounters related to this initiative with documented 38,032 patient education on breastfeeding provided during prenatal, postpartum and newborn encounters by the PHN. The PHN documented provided the IHS established a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the University of Tennessee to begin the implementation of the Resource to Enhance All Caregivers Health (REACH) program , an evidenced-based program that provides a structured intervention to support caregivers of individuals suffering from dementia. CJ-131 Caregivers supported by the REACH -VA program show improvement in depression, the effect of depression on daily life, and caregiver burden and frustration. In 2015-2016, PHN training, certification and support from the VA and University of Tennessee was provided in the Navajo , Phoenix, Albuquerque, Billings, California, Bemidji, Nashville, and Oklahoma A reas. For GRPA year 201 7, there have been 5,464 PHN encounters to patients with dementia. Services provided at these PHN encounters include the following: Immunizations ( 950) Life adaptation ( 312) Medications ( 955) Safety and fall prevention ( 635) The overall goal to implement this service in 50 tribal communities by 2018 was met in December 2017, as this service is currently available in 52 communities. Efforts to adapt this intervention to deliver and sustain the program in AI/AN communities is ong oing. Addressing behavioral health issues, in 2016, the Pine Ridge PHN Mental Health Case Management Program was established to focus on suicide prevention in the local community. This intervention will improve health outcomes of high risk patients through a community case management model that utilizes the PHN as a case manager. In FY 2017-2018, the program will continue billing for this service as a means of leveraging revenue to expand the services in the community, include data collection reports on the PHN Data Mart to report outcome, and in FY 2018 collaborate and replicate this service at the Standing Rock Service PHN Program . In FY 2018, this service will be shared as a best practice as a resource for the PHN grant program for tribal and urban grant recipients. PHNs provide support services for improving quality care and safety of patients during transitions across care settings by follow up on hospital discharges in an effort to decrease hospital readmissions; in 2017 GPRA year, PHNs had : 65,554 patient encounters with patients who were discharged from the hospital and provided a total of 12,330 follow -up visits; some of these patients had multiple post discharge follow -up visits . Top patient education topics provided during these encounters include immunizations, lifestyle adaptation and medication. In support of the Million Hearts campaign to prevent heart attacks and strokes, PHNs provided 34,838 patient encounters that encompass ed patient education on tobacco cessation at 4,230, hypertension at 27,218 and sodium reduction at 3,390. Additional education provided during these PHN encounters include tobacco use, immunizations, diabetes, and medications. In FY 2016, the PHN program began a review of the delivery service for safe and quality service standards of various accrediting bodies to develop recommendations for the public health nursing program. This activity included coordinating with the Joint Commission agen cy to define the PHN services as an integrated IHS service for review and host ed the first webinar for PHN to share practices on safe and quality care with a focus on the A ccreditation A ssociation for Ambulatory H ealth Care survey. This activity will con tinue into FY 2018, helping to ensure that quality PHN services are provided in a safe manner. In 2018-2019, as the primary care system is foundational to achieving high- quality, accessible, efficient health care for AI/AN clients, expanded PHN engagement will be made to support the patient centered medical home efforts as a promising model for transforming the delivery of primary care. In 2018, the PHN program will align prevention services to target sexually transmitted infections to improve quality by implementing evidence- based practices and PHN data mart decision -support tools as performance measurement and improve ment as a means of practicing population health management. Data and improvement activities will be shared publicly as PHN Program's commitment to quality. CJ-132 In FY 2017, the PHN grant program awarded 9 grants; these awards have a narrow and defined area of focus, seeking to improve specific behavioral health outcomes and to support the efforts of AI/AN communities toward achieving excellence in holistic behavioral health treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention services for individuals and their families . The purpose of this IHS PHN grant is to improve specific behavioral health outcomes through a case management model with the PHN as a case manager. Case management involves the client, family, and other members of the health care team. In addition to r educing the cost of health care, case management has worth in terms of improving rehabilitation, improving quality of life, increasing client satisfaction and compliance by promoting client self-determination. The community based case management model add resses the PHN scope of practice of working with individuals and families in a population -based practice to provide nursing care services in the community setting. Pine Ridge PHN Program initiated a similar PHN Case Management Program in 2016 and serves as a best practice for replication. The program has data to reflect increased home visits for behavioral health follow up and increased coordination and collaboration with the local Behavioral Health Department. The FY 2017 target for the PHN Program measure was 381,314 encounters. The final result of 362,358 encounters did not meet the target by 18,956 encounters, a 4.9 percentage decrease. Data exporting processes ha ve impacted the overall PHN performance outcome as sever al tribal programs have migrated away from the IHS Patient Management System (RPMS) resulting in less visits being exported to the agency's National Data Warehouse database. The end result has been a decrease in the number of PHN activities being reported. In FY 2018, additional PHN data briefs will be created and posted on the PHN data mart to reflect the PHN activity in meeting several Agency goals (such as decreasing STI rates, childhood immunizations) and to supplement the PHN program 's accomplishment s report . These reports provide an avenue to monitor the PHN program's support of the health care delivery services in the community. In FY 2018 the PHN Documentation Manual will be updated to include PHN electronic health record templates and include information on the PHN data mart reports to improve reporting of outcome.

The program focus es on the importance of educating patients in a manner that empo wers them to make better choices in their lifestyles and how they utilize health services. Accreditation requirements at IHS and tribal facilities specifically require the provision and documentation of patient education as evidence of the delivery of quality care. At a national level, the Health Education Program ass ists in developing policy, planning health education programs, setting priorities that impact meeting and monitoring \"Healthy People 2020,\" and complying with the National Health Education Standards. The Health Education Program has support ed the IHS' performance goals through the measures: number of visits with Health/Patient Education, and proportion of tobacco-using patients that receive to bacco cessation intervention. The Health Education Program documented 3,831,812 patient visits with patient education provided in FY 2016 . In FY 2017, there was a decline of 6.85 percent or 262,642 patient visits from the previous year; s taffing shortages significantly impacted provision of patient services, which was demonstrated in the decrease in documented patient education encounters for FY 2017. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS In FY 2017, the National Patient Education Committee (NPEC) identified commonly used ICD-10 codes for health education. The Indian Health Service NPEC will ultimately phas e out the current system and focus on protocols/guides for a well -defined and specific subset within the Resource Patient Management System . NPEC will also formalize an education data mart to provide reports for commonly used health education codes using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms (SNOMED -CT). The Health Education Program maintains data tracking of key program objective s. Tracked data includes educational encounters, the number of CJ-136 patients who received patient education services, provider credentials of who delivered the patient education, site location where patient education was provided, health information provided, amount of time spent on providing patient health education, patient understanding, and behavior goals . The Health Education program funded the following activities in FY 2017: Assessing care through collaborate efforts with clinical staff at health fairs and in the clinic -conducted patient needs assessments and patient satisfaction surveys, reviewed data stored in the National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS)/National Data Warehouse (NDW) to target top diagnosis areas. Analyzing patient satisfaction surveys/needs assessments and collaborating with Improving Patient Care team s to target areas of patient concern. Addressing behavioral health issues by assisting Tribes, health boards, and States in Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys (BRFSS), providing health education in schools by addressing \"bullying\" and using the \"Courage 2 Care\" curriculum as well as, providing physical education classes and opportunities, implemen ting the Basic Tobacco Intervention Skills for Native Communities curriculum to increase smoking cessation efforts to Tribal, Indian Health Service and Urban Indian clinics and communities. Strengthening m anagement by providing training to staff to increas e patient education and documentation of education provided through the Basic Tobacco Intervention Skills for Native Communities to increase commercial tobacco cessation documentation. Educating patients on the \"medical home model\" and preventable chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, and training staff on tobacco cessation , sexually transmitted diseases/infections, and methamphetamine/prescription drug abuse. Collaborating with Tribes, health boards, universities, county, state and national organizations to increase patient education in the community. Partnerships include the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society, University of Arizona's HealthCare Partnership, and Bureau of Indian Education. Efforts include increasing immunizations, and providing and improving Human Papilloma Virus education and immunization.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts, Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Community Health Representatives (CHRs) program began in 1968 and was established to meet the following four goals: (1) greater involvement of A I/AN people in their own health and in the identification and treatment of their health problems; (2) greater understanding between AI/AN people and IHS staff; (3) improving cross- cultural communication between the Indian community and health service providers; and, (4) increas ing basic health care and instruction in AI/AN homes and communities. Today, CHRs play a role in the health care delivery system to link the patient to the Indian health care system and are intended to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions and emergency department visits through home visits to patients with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes , and hypertension. The aim of the CHR Program is to help AI/AN patients and communities achieve an optimal state of well -being by providing health promotion and disease prevention, wellness and injury prevention education, translation and interpretation, transportation to medical appointments, and delivery of medical supplies and equipment within their tribal community. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As CHR programs have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via Tribal contracting and compacting, IHS's role has transitioned to providing support f or training CHRs and providing technical assistance to expand and enhance culturally -informed programs. Final FY 2017 results for CHR patient contacts and CHR patient contacts for chronic diseases will be available in March 2018. The FY 2017 training target for CHRs was exceeded. IHS trained 724 CHRs to equip them with skills to provide early intervention home visits for pregnant mothers and new parents through a program called Family Spirit, an evidence -based, culturally tailored, home -visiting CJ-139 program shown to promote optimal health and wellbeing of parents and their children. The program is the first to demonstrate efficacy of paraprofessionals and is uniquely tailored to address the behavioral health disparities, including increasing parental knowledge and involvement; decreased maternal depression; increased home safety; decreased emotional and behavioral problems of mothers; and decreased emotional and behavioral problems of children. With serious mental illness as one of the top three clinical priorities for the Department of Health and Human Services, IHS offered six Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) courses across the Nation. IHS trained more than 100 CHRs in MHFA with the goal that paraprofessionals are able to hel p indivi duals during a mental health crisis and learn skills to assist with access to care with anxiety, depression, psychosis, and addictions with competencies in knowing how to help individuals access care before they begin to experience negative outcomes.

Permanent Allocation Method .......................................................... Self-Governance Compact , Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Hepatitis B Program - The Hepatitis B Program was initiated in 1983 because of the need to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infections among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. It continues to provide this service in addition to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and the medical management of persons with hepatitis and liver disease. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The Hib Program started in 1989 with a targeted Haemophilus Influenzae type b prevention project in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta and now maintains high vaccine coverage by providing resources, training, and coordination to Tribal facilities throughout Alaska. Regular meetings are held with regional Immunization Coordinators, Clinical Directors, Community Health Aide Prog ram, IHS Immunization Coordinators, and the State of Alaska Immunization Program. The Program works with Tribal public relations to address parental immunization hesitancy and highlight the importance of vaccines. The Hepatitis B Program and the Hib Pr ogram of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, in collaboration with Alaska Tribal Health Care System partners, provide s clinical expertise and consultation, trainings, research, evaluation and surveillance with the goal to reduce the occurrence of i nfectious disease and improve access to healthcare in the Alaska Native population. The programs support immunization, patient screening, development of electronic health record reminders and systems, providing an infrastructure to maintain high immunization coverage, and high clinical management coverage of hepatitis B and C in Alaska Natives. The programs' activities support the IHS priorit ies on quality and partnerships. CJ-142 PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Immunization Alaska program has several performance measures to monitor progress in achieving the goal of high vaccine coverage for Alaska Natives as described below . Hepatitis B Program The Hepatitis B program continues to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infection among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. The program evaluates hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination coverage of Alaska Natives, and the total number of Alaska Native patients targeted for screening and the total number of patients screened for hepatitis B and hepatitis C as well as other liver disease that disproportionately affect the Alaska Native population. In FY 2017: Hepatitis A vaccination coverage met its target, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage exceeded the target. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was 90 percent (90 percent target) and hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 9 5 percent (90 percent target). At least 71 percent of AI/ANs with chronic hepatitis B (66 percent ) or C (74 percent ) infection were screened for liver cancer and for liver aminotransferase levels. The program maintains its practice of encouraging hepatitis patients to have regular, bi - annual screening. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program The Hib program continues to provide resources, training and coordination to T ribes in Alaska to maintain high vaccine coverage among Alaska Natives. Vaccine coverage data is collected for each Tribal region and measured in collaboration with local T ribal immunization coordinators. Consultation for the varying electronic health record systems within each Tribal health organization is provided to improve vaccine coverage for all T ribes. Statewide Alaska Native immunization coverage rates are reported to IHS Headquarters for infa nts 3 -27 months, 19- 35 months, adolescents, and older adults and flu vaccine immunization rates are reported for all ages. During FY 2017: Immunization Coverage for Alaska Native 19 -35 month olds was 72 percent, which is approaching the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80 percent for child vaccine coverage with 4:3:1:3* :3:1:4 series (4 DTaP, 3 IPV, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 Hep B, 1 Var, 4 PCV). Achieved 89 percent coverage with full series Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccine in 19-35 mont h olds, which is much higher than the US all- races 201 6 rate of 8 1 percent. An updated measure, Tdap vaccine coverage in all patients 19 years and older who had received Tdap within the past 10 years, achieved 80 percent in 2017. The previous measure tracked Tdap vaccine coverage in 19 -64 year olds , reflected 83 percent coverage in 2015, and 86 percent coverage in 2016. Achieved 91 percent pneumococcal vaccine coverage in patients 65 years and older who received pneumococcal vaccine in the past ever. Assisted tribal facilities throughout the Alaska Area in implementing new State po licy and procedures associated with vaccine inventory management, delivery systems, and documentation. CJ-143 Assisted Tribal facilities using the RPMS immunization package or new Electronic Health Records (EHR) in maintaining their interface to share vaccine records with the Alaska State Immunization Information System (SIIS). o Provided consultation with numerous facilities who implement ed new EHRs on immunization documentation and helped facilitate SIIS interface implementation. A summary of immunization res ults is included below: Immunization Measure Age Group Alaska Native coverage as of 4:3:1:3 *:3:1:4 19-35 months 19 years and older 80% IHS vaccination rates compare favorably with overall National vaccination rates. The CDC conducts National Immunizations Sur veys which allows self-reporting of vaccines. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vaxview/index.html The program continues to maintain collaborat ions with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in networking with IHS , State, and T ribal agencies to provide technical assistance regarding EH Rs. Challenges include the diversity of EHRs employed by Tribal agencies that may result in a temporary loss or delay of Area-wide reporting of immunization coverage. Regular r eporting of immunizations is critical in assuring follow- up with facilities experiencing vaccination administration issues. This will continue to be addressed through coordinated efforts by the Hib program, IHS , State, and Tribes. Vaccine and immunization coverage are measured as well as consults provided to Tribal partners.

BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 budget submission for Alaska Immunization of $1,950,000 is $85,000,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR level . FY 2019 Funding Increase of $8,000 includes: Current Services : +$85,000 for current services including: CJ-144 o Pay Costs +$37,000 - to fund pay increases for Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o Inflation +$48,000 - to cover inflationary costs of providing immunization services in Alaska. The FY 2019 funding will provide coordination of vaccine coverage reporting for Tribal facilities, training of Tribal immunization coordinators, and clinic staff in vaccine recommendations and documentation, consultation in the migration to EHRs, and regular notification to hepatitis patients of the need to complete liver function screenings so that program clinicians can identify serious liver disease or liver cancer when it is at an early and treatable stage. Hepatitis B Program - The program will conduct three days of outpatient clinics at the Alaska Native Medical Center, travel to regional health centers to conduct outpatient clinics , and will continue its web-based application for video -conferencing (Adobe Connect) that is accessible to the statewide Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) audience to provide relevant clinical information to assist in the care and management of hepatitis and live r disease patients. Annual field clinics will be conducted across Alaska to provide direct patient care, clinical updates to ATHS staff, and to recruit and conduct follow -up on participants enrolled in the program's research studies. Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccine coverage for Alaska Natives will be measured. In addition, the total number of Alaska Native patients targeted and screened will be measured for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other liver disease that affects Alaska Natives. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The budget request will allo w staff to provide support to regional Tribal programs on-site and for many partner location s, including rural and isolated location s, as well as limited printing of media materials. Funding of these activities allows maintenance of current program support of Alaska Tribal immunization activities, statewide and national immunization advocacy and technical support, and Area reporting to IHS Headquarters. Statewide Alaska Native immunization coverage rates a re reported to IHS Headquarters for infants 3-27 months, 19-35 months, adolescents, older adults , and flu vaccine immunization rates for all ages. In addition, the number of consultations and trainings offered to tribal facilities is also reported.

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2019 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation Method ...................... Formula Contracts and Competitive Formula Grants awarded to Urban Indian Organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Urban Indian Health Programs (OUIHP) was established in 1976 to make health care services more accessible to Urban Indians . The Indian Health Service ( IHS) enters into limited, competing contracts and grants with 34 urban Indian 501(c)(3) non- profit organizations to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians throughout the United States. Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) define their scope of work and services based upon the service population, health status, and documented unmet needs of the Urban Indian community they serve. Each UIO is governed by a Board of Directors that must be made up of at least 51 percent Urban Indians . UIO s provide unique access to culturally appropriate and quality health care for Urban Indians. UIOs provide health care services for approximately 54,500 Urban Indians who do not have access to the resources offered through IHS or tribally operated health care facilities because they do not live on or near a reservation. UIO health pr ogram sizes and services vary from full and limited ambulatory care, outreach and refer ral, and residential substance abuse treatment programs , as follows: o Full Ambulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for 40 or more hours per week. o Limited Ambulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for less than 40 hours per week. o Outreach and R eferral : Programs provid ing case management of behavioral health counseling and education services, health promotion/disease prevention education, and immunizatio n counseling but no t direct medical care services. o Residential Substance Abuse Treatment : Programs providing residential substance abuse treatment, recovery, and prevention services. In addition to the above 34 UIOs funded through contracts and grants, the other major Urban Indian Health focus areas and activities are: CJ-147 o Former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Programs: IHS is beginning the transfer of administrative oversight of the former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs (former- NIAAA programs) that receive an award from IHS and are confirmed to be a UIO as defined by the IHCIA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(29) from the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) to the OUIHP. IHS has identified seven (7) former-NIAAA programs for potential transfer. IHS ' transition of management of the current award funds and the transfer of funds from the ASAP to the OUIHP will fully implement the transfer authorized by IHCIA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660c - Urban NIAAA transferred programs. o Urban Indian Education and Research Organization Cooperative Agreement: Provides national education and research services for UIO s and OUIHP through a cooperative agreement. o Oklahoma City Indian Clinic and Indian Health Care Resource Center of Tulsa: These two urban sites were initially demonstration projects . They are now permanent programs within the IHS' direct care program funded as IHS Service Units; and must continue to qualify as a UIO under the IHCIA definition. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660b. o Albuquerque Indian Dental Clinic: Provide s dental services through the Albuquerque Area IHS Dental Program. UIOs are evaluated in accordance with the IHCIA requirements . The program is administered by OUIHP at IHS Headquarters. OUIHP integrates Enterprise Risk Management by annually reviewing UIO progress with set goals and objectives. The IHS Urban Indian Organization On- Site Review Manual is used by the IHS Area Urban C oordinators to conduct annual onsite reviews of the IHS funded UIO s to monitor compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation contractual requirements that are established through legislation . The results are submitted to OUIHP for review and follow -up to ensure that corrective action plans are successfully completed prior to continuation of funding. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS IHS released a plan to guide, support, and improve access to high quality health care services for Urban Indians. The OUIHP 2017-2021 Strategic Plan supports health care solutions that fit the diverse circumstances of Urban Indians and their communities. UIOs fulfill IHS data reporting requirements including the IHS Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) report and the Diabetes Non -Clinical Audit report. UIOs currently participate in the IHS Improving Patient Care (IPC) Initiative and are now in the Quality and Innovation Learning Network (QILN) implementing what they have learned across a wider variety of clinical and administrative options. From July 1, 201 6 to June 30, 2017 the UIO 2017 GPRA cycle accomplishments included: 97 percent of the UIOs reported on 20 of the 20 performance measures, 20 UIO s reported through the Clinical Reporting System (CRS), 11 UIO s reported using 100 percent review of appropriate data source (as opposed to sampling a smaller percentage of records), and In FY 2017, UIO improved performance on 7 of the GPRA measures with comparable FY 2017 data . The IHS will proceed with plans to have UIOs export data to the IHS data center and assist with the National Patient Reporting System (NPIRS) staff to compare data for the budget formulation for Urban programs. OUIHP with the assistance of the Office of Information T echnology, will CJ-148 continue to provide training and technical assistance to urban programs on accurate and uniform data collection, so as to achieve standardization throughout the system. The IHS has completed development of the Integrated Data Collection System (IDCS). During FY 2018, IHS will evaluate and validate the new performance data mart which contains urban program data submitted to the National Data Warehouse. As the urban program data mart matures, the expectation is to produce all reports from the NPIRS environment to automate and alleviate, where possible, manual data collection and reporting efforts. The goal is to have a consolidated, centralized, and integrated data stored that enables 'on -demand' reporting to support the management and monitoring of key performance measures. The plan is to report performance data from the data mart in FY 2018. With the addition of UIO data, the IHS will report aggregated results in FY 2018 from federal, trib al and urban sites. Currently, aggregated performance results include only federal and tribal sites.

Permanent Allocation Method ................................................................. Direct Federal , Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) P.L. 94-437, as amended , authorizes the Indian Health Service (IHS) Scholarship program, Loan Repayment program (LRP) , health professions training related grants, and recruitment and retention activities. The IHS made its first scholarship program awards in 1978 when Congress appropriated funds for the Indian Health Professions ( IHP) program. The IHP programs work synergistically to recruit and retain health professionals to provide high- quality primary care and clinical preventive services to American Indian s and Alaska Native s (AI/AN). The IHP programs also work with IHS, Tribal facilities and Urban Indian organizations (I/T/U) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase the number of sites eligible to participate as National Health Service Corps (NHSC) approved sites for the NHSC Scholarship program and L RP. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHP program has seen much success throughout the years including, but not limited to, the following: Enabling AI/ANs to enter the health care professions through a carefully designed system of preparatory, professional, and continuing educational assistance programs. Serving as a catalyst in developing AI/AN communities by providing educational opportuni ties for AI/ANs to become health care professionals and return to their local communities to provide health care. Developing and maintaining American Indian psychology career recruitment programs as a means of encouraging AI/ANs to enter the mental health field. Assisting AI/AN health programs to recruit and retain qualified health professionals. While the IHP programs have seen successes, we continue to strive to improve our performance and identify areas of risk. Placement of new scholars within 90 day s of completing their training CJ-152 continues to be a challenge. The use of online manuals, e- Newsletters, emails, and referral of graduates to recruiters have all been used to facilitate the 90 day scholar placement . In FY 2017, 38 percent of scholars had a hire letter within 90 days (target was 78 percent ). Failure to meet this goal was primarily due to nursing scholars not completing their licensing boards and finding positions within the 90 day period. The Scholarship program continues to look for new wa ys to assist our scholars in meeting this requirement. Assuring scholars and loan repayment recipients meet their service obligation is another critical component of the IHP programs. Annual employment verification through personnel rosters and certification by Tribal employers assist in this process. Scholarship program and L RP databases allow staff to identify when health professionals are expected to complete their service obligation and allow for timely follow-up. Loan Repayment Program (Section 108) : The L RP is an invaluable tool for recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals by offering health care professionals the opportunity to reduce their student loan debts through service to Indian health programs with critical staffing needs. Applicants agree to serve two years at an Indian health program in exchange for up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an additional $5,000 per year to offset tax liability. Loan repayment recipients can extend their initial two -year cont ract on an annual basis until their original approved educational loan debt is paid. In FY 2017, a total of 1,267 health professionals were receiving IHS loan repayment. This included 434 new two -year contracts, 396 one- year extension contracts and 437 health professionals starting the second year of their FY 201 6 two - year contract. Applicants who apply for funding and do not receive it, are identified as either \"matched unfunded\" or \"unmatched unfunded\". The \"matched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals employed in an Indian health program. The \"unmatched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals that either decline a job offer because they did not receive loan repayment funding or those unable to find a suitable assignment meeting their personal or professional needs. In FY 2017, there were 412 \"matched unfunded\" applicants (including 153 nurses, 4 behavioral health providers, 2 dentists, 70 mid -level providers and 144 pharmacists) and 376 \"unmatched unfunded\" health professionals (including 20 physicians, 58 behavioral health providers, 16 dentists, 46 mid -level providers and 158 nurses). The inability to fund these 788 health professional applicants is a significant challenge for the rec ruitment efforts of the agency. It is estimated that an additional $ 39.4 million would be needed to fund the 788 unfunded health professional applicants from FY 2017. A more detailed breakout of loan repayment awards in FY 2016 by discipline is included in a table at the end of the narrative. Scholarship Program (Sections 103 and 104) - Section 103 scholarships include the preparatory and pre-graduate scholarship programs that prepare students for health professions training programs. Graduate student s and junior - and senior- level undergraduate students are given priority for funding for programs under Section 103, unless the section specifies otherwise. Section 104 includes the Health Professions Scholarship program, which provides financial support consisting of tuition, fees and a monthly stipend for AI/AN students from federally recognized Tribes enrolled in health profession or allied health profession programs. Students accepting funding for programs under Section 104 incur a service obligation and payback requirement. In FY 2017, there were 805 new online scholarship applications submitted to the IHS Scholarship program. After evaluating the application for completeness and eligibility, a total of 331 of these new scholarship applications were considered eligible for funding. The IHS Scholarship program was able to fund 108 new a wards. An additional $3.3 million in scholarship funding would have been needed to fund all qualified scholarship applicants . The IHS Scholarship program also reviewed applications from previously awarded scholars that were continuing their education. A total of 154 continuation awards were funded in FY 2017. CJ-153 A detailed breakout of scholarships awarded by discipline in FY 2017 is included in a table at the end of the narrative. In 2013, the IHS Scholarship program provided retention metrics for inclusion in a system design guide for the revision of the Scholarship Management System. System upgrades to date have allowed for easier tracking of scholars throughout the application and award process, while in school and during post graduate training, and while fulfilling their service commitment. Additional enhancements, w hen completed, will provide annual reports on retention of scholarship recipients employed by IHS beyond the obligated service period. Extern Program (Section 105) - Section 105 of the IHCIA, is designed to give IHS scholars and other health professions students the opportunity to gain clinical experience with IHS and Tribal health professionals in their chosen discipline. This program is open to IHS scholars and non- scholars. Students are employed up to 120 days annually, with most students working during the summer months. In FY 2017, the Extern Program funded a total of 94 student externs. A breakout of extern awards in FY 2017 by Area Offices is included in a table at the end of the narrative.

Discretionary competitive grants to Tribes and Tribal organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Tribal Management Grant (TMG) program was authorized in 1975 under Sections 103(b)(2) and 103(e) of Public Law (P.L.) 93-638, Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended. U nder the authority of the ISDEAA , the program was established to assist all federally recognized Indian Tribes and Tribally- sanctioned Tribal organizations (T/TO) to plan, prepare , or decide to assum e all or part of existing Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, functions, services, and activities (PFSA) and to further develop and enhance their health program management capability and capacity. The TMG program has provided discretionary competitive grants to T/TO , to establish goals and performance measures for current health programs, assess current management capacity to determine if new components are appropriate, analyze programs to determine if T/TO management is practicable, and develop and enhance infrastructure systems to manage or organize PFSA. The nature of the TMG program allow ed T/TO the option to enter or not enter into ISDEAA contracts/compact agreements which are equal expressions of self-determination. The IHS established four funding priorities for the TMG program: Tribes that receive federal recognition or restoration within the last five years with implementing or developing management and infrastructure systems for their organization T/TO that need to improve financial management systems to address audit material weaknesses Eligible Direct Service and Title I Federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations submitting a competing continuation application or new application Eligible Title V Se lf Governance Federally recognized Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations submitting a competing continuation or new application. The TMG program offer ed four project types with three different award amounts and project periods: CJ-158 (1) Planning - fund up to $50,000 with project periods not to exceed 12 months. A Planning Project allows establishment of goals and performance measures for current health programs or to design their health programs and management systems. (2) Evaluation - fund up to $50,000 with project periods not to exceed 12 months. An Evaluation Study Project determines the effectiveness and efficiency of a program or if new components are needed to assist the T/TO improve its health care delivery system. (3) Feasibility - fund up to $70,000 with project periods not to exceed 12 months. A F easibility study analyzes programs to determine if T/TO management is practicable. (4) Health Management Structure (HMS) grants are funded up to $300,000 with project periods not to exceed 36 months. HMS projects include the design and implementation of systems to manage PFSA, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems or billing and accounting systems, management systems, health accreditation, as well as correction of aud it material weaknesses.

Permanent Allocation Method ............................... 93-638 Self- Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts , and Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Direct Operations budget supports the Indian Health Service (IHS) in providing Agency - wide leadership, oversight, and executive direction for the comprehensive public and personal health care provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Funds are used to promote the efficient and effective administ ration and overs ight of national functions such as: human resources (HR) , financial management , acquisitions, internal control and risk management, health care and facilities planning, health information technology, Contract Disputes Act claims analysis, and other administrative support and systems accountability. These types of direct operations performed at the Headquarters and Area Office levels provide the foundation necessary to carry out the Agency m ission. The IHS Headquarters provides overall program direction, authorities, and oversight for the 12 IHS Areas and 170 Service Units; formulates policy and distributes resources; provides technical expertise to all components of the Indian health care system, which includes IHS direct, Tribally operated programs, and urban Indian organizations (I/T/U); maintains national statistics and public health surveillance; identifies trends; and projects future needs. The IHS Headquarters works in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and sister agencies to formulate and implement national health care priorities, goals, and objectives for AI/ANs within the framework of its mission. The IHS Headquarters also works with HHS to formulate the annual budget and necessary legislative proposals, respond to congressional inquiries, and collaborate with other governmental entities to enhance and support health care services for AI/ANs. By delegation from the IHS Director, the 12 Area Offices distribute resources, carry out policies and internal controls, moni tor and evaluate the full range of comprehensive healthcare and community-oriented public health programs, and provide technical support to local Service Units and I/T/U staff. They ensure the delivery of quality health care through the 170 Service Units and participate in the development and demonstration of alternative means and improvement CJ-161 techniques of health services management and delivery to promote the optimal provision of health services to Indian people throughout the Indian health system. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Direct Operations budget is critical for continued progress in assuring an accountable, quality, and high- performing Indian health system . Examples of significant agency activities made possible by Direct Operations funds are provid ed below. Implementation of the Quality Framework continued in FY 2017 to strengthen organizational capacity to improve quality of care, improve our ability to meet and maintain accreditation for IHS direct service facilities, align service delivery processes to improve the patient experience, ensure patient safety, and improve processes and strengthen communications for early identification of risks. The Direct Operations budget helps fund the staff leading and supporting these activities, as well as the oversight needed to measure, track, and report performance outcomes. To bring quality healthcare expertise and strengthen management, the IHS has focused considerable efforts on Human Resource (HR) management. The IHS historically has difficulties recruiting and retaining healthcare providers. To address these challenges, IHS continues to maximize the use of available recruitment and retention tools such as: pay incentives and the use of Title 38 compensation authorities to offer more competitive salaries to medical providers; implementing global recruitments that focuses on c ritical health care positions and improves efficiency through a single vacancy announcement for vacant positions at multiple IHS facilities; priority access to expedited commissioning of new Commissioned Corps officers through a partnership with the Office of the Surgeon General; and other available incentives including loan repayment, recruitment/retention/relocation incentive pays, flexible schedules, and Title 38 authorities for competitive salaries . To ensure consistency and accountability in workforc e management, the IHS established an enhanced supervisory training focusing on employee and labor relations and an agency- wide tracking of all employee relations actions. A Leadership Training program was also implemented to build executive leadership capa city within the existing workforce and strengthen succession planning. The Direct Operations budget funds HR leadership and supporting staff, interagency agreements for collaborating with other government agencies to obtain additional expert support, and efforts to streamline and strengthen the overall HR program for maintaining a quality workforce. The IHS is committed to ensuring quality care for all patients and is actively working on deploying innovative strategies with a focus on achieving and sustaining improvements in quality of care and recruiting and retaining a high performing workforce.

Part 137 FY 2019 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation Method ....................... Direct Federal, Cooperative Agreements, and Self -Governance Funding Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Tribal Self- Governance (OTSG) is responsible for a wide range of agency functions that are critical to the IHS' relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) nations, Tribal organizations, and other AI/AN groups. Since 1993, the Indian Health Service (I HS), in cooperation with Tribal representatives, developed formula methodologies for identification of Tribal shares for all Indian Tribes. Tribal shares are those program and administrative funds that Tribes are eligible to assume through self- determination contract s and self-governance compacts. 1 Today, Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations currently administer over one- half of IHS resources through ISDEAA self -determination contracts and self - governance compacts. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHS Tribal Self -Governance Program has grown dramatically since the initial 14 compacts and funding agreements were signed in 1994. In FY 2017, approximately $ 2.0 billion of the total IHS budget appropriation was transferred to Tribes and Tribal organizations to support 94 ISDEAA self -governance compacts an d 120 funding agreements.2 The Self -Governance budget supports activities, including but not limited to: government- to- government negotiations of self -governance compacts and funding agreements; oversight of the IHS Director's Agency Lead Negotiators (ALNs) ; technical assistance on Tribal Consultation 1 The ISDEAA provides two mechanisms for Tribes and Tribal organizations to assume responsibility for health care formerly provided by the Federal government. The IHS Tribal Self- Governance Program is authorized under Title V of the Act. Tribes may also contract with the IHS through self -determination contracts and annual funding agreements authorized under Title I of the Act. 2 For FY 201 8, the IHS estimates an additional five Tribes will be entering into Title V ISDEAA compacts and funding agreements. This estimate corresponds to the number of Self -Governance Negotiation Cooperative Agreements available each fisca l year. Eligibility requirements for these agreements mirror the statutory requirements that Tribes must meet to participate in the I HS Tribal Self-Governance Program (25 U.S.C. \u00a75383; 42 C.F.R. Part 137, Subpart C). For this pool, an average estimate of $5 million per Tribe is used to project estimates for Tribes entering into a Title V ISDEAA compacts and funding agreements, inclusive of bo th Tribal shares and contract support costs. CJ-165 activities; analysis of Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorities; and supporting the activities of the IHS Director's Tribal Self -Governance Advisory Committee. The Self -Governance budget engages local Tribal resources through several activities: Develops and oversees the implementation of Tribal self -governance legislation and authorities in the IHS. Reviews eligibility requirements for Tribes to participate in the Tribal Self -Governance Program and to receive Self -Governance Planning and Negotiation Cooperative Agreements. Provides resources and technical assistance to Tribes and Tribal organizations for the implementation of Tribal self -governance. Provides Tribal Self -Governance Program training to Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Tribal groups. Coordinates national Tribal self-governance meetings, including an annual consultation conference in partnership with the Department of the Interior, to promote the participation by all AI/AN Tribes in the IHS Tribal Self -Governance p rogram activities and program direction. Develops, publishes, and presents information related to the IHS Tri bal Self -Governance Program activities to Tribes, Tribal organizations, state and local governmental agencies, and other interested parties. Coordinates self- governance Tribal Delegation Meetings for the IHS Headquarters, and Area Senior officials. The Se lf-Governance budget brings health care quality expertise to the IHS, and Tribes, by: Providing support for projects that assist Tribal ly operated health programs to enhance information technology infrastructure and prepare for meaningful use and other fe deral reporting standards; and Collaborating on crosscutting issues and processes including, but not limited to: budget formulation; program management issues; self- determination issues; Tribal shares methodologies; and emergency preparedness, response and security. These services are deployed in accordance with strategic planning, are data driven, and support program integrity through adherence to reporting requirements. T he Office of Tribal Self- Governance Funds Management Database supports the deliv ery of services by improved access to data to evaluate performance and identify areas of process improvement.

Authorizing Legislation .................................................Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Pub. L. 94-437, as amended by Pub. L. 111-148, title X, \u00a710221(a), Mar. 23, 2010, 124 Stat. 935); the Social Security Act sec. 1880 & 1911, 42 U.S.C 1395qq &1396j and the Economy Act (31 U.S.C 1535). PROGRAM DESCRIPTION In 1976, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorized the Indian Health Service (IHS) to collect Medicare and Medicaid (M&M) reimbursements for services provided in IHS facilities to patients with M&M eligibility. The IHCIA was later amended to allow IHS to collect Private Insurance (PI) reimbursements for services provided in IHS facilities for patients with PI. In fiscal year (FY) 2017, $1.193 billion was collected from third party insurers, of which $843.593 million was Federal M&M collections and $109.272 million was private insurers. The FY 2019 estimates above are based on the FY 2017 actual collections. Public and private collections represent a significant portion of the IHS and Tribal health care delivery budgets. Accreditation -In accordance with IHCIA authorization for collections, the IHS places the highest priority on meeting accreditation and certification standards for its healthcare facilities. Third party revenue is essential to maintaining facility accreditation, certification and standard of health care through organizations such as The Joint Commission or the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. Collection funds are ultimately used to improve the delivery and CJ-168 access to healthcare for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. Monitoring - The IHS has developed and implemented a data system to identify deficiencies and monitor the third party collections process for IHS operated facilities. The Third Party Internal Controls Self-Assessment online data tool provides necessary information for local managers and Headquarters staff to monitor compliance with applicable policies and procedures during the collections process so they can take necessary corrective actions and improve overall program activity. IHS is continuing the development of a third party interface with the Unified Financial Management System and enhancement of systems, reports, and processes to meet legislative requirements for IHS operated facilities. The IHS will also continue improvements to the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and incrementally enhance handling of ICD-10 codes. The IHS will continue to strengthen its revenue generation policies and management practices, including internal controls, patient registration, patient benefits coordination, provider documentation training, certified procedural coding training, third party billing, electronic claims processing, accounts receivable, and debt management. Priority activities include continued enhancement of third party billing and accounts receivable software to improve effectiveness and to ensure system integration with its business processes, compliance with M&M regulations, and industry standards and changes in operational processes. Improvements for IHS operated facilities are coordinated with concurrent enhancements in Purchased Referred Care business practices related to alternate resources. In addition, IHS is working to incorporate statutory rules and regulations that impact third party collections directly and indirectly. Some rules pertaining to the Medicare and Medicaid programs have a direct impact on revenue generation over the next few years. IHS has formed workgroups to maximize the positive impact for all IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health program facilities, such as the National Business Office Committee, which serves as a subcommittee to the National Council of Executive Officers. These efforts support IHS' priority on resources to secure and effectively manage the assets needed to promote the IHS mission. Partnerships - IHS is working to develop and enhance partnerships with federal and state agencies. IHS continues to work with CMS and the state Medicaid agencies to identify patients who are eligible to enroll in M&M and the state Children's Health Insurance Programs. IHS also continues these partnerships in the implementation of provisions in the IHCIA, and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Enrollment and collections depend, in large part, on IHS ' successful partnerships/relationships, state participation in Medicaid expansion, and awareness and willingness of IHS users to enroll in Medicaid and other programs. Areas have developed and shared their Area Business Plan Templates with Tribes in the Areas and continue to monitor implementation progress. IHS anticipates that in-network contracting with health plans may work for many facilities and is working with CMS to identify ways to provide informational resources for implementation. IHS is continuing to implement, train, and participate in the Medicare Payment Reform efforts by CMS. This included increasing awareness, training and implementation of the Quality Payment Program under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act. IHS is now working on implementation of the Merit - Based Incentive Payment System and Advanced Alternative Payment Models with the end goal of improving access to care. CJ-169 IHS collaborates with CMS and the Tribes on a number of matters, including implementation of and training regarding recent changes in legislation, eligibility policies, covered services policies, reimbursement policies and payment methodologies, claims processing, denials, training and use of information technology resources at IHS and Tribal sites to increase the enrollment of M&M eligible AI/AN patients. IHS continues to coordinate outreach, education, and training efforts in collaboration with other federal, state and Tribal partners. IHS has partnered with CMS to provide a number of training sessions nationwide for Tribal and IHS employees, focusing on outreach and improving access to M&M programs. In December 2012, IHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) signed the VA/IHS National Reimbursement Agreement that facilitates reimbursement by the VA to the IHS and Tribal facilities for direct health care services provided to eligible AI/AN veterans. In January 2017 the IHS and VA signed an amendment to the agreement that extends the period of the reimbursement agreement through June 30, 2019. This was a significant step in continuing to ensure implementation of Section 405 of the IHCIA1. The agreement represents a positive partnership to support improved coordination of care and non-duplication of resources between IHS federal facilities and the VA and it paved the way for agreements negotiated between VA and tribal health programs. IHS will continue to work directly with the VA to implement billing practices to ensure IHS receives proper payment for care provided at IHS and Tribal facilities to AI/AN veterans. Monitoring, auditing, and compliance with the agreement will continue to be a focus for FY 2017 through FY 2019. Annually, IHS trains health care facility staff in areas related to various functions within the revenue cycle, including patient registration, benefits coordination, coding, third party billing, accounts receivable and other aspects of the revenue cycle. Area I/T/U staff are highly encouraged to participate in annual CMS trainings. IHS hosts a Partnership Conference to provide the most current information related to finance, information technology, health information management, Purchased/Referred Care, and business office functions; special emphasis is also provided for the specific management needs of Tribes and urban programs. Claims Processing Improvements -IHS continues to work to enhance each IHS operated facility's capability to identify patients who have private insurance coverage and improve claims processing. The local service units utilize private insurance funds to improve services, purchase medical supplies and equipment, and to improve local service unit business management practices in support of maintaining accreditation. The IHS continues to make use of private contractors to pursue collections on outstanding claims from private payers. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS With the agreement between the VA and IHS in place, IHS developed and executed an implementation plan to collect at all IHS federal sites serving eligible Veterans. The VA has approximately 105 agreements with Tribal Health Programs. This partnership with the VA and implementation of VA reimbursement at IHS sites serve to support the IHS priority to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships that advance the IHS mission and enable IHS to provide further services to local communities funded with these collections. 1 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1645(c), \"Reimbursement. The Service, Indian tribe, or tribal organization shall be reimbursed by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense (as the case may be) where services are provided through the Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization to beneficiaries eligible for services from either such Department, notwithstanding any other provision of law. CJ-170 The IHS HQ conducted bi- weekly ACA Question and Answer Conference Calls from October 2013 through January 2017. Since May 2017, the IHS HQ has hosted a series of monthly conference calls titled, \"Best Practices in Indian Health: Education and Assistance with Health Care Coverage and Other Benefits.\" The conference calls are designed to provide information regarding programs and benefits available to populations within the AI/AN community as well as to share best practices as to how to reach those populations from across the I/T/U system. The IHS HQ has also entered into cooperative agreements since 2010 with organizations such as the National Indian Health Board and the National Congress of American Indians to coordinate and conduct consumer centered outreach and education, training and technical assistance on a national scale for the 566 Federally -recognized Tribes and Tribal organizations on the changes and authorities of the new legislation for the ACA and the IHCIA. The national organization partners have provided well over 100 training sessions and webinars for Tribes and tribal members, helped coordinate numerous enrollment events, created toolkits for youth and elders and offered technical assistance to AI/AN and non- AI/AN enrollment assisters. Through the IHS National Indian Health Outreach and Education (NIHOE) Initiative, the IHS continues to partner with national and regional Tribal/Indian organizations to educate consumers and tribal governments on the health care insurance options available, the process for enrollment, financial assistance, the exemption options for American Indians and Alaska Natives, eligibility determinations, the tribal employer mandate, and maximizing revenue. As a result of partnership and discussions with CMS on outreach and enrollment opportunities within the IHS, the IHS HQ conducted a pilot project to increase M&M enrollment at six IHS Service Units in four states during the latter part of CY 2016. The facilities included Phoenix Indian Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona; Pine Ridge Hospital in Pine Ridge, South Dakota; Rosebud Hospital in Rosebud, South Dakota; Sioux San Hospital in Rapid City, South Dakota; Blackfeet Community Hospital in Browning, Montana; and Quentin Burdick Facility in Belcourt, North Dakota. The pilot project provided an opportunity for the selected Service Units to improve their M&M enrollment numbers, increase their third-party revenue and, in turn, increase their resources. One goal of the pilot project was to help the IHS to identify best practices to increase M&M enrollment which could be shared with all Service Units. The IHS hosted a Patient Registration and Patient Benefits Coordination Training in April 2017 which focused on topics related to outreach, education and assistance to patients regarding health benefits coverage. Useful tools, best practices, and informational resources were provided to training participants. More than 300 I/T/U attendees from across the country participated in the 3.5 day training. The IHS hosted the Partnership Conference in August 2017 and had over 800 attendees. In June 2018, the IHS expects the Partnership Conference to have at least another 800 I/T/U attendees from the Business Office, Health Information Management, Purchased/Referred Care, Finance, and other components of the Revenue Cycle. FY 2018 -2019 Collections Estimates Medicare and Medicaid (M&M) --The FY 2019 President's Budget submission includes $1.056 billion which continues the FY 2018 collections level. Medicaid - The FY 2019 budget submission includes $807.605 million, the same level as FY 2018. IHS continues to educate its users on the benefits of increased Medicaid enrollment. IHS is continuing to monitor its user population and insurance coverage and is making all possible efforts to maximize Medicaid enrollment in all States and maintain current level of collections. CJ-171 Medicare - The FY 2019 budget submission includes $248.638 million, the same level as FY 2018 level. IHS hospitals and clinics are expanding steps to improve quality of care and maintain current levels of collections. Private Insurance - The FY 2019 budget submission includes $109.272 million, the same level as FY 2018 level. IHS will continue to monitor its user population and insurance coverage to maintain and maximize private insurance collections. VA/IHS National Reimbursement Agreement - The FY 2019 budget submission includes $28.062 million, the same level as FY 2018. The estimates include collections for Federal and Tribal payments made by the VA . The FY 2018 estimate and the FY 201 9 budget submission based on the FY 2017 actual collections received by IHS for Federal programs and the payments made by the VA to our tribal organizations. IHS and VA have agreed to con tinue to monitor FY 2018 actual reimbursements and work together to improve the quality of care for all veterans and maximize payments whenever possible. IHS continues to work with the VA in identifying the actual number of AI/ANs with VA benefits eligibil ity and, of those, how many receive direct care from IHS. IHS and the VA continue to work in partnership to identify and resolve billing and reimbursement issues and provide sites with on-going support and training. All IHS sites have signed implementation plans and have the ability to bill the VA for Veterans Services.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Maintenance and Improvement (M&I) funds are the primary source of funding to maintain, repair, and improve existing Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal health care facilities, which are used to deliver and support health care services. M&I funding supports federal, government- owned buildings and tribally- owned space where health care services are provided pursuant to contracts or compacts executed under the provisions of the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638). M&I funds are necessary to achieve and maintain accreditation, to meet building codes and standards, to maintain and repair the physical condition of health care facilities, to modernize existing health care facilities to meet changing health care delivery needs, and to implement mandated requirements (e.g., energy conservation, seismic, environmental, handicapped accessibility, security, etc.). Efficient and effective buildings and infrastructure are vital to delivering health care in direct support of the IHS mission and priorities. Maintaining reliab le and efficient buildings is an increasing challenge as existing health care facilities age and additional space is added into the real property inventory. The average age for IHS-owned health care facilities is approximately 35 years, whereas the average age, including recapitalization of private- sector hospital plants, is 9 to 10 years. 1 Many IHS and Tribal health care facilities are operating at or beyond capacity, and their designs are not efficient in the context of modern health care delivery. In addition, as existing health care facilities continue to age, the operational and maint enance costs increase. The physical condition of IHS-owned and many tribally- owned healthcare facilities is evaluated through routine observations by facilities personnel and by in-depth condition surveys. These observations and surveys identify facility, fire- life-safety, and program deficiencies, and are used 1 The 'average age of hospital plant' measures the average age of the facility including capital improvements, replacement of built- in equipment and modernization. CJ-175 to develop IHS' estimate of the Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration, and Repair (BEMAR). The BEMAR is a measure of the condition of health care facilities in the Indian health system and establishes priorities for larger M&I projects. T he BEMAR for all IHS and reporting Tribal health care facilities as of October 1, 201 7 is $568.8 million. Approximately 4 percent of the current replacement value, $208.3 million , is needed to fully 'sustain' the facilities and fund a project pool for restoration/modernization/improvement projects to support program requirements. When IHS replaces an older, obsolete hospital or clinic with a new facility, all deficiencies associated with the old facility are removed from the backlog. M&I Funds Allocation Method The IHS M&I funds are allocated in four categories: routine maintenance, M&I projects, environmental compliance, and demolition: 1. Routine Maintenance Funds - These funds support activities that are generally classified as those needed for maintenance and minor repair to keep the health care facility in its current condition. Funding allocation is formula based. The Building Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences has determined that approximately two to four percent of current replacement value of supported buildings is required to maintain (i.e., 'sustain') facilities in their c urrent condition. 2 2. M&I Project Funds - These funds are used for major projects to reduce the BEMAR and make improvements necessary to support health care delivery. Funding allocation is formula based. 3. Environmental Compliance Funds - These funds are used to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits, to improve energy efficiency and water efficiency, to increase renewable energy usage, to reduce consumption of fossil -fuel generated electricity, and to implement other sustainability in itiatives. These funds are available to Federal and Tribal health care facilities on a national basis. 4. Demolition Funds - The IHS has a number of Federally-owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete. Demolition funds are used to dispose of these excess assets. These funds may be augmented with Environmental Compliance Funds as available for demolition and disposal to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to IHS.

CJ-176 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 Budget submission for Maintenance and Improvement program of $75,745,000 is $514,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR level. This level of funding provides for the following allocation categories: Approximately $69.245 million for routine maintenance to sustain the condition of federal and Tribal healthcare facilities buildings. These funds will support facilities activities that are generally classified as those needed for 'sustainment' of existing facilities and provi ded to the IHS Area Offices and to Tribes for daily maintenance activities and local projects to maintain the current state of health care facilities. These Routine Maintenance Funds may be used for Area and Tribal M&I projects to fund smaller elements of the backlog of work to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) and program enhancements. Approximately $3 million would be available for major Area and Tribal M& I projects to reduce the BEMAR deficiencies and to improve healthcare facilities to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. The FY 2019 Budget Request continues funding critical projects to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) , accreditation standards, and program enhancements , all of which is essential to support health delivery . Approximately $3 million would be available for environmental compliance projects. The IHS places a high priority on meeting Federal, State, and local legal/regulatory environmental requirements, including allocating funding to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits. The IHS has currently identified approximately $12.3 million in environmental compliance tasks and included them in the BEMAR database. Approximately $500,000 for demolition projects . The IHS has approximately 120 Federally- owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete which are no longer needed. Many of these buildings are safety and security hazards. Demolition of some of these buildings, in concert with transferring others, reduces hazards and liability. Demolition Funds may be augmented with environmental compliance funds as available for demolition of the Federal buildings to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to the Indian Health Service. OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S The Outcomes for this program are measured through BEMAR, i.e., progress in addressing maintenance needs and facility deficiencies. Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings improve the ease and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services.

Needs- based priority system for construction project fund allocation and implemented through P.L. 86-121 Memorandum of Agreements, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self-Governance Construction Project Agreements. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improve ment Act (IHCIA) requires the Indian Health Service ( IHS) to identify the universe of sanitation facilities needs for existing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) homes by documenting deficie ncies and proposing projects to address their needs. These projects provide new and existing homes with first time s ervices such as water wells, onsite waste water systems or connecting homes to community water, and waste water facilities. The universe of need include s upgrading existing water supply and waste disposal facilities. The four types of sanitation facilities projects funded through IHS are: (1) projects to serve existing housing; (2) projects to serve new or like-new housing, such as Indian homes being constructed or rehabilitated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)-Home Improvement Program, Tribes, individu al homeowners, or other nonprofit organizations; (3) special projects (studies, training, or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction); and (4) emergency projects. Projects that serve new or like-new housing are funded based on a priority classification system. Projects that provide sanitation facilities to existing homes are selected for funding in priority order each year from the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS). The SDS is an inventory of the sanitation deficiencies of federal ly recognized AI/AN eligible homes and communities; th e sanitation deficiencies include needed water, sewer, and solid waste facilities for existing AI/AN homes. Project selection is driven by objective evaluation criteria including health impact, existing def iciency level, adequacy of previous service, capital cost, local tribal priority, operations and maintenance capacity of the receiving entity, availability of contributions from non -IHS sources, and other conditions that are locally determined. The SDS pr iority position of each unfunded project is reevaluated with the Tribes in each Area annually. Sanitation Facilities Construction (S FC) projects can be managed by IHS directly or by Tribes that elect to use the Title I or Title V authorization under P.L . 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and CJ-178 Education Assistance Act. Sanitation facilities projects are carried out cooperat ively with the Tribes who will be served, and construction is performed by either the IHS or the Tribes. Projects start with a Tribal Project Proposal and are funded and implemented through execution of an agreement between a Tribe and IHS. In t hese agreements, the Tribes also assume ownership responsibilities, including operation and maintenance. The overall SFC goals, reporting requirements, eligibility criteria, project planning, and funding priorities remain the same, regardless of the delivery methods chosen by a Tribe. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS SFC is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IH S has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated for SFC to provide potable water and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN eligible homes and communities. As a result, infant mortality rates and mortality rate s for gastroenteritis and other environmentally- related diseases have been reduced by about 80 percent since 1973. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state populations in regions with lower proportion of homes without water service , reflect significan tly higher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus.1 Researchers associate the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The SFC Program works collaboratively with tribes to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply systems and sanitary sewage disposal systems as soon as possible. In FY 2017, IHS provided service to 19,857 AI/AN homes with an average project duration of 3.5 years. However, at the end of FY 2017 about 9,339, or 2.3 percent of all AI/AN homes were without access to adequate sanitation facilities; and, about 171,203 or approximately 42 percent of AI/AN homes were in need of some form of sanitation facilities improvements. The individuals who live in homes without adequate sanitation facilities are at a higher risk for gastrointestinal disease, respiratory disease and other chronic diseases. 2 Many of these homes without service are very remote and may have limited access to health care which increases the importance of improving environmental conditions. The total sanitation facility need reported through SDS from year end 2005 to year end 2017 has increased over 55 percent from $1.86 billion to $2.9 billion. The underlying challenges of construction cost inflation, population growth, an increasing number of regulations, and failing infrastructure still significantly influence sanitation facility needs across Indian country. Failing infrastructure is presumably the largest factor , a result of inadequate operations and maintenance. Under the I HCIA , the IHS is authorized to provide operation and maintenance assistance for, and emergency repairs to, tribal sani tation facilities , when necessary to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Federal investment in sanitation facilities , however resources have not been appropriated for this purpose. The SFC Program will continue in FY 2019 focusing on improving quality of data reported through the SDS on the sanitation facility needs supporting AI/AN homes and communities. These efforts will ensure the sanitation facilities needs included in SDS are: 1 Thomas W. Hennessy, Troy Ritter, Robert C. Holman, Dana L. Bruden, Krista L. Yorita, Lisa Bulkow, James E.

In order to achieve this outcome funds will only be obligated to projects that have been certified by the SFC Program Areas as \"ready to fund\" ; this means they have a well- defined scope, a detailed cost estimate, a completed preliminary design and that known potential risks to project construction, operation and maintenance have been considered and mitigated. FUNDING HISTORY/REQUEST Fiscal Year Amount 2015 $79,423,000 2016 $99,423,000 2017 $101,772,000 2018 Annualized CR $101,081,000 2019 President's Budget $101,772 ,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2019 Budget submission for Sanitation Facilities Construction of $101 ,772,000 is an increase of $691,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR level. The FY 2019 President's Budget of $101 ,772,000 - provides funding in the following allocation categories: Approximately $59.2 million may be distributed to the Areas for prioritized projects to serve existing homes, based on a formula that considers, among other factors, the cost of facilities to serve existing homes that: (a) have not received sanitation facilities for the first time, or (b) are served by sanitation facilities that are in need of some form of improvement. Another element of the distribution formula is a weight factor that favors Areas with larger numbers of AI/AN homes without water supply or sewer facilities, or without both. From this distribution , up to $5.0 million may be used for projects to clean up open dump sites on Indian lands pursuant to the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 1994, 3 pending coordination with the E PA on oversight and evaluation of tribal solid waste management programs. Up to $3,000,000 will be reserved at IHS Headquarters: Of this amount, $1,000,000 will be used for emergency projects as requested by Areas to address water supply and waste disposal emergencies caused by natural disasters or other unanticipated situation that require immediate attention to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Federal 3 Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 1994 Pub. L.103 -399, Oct. 22, 1994, 108 Stat. 4164 (25 U.S.C. 3091et seq.) CJ-180 investment in sanitation facilities. Remaining emergency unused funds at the end of the fiscal year may be distr ibuted to address the SDS projects in the Areas. The remaining $ 2,000,000 is for funding special projects. Starting in FY 2019 and ending in FY 2021 up to $1,000,000 annually (total anticipated funding $3,000,000) will be utilized for the purpose of updating the inventory of open dumps currently identified in the IHS data system to ensure consistence with the requirments of the Indi an Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act (PL103- 399). An amount up to $250,000 will be used to incorporate a graphical information system (GIS) functionality into the SFC Program data system. The primary benefit of incorporating a GIS into the SFC Program's data system is to improve the Program's ability to access, store and update sanitation facilities composite as-built drawings. The graphical interface will allow for the collection, uploading and editing of field- collected data on installed sanitation facilities. It will allow users to update sanitation facilit ies as-built drawings for the purpose of aiding in needs identification, planning, design, construction, and technical assistance. The remaining special project funds will be used to pay for research studi es, training, or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction, but which are not eligible for construction funds. Approximately $39.572 million will be used to serve new and like- new homes, which are non- Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) homes (HUD homes are served under HUD authorities and appropriations). Some of these funds may also be used for sanitation facilities for individual homes of the disabled or sick , with a physician referral , indicating an immediate medical need for adequate sanitation facilities in their home. 4 As needed, amounts to serve new and like- new homes will be established by Headquarters after reviewing Area proposals. Priority will be given to projects under the BIA Housing Improvement Program (HI P) to serve new and like- new homes with the exception of \"Category A\" BIA HIP homes which are considered existing homes and will be served with the funds described in the first bullet of this section . The IHS appropriated funds for sanitation facilities construction are prohibited by law from being used to provide sanitation facilities for new homes funded with grants by the housing programs of HUD. These HUD housing grant programs for new homes should continue to incorporate funding for the sanitation facilities necessary for those homes. 4 Indian Health Service.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts Construction Project Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service ( IHS) Health Care Facilities Construction (HCFC) funds provide optimum availability of functional, modern IHS and tribally operated health care facilities and staff quarters where no suitable housing alternatives are available. The IHS is authorized to construct health care facilities and staff quarters, support Tribal construction of facilities under the Joint Venture Construction Program (JVCP), provide construction funding for Tribal small ambulatory care facilities projects, and provide funding to construct new and replacement dental units. The construction and modernization of IHS infrastructure through the health care facilities construction program helps ensure the IHS commitment to the Department of Health and Human Services Strateg ic Objectives 1.2: Increase health care service availability and accessibility ; and 1.3:Improve health care quality, safety, cost and value. The health care facilities constructed by the IHS ensure access to quality, culturally competent health care for one of the lowest income populations in the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The focus of the IHS health care service programs provided in these facilities is on prevention and delivery of comprehensive primary care in a communi ty setting. The HCFC program is funded based on an IHS-wide list of priorities for construction projects. During FY 1990, in consultation with the Tribes, the IHS revised the Health Facilities Construction Priority System (HFCPS) methodology. The HFCPS ranks proposals using factors reflecting the total amount of space needed , age and condition of the existing health care facility, if any, degree of isolation of the population to be served in the proposed health care facility, and availability of altern ate health care resources. The remaining health care facilities projects on the HFCPS list, inclu ding those partially funded, total approximately $2.3 billion as of June 2017. The reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) includes a provision stating \"any project established under the construction priority system in effect on the date of enactment of the Act of 2009 shall not be affected by any change in the construction priority CJ-183 system taking place after that date... \" Total need fo r the HCFC Program is approximately $14.5 billion for expanded and active authority facility types according to The 2016 Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress. The Joint Venture Construction Program ( JVCP ) authorizes IHS to enter into agreements with Tribes that construct their own health care facilities. The Tribe provides the resources, whether from their own funds, through financing, grants, contributions, or a combination thereof, for the constr uction of their health care facility . IHS health care facility construction appropriations are not used for construction of facilities in the JVCP but may be used to equip the health care facility. Tribes apply for the JVCP during a competitive process and the approved projects are enter ed into agreements with IHS. Based on the date of projected completion of construction by the respective Tribe, the IHS agrees to request a funding increase from Congress for additional staffing and operations consistent with a fully executed beneficial occupancy of the health care facility. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Each healthcare facility project that is completed increases access to much needed health care services. Each completed replacement facility is typically larger to meet the increased demand for health services from a growing population. With the increase in facility size comes more healthcare providers and exam rooms, dentists and dental chairs, improved imaging systems, and expanded or new health services such as eye care and audiology. Each new facility includes a component to address behavioral health issues. Administration staff is increased to strengthen management , collections and bring health care quality expertise to the replacement facility. Each facility also incorporates additional space for tribal health programs which compliments IHS programs. Tribes typically provide land, at no cost to the Federal Government, for the new or replacement health care facility. The JVCP has saved the Federal Government over $1.15 billion dollars in capital expenses since its inception . The Congress also provided an incentive for Tribes with a project on HCFC priority list to provide the resources for design and construct the priority list project and benefit from all aspects of the JVCP. The out come of the JVCP provides the same accomplishments as described above. The IHS Small Ambulatory Program (SAP) provides funding for tribal health care facilities . The program is available for Federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes o r tribal organizations to competitively obtain funding for the construction, expansion or modernization of tribally owned small ambulatory health care facilities. The selection process utilizing the FY 2017 funds, and any FY2018 appropriated funds, began on December 1, 2017. The selected projects will not be a part of the IHS HCFPS. The SAP is authorized by Section 306 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Public Law 94-437, and projects are competitively selected for funding as funds are appropriated. In FY 2017 IHS entered into a Joint Venture with : Yakutat Tlingit Tribe for the Yakutat Community Health Center Yakutat, Alaska. The federal construction and the Joint Venture programs bring new and increased health care capacity to AI/AN communities where there is a great need. These activities increase the access to quality health care in these underserved communities. CJ-184 In FY 2017 IHS received $5,000,000 for the SAP and is currently in the process of selecting priority projects.

The programs directly and indirectly support all of the IHS facilities performance measures and improved access to quality health services. The programs and staff at the IHS Headquarters, Area Office, and Service Unit levels work collaboratively with Tribes and other agencies to promote and provide access to improvements in public health through surveillance, education, intervention activities, construction of sanitation facilities and health care facilities. These activities are aligned in sub - activities: Facilities Support, Environmental Health Support, and Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support. CJ-187 In addition to personnel salary and benefits costs, funding under this activity is used for utilities, certain non-medical supplies and personal property, and biomedical equipment repair. The IHS may use a limited amount of these FEHS funds for centrally charged assessments that benefit the staff and activities funded through the Indian Health Facilities ap propriations. To date, the majority of IHS's assessments have been paid through the Indian Health Services appropriation; however, the amount of assessment costs have significantly exceeded the amount of funds available within Services. In order to continu e the emphasis on direct patient care, these FEHS funds that provide other types of administrative support for the Facilities appropriation may share in appropriate assessment charges proportionate to the underlying activities. For example, a centrally managed assessment for payroll services that is charged by the number of employees may be proportionately paid under both the Services and Facilities appropriations according to the number of staff supported by each appropriation.

The sub -activity directly supports the Agency's priorities including: (1) people ; (2) partnerships ; (3) quality ; and (4) resources . The IHS owns approximately 10,004,000 square feet of facilities (totaling 2,144 buildings) and 1,723 acres of federal and trust land. The nature of space varies from sophisticated medical centers to residential units and utility plants. Facilities range in age from less than one year to more than 165 years, with an average age greater than 37 years. A professional and fully - functional workforce is essential to ensure effective and efficient operations. An estimated 600 Federal positions (fulltime equivalents) are funded under this sub- activity. Typical staff functions funded may include: Facilities engineers and maintenance staff responsible for ensuring that building systems are operated properly, facilities and grounds are maintained adequately, utilities are managed appropriately, environmental compliance requirements are met, and build ings are safe; Specialized clinical engineers and technicians who maintain and service medical equipment; Realty staff that manages the real property requirements and quarters; and Facilities planning and construction -monitoring that assist in the planning and construction of projects. In addition, FS provides partial funding for related Area and Service Unit operating costs, such as utilities, building operation supplies, facilities-related personal property, and biomedical equipment repair and maintena nce. Accomplishments include supporting health delivery through the attainment of accreditation and the maintenance of the environment of care of buildings, utility systems, life safety systems, and medical equipment. Adequate facilities/maintenance staffing both at the Area Offices and service units are paramount to maintain accreditation, for the continuity of health services, and ensur ing that major building system s function correctly . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS In FY 2017, total utility costs were $16.5 million and total utility costs per Gross Square Feet (GSF) were $3.42/GSF. In FY 2019, the total utility cost is expected to be $17.5 million reflecting a 3.25 percent annual increase. The cost per GSF is expected to rise to approximately $3.64/GSF. IHS makes conscious efforts to help stem the growth in utility costs to ensure appropriations are sufficient to fund these needs. For example, IHS reduced the energy related utility consumption for IHS managed facilities from 148,469 British Thermal Units per Square CJ-189 Foot (BTU/SF) in 2015 to 115,216 BTU/SF in 2017, a 22.4 percent reduction even with a modest increase of energy usage intensity in 2017. Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings and equipment improve the eas e and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. This is all integral to quality health care for AI/ANs. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Environmental Health Support Account (EHSA) provides funding for IHS Area, District, and Service Unit management activities and environmental health staff which include engineers, environmental health officers, environmental health technicians, engineering aides, injury prevention specialists, and institutional environmental health officers. More than 70 percent of these IHS and Tribal staff live and work in Tribal communities; another 20 percent provide regional services to Tribes or IHS facilities; and less than 10 percent of our staff are admin istrative managers. AI/ANs face hazards in their environments that affect their health status, including communities in remote and isolated locations, severe climatic conditions, limited availability of safe housing, lack of safe water supply, and lack of public health and safety legislation. In accordance with congressional direction, these funds are distributed to the Areas based upon the workload and need associated with the two programs noted below. Sanitation Facilities Construction Program (SFC) - This program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated for SFC to provide safe water supply and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people and communities. As a result, infant mortality rates and mortality rates for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have been reduced by about 80 percent since 1973. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state populations in regions with lower proportion of homes and absent of water service, reflect significantly higher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus . 1 Researchers associate the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The absence of clean water to sanitation facilities for tribal households exacerbate concern for the Indian Health Service Clinical Health Care program; further decreasing the quality of life for A I/ANs . Efforts by other public health specialists such as nutritionists and public health nurses are much more effective when safe water and adequate wastewater disposal systems are available in the home. In addition, the availability of such facilities is of fundamental impo rtance to social and economic development, which leads to an improved quality of life and an improved sense of well - being. The SFC Program staff work collaboratively with tribes to assure all communities and homes are provided with safe water supply and waste disposal systems as soon as possible. Under this program in FY 2017 , staff managed and/or provided professional engineering services to construct 429 sanitation projects with a total cost of over $ 253.0 million. The program manages annual project funding that includes contributions from Tribes, states, and other 1 Thomas W. Hennessy, Troy Ritter, Robert C. Holman, Dana L. Bruden, Krista L.

American Journal of Public Health: November 2008, Vol. 98, No. 11, pp. 2072 -2078. CJ-190 federal agencies. The SFC Program is the environmental engineering component of the IHS health delivery system. Services funded include management of st aff, pre -planning, consultation with Tribes, coordination with other federal, state and local governmental entities, identifying supplemental funding outside of IHS, developing local policies and guidelines with Tribal consultation, developing agreements with Tribes and others for each project, providing professional engineering design and/or construction services for water supply and waste disposal facilities, assuring environmental and historical preservation procedures are followed, and assisting Tribes where the Tribes provide construction management. Consistent with the 1994 Congressional set aside for \"...tribal training on the operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities,\" $1 .0 million of these support funds are used for technical assistance, tr aining, and guidance to Indian families and communities regarding the operation and maintenance of water supply and sewage disposal facilities. In accordance with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the staff annually updates its inventory of sanita tion facilities deficiencies for existing Indian occupied homes.2 This is accomplished through extensive consultation with Tribes. The SFC staff also develops and updates an inventory of all open dump sites on Indian lands as required under the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act.3 Both of these inventories are widely used by other governmental agencies in their evaluation and funding of sanitation facilities construction projects. Environmental Health Services Program (EHS) -The EHS program identifies environmental hazards and risk factors in Tribal communities and proposes control measures to prevent adverse health effects. These measures include monitoring and investigating disease and injury; inspections to identify environmental hazards in homes, healthcare facilities, food service establishments, Head Start centers, and many other types of Tribal establishments; and providing training, technical assistance, and project funding ( including competitive cooperative agreements ) to develop the capacity of Tribal communities to address environmental health issues. N ational priority areas include: food safety, children's environments, healthy homes, vector borne and communicable disease, and safe drinking water. EHS provides access to public h ealth services to AI/ANs. Examples include referrals for home investigations to reduce environmental triggers for asthma patients; home investigations to reduce exposure to lead -based paint or other lead hazards (including drinking water sources) for pati ents with elevated blood -lead levels; animal bite investigations in Tribal communities and potential patient exposure to rabies virus; home investigations to address fall risk for elderly and other patients at risk for falls; and referrals for investigatio n of community disease outbreaks from multiple patient exposures to contaminated food or water. The EHS Institutional Environmental Health Program identifies environmental hazards and risk factors in the built environment and proposes control measures t o prevent adverse health effects to patients, staff, and visitors in health care and other community facilities. The IEH program supports healthcare accreditation which improves the quality of care. Maintaining accreditation ensures that IHS continues to have access to third -party funding. 2 Title III, Section 302(g) 1 and 2 of P.L. 94-437. 3 P.L. 103 -399. CJ-191 PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS OEHE staff accomplishments reduce the need for direct healthcare services when environmentally related diseases and injuries are reduced. For example , the IHS Injury Prevention Program has been instrumental in reducing the injury mortality rate of AI/ANs by 58 percent since it moved from an \"education only\" focus to a public health approach based upon effective strategies and initiatives to reduce the devastating burden of injuries experienced by AI/ANs. Preventing severe, debilitating injuries reduce the cost and need for healthcare service; however, the challenge remains that unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death for AI/ANs ages 1 -44. Staff collaborate with IHS and T ribal behavioral health programs in supporting suicide and violence prevention initiatives. Examples include initiatives for training students and teachers on suicide prevention and bullying prevention measures and more recent involvement in efforts supporting prevention of prescription drug overdose. The IEH Program provides technical assistance and program development support for local healthcare worker safety programs. These efforts have led to a reduction in the IHS total occupational injury case rate which has decreased from 4.35 injuries/100 employees in 2004 to 1.97 injuries/100 employees in 2016. The IEH program supports healthcare management by providing local accreditation support including mock environment of care surveys in which regulatory requirements and conditions for general safety, environmental infection control, environmental compliance, fire safety, chemical safety, and radiation safety are accessed and recommendations for corrective action are provided. Staff engage Tribal, county , and state public health and public safety officials in Tribal communities. For example, staff engage local Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement or Tribal police to enhance motor vehicle related injury prevention efforts through child safety seat interventions and enhanced police enforcement activities such as seat belt usage or driving under the influence checkpoints. Staff work extensi vely with Tribal, county, and state health departments on a variety of public health issues including response to food- borne (i.e., salmonellosis), vector -borne (i.e., bubonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, hantavirus), and water -borne (i.e. legionellosis) disease outbreaks. Other examples of collaboration include arbovirus surveillance activities related to emerging diseases and public health emergency preparedness.

For the FY 2017 target, 8 of 10 (80 percent ) of the Area programs implement ed comprehensive interventions using at least three effective strategies to increase seatbelt usage rate in targeted Tribal communities. Examples include: d eveloping or strengthening tribal seat belt laws, i ncreas ing partnerships with tribal police, providing classroom curriculum for motor vehicle crash prevention at reservation schools. In FY2018, Area programs will compare restraint use against the baseline and adju st interventions to improve driver seatbelt usage. Environmental Surveillance: During the 2016-2020 performance cycle, in FY 2016, Area EHS Programs identif ied targeted Tribal Head Start and non -residential day care establishments from which a national baseline of foodborne illness risk factors was calculated. For the FY 2017 target, 10 of 10 (100 percent) of the Areas implement ed and report ed comprehensive interventions using at least three effective strategies to decrease food risk factor deficiencies at targeted Tribal Head Start and non- residential day care establishments. Examples include: develop ing and implement ing active managerial con trol and corrective action plan processes with local operators , focusing food inspection s urveys on targeted risk factors, and providing a ccess to training through the IHS Online Food Handlers Training Course. I n FY 2018, Area programs will compare foodbo rne illness risk factors against the baseline and adjust interventions to decrease food risk factor deficiencies. The FY 2016 - 2020 EHS performance measures focus on reducing the risk of foodborne illness in children's environments and reducing the risk of motor vehicle- related injuries and deaths through increased use of seatbelts. Barriers that may impact the program's ability to meet these targets include competing local, regional and national priorities, staff turn -over, lapsed vacant positions, and a decentralized approach to program management that can result in non - standardized processes across the country. To help mitigate the se barriers , EHS provides ongoing 4percent of drivers use seat belts. 5percent of drivers use seat belts 6percent of foodborne illness risk factors out of compliance CJ-193 competency development through specialized training programs; strategic planning efforts that support uniform program management; and data management tools to support local staff. GRANT AWARDS In FY 2017, the Injury Prevention Program awarded $1,3 25,000 in cooperative agreements to fund 32Tribal programs. In FY 2018, (year three of the five -year agreements) $ 1,325,000 in continuation funds were available to the 32 Tribal programs. OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The IHS Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support activity (OEHE) provides funds for executive management activities, personnel, contracts, contractors, and operating costs for the OEHE Headq uarters. Personnel have management responsibility for IHS facilities and environmental health programs, provide direct technical services and support to Area personnel, perform management functions and have responsibility for all construction contracting in excess of $150,000. Management activities include : national policy development and implementation budget formulation, project review and approval congressional report preparation quality assurance (e.g., internal control reviews, Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act activities and other oversight) technical assistance (e.g., consultation and training) construction contracting long range planning meetings (with HHS, Tribes, and other federal agencies) and recruitment and retention efforts . Typi cal direct support functions are: Project officers and contracting officer representatives for health care facilities construction projects: reviewing and/or writing technical justification documents, participating in design reviews and site surveys, condu cting onsite inspections, and monitoring project funding status. Staff support real property asset management requirements. These actions are to ensure management accountability and the efficient and economic use of federal real property. Staff serving as contracting officer representatives and project officers in support of data systems, cooperative agreements, inter- agency agreements, and community -based projects. In accordance with appropriation committee direction, OEHE staff develop, maintain, and utilize data systems to distribute Facilities Appropriation resources to Area offices for facilities and environmental health activities and construction administration and management, based upon workload and need. Also, technical guidance, information, and training are provided throughout the IHS system in support of the Facilities Appropriation. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following are activities which focus on the IHS mission and priorities: CJ-194 review and approval of P rogram Justification Documents (PJDs) and P rogram Of Requirements (PORs) announcement and review of Joint Venture and Small Ambulatory projects awarding and monitoring contracts for all aspects of the Facilities Appropriation, including all types of construction contracts and 638 const ruction project agreements. OEHE coordinating construction, environmental health, and real property activities through the 12 Area Offices to ensure program consistency, to ensure the most effective use of resources across IHS, and to support field programs through budget preparation and required reporting, thus ensuring the most effective, accountable use of resources to improve access to quality healthcare services. OEHE strengthens the overall management of IHS by reviewing and approving the planning documents for health care facilities construction projects called PJDs and PORs. Also, announcements and review of joint venture and small ambulatory projects which represent quality health care infrastructure which addresses assessing health care and imp roving health care delivery including behavioral health services which are included during the planning process. The OEHE facilities programs integrate strategic planning, performance, and program integrity into the office's daily business practices. One example is the Sanitation Facilities Construction Strategic planning efforts and identification of needs. Implementation of this plan has improved project management, reduced project durations and transformed the data system used by IHS and federal partner s to manage sanitation programs in Indian country. Another example is the Environmental Health program strategic visioning and the Ten Essential Environmental Health Services as a framework. Implementation of both of these initiatives is ongoing.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Equipment funds are used for maintenance, upgrades, replacement, and the purchase of new medical equipment systems at Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal healthcare facilities. It directly supports the Agency's priorities of Partnerships and Quality. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care providers using modern and effective medical equipment/systems to assure the best possible health diagnosis . The IHS and tribal health programs manage approximately 90,000 devices consisting of laboratory, medical imaging, patient monitoring, pharmacy, and other biomedical, diagnostic, and patient equipment valued at approximately $500 million. With today's medical devices/systems having an average life expectancy of approximately six years and rapid technological advancements, medical equipment replacement is a continual process making it necessary to replace worn out equipment or provide equipment with newer technology to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. To replace the equipment at the end of its six - year life would require approximately $84.0 million per year. Equipment Funds Allocation Method The IHS Equipment funds are allocated in three categories: Tribally- constructed hea lth care facilities, TRANSAM program, and new and replacement equipment: 1. Tribally -Constructed Health Care Facilities - The IHS provides medical equipment funds to support the initial purchase of equipment for tribally- constructed health care facilities. The Budget Request supports approximately $5 million for competitive awards to Tribes and Tribal organizations that construct new or expand health care facilities space using non-IHS funding sources. Tribes and Tribal Organizations will use these funds to serve approximately 500,000 patients with newly purchased medical equipment. CJ-196 2. TRANSAM and Ambulance Programs - Equipment funds may be used to acquire new and like- new excess medical equipment from the Department of Defense (DoD) or other sources through the TRANSAM (i.e., Transfer of DoD Excess Medical and Other Supplies to Native Americans) Program and to procure ambulances for IHS and Triba l emergency medical services programs.1 The Budget includes $500,000 for the TRANSAM Program from the Equipment budget. Under the TRANSAM Program, excess equipment and supplies, at an annual estimated value of $5 .0 million, are acquired for distribution to federal and Tribal sites. 3. New and Replacement Equipment -Approximately $14. 452 million will be allocated to IHS and Tribal health care facilities to maintain existing and purchase new medical equipment, including the replacement of existing equipment used in diagnosing illnesses.

P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Determination and Education Assistance Act ( ISDEAA), P.L. 93-638, provides Tribe s or Tribal Organizations ( T/TO ) the authority to contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Indian Health Service (IHS), to operate Federal programs serving eligible persons and to receive not less than the amount of funding that the Secretary would have otherwise provided for the direct o peration of the program for the period covered by the contract (otherwise known as the \"Secretarial amount\"). The 1988 amendments to the Act authorized Contract Support Costs (CSC) be paid in addition to the Secretarial amount. CSC are defined as necess ary and reasonable costs for activities that T/TO must carry out to ensure compliance with the contract and prudent management but that the Secretary either did not normally carry out in his or her direct operation of the program or provided from resources other than those transferred under contract. The IHS CSC policy was established in 1992 and most recently revised in October 2016,1 an update to reflect necessary changes. These changes have included the method by which Congress has funded CSC , moving f rom a system of limited awards to uncapped awards , and the provision of CSC as an indefinite appropriation. CSC is administered for IHS by t he Office of Direct Services and Contracting Tribes (ODSCT), an office with responsibility for three primary functions that directly impact the relationship with each Indian T/TO. The ODSCT serves as the primary conduit between the IHS and the Direct Service Tribes, management of P.L. 93 -638 Title I, ISDEAA contracts, and CSC in support of both Title I contracts and Title V compacts. 1 Indian Health Manual , Part 6 - Services to Tribal Governments and Organizations, Chapter 3 - Contract Support Costs, available at http://www.ihs.gov/ihm/index.cfm?module=dsp_ihm_pc_p6c3 . CJ-201 PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Following is a summary CSC funds for FY 2014 - FY 2017, as of FY 2017 included $800 million, but using updated projections, only $718 million was apportioned to IHS. 2 Funds remain in process for payment to tribes and/or pending final reconciliation with tribes to determine the final amounts. IHS Headquarters reconciles CSC fund request s on a quarterly basis and allocates funds to each regional office to pay tribes. IHS uses the CSC automated data system to track and monitor all CSC activity. The CSC data set is used to track all CSC funds, including any new and expanded assumption, renegotiation of CSC amounts , and distribution of funds. IHS also uses the system to project CSC need based on the most current data. IHS updated its CSC Policy in October 2016 and has worked diligently to implement the policy by providing training and guidance to internal and external customers. The updated policy provides detailed guidance and clarifies the data used to determine each T/TO's estimated CSC need and/or final amount. The policy describes IHS's business process and includes a calculation too l which is used to determine each T/TO 's CSC amount and subsequent payment is consistent with the ISDEAA. In addition to ongoing internal and external training on the updated CSC Policy to ensure that consistent business practices are used throughout the IHS, in April 2017, IHS rolled out CSC video clips that are available for external customers, with the primary focus of changes in the updated CSC policy. On August 16, the IHS CSC Workgroup met to review the implementation process for the recently updated CSC Policy, specifically to engage in tribal input on the updated CSC policy. IHS will use this information to further efforts to improve business processes. The updated IHS CSC policy implemented in late 2016 include s a provision that provide s a simpl ified calculation of indirect CSC on recurring service unit shares, referred to as the 97/3. After a year of implementing the revised CSC Policy, the IHS has found that in certain instances, the section of the policy relating to an alternative met hod for calculating indirect costs (IDC) associated with recurring Service Unit shares - also referred to as the \"97/3 method\" or \"97/3 split\" - does not conform with the statutory authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (IS DEAA). On December 2 1, after careful review and consideration, the IHS temporarily recinded this provision until such time that the IHS is able to work with the IHS CSC Workgroup and subsequently Tribal Consul tation on an y changes. IHS continues to use the internal electronic database to monitor each Title I and V ISDEAA negotiation, including CSC negotiations. The database will monitor each phase of a negotiation to ensure that IHS uses a consistent agency business approach, deadlines are met, and funding amounts are correctly calculated. This supports an agency -wide approach to monitor and improve the overall negotiation process. In addition, the information will CJ-202 track new and expanded activity assumptions and will be used to determine the status of funds, workload, planning of resources, and subsequent years' funding needs. For FY 2017, IHS paid $15,181,584 million for one time direct CSC for pre-award and startup funds for 14 tribes that assumed new program, functions , services, and activities (PFSAs) or renegotiated their direct or indirect type CSC amount. IHS continues to make progress in resolving Contract Disputes Act claims from T/TO for additional CSC funding for prior years . As of Febrary 23, 2018, the IHS has extended settlement offers on 1,495 of the 1,5 79 claims, with settlement payments of approximately $860 million that has been tentative or confirmed for payment from the Judgment Fund.

FY 2019 Authorization ....................................................................... Expires September 30, 2019 Allocation Method ......................................................................................... Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant program provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention t o approximately 301 Indian Health Service (IHS) , Tribal , and Urban (I/T/U) Indian health grant programs. Funds for SDPI were first author ized in FY 1998; as such, FY 2019 would be the 22 nd year of the SDPI . SDPI operates with a usual budget of $150 million per year and is currently authorized through September 30, 2019. The IHS Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS) Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) provides leadership, programmatic, administrative, and technical oversight to the SDPI grant program. The mission of the DDTP is to develop, document, and sustain public health efforts to prevent and control diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) by promoting collaborative strategies through its extensive diabetes network . The diabetes network consists of a national program office, Area Diabetes Consultants in each of the 12 IHS Areas, and approximately 301 SDPI grants and sub- grants at I/T/U sites across the country. CJ-204 Target Population: American Indians and Alaska Natives Diabetes and its complications are major contributors to death and disability in nearly every Tribal community. AI/AN adults have the highest age- adjusted rate of diagnosed diabetes (15.1 percent) among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States, m ore than twice the rate of the non-Hispanic white population (7.4 percent).1 In some AI/AN communities, more than half of adults 45 to 74 years of age have diagnosed diabetes, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 60 percent. 2 Allocation Method In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress instructed the IHS to use SDPI funds to \"establish grants for the prevention and treatment of diabetes\" to address the growing problem of diabetes in AI/ANs. The entities eligible to receive these grants were I/T/Us . The IHS distributes this funding to approximately 301 I/T/U sites annually through a process that includes Tribal consultation/Urban confer , development of a formula for distribution of funds, and a formal grant application and administrative proc ess. Strategy The SDPI brings Tribes together to work toward a common purpose and share information and lessons learned. The Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee, established in 1998, reviews information on the SDPI progress and provides recommendations on diabetes- related issues to the IHS Director. Through partnerships with federal agencies, private organizations, and an extensive I/T/U network, DDTP undertook one of the most strategic diabetes treatment and prevention efforts ever attempted in AI/AN communities and demonstrated the ability to design, manage, and measure a complex, long -term project to address this chronic condition. Because of the significant costs associated with treating diabetes, I/T/Us have used best and promising practices for th eir local SDPI funding to address the primary, secondary , and tertiary prevention of diabetes and its complications. This collaborative approach supports the strategic planning process necessary to identify the goals and objectives needed to achieve the intended SDPI outcomes. This process aligns with the IHS priorit ies to renew and strengthen partnerships with Tribes and also to improve access to quality health care.

Available at : https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national -diabetes -statistics -report.pdf 2 Lee ET, Howard BV, Savage PJ, et al. Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in three American Indian populations aged 45 -74 years: the Strong Heart Study. Diabetes Care . 1995;18:599 -610. CJ-205 As directed by Congress and Tribal consultation, the SDPI consists of t wo major components: (1) SDPI Grant Program; and (2) Diabetes data and program delivery infrastructure. 1. SDPI Grant Program The SDPI grant program (formerly called the SDPI Community -Directed grant program) provide s $138.7 million per year in grants and technical assistance for local diabetes treatment and prevention services at I/T/U health programs in 35 states. Each of the communities served by the SDPI grant program is unique in that its diabetes treatment and prevention needs and priorities are defined locally. Based on these local needs and priorities, the SDPI grant programs implement proven interventions to address the diabetes epidemic. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 established statutory authority for SDPI to implement a best practices approach to diabetes treatment and prevention. The SDPI has incorporated these Indian Health Diabetes Best Practices into the SDPI g rant application process used throughout AI/AN communities. Grant programs are required to document the use of one SDPI Diabetes Best Practice, 3 corresponding evaluation measures, and progress in achieving program objectives in order to enhance accountability. Grantees receive traini ng on how to collect, evaluate, and improve their data collection and use it to improve their outcome results. Impact of the SDPI Grant Programs SDPI funding has enabled staff and programs at the local and national levels to increase access to diabetes treatment and prevention services throughout the Indian health system. The following table demonstrates substantial increases in access to many activities and services: Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals Access in 1997 Access in 2015 Absolute Percentage increase Diabetes clinics 31% 64% +33% Diabetes registered dieticians diabetes education programs Access to physical activity specialists Adult weight management programs 19% 73% +54% Clinical Diabetes Outcomes During SDPI At the same time that access to these diabetes services increased, key outcome measures for AI/ANs with diabetes showed improvement or maintenance at or near national targets. These results have been sustained throughout the inception of SDPI. Examples include: Improving Blood Sugar Control 3 Available at https://www.ihs.gov/sdpi/sdpi- community -directed/diabetes -best-practices/ CJ-206 Blood sugar control among AI/ANs with diabetes served by the IHS has improved over time. The average blood sugar level (as measured by the A1C test) decreased from 9.0 percent in 1996 to 8.2 percent in 201 7, nearing the A1C goal for most patients of less than 8 percent. Improving Blood Lipid Levels Average LDL cholesterol (i.e., \"bad\" cholesterol) declined from 118 mg/dL in 1998 to 91 mg/dL in 2017, surpassing the goal of less than 100 mg/dL. Reducing Kidney F ailure The rate of new cases of kidney failure due to diabetes leading to dialysis declined by more than half (54 percent ) in AI/AN people from 1996 to 2013. This is a much larger decline than in any other racial group in the US. 44 2. Diabetes Data and Program Delivery Infrastructure The IHS has used funding from the SDPI to strengthen the diabetes data infrastructure of the Indian health system by improving diabetes surveillance and evaluation capabilities. SDPI supports the development and implementation of the IHS Electronic Health Record, and the IHS Diabetes Management System in all 12 IHS Areas. Facilities associated with SDPI programs participate in the annual IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit. The Diabetes Audit is the cornerstone of the IHS DDTP diabetes care surveillance system, tracking annual performance on diabetes care and health outcome measures. Data collection for the Diabetes Audit follows a standardized protocol to ensure statistical integrity and comparability of measures over time. The 2017 Diabetes Audit inc luded a review of 124,822 patient charts at 33 3 I/T/U health facilities. The Diabetes Audit enables IHS and the SDPI programs to monitor and evaluate yearly performance at the local, regional, and national levels. DDTP provides D iabetes Audit training th rough online and webinar formats. DDTP receives evaluations on all trainings provided to guide improvements for future sessions. Key Performance/Accomplishments Annual SDPI assessments have shown significant improvements in diabetes clinical care and community services provided over time when compared to the baseline SDPI assessment in 1997 (see table above titled \"Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals\"). Ongoing efforts to improve blood glucose, blood pressure, an d cholesterol values will continue to reduce the risk for microvascular, as well as macrovascular complications (see \"Outputs/Outcomes \" table below). Reporting In addition to internal monitoring of the SDPI Grant Program, the DDTP has completed f ive SDPI Reports to Congress to document the progress made since 1997. The SDPI Reports to Congress are as follows: 4 Bullock A, Burrows NR, Narva AS, et al.

Grants PROGRAM DESCRIPTION American Indians and Alaska Natives had the highest drug overdose death rates in 2015, and the largest percentage change increase in drug overdose deaths from 1999 -2015 of any population at 519 percent. The IHS Tribal Opioid Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Support ( Tribal Opioid Support) grants pr ogram aims to confront the opioid crisis in AI/AN communities by providing targeted funding to increase access to treatment and reduce opioid overdose related deaths through prevention, treatment, and recovery options. Activities will support a comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic with a specific focus to integrate primary care and substance use prevention and treatment activities and establish or enhance community- based support serv ices, such as peer support, behavioral health aides, transitional housing, and other recovery support services. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Tribal Opioid Support grant program will support the following activities: Develop a comprehensive Tribal action plan to address gaps in prev ention, treatment, and recovery. Implement primary and secondary prevention approaches, including culturally appropriate interventions, to reduce the number of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose deaths. Implement or expand clinically appropriate treatment for OUDs, such as medication assisted treatment (MAT) . Hire health care providers, such as physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, counselors, social workers, nurses, care coordinators, and case managers. CJ-212 Provide peer and other recovery support ser vices, such as behavioral health aides or other behavioral health providers. Cover treatment costs, such as MAT provided by referral providers. Establish telehealth services to increase access to MAT services. Purchase naloxone for distribution among fi rst responders and families of individuals with OUDs. Provide services in criminal justice settings or other rehabilitative settings operated by Tribes and/or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Establish or enhance community -based recovery support networks, such as transitional housing, vocational rehabilitation, sober living communities, and/or vital culturally appropriate supports and services. Establish or enhance surveillance systems to increase the capacity of AI/AN communities to monitor the impact of the opioid epidemic on their tribal citizens and/or service population and assess their progress. Program accomplishments will be determined through the submission of annual reports from funded projects to include the number of people receiving OUD treatment, number of people in recover services, number of providers implementing MAT, number of health care prov iders hired as a result of the grant funding , number and rates of opioid use, and numbers and rates of opioid overdose- related deaths.

As part of this effort, the budget requests $150 million for activities in IHS, which is not reflected in this table. MISSION The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing Federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). IHS supports substance abuse treatment and prevention services as part of this mission. METHODOLOGY The IHS includes the appropriation for Alcohol and Substance Abuse (excluding the amount designated as Adult Alcohol Treatment) and the portion of Urban Indian Health Program (UIHP) funds from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs transferred to the IHS under the UIHP budget. BUDGET SUMMARY In FY 2019, IHS requests $ 117.8 million for its drug control activities , an increase of $ 7.8 over the FY 2018 Annualized CR level . CJ-214 Alcohol and Substance Abuse FY 2019 Request: $ 114.2 million (Increase of $ 7.8 million above the FY 2018 Annualized CR) The FY 2019 budget request is necessary to maintain the program's progress in addressing the alcohol and substance abuse needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele-behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services. Urban Indian Health Program - Alcohol and Substance Abuse Title V Grants FY 2019 Request: $ 3.6 million (Increase of $29,000 above the FY 2018 Annualized CR) The FY 2019 request includes funding for the Urban Indian Health Program which will be used to continue serving urban AI/ANs impacted by alcohol and substance abuse through the Title V grant program, Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment. Substance abuse prevention, treatment, and education programs address alcohol/drugs, suicide, self- esteem, injury control, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. Several Urban Indian Health Programs have active partnerships with their local Veterans Health Administrati on programs and several have identified joint alcohol and substance abuse initiatives. ONDCP FUNDING PRIORITIES In FY 2019, the IHS budget request for its drug control activities supports the Office of National Drug Control Policy's (ONDCP) funding prior ities. IHS established a multi -disciplinary workgroup to focus on Prescription Drug Abuse in Indian Country in 2012. In March 2017, IHS elevated its workgroup to a National Committee on Heroin, Opioids, and Pain Efforts (HOPE) Committee comprised of multidisciplinary team members with pharmacy, medical, nursing, and behavioral health professional backgrounds. The HOPE Committee will work from a framework based on six tenets: 1) Establishing IHS policies; 2) Training Health Care Providers; 3) Ensuring Effective Pain Management; 4) Increasing Access to Naloxone; 5) Expanding Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT); and 6) Reducing the Inappropriate Use of Methadone. IHS policy work includes establishing the Indian Health Manual (IHM) Chapter 30 \"Chronic Non-Cancer Pain\" and Chapter 32 \"State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.\" The purpose of Chapter 30 is to assist IHS providers to provide prompt and effective assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic non- cancer pain. In 2016, IHS Implemented IHM Chapter 32, a groundbreaking new policy regarding opioid prescribing which requires all healthcare providers working in IHS federal-government-operated facilities, including doctors, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other providers who prescribe opioids, to check state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program databases prior to prescribing opioids for pain treatment longer than seven days and periodically throughout chronic pain treatment, one of the first such actions by any federal agency involved in direct medical care. IHS implemented a mandatory training course, entitled \"IHS Essential Training,\" for all Federal prescribers, contractors, residents and trainees who prescribe controlled substances and spend at least 50 percent of their time in a clinical setting. The purpose of this training is to assure that providers have the knowledge needed to appropriately and effectively prescribe controlled substance medications. In FY 2017, IHS trained 96 percent of its providers who are re quired to CJ-215 attend the training. Many Tribal and Urban Indian providers have also taken advantage of the no cost training. IHS will continue to offer the training on a regular basis to capture new employees who require training, as well as offer refresher courses every three years. To assist providers as they provide effective and optimal pain management, IHS developed two websites \"Opioid Use Disorder Management\" available at https://www.ihs.gov/odm and \"Pain Management,\" available at https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement which provide resources, current clinical guidelines, and best practices for providers in the Indian health system. IHS, in partnership with the University New Mexico Pain Center, provides IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian providers with weekly, real -time consultation with experts in the field of pain management and additional web- based educational services. To increase access to naloxone , IHS signed a memorandum of agreement with Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The agreement allows IHS to provide BIA officers with training and naloxone rescue kits for responding to incidents of opioid overdose. This partnership has put naloxone in the hands of law enforcement officers, who are often the first responders to incidents of opioid overdose in Tribal communities. IHS is working to increase access to MAT, the use of medications with counseling and behavioral therapies, to treat opioid use disorders. IHS is currently working to increase the number of primary care providers who have been trained to prescribe MAT. IHS provided waiver training in the Bemidji and Albuquerque IHS Areas in FY 2017. IHS is actively working to reduce the use of methadone for pain management. Recent guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed to several studies showing that the use of methadone in the treatment of chronic pain was associated with a much high er number of overdose deaths compared to other opioid pain relievers and therefore recommended against using it as a first line medication for the treatment of pain . IHS is currently updating policies to align with this recommendation and providing training to Indian health system providers. In FY 2019, IHS will continue to serve AI/ANs impacted by substance abuse and dependence through its Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) and other IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian operated substance abuse treatment and prevention programs. In addition to those direct services, the IHS Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Progr am (SASP) (formerly known as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, or MSPI ) is a nationally -coordinated grant program, focusing on providing targeted substance abuse and suicide prevention and intervention resources to communities in AI/AN communities with the greatest need for these programs. There is mutual development and implementation of the SASP with Tribes, Tribal programs, Urban Indian organizations, and other Federal agencies which now provides support nationally . The strategic g oal is to support Tribal programs in their continued substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services. These efforts represent an innovative partnership with IHS to deliver services developed by the communities themselves, with a national support network for ongoing program development and evaluation. IHS continues to support the integration of substance abuse treatment into primary care and emergency services through its activities to implement Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Tre atment (SBIRT) . IHS has incorporated SBIRT as a national measure to be tracked and reported. CJ-216 The IHS provides several training opportunities annually on alcohol and substance abuse issues for its providers. In FY 2017, the TBHCE, in partnership with the University of New Mexico, provided more than 8,920 hours of training on current and pressing behavioral health issues through a series of webinars, including a concentrated focus on substance use disorders with topics including : Introduction to Addiction; Opioid Dependence; Chronic Pain and Depression; Anxiety and Chronic Pain; Fibromyalgia; Chronic Pain and Neurology; Epidemiology of Chronic Pain; Non -Opioid Pain Medication; Screening for Misuse, Diversion, Buprenorphine; FASD; Naloxone and MAT for Opioid Dependence. To provide clinical support for providers, IHS launched weekly Pain and Addiction consultations, in partne rship with the University of New Mexico. Healthcare providers may receive a no -cost consultation from an expert panel on the most challenging pain and addiction cases. The TBHCE evaluates models of care delivery, access to care, and sustainability. A to olkit is available for sites to prepare the infrastructure for tele-behavioral health services. In FY 2017, 12,212 patient encounters were provided nationally via tele-behavioral health. As IHS promotes the use of MAT programming, future development work includes options to expand tele-health for MAT maintenance. In FY 2019, IHS will begin to track the number of naloxone prescriptions as part of our efforts to increase access to naloxone . FY 2019 Changes (no change): IHS will continue to serve AI/ANs impacted by substance abuse and dependence through its YRTCs and other IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian operated substance abuse treatment and prevention programs. Indian Health Service Selected Measures of Performance FY 201 7 Target FY 201 7 Achieved \u00bb Universal a lcohol screening \u00bb Accreditation rate for Youth Regional Treatment Centers in operation 18 months or more \u00bb Report on number of emergency department patients who receive SUD intervention Report on number of SUD services in primary care clinics Baseline 100% 41,696 121,343 68.0% 100% 39,658 113,497 Information regarding the performance of the drug control efforts of IHS is based on agency GPRA/GPRAMA documents and other information that measures the agency's contribution to the National Drug Control Strategy from O ffice of National Drug Control P olicy. The table above and accompanying text below represent highlights of IHS's achievements during FY 2017, the latest year for which data are available. The selected performance measures reported in the table provide targets and results from both Tribally- Operated Health Programs and Federally - Administered Health Programs. To provide more comprehensive routine screening, IHS expand ed its Alcohol Screening measure to include all patients 12 through 75 years of age in FY 2017 and retired the Alcohol Screening measure for female patients. Addit ionally, IHS report ed a new SBIRT measure that had 2017 baseline results of 3.0 percent . CJ-217 The accreditation measure for YRTCs reflects an evaluation of the quality of care associated with accreditation status by either the Joint Commission, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), state certification, or regional Tribal health authority certification. For youth with substance use disorders, the YRTCs provide invaluable treatment services. The accreditation measure for YRTCs reflects an evaluation of the quality of care by either the Joint Commission, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), or State licensure. The IHS monitors two program measures on the number of substance use disorder (SUD) encounters provided in emergency departments and primary care clinics. In FY 201 8, IHS will include overall SUD encounters provided in all clinical settings across the health system to aid in promoting integrated SUD services. Tracking overall clinical SUD encounters will allow IHS to report on the effectiveness of IHS programs that focus on drug abuse . In FY 2017, the result for SUD encounters across all IHS clinics was 688,514 encounters. Office of Urban Indian Health Programs Urban Indian Organizations (UIO) are resources to both tribal and urban communities. UIO that offer inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment have become reliable referral sites for tribes . In FY 2019 IHS is proposing $3.6 million for the urban ONDCP budget. AI/AN people who live in urban centers present a unique morbidity and mortality profile. Urban AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately higher mortality from certain causes in sharp contrast to mainstream society. These unique challenges require a targeted response. Existing UIO see their efforts in health education, health promotion, and disea se prevention as essential to impacting the behavioral contributors to poor health: 1 Alcohol-induced death rates are 2.8 times greater for urban AI/AN people than all races in urban areas. Chronic liver disease death rates are 2.1 times greater for urban A I/AN people than all races in urban areas. Tuberculosis death rates are 2 times greater for urban AI/AN people than all races in urban areas. Accidents and external causes of death rates are 1.4 times greater for urban AI/AN people than all races in urban areas. Alcohol and drug -related deaths continue to plague urban AI/AN. Alcohol-induced mortality rates for urban AI/AN are markedly higher than all races in urban areas. All regions, 2 with the exception of eastern seaboard cities in the Nashville Area, show dramatically higher rates for urban AI/AN than for all races in urban areas who live in the same communities: the Billings Area is 4 times greater, the Phoenix Area is 6 times greater, the Tucson Area is 6.7 times greater, and the Great Plains Area has a 13.4 times greater alcohol-induced rate of mortality. 3 Urban AI/AN populations are more likely to engage in health risk behaviors. Urban AI/AN are more likely to report heavy or binge drinking compared to all races and urban AI/AN are 1.7 times more likely to smoke cigarettes. Urban AI/AN more often view themselves in poor or only fair health status, with 22.6 percent reporting fair/poor health as compared to 14.7 percent of all races reporting as fair/poor. 1 Indian Health Service, Office of Urban Indian Health Programs, Urban Needs Assessment Report , 201 5. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. CJ-218 UIO e mphasis on integrating behavioral health, health education, health promotion and disease prevention into primary care offered within a culturally appropriate framework, leads to positive outcomes for urban AI/AN. Urban AI/AN in need of substance abuse treatment commonly exhibit co -occurring disorders. UIO programs have recognized the need for more mental health and substance abuse counselors to adequately address the needs presented by AI/AN with co - occurring disorders. AI/AN need gender- and age-appropr iate substance abuse treatment. Stakeholders reported the need for more age- and gender- appropriate resources for substance abuse treatment. While male AI/AN can encounter wait times for treatment admission up to 6 months, treatment options for youth, women, and women with children can be greater than 6 months. Some of the best AI/AN treatment programs for youth, women, and women with children are administered by UIO. Affecting lifestyle changes among urban AI/AN families requires a culturally sensitive approach. The existing UIO have operated culturally appropriate initiatives to reduce health risk factors. UIO continued efforts to target behavioral or lifestyle changes offer the best hope for impacting the major health challenges of the urban AI/AN population. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is used to describe a range of effects that can occur in someone whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. FASD includes disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related neuro developmental disorder (ARND), and alcohol- related birth defects (ARBD) . Interventions are needed in urban centers to address prevention efforts for urban AI/AN with a FASD. The IHS Policy on Conferring with Urban Indian Organizations identifies FASD as a provision that require s the IHS to confer with UIO \"to develop and implement culturally sensitive assessment and diagnostic tools including dysmorphology clinics and multidisciplinary fetal alcohol spectrum disorders clinics for use in Indian communities and urban centers.\" Heavy drinking during pregnancy can cause significant birth defects, including FAS. FAS is the leading and most preventable cause of intellectual disability. The rates of FAS are higher among AI/ANs than the general population. Screening with intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol misuse in pregnancy and to reduce the incidence of FAS.

Health Education: The FY 2018 Annualized CR amount for Health Education is $18,608,000, with the program discontinued in FY 2019. The rationale for discontinuing this program is to concentrate funding for clinical services and staffing costs of new and r eplacement health care facilities to provide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). This program has played a role in IHS's approach to Native American health care, but direct health care services are a priority. Community Health Representatives: The FY 2018 Annualized CR amount for Community Health Representatives is $59,915,000, with the program discontinued in FY 2019. The rationale for discontinuing this program is to concentrate funding for clinical services and staffing of new and replacement health care facilities to provide health care to AI/ANs. This program ha s played a role in IHS's approach to Native American health care. Tribal Management Grant Program : The FY 2018 Annualized CR amount for the Tribal Management Grant Program is $ 2,448,000, with the program discontinued in FY 2019. The rationale for discontinuing this program is to concentrate funding for clinical services and staffing of new and replacement health care facilities to provide health care to AI/ANs. This program ha s played a role in IHS's approach to Native American health care.

Provide the number of PCA agreements per additional category for the PY, CY and BY. Not applicable . 8) Provide the maximum annual PCA amount paid to each category of physician in your agency and explain the reasoning for these amounts by category. Maximum annual PCA for Category I (Clinical Position) - $30,000. Factors used were board certification, multi- year agreements, shortage specialty, location (remote), and duties . Maximum annual PCA for Category IV -B (Health and Medical Administration) - $18,000. Factors used were board certification, multi-year agreement, categorical al lowance. 9) Explain the recruitment and retention problem(s) for each category of physician in your agency (this should demonstrate that a current need continues to persist). (Please include any staffing data to support your explanation, such as number an d duration of unfilled positions and number of accessions and separations per fiscal year.) Overall, Physician vacancy rates continue in the 20% range due to a shortage of physicians, particularly in primary care specialties. IHS has moved to using Title 38 Physician and Dentist Pay instead of PCA as the only option to compete successfully with private sector salaries. Many of our previous PCA recipients have been converted to Title 38. 10) Explain the degree to which recruitment and retention problems were alleviated in your agency through the use of PCAs in the prior fiscal year. (Please include any staffing data to support your explanation, such as number and duration of unfilled position s and number of accessions and separations per fiscal year.) IHS is using Title 38 Physician and Dentist Pay authority more than PCA authority at this point in time. In general, PCA does not provide the pay flexibility needed to recruit and retain Physic ians. 11) Provide any additional information that may be useful in planning PCA staffing levels and amounts in your agency. Over the next few years IHS PCA levels should decrease . This is based on knowledge of the physicians' contract dates and management intent. If the recipients predicted to change to T38 PDP are converted then only 3 doctors will be left receiving PCA .

Tribes have specifically requested that priority areas for funding focus on diabetes treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and health professions. The Committee directs the Service to provide, no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, a detailed plan with specific dollar amounts identified to fully fund and implement the IHCIA (p. 82 ). Action taken or to be taken IHS appreciates the Committee's interest in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. A comprehensive plan, including dollar amounts would require significantly more time than the 90 days allotted in the report, as well as dedicated resources ( e.g., necessary funding for a health economist and a team of researchers). Reimbursable Funding \u2014The Committee directs the Service to report, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on patient population and service growth over the past ten years and the funding sources used to provide for these medical services. The IHS is to include a breakdown, by dollar amount and percentage, of funding sources which supplement appropriated dollars to cover the provision of medical services at IHS operated and tribally contracted and compacted facilities. The Committee is interested in detailed information on whether medical services have been able to expand over this time period as a result of increases in the ability to charge medical services to supplem entary funding sources. As a point of comparison, and to the extent possible, the Service shall compare these impacts across the twelve IHS areas, with the degree to which patient populations services in the respective states has increased (p. 82). Action taken or to be taken IHS appreciates the Committee's interest in this topic. IHS will be able to provide information on user population growth over the last 10 years and could provide information on third party collection for federal facilities. In ad dition, the IHS could provide information on the funding sources and comparisons for IHS operated facilities, however ; Tribally contracted and compacted facilities are not required to provide information on funding sources . IHS can encourage tribally contracted and compacted facilities to report this information. Health Care Facilities Construction -The recommendation includes $117,991 ,000 for health care facilities construction, $17,991,000 above the budget request and equal to the fiscal year 201 7 enacted level. The Committee remains dedicated to providing access to health care for IHS patients across the system. The IHS is expected to aggressively work down the current Health Facilities Construction Priority Syste m list, as well as work with the Department and Tribes to examine alternative financing arrangements and meritorious regional demonstration projects authorized under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act that that would effectively close the service gap. Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, the Service shall submit a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations that details the project-level distribution of funds provided for healthcare facilities construction. The IHS has no defined benefit pack age and is not designed to CJ-227 be comparable to the private sector health care system. IHS does not provide the same health services in each area. Health services provided to a community depend upon the facilities and services available in the local area, the facilities' financial and personnel resources (42 CFR 136.11 (c)), and the needs of the service population. In order to determine whether IHS patients across the system have comparable access to healthcare, the IHS is directed to conduct and publish a gap analysis of the locations and capacities of patient health facilities relative to the IHS user population. The analysis should include: facilities within the IHS system, including facilities on the Health Facilities Construction Priority System list and the Joint Venture Construction Program list; and where possible facilities within private or other Federal health systems for which arrangements with IHS exist, or should exist, to see IHS patients. (p. 83 ). Action taken or to be taken The House Bill for FY 2018 proposes $117,991,000, which is $17,991,000 above the President's Budget request. The additional funds would be used to continue two priority list projects. In addition, within 60 days of the appropriation, the Service shall submit a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations with the project- level distribution for healthcare facilities construction. This analysis is similar to the \"Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress\" required every 5 years (last report was 2016). There is a technical workgroup working on the 2021 report. The analysis and report are a multi- year task. There are over 13,000 communities and almost 4,000 IHS, tribal and private facilities within the IHS dat a base to verify, analyze and compare. There is no due date for submission of the report in the House Report 115-238. The same language appeared in House Report 114-632 (2017 budget documents). The OEHE intends to incorporate as much of the analysis as possible into the 2021 Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress. CJ-228 INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FY 2019 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFICATION Senate Report 115-000 Significant Items Quality of Care \u2014The Committee is extremely concerned about the lack of access to quality healthcare for Tribes around the Nation, including the ongoing healthcare quality problems in the Great Plains. In order to address these issues, the Committee recommendation includes a pilot program and related directives to improve access to quality health services and to improve recruitment and retention of qualified medical personnel as detailed below (p. 91) : Housing Improvements \u2014In addition to funds provided for staffing quarters within the Facilities Appropriation, the administrative provisions section of the bill also contains new language allowing for a program to provide a housing subsidy to medical personnel at facilities operated by the Indian Health Service. The Committee is concerned that the lack of affordable and available housing plays a significant role in the agency's personnel vacancy rates and contributes to lowering the quality of care. The Committee expects the Service to provide a plan within 90 days of enactment of this Act that details how the agency plans to use this authority in fiscal year 2018, including the measures it will use to determine whether the authority is successful and how it should be expanded in future years. The Committee notes that it has restored funds for accreditation emergencies that could be made available for this purpose. The Committee also directs the Service to work with Tribes and with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop a long- term strategy to address professional housing shortages in Indian Country and to ensure that the Service and its partner agencies are fully utilizing existing autho rities to improve the availability of housing stock (p. 92). Action taken or to be taken The IHS will work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Tribes and Tribal Housing Authorities to explore and develop strategies that expands the hou sing stock available to non-local, professional providers where there is currently a shortage. The IHS will provide a plan that details how the Agency plans to use this authority within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Workforce Development \u2014The Committ ee believes that expanded workforce development training for all Service personnel\u2014including non- clinical personnel \u2014must be part of efforts to improve healthcare quality. In addition to continuing skills development opportunities, the Committee believes that IHS should expand its efforts to provide education to all staff and Federal employee management training to facility and area leadership that will provide employees a better understanding of their obligations to report failures in quality of care (p. 92) . Action taken or to be taken IHS has provided quality improvement and patient safety training to clinical and non- clinical staff through the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School in FY 2017, continuing into FY 2018. The Open School curriculum is recognized worldwide and has become a required curriculum element in some US medical schools. IHS has made this training available to staff who have not previously completed it via two methods: ambulatory health center staff can access the trainin g through the IHS Improving Patient Care Program and hospital staff can access the training through the Partnership to Advance Tribal Health (PATH - the single Quality Improvement Organization for IHS, funded by CMS). CJ-229 In FY 2018, IHS is completing implementation of the IHS 2016-2017 Quality Framework which includes development of a patient safety principles curriculum (anticipated to include training on obligations to report failures in quality of care, often termed either Near Misses or Adverse Events). All Quality and Safety efforts undertaken under the Quality Framework are inclusive of non-clinical staff as well as clinical staff. IHS acknowledges the importance of a holistic approach to quality and safety, development of high reliability proce sses, and a culture of safety that encourages reporting and analysis to manage and mitigate risk. Title 38 Personnel Authorities \u2014The Committee is aware of significant differences between the personnel authorities used by the Service versus the Department of Veterans Affairs under Title 38 of the United States Code. The Committee believes that an analysis of these differences\u2014 which include hiring and benefits authorities \u2014may provide strategies for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in the same rur al and remote locations as the VA. The Committee directs the Service to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to analyze the differences between the two agencies' personnel authorities and to submit a report no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act that details the differences and makes specific legislative recommendations as appropriate to provide parity between the two agencies (p. 92). Action taken or to be taken The FY 2019 President's Budget proposes a legislative change to allow IHS full use of Title 38, Chapter 74, authorities so that there is parity between IHS and the VA when recruiting for medical providers. Full authority will help IHS recruit and retain qualified medical staff in the same rural and remote locations as the VA. Under current law, HHS and IHS may only use certain authorities under Title 38, Chapter 74, not all. Indian Health Facilities - The Committee recommends $563,658,000 for health facilities operations of the Indian Health Service. This amount is $18,234,000 above the enacted level and $116,702,000 above the budget request. All proposed reductions have been restored. Increases above the enacted level include $5,963,000 for the staffing of new facilities; $1,782,000 for facilities maintenance and improvement; and $10,489,000 for healthcare facilities construction for the small ambulatory clinic program. Of the increase for healthcare facilities construction which is provided $5,000,000 is for the small ambulatory clinic program for a total amount of $10,000,000, and $5,489,000 is for quarters which is provided in addition to the $6,000,000 included in fiscal year 2017 to assist with housing shortages across the Service. The Committee expects the Service to continue following its existing interpreta tion of criteria for the funding of new, improved, or replacement sanitation facilities. The Committee believes that additional funds for quarters is essential to help resolve the widespread housing shortages which have contributed to high vacancy rates f or medical personnel throughout the system, particularly in rural areas. These funds have been used in areas with chronic housing shortages like Alaska and the Great Plains in order to ameliorate these problems. The Committee expects a report from the Service within 60 days of enactment of this act on the distribution of funds. The Committee notes its strong support for the small ambulatory clinic program. As the Service testified before the Committee, this program provides another critical tool for addres sing facilities maintenance and construction backlogs throughout the nation. The stipulations included in the ''Indian Health Services'' account regarding the allocation of funds for the staffing of new facilities pertain to the funds in this account as we ll. The Committee is pleased that the Service has followed congressional direction to work with Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium to formulate options for facilities upgrades and ultimately a replacement facility at Mt. Edgecombe in Sitka. CJ-230 The C ommittee understands that discussions are ongoing and that the parties are hopeful that a path forward is possible for a new facility. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Service shall submit a report to the Committee on the status of these negoti ations. (p. 93). Action taken or to be taken The proposed $5,000,000 for the Small Ambulatory Program (SAP) will be applied to the SAP ranked list of applicants established for the FY 2017 SAP funds. The additional funds for staff quarters will be applied in Areas that have the greatest need. The Sanitation Facilities Construction Program will continue following its existing interpretation of criteria for the funding of new, improved, or replacement sanitation facilities. Within 60 days of the appropri ation, the Service shall submit a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations with the project- level distribution for healthcare facilities construction including quarters projects. The planning report \"Upgrades and Replacement Options for Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital Report to the Senate and House Committee on Appropriations\" requested in Senate Report 114-281 and will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of this act.

Because the cost of vaccines for infants and adolescents < 19 years of age is covered by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, only the costs for vaccine administration, which are not covered by the VFC program, are included for this age group. Vaccine administration fees were based on an average of the CMS Maximum Regional Charges for vaccine administration , multiplied by the number of doses of vaccine routinely recommended for each age group (e.g., 25 doses for children < 2 yrs; 6 doses of vaccine for adolescents). In order to incorporate the vaccine provisions included in Obamacare, all routinely recommended adult vaccines were added to the IHS Core Formulary in September 2011. Costs for the purchase and administration of the se adult vaccines are included in the estimated costs in subsequent years. In prior years, costs were only included for adults 65+ yrs and for influenza vaccine. In August 2014, the Advisory Committee on Im munization Practices (ACIP) for the first time recommended routine use of 13- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) among adults aged 65 years; the projected costs for incorporating this additional vaccine are included starting with th e FY 2016 expenditures. The assumptions for all calculations are included in the table below. 1 The immunization estimates do not include the Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Immunization (AK) program; estimates for these immunizations are included under the Immunization Alaska budget. CJ-234 Costs for monitoring of immunization coverage were also included, and represent a 3.9 percent increase over the FY 201 8 estimate. FY 2015 Estimated Costs = FY 2014 cost plus 3.1 percent FY 2016 Estimated Costs = FY 2015 cost plus 3.8 percent FY 2017 Est imated Costs = FY 2016 cost plus 3.7 percent FY 2018 Estimated Costs = FY 2017 cost plus 3.9 percent FY 2019 Estimated Costs = FY 2018 cost plus 3.9 percent For FY 2019, $82,560,973 is estimated for vaccine costs, and $137,207 for immunization monitoring costs, for a total of $82,698,180 estimated for all immunization expenditures. This represents a $1,918,146 increase over FY 2018 attributable to changes in vaccine costs, redistribution in population age categories, and progress towards vaccination coverage goa ls aligned with Healthy People 2020 goals (i.e., as progress is made, there are fewer individuals still needing vaccination and thus reduced forecasted costs) . Calculations for the costs included as part of the FY 2019 estimated immunization costs were based on the assumptions outlined in the table below: Estimated User Pop (FY2018) Coverage Goal Current Coverage * No. to be vaccinated Vaccine costs (per dose) ** Admin fee (per dose) \u00a7 No. of doses per patient Total Immunexpenditures per patien t Total Infants, Monitoring Total Costs $82,698,180 Based on Healthy People 2020 , where applicable *Coverage estimates based on most current coverage levels reported by IHS (FY 2017 Quarter 4) .

Lowest published price is generally used where multiple products or formulations are available. https://www.cdc.gov /vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine- management/price-list/index.html \u00a7Based on an average of the state CMS Maximum Regional Charges for Vaccine administration. ACIP recently (October 2017) preferentially recommended use of a newly approved Zoster vaccine for adults 50 years and older and requiring two doses versus one dose for the currently available vaccine. IHS will likely implement this new recommendation sometime during FY 2018 - FY 2019, increasing Zoster vaccination costs due to an expanded target population and requirement for a second dose. Estimated costs for use of the new vaccine are not included here, as vaccine availability and pricing are not known at the time of writing. CJ-235 Overall, the estimated costs for these immunizations are affected by: 1. Individuals outside these target groups are regular recipients of immunizations (e.g., immunization for health care workers and those at specific risk for other vaccine-preventable diseases), however, there is not a methodology to estimate the size of these groups. 2. The CMS Maximum Regional Charges for Vaccine administration was used to estimate indirect costs because there is no specific methodology to estimate indirect costs or administr ative overhead associated with the administration of immunizations system -wide , or operation of the overall immunization program. CJ-236 FISCAL YEAR 2019 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Meet Loan Repayment/Scholarship Service Obligations on a Half-Time Basis Proposal : Permit both IHS scholarship and loan repayment recipients to fulfill service obligations through half -time clinical practice, under authority similar to that now available to th e National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program (LRP) and Scholarship Program . Authority similar to Section 331(i) of the Public Health Service Act would allow IHS loan repayment and scholarship recipients more options and flexibility to satisfy their service obligations through part -time clinical work (20 hours or less per week) for double the amount of service time (e.g., clinician who works 20 hours a week performing clinical duties with a two-year service obligation would increase to a four-year service obligation) or accept half the amount of loan repayment award in exchange for a two-year service obligation. This would provide parity with the National Health Service Corp (NHSC) Programs. This proposal meets the following Secretary's priorities for reforms and reinvestments: Reducing burdens on our partners, providing flexibilities to our partners, and expanding opportunities for individuals and families. Current Law : Sections 104 and 108 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act require employees who receive IHS scholarships or loan repayments to provide clinical services on a f ul l -time basis. Section 331(i) of the Public Health Service Act was amended by \u00a7 10501(n) of the Affordable Care Act to permit certain NHSC loan repayment and scholarship recipients to satisfy their service obligations through half-time clinical practice for double the amount of time or, for NHSC loan repayment recipients, to accept half the loan repayment award amount in e xc ha nge for a two-year service obligation. Section 331(j) of the PHS Act (42 USC 254d(j)) defines \"full -time\" clinical practice as a minimum of 40 hours per week, for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. It also defines \"half -time\" as a minimum of 20 hours per week (not to exceed 39 hours per week), for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. Rationale : The IHS, as a rural healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals. This has been especially significant with the recruitment of physicians and other primary care clinicians. While IHS has not specifically tracked the number of part-time employment applicants, we believe that having the options and flexibility to permit IHS scholarship and loan repayment health professional employees tofulfill their service obligations through part-time clinical work for double the amount of time and to offer half the loan repayment award amount in exchange for a two-year service obligation could increase the number of providers interested in serving in the Indian health system. Additional half-time direct care employees could also reduce the number and cost of Purchased/Referred Care program referrals, especially at sites that do not need full-time specialty care services. There are also a number of smaller rural IHS sites where clinicians will be able to provide a minimum of half time clinical services with the remainder of their time devoted to much needed administrative/management responsibilities. This proposal will provide flexibility for providers who might not otherwise consider service in IHS by allowing part- time practice in IHS to coincide with a part-time private practice, as well as part -time practice in IHS combined with part-time administrative duties within IHS. The NHSC was authorized to establish a demonstration project permitting loan repayment recipients to meet their service obligations through less than full -time clinical service in response to requests from clinicians and sites. The Affordable Care Act replaced this demonstration with permanent authority for two specific kinds of CJ-237 NHSC options (described above under Current Law). The IHS is equally concerned with the requests from clinicians and prospective candidates for loan repayment awards for half -time service by clinicians. Having similar a u t h o r i t y as the NHSC would increase the ability for the IHS to recruit and retain healthcare clinicians to provide primary healthcare and specialty services (e.g., Surgery, OB/GYN, Psychiatry, Radiology, and Anesthesiology) and otherwise support the IHS and HHS Priorities. The ability to provide scholarship and loan repayment awards for half-time clinical service would make these recruitment and retention tools more flexible and cost-effective, providing incentives for an additional pool of clinicians and other medical providers that otherwise may not consider a commitment to the IHS federal, Tribal and Urban Indian sites. Having similar authority as the NHSC would increase the ability for the IHS to recruit and retain healthcare clinicians to provide primary healthcare and specialty services and otherwise support the IHS and HHS priorities. Budget Impac t: Direct hire medical staff costs are lower than the costs to hire temporary, contractor staff. Personnel R equirements: None. Effective Date: Upon Enactment. CJ-238 FISCAL YEAR 201 9 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service Discretionary Use of all Title 38 Personnel Authorities. Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS ) is seeking the discretionary use of all United States Code Title 38 authorities under Part V, Chapter 74, \"Veterans Health Administration - Personnel\", that are primarily available to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in relation to health care positions. The term \"health care occupations\" refers to positions , other than positions in the Senior Executive Service , that provide direct patient -care services or services incident to direc t patient-care which would normally b e covered by Title 5 of the United States Code. Current Law : Title 38 Part V , Chapter 74, govern s all aspects of personnel administration for the VA unless expressly overridden by another law or regulation . In many areas of personnel administration , the VA is exempt from Title 5 laws and regulations by virtue of Title 38 . The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) , under the authority of sections 1104 and 5371 of Title 5 of the United S tates C ode, has authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use the Title 38 provisions pertaining to pay rates and systems, premium pay, classification, and hours of work. This delegation of authority is described in a delegation of agreement between OPM and HHS - the latest version of which was effective July 1, 2014. If HHS, or a HHS Operating Division under the delegation of authority , chooses to use a Title 38 provision, the comparable authority under Title 5 is waived . However, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371 does not provide authority to apply all personnel provisions of Title 38 in lieu of comparable Title 5 prov isions. Rationale : The IHS, as a primarily rural healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting health care professionals. The IHS has critical hiring needs for health care professionals in IHS, Tribal and U rban Indian programs including , but not limited to , physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The ability to use Title 38 for pay purposes as discussed above is beneficial because the IHS can offer market pay to physicians and d entists , and special salary rates to individuals in other health care occupations. However, the IHS's use of these compensation authorities is not adequate by itself to compete with other public sector agencies and private sector organizations. Typically, the private sector and VA can offer candidates better scheduling options and annual leave accrual . The IHS faces specific private and public sector competition in the area of annual leave accrual. Many private organizations offer more lucrativ e leave for doctors and nurses - even those new to the profession. In addition, the VA provides 8 hours of annual leave accrual per biweekly pay period to all new nurses, doctors, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors - regardless of thei r years of experience. Due to the limited scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371, the IHS does not have this authority as it is covered by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421, \"Personnel administration: in general\". Thus, when a candidate with just a few years of experience is choosing between the IHS and the VA, he or she will invariably choose the organization offering 8 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period, as opposed to 4 or 6 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period. Supervisors report anecdotally that the IHS has lost many candidates due to this difference in accrual rates. In addition to pursuing 8 hours of annual leave for nurses, doctors, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors , the IHS is seeking access to other Title 38 authorities to increase its ability to compete with both the public and private sector and to create the best possible human resources program. This would include the potential for hiring non- citizens and instituting two year pr obationary periods for staff appointed under Title 38. CJ-239 If the IHS is authorized to offer more competitive leave packages and to hire non- citizens through the discretionary use of all Title 38 authorities under Part V, Chapter 74, recru itment and retention rates will increase while vacancy rates and turnover will decrease. This would bring about a signficant p ositive impact to the IHS health care system and subsequently to IHS beneficiaries . With additional staff and fewer staffing gaps, t he IHS could provide additional services to Native American and Alaska Natives. In addition, current services could be provided more efficiently and effectively ; thereby positively impacting both individual and community health . Budget Impact : This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Personnel Requirements: None Effective Date : Upon enactment. CJ-240 FISCAL YEAR 2019 DHHS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Indian Health Service Provide Tax Exemption for IHS Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program s Proposal : IHS is seeking tax treatment, similar to the treatment provided to recipients of National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and Armed Forces Health Professions scholarships, to allow scholarship funds for qualified tuition and related expenses received under the Indian Health Services Health Professions Scholarships to be excluded from gross income under Section 117(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and to allow participants in the IHS Loan Repayment Program to exclude from gross income payments made by the IHS Loan Repayment program under Section 108(f)(4) of the IRC. In addition, IHS is seeking exemption from any Federal Employment Tax (FICA), making the IHS programs comparable to the current NHSC status. This proposal meets the following Secretary's priorities for reforms and reinvestments: Reducing burdens on our partners, providing flexibilities to our partners, and expanding opportunities for individuals and families. Current Law: Generally, benefits awarded in the form of scholarship awards and loan repayment s are regarded as federal taxable income by the IRS under Title 25 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, three federal laws currently provide for the non- taxability of federal scholarship awards and loan repayment programs: Section 413 of P.L. 107-16, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 provides that tuition, fee, and other related cost payments by the National Health Service Corps and F. Edward Hebert Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarships and Financial Assistance Program scholarships are not taxable. This tax exemption was made permanent by Congress in December 2012 but did not include IHS scholarships. 26 USC 108(f)(4) provides that funds received through the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program authorized under 338B(g) of the Public Health Service Act or a state loan repayment program described in section 338I of the Public Health Service Act are permanently not subject to federal income tax. 26 USC 3401(a)(19) excludes NHSC loan repayment from federal employment tax. As IHS programs are not included in the exceptions, IHS health professions scholarships and loan repayment awards are taxed under the IRC. Rationale : The IHS, as a rural healthcare provider, has difficulty recruiting healthcare professionals. There are over 1,484 vacancies for healthcare professionals including: physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The IHS Health Professions Scholarship Program and the Loan Repayment Program play a significant role in the recruitment and retention of the healthcare professionals needed to fill these vacancies. The IHS Health Professions Scholarship and IHS Loan Repayment Program are very similar to other programs that receive preferred tax treatment, and should therefore receive similar tax treatment. Currently, benefits awarded through IHS in the form of loan repayment and scholarships are regarded as federal taxable income to the recipient; however, the same benefits offered under the NHSC are not taxable. This disparate tax treatment of IHS-funded scholarship and loan repayment awards increases the overall tax bracket for the participants and creates a financial disincentive for those otherwise willing CJ-241 to serve American Indian and Alaska Native patients by working in Indian health facilities. The ability to exempt scholarship and loan repayment funds from gross income would make this recruitment and retention tool more attractive to potential participants. Thus, the IHS would be better able to increase the number of healthcare providers entering and remaining within the IHS to provide primary healthcare and specialty services. Budget Impact : To Department of Treasury Federal Tax Revenue Foregone (in 201 6 dollars) : Loan Repayment $8,118,113 Scholarship $267,222 Total $8,385,335 Budget impact is the amount of tax revenue withheld from IHS Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment and forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service. This also includes the tax liability owed by the scholarships recipients. Personnel Requirements : No new or additional FTEs required Effective Date : Upon enactment.

L. No.) 93-638, as amended, which recognizes the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and American Indian and Alaska Native peoples. Accordingly, t he IHS supports Tribal sovereignty : (1) by assisting Tribes in exercising their right to administer the IHS health programs, or portions thereof, and (2) by continuing to directly provide services to Tribe s that choose the IHS as their health care provider . A Tribal decisi on to enter or not enter into ISDEAA agreements are equal expressions of self -determination. Title I Contracts and Title V Self -Governance Compacts - Titles I and V of the ISDEAA provide Tribes the option to exercise the right to self-determination by assuming control and management of programs previously administered by the federal government. Since 1975, the IHS has entered agreements with Tribe s and Tribal organizations to plan, condu ct, and administer programs authorized under Section 102 of the Act. Today, over $2.7 billion of the Agency's appropriation is transferred to Tribes and Tribal Organizations through Title I contracts and Title V compacts. Under Title I, the re are 230 Tribes and Tribal Organizations operating 251 contracts and annual funding agreements which comprise approximately $804.8 million .
