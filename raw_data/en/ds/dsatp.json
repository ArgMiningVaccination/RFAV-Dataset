Some research suggests this herb may help people with conditions like anxiety and infertility, but stronger studies are needed. Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda, which is a traditional form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing. People [have used](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32201301/) \"Ashwagandha\" is Sanskrit for \"smell of to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7710824/) Its botanical name is Withania somnifera, and it's also known by several other names, including \"Indian ginseng\" and \"winter cherry.\" The ashwagandha plant is a small shrub with yellow flowers that's native to India and Southeast Asia. People use extracts or powder from the plant's root or leaves [to treat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/) [fertility](/health/infertility/) issues. Here are 8 potential benefits of ashwagandha, based on research. Ashwagandha is perhaps best known for its ability [to reduce stress](/health/10-ways-to-relieve-stress/). It's classified as an [adaptogen](/health/stress/smart-girls-guide-to-adaptogens), a substance that helps the body cope with stress. Ashwagandha [may help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/) It also reduces the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system in your body that regulates the stress response. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) [help relieve stress](https://www.healthline.com/health/10-ways-to-relieve-stress/) and [anxiety](/health/anxiety). In a [small study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/) [the stress hormone cortisol](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-lower-cortisol/) compared with those who took a placebo. Those who took the ashwagandha supplements also saw improvements in sleep quality compared with the placebo group. Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) Thus, early research suggests ashwagandha may be a helpful supplement for stress and anxiety. However, a [2021 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8762185/) Summary Ashwagandha may be effective for reducing stress and anxiety symptoms. However, more research is needed to form a consensus on appropriate forms and dosing to address stress and stress-related disorders. Research has shown that ashwagandha may have beneficial effects on athletic performance and may be a worthwhile supplement for athletes. One [analysis of research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8006238/) Another [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230697/) VO2 max is the maximum amount of oxygen a person can use during intense activity. It's a measurement of heart and lung fitness. Having optimal VO2 max is important for athletes and nonathletes alike. Low VO2 max is associated with increased mortality risk, while higher VO2 max is associated with [a lower risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230697/) [heart disease](/health/heart-disease). Additionally, ashwagandha may help increase muscle strength. In a [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4658772/) Summary Ashwagandha may help improve measures of physical performance in athletes and healthy adults, including VO2 max and strength. Some evidence suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of other [mental health conditions](/health/mental-health/), including [depression](/health/depression/recognizing-symptoms), in certain populations. In one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31046033/) [schizophrenia](/health/schizophrenia) who were experiencing depression and anxiety. They found that participants who took 1,000 mg of ashwagandha extract daily for 12 weeks had greater reductions in depression and anxiety than those who took a placebo. Limited [research from 2013](https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/bipolar/randomized-placebo-controlled-adjunctive-study-extract/) also suggests that ashwagandha may help improve cognitive impairment in people with [bipolar disorder](/health/bipolar-disorder). A [2021 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8762185/) [insomnia](https://www.healthline.com/health/insomnia/), and other mental health-related and neurological issues. However, more research is needed into all these uses.

Ashwagandha supplements have been shown in some studies to benefit [male fertility](/health/boost-male-fertility-sperm-count) and [increase testosterone](/nutrition/8-ways-to-boost-testosterone/) levels. In [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6438434/) The treatment was associated with an 18% greater increase in DHEA-S, a sex hormone involved in testosterone production. Participants who took the herb also had a 14.7% greater increase in testosterone than those who took the placebo. Additionally, a [review of four studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30466985/) [sperm motility](/health/fertility/sperm-motility/) in males with [low sperm count](/health/fertility/how-to-increase-sperm-count). It also increased sperm concentration and motility in males with [normal sperm count](/health/mens-health/normal-sperm-count/). However, more studies are needed. Summary Ashwagandha may help increase testosterone levels and may have some potential benefits for male fertility. However, more research is needed. Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may have some benefits for people with diabetes or [high blood sugar](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/hyperglycemia/) levels. A [review of 24 studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975514/) [diabetes](/health/diabetes), found that with ashwagandha [reduced A1c The [reason may be](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25796090/) [glucose](/health/glucose/) from the bloodstream. However, research is limited at this time, and more well-designed studies are needed. Summary Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may reduce blood sugar levels through its effects on insulin secretion and cells' ability to absorb glucose from the bloodstream. Ashwagandha contains compounds, including WA, that may [help reduce inflammation](/nutrition/13-anti-inflammatory-foods/) in the body. [Animal studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696210/) [reduce too. In a [2021 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857981/) [other herbs](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-herbs/) twice per day for 7 days. This reduced participants' levels of inflammatory markers CRP, IL-6, and TNF- compared with a placebo. The treatment formulation also contained: - 1 gram of [giloy ghanvati](/nutrition/giloy-benefits)(Tinospora cordifolia) - 2 grams of swasari ras (a traditional herbo-mineral formulation) - 0.5 grams of [tulsi](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/basil-benefits/)ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) However, research on ashwagandha's potential effects on inflammation remain limited. Summary Ashwagandha may help reduce inflammatory markers in the body. However, more research is needed. Taking ashwagandha may benefit cognitive function. One [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31742775/) [mild cognitive impairment](/health/mild-cognitive-impairment) and people with schizophrenia. Cognitive functions it may benefit included: - executive functioning - attention - reaction time - performance on cognitive tasks A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31742775/) - immediate and general memory - attention - information-processing speed The researchers noted that compounds found in ashwagandha, including WA, have antioxidant effects in the brain, which may benefit cognitive health. However, more research is needed before experts can draw strong conclusions. Summary Ashwagandha supplements may improve memory, reaction time, and the ability to perform tasks in certain populations. However, more research is needed. Many people take ashwagandha to [promote restful sleep](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-to-help-you-sleep/), and some evidence suggests it help [sleep issues](/health/sleeping-difficulty). For example, [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096075/) [improved sleep quality](/health/natural-sleeping-remedies/) and mental alertness upon waking compared with a placebo treatment. Additionally, [one review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462692/) - have a small but significant positive effect on overall sleep quality - reduce anxiety levels - help people feel more alert when they woke up The results were more pronounced in people with [insomnia](/health/insomnia) and in those who took more than 600 mg daily for 8 weeks or longer. Summary Recent evidence suggests that ashwagandha may be an effective natural remedy to improve sleep and may especially help people with insomnia.
