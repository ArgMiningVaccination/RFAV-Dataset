If you're anything like me, you've probably spent years of your life searching high and low for beauty [sleep](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/collection/clever-sleep-week-2022) hacks. Between [optimizing our bedrooms](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/new-parents-tricks-optimize-bedroom-for-sleep) and [evolving our sleep habits](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/sleep-habits-history), falling asleep has become an intricate process.
