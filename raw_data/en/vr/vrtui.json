The presence oftrachoma since antiquity has influenced thehistorical development ofliterate medical systems and theethnomedical system present today. Much ofthe ethnomedicine is directed towards the treatment oftrachoma, including anelaborate pharmacopedia and several surgical techniques. The study examined the villagers' hierarchy ofresort for eye therapy and found access to practitioners for treatment was influenced bythestatus associated with age andgender within thefamily. The study included ananalysis ofthe behaviors associated with low trachoma intensity inchildren to determine which behaviors might be\"protective.\" The two\"protective\" behaviors, face washing with soap andlatrine ownership, arediscussed intheir cultural context operate akerosene stove, and throw stones toscare away aggressive dogs.

Her lashes, which rub against her eyes with every painful blink, have gradually excoriated hercorneas, and now she isnearly blind. Tears formrivulets through the grey powdered kuhl around her eyes. Her grandson's lashes areencrusted with pus andseveral flies feast on his vision and, even so, theflies are soubiquitous and aggressive that they are impossible toavoid. Trachoma, the eyeinfection that caused the Hagga's cause ofinfectious (Maitchouk 1982). Approximately 500million people are infected, ofwhich six million are blind (Dawson 1987). InEgypt, trachoma has caused ocular suffering and blindness throughout recorded history. Due totrachoma and other infections an18th century traveler toEgypt called 1936: 119). Developments inhousing, and medical care have greatly decreased trachoma inthe urban areas. However, intherural delta, where this research took place, thedisease remains endemic. Thesubject ofthis study istheinteraction ofbehavior, belief broadly eyedisease, blindness, andvision asthe focus, Iexamine how the disease has influenced the culture and how the people's behaviors and beliefs affect the distribution oftrachoma. Asyet, not enough isknown about the human behaviors that mayinfluence thedistribution oftrachoma and even less about the indigenous beliefs and practices relating toeye disease in thepopulations where trachoma lining oftheeyelids inflamed and induces ofgel-like lymphoid follicles (Dawson 1984). Active trachoma isgraded onan intensity bythe World Health Organization that measures thedegree ofinflammation (inactive, mild, moderate, severe) (Dawson et al. 1981). Incommunities with blinding trachoma, children develop florid active trachoma scarring canshrink theinside ofthe upper eyelids, turning the whole lid inward (entropion) andmisdirecting the lashes towards the cornea (trichiasis), where they mechanically abrade the cornea. Constant abrasion ofthe cornea bythestiff lashes eventually produces corneal ulceration and permanent corneal opacity. Thus, trachoma is a chronic infectious disease. The various stages oftrachoma-- ending inold age. Chlamydia trachomatis can bespread directly via hands, or indirectly via shared towels, flies, orbedding. Inrecognition ofthis type oftransmission, Jones (1975) ofeye secretions that leads toinfection. with frequent and chronic reinfection iscommon inendemic areas (Grayston and Kuo 1985). Long considered adisease associated with poverty and poor sanitation(Dunn 1985), ithas been noticed that when the socioeconomic status ofa population improves their trachoma decreases without therapy (Dawson, et al. 1976). Even inatrachoma endemic area thedisease isnot randomly distributed, but tends tocluster inhouseholds, with some households severely affected and some very mildly affected (Bailey etal. 1986). These factors led investigators tobelieve that behavior might play an important role inthedistribution ofactive trachoma. Identification of\"protective\" behaviors that are associated with inactive ormild trachoma would beespecially useful for primary care eye programs, which could then integrate them into their planning (Treharne 1985). DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This study has employed both ethnographic and epidemiologic methods toinvestigate theinteraction ofbehavior, belief and trachoma phase ofthestudy I lived talked with, atewith, and observed thevillagers. Iaccompanied them totheir biomedical physicians, 3and interviewed their traditional healers. This aspect ofthe research yielded data on theculture ofthe hamlet, including the ethnomedical beliefs and practices relating toeyedisease, and access tobiomedicine for the treatment ofeye disease. The second phase ofthe study, ananalysis oftheassociation between behavior and trachoma intensity, observations inarandom sample ofhouseholds inthe hamlet. Thestructured observations focused onthose behaviors that might affect trachoma transmission. The interviews elicited informationonthe perception ofeye disease, use oftraditional medicine and biomedicine, knowledge oftrachoma, beliefs about blindness, and attitudes toward sanitation. IMPETUS FOR THE STUDY This study ispart of alarger study onthe epidemiology and of 1984 agroup ofinternational trachoma researchers met ina conference that was held bythe International Center for Epidemiologic and Preventive Ophthalmology ofthe Johns Hopkins University and sponsored bythe Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. The purpose ofthis meeting was todiscuss what had been accomplished thus far intrachoma research and plan future directions. Dr. Frederick Dunn (1985) presented apaper on\"Sociomedical contributions totrachoma research and inter vention\" inwhich heoutlined ways inwhich social scientists could contribute totrachoma investigations. Inkeeping with this sociomedical direction intrachoma investigation Ms. Marx wrote ofthe meto conduct biocultural research inEgypt. Since 1972 Ihave been a nurse, with clinical experience inpediatrics, andadult \"edicine andsurgery. Myundergraduate Inthedoctoral program inmedical anthropology Icombined these interests on health issues inMiddle Eastern populations. Iwas guided inthis focus byworking with the Mid-East Study ofImmigrant Health Adjustment Group atUCSF. myfirst inDecember 1984, Iconducted abrief study inEgypt onthe medical system in a Delta city. Thus, this doctoral research has drawn onevery aspect of mybackground and has deepened myunderstanding ofEgyptian and Middle Eastern society andhealth. The nature of aninter disciplinary research project is collaboration. However, aprimary requirement for the Ph.D. in anthropology isthat the student must dothe research herself. I resolved this problem bydesigning, conducting, andanalyzing apart of thelarger study bymyself. This interaction ofbehavior, belief, and trachoma that isreported inthis dissertation. THEORETICAL MODEL FOR THE STUDY Theanthropological investigation ofinfectious disease employs the theoretical approach ofmedical ecology, which was defined byAudy as, \"the study ofthe populations of man with special reference to environment and topopulations ofall other organisms asthey affect his health and numbers\" 102). According toFabrega (1974), this approach entire related elements, onwork infields such asepidemiology, medical geography, nursing, andmedicine. The recent volume onAnthropology and Epidemiology edited byJanes, Stall,and Gifford (1986), isanexample ofthis multidisciplinary focus. Medical ecology has emerged from ecological anthropology, which in the work ofDubos (1977), Alland (1970; 1977), Dunn (1965; 1968) adaptations ofhuman groups. According toAnders onthe framework research has largely been asystems approach inwhich \"living systems are studied as integrated complexes\" (1974: 180). The focus oninfectious diseases began with Livingstone's (1967) work linking inmalaria was secondary tothemultiplication ofmosquito breeding sites. Other examples ofanthropological infectious disease research include Dunn's (1972; 1976) work onthe interaction ofhuman behavior and filiarisis infections. Gajdusek (1977) identified the mysterious slow virus, kuru, that wascausing theneurological disability anddeath of women and children inNew Guinea. Lindenbaum (1979) helped uncover the mechanism ofinfection, cannibalistic mortuary practices, that led to the unusual distribution ofkuru. Nations' (1982) doctoral work was on diarrhea, the leading childhood killer world-wide. Inthe Middle East, Roundy (1978) examined human behavior anddisease inEthiopia and Kloos etal. (1981) studied water contact behavior and schistosomiasis in Egypt. Trostle stressed that medical ecological research encompasses different ecological levels--\"at organismic, local, community, or population levels\" (1986:76-77). Inaddition tothese of investigation, amedical thehistorical andpolitical factors influenced byandinfluencing thedistribution of theinfectious disease For example, Wood's (1979)article onthepaleopathological controversy over thepotential New World origin ofsyphilis provides afacinating description ofthe 15th century syphilis epidemic inEurope. Historical studies such as this help usgain perspective oncurrent responses tothe AIDS epidemic. Social inequality and major political movements greatly influence thedistribution ofinfectious diseases. Hughes and Hunter (1970) and Heyneman (1983) called attention tothe impact ofWestern development projects and refugee flight onthe tremendous increase of such diseases asschistosomiasis andmalaria. Similarly, Turshen questioned the notion that certain diseases are associated with geographical areas rather than with the poverty found inthose areas: \"The label 'tropical' reinforces theimpression that natural conditions like climate rather than economic conditions orpolitical circumstance sare responsible for the persistence ofthese World\" (1984: 14-15). The American Anthropological Association's Working Group on Infectious Disease defined the anthropological investigation of infectious disease as, \"abroad area which emphasizes the interactions between sociocultural, biological, andecological variables relating to arecent article oninfectious disease, Nations (1986) stressed the importance ofsociocultural factors in under standing the impact ofthe disease, specifically onthe ethnomedical beliefs ofthepeople. have thedisease.Clearly, ananthropological investigation ofaninfectious disease isholistic, encompassing various ecological levels ofinquiry, examining historical andpolitical factors, and addressing ethnomedical belief systems. Ihave taken Wood's suggestion asaguideline: Indeed, aninseparable dialectical process can bediscerned in which disease subtly molds fundamental elements of asociety and, inturn, many aspects ofhuman cultures determine the prevalence, and even theexistence, ofparticular disease patterns (1979: ix). Ihave addressed the ways inwhich health conditions, specifically endemic trachoma, have shaped health beliefs and the ways behavior and belief have influenced the distribution ofdisease. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY There is agap isthe medical anthropological literature with regard toeye disease. Some earlier researchers included traditional remedies for eyedisease aspart ofamonograph onethnomedicine (Turner 1963; Harley 1941). More recent work focused onthepractices of traditional healers with regard toeye disease (Fines thand th 1975; caused byonchocerciasis (1985) investigated thetraining and of\"barefoot ophthalmologists\" inHaiti. However, aside from these fewstudies, eyedisease has been largely ignored inanthropology. With regard totrachoma thesocial science literature iseven more sparse. Most ofthe Egyptian ethnographic accounts make passing mention oftrachoma andother aregreat ofblind and inmany more the eyes more affected byvarious forms of inflammation\" (1912:14). people\" (1963:73). Blackman wrote, \"In these Egyptian villages, where the dust andflies abound, and where thevillagers themselves are soignorant ofhygiene, eye-troubles very how defective is theeyesight ofmany people ofthe peasant class and the amount ofeye ifnot actual blindness, that prevails\" (1968:20.1). Fakhouri infections (to be)especially prevalent 15). Adams reported that, \"According toinformants, prior to1952 trachoma and other eye diseases were sowidespread inthe district that agood rule ofthumb was that half ofthe population had only one good eye \"(1986:131). Despite this frequent mention ofthe problem, noanthropological research inEgypt has focused specifically ontrachoma, eye disease, orblindness. Three studies conducted inother parts ofthe world address community onwhich tobase behavioral interventions, the authors were guided byanecdotal mention oftrachoma being associated with \"overcrowding and poor personal endemic trachoma. Gilbert looked at\"cultural groupings\" (seven categories by which toguage theritual purity ofanethnic group), washing and hygiene, knowledge oftrachoma, and attempts atbiomedical treatment for trachoma and compares all of these factors with trachoma status. Ofthese variables, she found cultural cleanliness grouping to bemost highly correlated with trachoma. More social science research ontrachoma isneeded. This dissertation isanattempt tofill that need. Dunn ofavenues for sociomedical on trachoma, including, \"...identification, characterization, and ranking ofdeterminants orrisk factors, especially those that are behavioral (individual andsocial), economic, cultural, psychological, political, ordemographic\" (1985:783). Heargued that ithas been noted that trachoma isassociated with \"poverty, inadequate water supplies, deficiencies inwaste disposal, poor environmental hygiene, and crowding\" (1985:783). However, such research has been anecdotal or purely statistical, lacking asocial, cultural, oreconomic perspective. Marx, inher extensive review ofthe trachoma literature, stated that, \"Epidemiological studies areplentiful but seldom provide detailed documentation ofcultural attitudes, beliefs and behavior ortraditional preventive and curative practices\" (1985:6). Medical anthropologists and \u00b0nblinding on the association ofbehavior with trachoma and the use of traditional medicine and biomedicine for eye disease, which can beused toplan primary care eye programs. Insum, with regard toeye disease, and more specifically totrachoma, there aresignificant gaps inthe research. This doctoral study addresses those gaps and contributes to both medical anthropology and public health. ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTERS IN THE DISSERTATION This dissertation isorganized toaddress trachoma through the focus of several theoretical areas inmedical anthropology. Although thegeneral framework ofmedical ecology isintroduced inthis chapter, more specific theoretical concepts andliterature areintegrated into each chapter. Themethodological chapter that follows presents the access tothe study site and research design, methods, andethical issues. Chapter three, the ethnography, isanintroduction tothe culture ofthe study site, with particular regard tothehealth beliefs andhealth conditions. Thehistorical chapter, chapter four, traces the treatment oftrachoma ineach medical system inEgypt's recorded history, looking specifically attherole ofeyedisease inestablishing each system and shaping five examines theinfluence oftrachoma theethnosemantics ofeyedisease. Chapter six describes the hierarchy ofresort ofthevillagers for eye illness. Chapter seven presents adiscussion ofthepotential benefit and harm ofthetraditional eye remedies. Chapter eight thebehavior andbelief ofthevillagers affects thedistribution of their trachoma. 11CHAPTER 2 METHODOLOGY TIME FRAME AND ACCESS TO THE STUDY SITE Data for this study were collected during four field trips to Egypt. During thefirst trip, inDecember 1984, Iinvestigated the medical system inDamanhour, Egypt, anexchange and nurses could bearranged. isthecapital of Behera, the governorate where Gamileya islocated, this trip provided invaluable information onthehealth problems ofthe fellahin (peasant farmers). While inDamanhour, Ilived inahospital compound and associated with doctors and nurses. Through this experience Ilearned about the health ofthe fellah'In from the perspective oftheir biomedical practitioners. During the following field trips--from November 1985 toMarch 1986, October 1986, andJanuary and Feburary 1987--I worked inGamileya and gained the perspective of thefellah inaone-room toserve asaclinic. Dr. Chandler Dawson and Dr. Mohyi El Din Said, two ofthe principal investigators, have conducted ophthalmological studies inGamileya over the course of 15years, and used theclinic building tosee their patients. However, noresearcher had ever lived inthe hamlet and 1976 wasthelast date ofdata collection. warmly remembered \"Dr. their acceptance ofme. Inherethnography ofaBedouin settlement, Abu-Lughod (1986) described how her father, facilitated heracceptance byaccompanying her toherfield site and 12study. Insomewhat the same manner Dr. Mohyi drove out toGamileya with me, introduced metothe leading families, and requested them towatch over me and assist me. True totheir Egyptian hospitality, the villagers graciously agreed. Their only concern was that Iintended to live alone, which they had never heard ofanyone doing before. They asked many times ifIwould not rather live with one ofthefamilies or atleast have awoman come and sleep with meatnight. Iwanted to please them but Idid not want toalign myself immediately with only one family. Furthermore, Iknew that Ineeded some privacy atnight to write upmynotes, soover and over again Iexplained that inAmrika we usually sleep alone, that mysleeping bag was warm and Iwould not get cold, and Ipromised tolock the door atdusk and not open ittoanyone. Finally and with great hesitation they agreed to myliving alone. Later, when fell ahnwould come from other hamlets tovisit, my neighbors would explain myunusual living arrangement tothem. \"Aren't you cold 7\"\"Aren't you lonely?\" you frightened?\" would always ask. Truthfully, inthewinter Iwas often cold, Iwas sometimes lonely, but Iwasnever frightened, except ofthedogs. Thevillagers kept their promise toDr. Mohyi and helped mewith and took very good care ofme. The ophthalmologists, nurses involved inthe study commuted tothe hamlet bycar onthe days that they came to collect data. For six weeks, during December 1983 toJanuary 1986, Marcia Inhorn Millar, agraduate student inanthropology, STUDY SITE: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRACHOMA INTHE HAMLET Gamileya was chosen for this trachoma study because thedisease is endemic inthe Nile Delta, where hamlet 1slocated. Inpreparation for theanthropological investigation ofbehavior, acensus ofthe were offered ophthalmological examinations: 62% were examined.\" Among the children (ages two toeight), who have thehighest rates ofactive disease, 6.4% had moderate tosevere trachoma intensity during winter (January) when thedisease islowest etal. 1987). entropion and trichiasis. Of men and women inthe hamlet who were older than 60 years ofage, approximately half hadsevere trichiasis and accompanying visual impairment. After examination all infected villagers were provided with tetracycline eye ointment bytheproject ophthalmologist, for treatment ofactive trachoma. PHASE ONE Objectives tounderstand oftheculture ofthehamlet. 142/ Discover people's ideas cause, prevention and treatment ofeyedisease and compile ataxonomy ofthe terms used for eye disease. 3/ Identify and interview the traditional healers inorder to understand their treatment ofeye disease. 4/ Observe the people's use ofbiomedicine andtheir interactions with the local doctors inorder tounderstand how and when they seek biomedical care for eyedisease. 5/ Identify those elements ofdaily life inthe hamlet that may influence the transmission oftrachoma. Methods The methods used inthis section included participant observation and informal interviewing. Participant observation, the standard anthropological method, was begun byMalinowski (1922), who recommended living inthe native village and speaking to obtain, asclosely ofsomeone arefamiliar: Itmust beremembered language wassufficient toobserve them, Participate inevents, and have everyday conversations. For more detailed interviews, such asthose with thetraditional healers, Iwas 15accompanied byone team. Inthis beginning phase all \"sociomedical\" team members (the anthropologists and thenurses) collected information ontraditional beliefs. Ifone person heard ofatreatment orbelief, theothers would follow upand ask more questions about itofother people. Inthis way qualitative data was verified byasking several people about each fact atdifferent times. Detailed notes were recorded. Ikept adaily field diary compiled afile ofobservations as\"diet\" or\"traditional beliefs--eye,\" were collected. Thefirst phase ofthe study yielded adescription ofthe range of beliefs and customs inthe hamlet. These data were used toconstruct the structured inter view for the second phase ofthe study. Ethnographic data are interwoven with statistical data inevery chapter inthis dissertation. The combination ofqualitative and quantitative methods provides the most complete description ofthe behaviors and beliefs inGamileya. PHASE TWO Objectives The overall objective ofthis section ofthe research was totest theassociation between behavior, belief, and trachoma. The specific objectives were to: 1/Identify those \"protective\" behaviors associated with inactive The use oftraditional and biomedical therapy for eye disease. Knowledge oftrachoma. Research Design The research used adouble-masked design inarandom sample of households totest the association between trachoma and anumber of other variables. The study involved direct observation and quantification ofbehavior, followed byastructured interview. The study was double-masked because the subjects did not know exactly what they were being observed for and theinvestigator did not know the trachoma status ofthe subjects. Sample Selection The unit ofsampling was thehousehold. From theentire hamlet of 1,033 people in 104 households, 27households, containing 386 people, were selected for theobservation (25 ofthese households were randomly chosen and two were added tomake the sample more representative ofthe hamlet population); 25ofthose households, containing 375 people, were interviewed. Two households refused the interview due tolack oftime. The households varied insize from five to33members, of 14.3 members. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Tobeincluded inthe sample ahousehold had to have two ormore children under five years ofage and thechildren must have received anophthalmological examination. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Refusal toparticipate inthe study. Variables and Measurements 17INDEPENDENT WARIABLE: The independent variables, behavior and belief, presented intable 10--chapter eight, were measured bydirect observation and astructured interview. The observation, essentially quantified participant observation, wasinspired byWilson's (1974) technique ofchild following. For onefull day, from 6:30 AMto7:30 PM, the members ofeach family were observed for behaviors that are believed toberisk factors for trachoma transmission and notes were recorded every 15minutes. Since infectious trachoma hasitshighest rates inthe children and the long term chronic effects are highest in the women, theobservations were focused onthe women and children. Even inlarge households the women and children tend tocluster together soitwas possible toobserve them all with some accuracy. The interview was administered tothe women ofthe household. Since some ofthe questions are about the household members' history of eye disease and their use oftherapy itwasprofitable tohave more than onehousehold member present who could recall such events. Ifound that onsuch questions asbelief inthe evil eye there seemed tobe a household concensus about the belief. Inthe cases inwhich there was more than one answer given toaquestion, Irecorded all answers. DEPENDENT WARIABLE: The dependent variable was the trachoma intensity ofchildren. Inthe 27households there were 164children, aged one to l lyears, of whom 144 (88%) were examined bythe ophthalmologist and assigned ascore for trachoma intensity. This score was determined using the standard scale developed bythe World Health Organization chosen for the analysis because it corresponds clearly tothe prevalence ofchlamydial infection and the degree ofsubsequent conjunctival scarring. RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1/ How has the ethnomedical system ofthe fellah In? 2/ about trachoma and other ocular ailments? Specifically, what are their names for the conditions, their etiological ideas and their remedies? 3/ What istheir perception oftheseverity oftrachoma and how does it compare with the many other diseases from which they suffer? How does their perception ofdisease severity compare with theophthalmologists' oftheir treatment? What istheir access tobiomedicine like 2 What variables govern their choice oftherapy? 5/ What istheeffect oftheir 6/ What are thebehaviors associated with low trachoma intensity in children? How might these \"protective\" behaviors decrease trachoma transmission? ETHICAL ISSUES The research project as awhole received clearance from the Committee onHuman Research ofthe University ofCalifornia, San Francisco. Since many ofthehamlet residents areilliterate, itwas 19decided that written consent should bewaived and that aninformation sheet containing all theelements ofaconsent form should beread to thepeople before enlisting them inour study. The information sheet was translated into Egyptian dialect Arabic and read toall Muslim hamlet residents in ahamlet meeting atthe Mosque. The leaders ofthe hamlet then discussed the matter publicly andformally accepted our research project into their hamlet. The five Coptic Christian families were visited separately. Each stage ofthe research was explained topotential participants before itwasstarted. For the day long observation ofbehavior ineach household itwas necessary for the members tobeunaware ofexactly which behaviors were being observed, inorder toprevent bias inthe results. Members were told that the observer wanted tostay with them for one whole day and take notes because she wanted tolearn about the work ofthe women and the daily lives ofthe women and children. Observation and recording data were always done openly and nocovert observations were made. 20CHAPTER 3 ETHNOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION This ethnography presents apicture oftheculture sothat the reader may have anidea ofwhat the people are like and howtheir eye disease fits into thetapestry oftheir lives. Although Ihave included many facets of atraditional ethnography, such askinship, Ifocus most of myattention onhealth. This picture reveals as much about the painter asabout her subject. Since Iamawoman, inthis gender-segregated society Ispent more time with the women andchildren, andtheir lives aredepicted more thoroughly than those ofthe men. Ihave always been fascinated by religion and studied Islam extensively asanundergraduate. Because of this interest, thereligious practices occupy more space than they might otherwise. Most significantly, myinterest innutrition and infectious disease isobvious inthese pages. The ethnography presents abrief review ofanthropological and social scientific studies onEgypt, background about Egypt, physical description ofthe hamlet andfirst impressions, education, Sidi Ismial-- the local village center, religion, thelife cycle, work, diet, ecology andhealth, andhealth Care resourcese BRIEF REVIEW OFANTHROPOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE STUDIES ON EGYPT Egypt has long fascinated scholars. Begining with Herodotus in447 B.C. (1928) scholars have traveled toEgypt and recorded their observations onEgyptian culture. Lane (1836/1973) describe life in 21Cairo atthe beginning ofthe 19th century. The archeologist Ebers (1887) went toEgypt primarily tostudy Pharaonic artifacts and discovered the famous medical papyrus that bears his name. Inaddition, Ebers wrote two volumes ofmeticulous description ofthe customs during his stay Durrell 1961), missionaries the notable exception ofAbu Lughod's (1961; 1971) work inCairo. Scholars have examined the 1920's feminist movement that influenced Egyptian women toremove their veils (Marsot 1978; Phillip 1978) recent movement toreadopt theveil (el-Guindi 1983; Williams 1986), onwomen's work (Youssef 1978; Hammam 1979; Sullivan 1981), and female circumcision (Meinardus 1967; Assad 1980). Medical anthropology inEgpyt includes descriptions theperspective Morsy's (1981) and Gran's (1979) work inmedical pluralism inEgypt. Both Early (1982) and 22Morsy (1980) use anethnosemantic framework toexamine how Egyptian women talk about illness episodes. Inaddition, Morsy (1978) addresses power relations within thefamily, toexamine howgender influences access and barriers tohealth care. Ethnographies ofEgyptian communities have emphasized behavior and belief without addressing the morbidity andmortality, which profoundly affect thepeople's lives. This ethnography onGamil eyafills gap ofhealth conditions and thebehaviors andbeliefs relating tohealth. ABOUT EGYPT Although the research forthis dissertation wascollected inatiny rural hamlet, Idonot want the reader tothink that the hamlet represents all ofEgypt; cities and social stratification have existed inEgypt since Pharaonic times. This history, andits influence onthe history ofWestern civilization, isacknowledged proudly phrase, helpful insuch situations asgetting through customs, getting residence visas extended, and thelike. Egypt's cosmopolitan history arises from conquest andcolonization bythe Greeks, Romans, Arabs, French, andBritish. Reminders ofthe many cultures that have ruled Egypt for acentury ormore abound, especially inthe two largest cities, Cairo and Alexandria. Greek and Roman antiquities are crowded by19th-century European villas and twentieth century highrises. Street signs are inEnglish, French, and Arabic and 23hotel clerks speak atleast these three languages andpossibly several others. Islamic culture, brought bythe Arabs from theArabian peninsula in theseventh century, has shaped Egypt most profoundly. More than 90% of thepopulation isSunni Muslim, thenational language isArabic, and Egypt was one ofthe founding members ofthe League ofArab Nations. Since the mid-1970s anIslamic revival has convinced many Egyptian women toreadopt thehigab, orheadscarf, andhasbegun toaffect changes in marriage fundamentalism isagrowing political force aswell, inspired byanger over the United States' foreign policy inthe Middle East and further strengthened bythe worsening economic situation inEgypt (Ansari 1987). The Coptic Christians, the second largest religious group inEgypt, are the descendents ofthefirst Egyptian converts toChristianity, which occurred inthefirst century A.D. (Meindarus 1970). The Coptic minority tends tohave higher socioeconomic andeducational levels than the Muslim majority, sparking resentments. Although Copts and Muslims work side byside there isnot much social interaction, intermarriage is very rare, and there seems tobe arather uneasy peace between them. Currently Egypt's total population is52million, butitincreases approximately onemillion ofEgypt, ofCairo andAlexandria have exploded in recent years, because ofthe high birth rate and rural tourban migration. Cairo now hasnearly 12million residents andAlexandria has four million. Most ofEgypt's population isclustered on 6%ofitstotal land 24area around the Nile river that runs south tonorth inthe center ofthe country. The Nile divides into two branches inthe north, the Rosetta and the Damiatta, each ofwhich blossoms into multitudinous irrigation canals that areancient inorigin. There are three main ecological spheres inEgypt with historically different subsistence strategies: theurban areas oftoday arebuilt home nomadic Bedouin pastoralists, who are now almost completely settled; and onthe lush delta farmland the fellah.In grow crops. Egypt was one ofthefirst areastocultivate crops; farmers have done sointheNile valley since 13,000 B.C. (Critchfield 1978). Northern Egypt isparadoxically called \"lower Egypt\" tonorth flow ofthe Nile. The culture inupper Egypt descends from the ancient Nubian culture anddiffers greatly from lower Egypt. Since data for this study were collected inafellah. Inhamlet inlower Egypt, this ethnography describes the common toother fellah Incommunities innorthern Egypt. life, Bedouin, orNubian culture, all ofwhich are very different from each other and from the fellah In. Gamileya isfairly typical offellah Insettlements except that, end ofthe continuum. About 85% (Mobarak 1979) ofEgyptian villages have piped water, although atany given time many ofthese taps are not working. Infact, recent study ofhamlets near Gamileya found that 57% ofthe pipes were oforder (Khairy 1986). isthesmallest administrative unit inEgypt, above which isthevillage, markaz (county), governorate, and central 25Egyptian government. THE HAMLET: PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS Gamileya isadensely populated hamlet forty kilometers southeast ofAlexandria. Toreach itone drives most ofthe way on atwo-lane highway where overloaded trucks, donkey carts and European sports cars jockey for position; over turned trucks and smashed cars are not infrequent roadside sights. Incontrast tothe melange ofancient, colonial, leya islocated consists ofemerald squares ofgrowing crops interspersed with mud and stone dwellings, capped with mounds ofrice plants andcotton sticks drying inthe sun. Two kilometers from the highway, over alumpy dirt road that becomes impassable with thewinter rains, isGamil eya. Surrounded on all sides byfields ofrice, fava beans, and the most enormous cabbages Ihave ever seen, are one hundred and four houses, containing 1,033 people, all squeezed together onabout one-quarter ofasquare mile. The placement ofthe personal space thevillagers seem toneed tofeel comfortable. Even inside large houses with six oreight rooms, fifteen totwenty people sleep intwo orthree rooms, leaving the remaining rooms for the animals, storage, orjust empty. Another reason for this housing density isthat Egypt's expanding rural population has begun toencroach onitsprecious but limited cultivable land (Adams 1986:7). Most ofthefamilies inGamil eya have lived there for aslong as they can remember, although before the 1952 socialist revolution they 26were land less share croppers growing cotton and wheat for awealthy Syrian absentee landlord. After therevolution each fellah Infamily received number ofchildren is1.66 fedan (range 0toeight fedan) per household. The patrilocal households consist ofthe eldest male, his wives and unmarried children, his married sons, their wives andtheir children. Most ofthe houses aresingle story mudbrick, brightly painted stone orred brick buildings, with Allahu 'akbar (God isgreat) painted over the door. Afew families own pick-up trucks but the major form of transportation isthewiry little donkey, which cancarry tremendous loads onits back. Irrigation canals bound the hamlet ontwosides and provide water for crops and forall washing ofbodies, dishes, and clothing. Toget drinking water the women walk four kilometers with their donkeys toapublic tap andreturn with twoten-gall onplastic jugs filled with theprecious Thevillagers bitterly about this lack ofclean water, towhich they attibute many diseases, including eyedisease. Since there isnoelectricity, thehouses are litwith kerosene lamps and the many television sets are run by automobile batteries. Thevillagers dress intraditional fellah inclothing: the men cover their heads with turbans orcrocheted skull caps and wrap wool Scarves around their heads and necks inthewinter. They wear robe-like galabiyas, mostly inblue orgrey, with vests underneath secured with many small buttons. Their skin color ranges from fair todark, butall 27are burnished from the sun. Many have missing teeth, with the remaining ones colored yellowish-brown from the honey cured tobacco they smoke in their water pipes and theendless glasses ofstrong heavily sugared tea. The women wear brightly-patterned, mid-calf-length polyester dresses, underneath which are loose bloomers that look like pajama bottoms. Bright scarves cover their long braided hair. Married women wear elbow-length, sheer black scarves that wrap tightly around their faces. Theolder women have tattoos ontheir chins, fore heads, and fingers. Young children aredressed intorn, brightly colored galabiyas or pants andshirts. Pre-toilet trained infants and toddlers wear nothing onthe bottom andurinate ordefecate where ver they happen tobewhen they need to. Due tothe large number ofanimals (water buffalo, cows, donkeys, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, camels, ducks, geese, pigeons, chickens, turkeys, andrabbits) there are ubiquitous piles ofdung; thus myfirst impression ofGamil eya was anassault on mysense ofsmell and a weakening of mycourage. There were piles ofmanure and flies everywhere, inside the houses, infront ofthe houses, and inthe narrow muddy lanes between the houses. Iwas overwhelmed. Mysecond impression was ofhundreds ofchildren, who intheir excitement were pushing andfighting and climbing all over each other to benext tome, topull atmyclothes and tocough all over me. They had mucous pouring from their noses, scabbed sores ontheir skin, and crusted pus around their eyes. Myusual love ofchildren fled. Mycommunication with the people was atfirst incredibly frustrating. The accent anddialect oftheir Arabic differed from that 28inthecity; they spoke atleast twice asfast and seemed tohave no understanding that Arabic was asecond language for me. The volume of their speech was soloud that Isome times felt that everyone was shouting angrily atme. When Idid not understand something someone said, heorshe would lean near myear andreally yell. Later, when I realized thefrequency ofruptured tympanic inthevillage children that are secondary tountreated infections, Iunderstood part ofthe reason for the volume. Alarge portion vocal cords toughened from trying tomatch the volume ofspeech, although some times bythe end ofthe day Icould hardly talk. The children became known individuals, instead ofaswarming horde, and I grew very fond ofthem. Thevillagers fed meand taught meabout their lives and Iamvery grateful tothem. EDUCATION For ten years there has been aprimary school inGamil eya that serves the hamlet and several neighboring hamlets aswell. There are twoshifts ofstudents, morning and afternoon, that crowd into thefive classrooms with 30to50students perclass. There isamiddle school inanearby hamlet, afour-kilometer walk from Gamileya. The secondary schools, both technical and academic, are located intheclosest city, a20-kilometer bus ride away. The few students whoattend university must travel toAlexandria, where they 29live during the school year. There are nolonger any Qur'anic (religious) schools inthearea; thegovernment schools have taken over this religious teaching. Education isincreasing greatly inthis generation ofchildren, especially among the boys. Inthe27-household sample, there are 101 children ofschool age (six to 18years), 46girls and agechildren 35% ofthegirls and 7.1% ofthe boys are in school. Since one must leave the hamlet for middle and secondary school, girls arerarely allowed tocontinue their education beyond primary school. Only twogirls inthe sample are inmiddle school and one insecondary school. More ofthe boys have been allowed to continue their education: four boys are inmiddle school, twelve in secondary, and one inpost secondary school. These children represent a great increase ineducation over that oftheir parents and older siblings. Adult literacy inthe sample is 17%overall (n=160 adults), with 9%ofthe females ofthe males able toread and write. SIDI ISMA'IL--THE LOCAL CENTER Two kilometers from Gamileya, thevillage center Sidi Isma'il is theadministrative center for the 102 neighboring hamlets (65,000 people); itcontains alocal police department, the shaikh al-balad (a village head, something like amayor), andoffices for the two leading political parties: theHizb Itisalso thelocation government rural health center, the pharmacy, and theoffices offour private physicians. Sidi Isma'il is amarket center, with ofsmall shops. 30Whole, skinned gamus (water buffalo) hang headless from hooks onthe tile porches ofthebutchers; rows offowl are lined upincages for sale; tiny clothing stores are crammed with long bright polyester nightgown-type dresses, head scarves with blue andpurple roses, and plastic rain boots for tromping through thewinter mud. OnMondays the field beside theclinic houses thesud, anopen-air market with more than one hundred merchants hawking oranges, sugar cane, sweet cakes, underwear, children's clothes, kerosene lamps and stoves, and aplethora ofother items. There are ofgreasy sardines covered with there are six'attars medicaments, andspices; there ista'miya frying inhotoil and delicious bread. Intheback ofthesud one can buy ababy lamb orcow and inthe front one can have adonkey's shoe repaired. Perhaps athousand fellah.In gather from all over andall seem tobargain atonce atthe top oftheir lungs for the best deal. There isnostanding in line tobewaited on--whoever has the sharpest elbows and the loudest voice gets served first. Sidi Isma'il isnamed after afamous holy man whose tomb isinthe mosque ofthevillage center that bears his name. Each summer there is aweek long celebration with special foods and every night the men gather inalarge circle tochant Qur'anic verses inthezikr ceremony. Although women donot usually gotothe mosque, during this week everyone goes topray atSidi Isma'il's tomb toobtain the baraka (an invisible substance that istheessence ofGod's grace) that emanates from his body. This veneration 31parts Middle East and North Africa. RELIGION There are 99Muslim and five Coptic Christian households in Gamileya. The Muslims have worshipped intheir own hamlet mosque for more than 25years, however 20years ago they raised enough money to rebuild itinto its present form. Itis astone building, painted bright yellow with blue trim, with apublic address system tobroadcast thefive daily calls toprayer and toannounce chants losing his sight hememorized theentire Qur'an, which herecites during the Friday noon worship service. There are five and Muhammad isHis Prophet\"), anoath all Muslims must affirm. Both Muslims andChristians inGamileya express their faith inGod onanalmost hourly basis. common answer tothequestion you?\" is\"Praises toGod.\" This response isoften accompanied bythe person kissing their own right hand first onthe palm side then onthe other side and looking up towards the sky with anexpression ofgratitude. Atleast onthe surface thevillagers attribute some difficulties ininterviews onthe causation ofeye disease and blindness. For example, when asking people how eye disease was caused, invariably they would answer, \"It isfrom God.\" Ifthere were isfrom God.\" Ittook much 32would say, \"Yes, ofcourse, everything isfrom God, but howexactly does eye disease tohappen?\" This tendency tostate that everything isfrom God has led many Western observers toconclude that Muslims are fatalistic intheir religious belief. However, thereality ismuch more complex. Obviously, there isacore ofbelief that many, ifnot most of thepeople, share. Layered upon that are verbal customs that people may follow without actually thinking about their meaning. Finally, itis important tounderstand that the people arefrequently sick and there is ahigh mortality rate inthe hamlet. Thus, theinsistence upon thanking andpraising God isanattempt sothat rather than fatalistic acceptance itis anattempt toactively protect themselves and their families from harm. Five daily prayers are asecond pillar ofIslam. Performance of these prayers inGamileya isheavily gender influenced; men and boys pray inthe mosque, fields orathome but the only women Iobserved praying were widows and theolder co-wives ofpolygamous men. When I asked women ifthey prayed they said, \"Ofcourse.\" But when Istayed with them for entire days they did not pray. Confronted with this discrepancy between their actual andstated behavior the women said that they were too young topray orthey did not pray because they still had aman. Prayer isprohibited when the person isritually impure, which for women occurs during menstruation, during the post childbirth flow of lochia, and after sexual intercourse until afull bath istaken. Because ofthe frequency ofthese conditions inthelives ofyounger women they maydelay prayer until they have reached the age when they are nolonger, orare seldom, ritually InGami leya people usepolluted canal water forthis ritual washing, which includes rinsing the mouth andsniffing water into thenostrils three times. Thepollution turns what could beahealth promoting act into one of potential exposure todisease. Zakat, donating alms tothe poor, isathird pillar ofIslam. Because itis areligious prescription togive tothe poor, beggars in Muslim society are helping thebelievers toearn their places inheaven. Every Monday outside ofthesud, ablind beggar satshouting, \"Allahu akbar.\" When passing villagers dropped coins into hisoutstretched palm, hewould kiss his hand and raise his unseeing eyes tothe sky. The Ramadan fast isafourth pillar ofIslam, during which nofood ordrink isconsumed and neither smoking nor sexual relations are permitted from sunrise tosunset for anentire month. Even infamilies that donotusually observe gender segregation, women and mensit at different tables toeat during this month. Atthe end ofRamadan the villagers celebrate thefeast of'Idal-Fitr, when children receive presents and women beautify themselves byreddening their hands andfeet with henna. toMecca, pillar returned thepilgrimage are addressed asal-Hagg, for aman andal-Hagga, for awoman, which are titles indicating agreat deal older formal theological 34aspects ofMuslim belief inGamileya that are derived from the sacred texts, the Qur'an and the Hadith. However, ananthropological analysis ofreligion includes more than just its formally encoded aspects; in addition, all practices that deal with metaphysical orsupernatural phenomena are examined. Nevertheless, incultures inwhich religion is handed down insacred texts, religious leaders and educated members of theculture may consider only those beliefs expressed inthewritten theology tobepart ofthereligion. This division leaves out many types ofspirit possession, exorcism, and supernatural forces. Yet these mystical phenomena are often derived from elements ofthe formal theology. Such anorthodox/mystical division occurs inIslam. Practices such astheZar ceremony are thought tobesupers tition who toexpress this distinction, thecategories ofreligious belief are often separated into \"theological\" and \"popular.\" This separation reflects Redfield's theless, while beremembered that thefellah In ofGamileya make nosuch distinction. Rather than analyzing from where thestrands oftheir belief come, they experience them, like people everywhere, assimply \"the truth.\" The oral religious and thelife affirming force ofbaraka. Although zikr is amale activity in eya, when Iexpressed interest, Iwas allowed at waslit with hanging lanterns. Acircle of50men formed around two men who were chanting the Qur'an. Everyone was clapping rhythmically, leaning forward toclap low and backwards toclap high. Then they all jumped upand down inunison afew times and chanted in response tothe shaikhs inthe center. The circle ofmen knelt on theground with their shoes infront ofthem. Atthat point Iwas invited into the house where the women ofthe household were sitting. Many men, including the two shaikhs, came intoshake my hand and exchange greetings. They asked ifIliked their zikr and Isaid, \"It wasgreat.\" From this brief experience itseemed that the chanting and body movements inthezikr ceremony encouraged the men tofeel inharmony with each other, togain asense ofphysical release anxiety, and ,for atleast, toenter atrance state. Furthermore, this isone ofthe few large collective activities ofthe men, aside from prayer inthe mosque, and provides atime forfellowship and entertainment. The zar ceremony, which is atherapy forspirit possession, may be given for aman orwoman, but likely tobefor awoman. The orshaikha (female) may ormay not beevil, demanding. These supernatural shaikhs and shaikha must bedistinguished from the human religious specialists andhealers who arealso called shaikh/shaikha. When the spirit-shaikh possesses awoman itissaid that \"he rides her\" and makes demands upon her and herrelatives. Usually amale shaikh will ride awoman and afemale will ride aman. The purpose of the zrceremony istodiscover the demands oftheshaikh and topacify him temporarily, but notnecessarily tocompletely exorcize him. possessed her family must hold azar. Thez\u00e4risalarge party with adrummer and sometimes other musicians who play different beats ofmusic until they entice the spirit-shaikh todance and tospeak through the possessed person. The spirit then tells its name anddiscloses its demands, which may befor gold, food, or anew dress. Kennedy (1967) has described thez\u00e4r ceremony among the Nubians inupper Egypt and Crapanzano (1973) has written about asimilar type ofspirit possession and trance dancing among the Hamadsha inMorocco. Another category ofspirits, \"Afrits, donot possess people but can never theless bebother some. They live inthefields and scare the unfortunate villagers who must walk out into thefields torelieve themselves atnight. One27-year-old woman had tobehospitalized after being struck byan'afrit early one morning. The folk diagnosis ofher condition, byweakness and only inhabits thefields around Gamileya, and there are others who are large, small, black, and white. 'Afrits arefrightened bydogs, which may beone ofthe reasons that every hamlet household owns avery nasty and aggressive dog that stays outside toguard the house atnight. Inevery society there are paradoxical currents oftension between public and private behavior. The surface often reflects anidealized image ofthepeople's aspirations forthemselves. Theundercurrents represent thereality oftheir poverty their human weaknesses. In Gamileya, thepublic social behavior isintensely warm, hospitable and generous. theprivate behavior is 37often mistrustful, neighbors. This anxious rivalry isexpressed intheevil eye; the belief that the glance of anenvious person can cause illness, misfortune, death, ordestruction. The evil eye is apre-Christian pan-Mediterranean inthe Qur'anic sura onDaybreak, soitplays asmall part in Islamic and young children arebelieved tobethe most susceptible toal-hasad (the evil eye) and inGami leya many precautions are taken tokeep them safe from this hazard. These preventive measures attempt tohide the value ofthechildren and thus prevent envy. Forexample, newborn boys arereferred toasgirls and aredressed ingirls' clothing fortheir first year oflife, since girls are less valued than boys. Some boys arealso given unattractive names, such asShahat (beggar). Many children are dressed inrags and are allowed tostay dirty, which greatly increases the number offlies that feed ontheir sticky faces. Other prophylactic measures against the evil eyeinclude dressing children inthecolor blue, burning bukhur (incense), and wearing such asseveral strands ofsmall beads attached toalock of ababy's hair just above his forehead. Often the amulet isinthe shape of ahand, with ablue Isa,\" which literally means \"five and the five.\" Taken even further the number five itself can serve as aprotection against theevil eye. Interestingly, the ages people gave usduring our hamlet census very frequently ended inthe number five. For thepotential bearer ofthe for thehealth orbeauty isthe 38appropriate measure. This conversation since Ifrequently had todiscuss thechildren's health with their mothers and mychildless would make meaprime suspect forhaving theevil eye. is asource ofgood health, happiness, andfertility that God issometimes believed tobetransportable asifitwere aphysical essence. Ether like, baraka andtheir tombs, such asthe tomb ofSidi Isma'il that was mentioned earlier. The baraka insuch places has healing power, and some tombs may become famous for the treatment ofcertain diseases. The Coptic Christian families inthe hamlet also have theological and popular aspects totheir religious belief. The five Coptic households attend the church ofMari Girgis (St. George) inthe nearby city, which isone ofthe three Coptic churches inthat city. St. George inthereligion are pictures ofhim--a man back, with a lance--in every Coptic household, side byside with huge icons ofMary and Jesus. These icons are one ofthe distinguishing elements of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Infact, inthe eighth century the Byzantine Empire was split in adisagreement over the nature and divinity ofChrist and whether Christ could bedepicted inart (Weitzmann 1982:4). The Copts continued torepresent the Holy Family in elaborate gold andsilver encrusted artwork that developed into their distinctive icons. Their paintings are soimportant that small icons 39are placed inthe wrappings ofnewborn babies and the family inthe hamlet has ahuge framed face ofJesus occupying one chair intheir salon. Visitors sit intheother chairs and ifthere isanoverflow they stand; the icon isnever removed from its place ofhonor. The Copts inthe hamlet wear the same clothing asthe Muslim villagers, but aredistinguished by asmall cross that istattooed on their right inner wrist, ateight years ofage, bytheir priest. The Christians and Muslims inthe hamlet live side byside and are cordial toeach other. Thechildren attend school together andplay together when young. The adults acknowledge each other formally and politely, but ingeneral they only visit andsocialize with their kin, which is consistent with thepattern ofintrafamily visiting inthe hamlet. One exception tothis pattern isvisits totraditional healers. There was aChristian midwife, who recently died, and there is a Christian woman who specializes inapplying atraditional eye medicine, called t\u00fctya. Both Muslims and Christians patronize these practitioners. Religious healing through prayer orexorcism isone aspect ofpopular rather than theologically encoded religious belief. One Coptic man, for example, practices atype ofreligious healing for headache. The Muslims whovisit himfortreatment call him ashaikh, although the title isnormally reserved for Muslims. Hesays aprayer while laying his hands onthe temples of,and some times writing inpencil onthe forehead of, thepatient. Helearned this prayer from apriest who came from Jerusalem. Atthat time the man had asevere headache and the priest said this prayer onhis head. The priest then revealed the 40prayer tohim but cautioned him not todisclose ittoanyone else orit would lose its power. The Coptic church inthe nearby city holds exorcism ceremonies for possessed women-- Iwas told that itisusually women who become possessed. Itisbelieved that aspirit goes into the woman's body and impels her toactinappropriately, perhaps corresponding toabiomedical diagnosis ofpsychiatric disorder. Both Christians and Muslims can be exorcised with this ceremony, although more Christians than Muslims participate. This exorcism isaprayer service performed byapriest upon the possessed woman. The woman must dress entirely inwhite and as thepriest \"kills thedevil orspirit\" isthe blood oftheevil spirit.\" The woman must then cut this red cross off and wear itatall times inorder toprotect herself. 41THE LIFE phases approximately tochronologic ages, but since the village people donot celebrate their birthdays, they donot always know exactly how old they are. This isespecially true ofolder women and men. Infancy Nearly all babies are born athome, with thetraditional midwife, thedaya, and the newmother's female relatives toassist her. As mentioned earlier, both male and female infants arereferred toasgirls and are dressed asgirls, since females have lower value than males and parents wish toprotect the boy babies from theevil eye. Since the color blue isalso protective, the newborn isdressed inabright blue galabiya, which some families stain with blood ofafreshly slaughtered chicken. This type ofbaby clothing issocommonly used that there is one old woman whospecializes inpreparing thechicken-blood stained galabias for hamlet newborns. isbelieved tocause many illnesses. Theillness causing power ofcold causes many mothers todelay the child's first bath until after 40days, six months, stump. galena is composed oflead sulfide containing some antimony and tolead poisoning. ceremony, ontheinfant's seventh day oflife, marks the end ofthe seclusion ofthe mother and newborn. Relatives and friends visit, bringing nudut (money gifts), sharbat (sweetened fruit drink), and presents. This isthe time when the infant's name isannounced and many infant girls have their ears pierced bythedaya. Also atthe subu'a theinfant's fava beans, hilba (fenugreek), andother seeds. This amulet is kept tied around thebaby's outer clothes for the whole first year \"so that hewill live.\" Thefirst two weeks are adangerous period for the new baby, since many die ofneonatal tetanus from contamination ofthe knife used tocut theumbilical cord.\" Many mothers inGamil eya recalled how their infants died before the second week oflife, with thetrembling limbs andstiff grimaced smiles that are the hallmarks ofneonatal tetanus. Largely due totetanus and other infectious diseases, the infant mortality rate inGamil eya was 188 per 1,000 (based onpregnancy histories of50of80mothers inthe 27household sample), which is considerably higher than the 83per 1,000 official rate for Egypt as a whole (Carney 1984). Thedeaths ofinfants and young children arerarely reported tothe government forseveral reasons. From 1969 until very recently thedaya had nolegal status inEgypt, despite the fear that thegovernment will punish thedaya ifthebabies that she delivers die, sothey protect her bynotreporting the deaths of infants that shedelivers. Furthermore, infant death issuch acommon experience andchildbirth issofrequent that parents inGamileya donot register children with the government until they are older. Under reporting ofbirths and infant deaths, especially inthe countryside, may account for the large discrepancy between theofficial infant mortality rate for Egypt and the rate inGamileya. Ifaninfant isstill born, orif afetus ismiscarried, inthe mud walls ofthe home. This type ofburial isnot an Islamic custom and itmay bethat the practice dates back to the ancient Pharaonic culture. More mature infants who die are buried in thefield ornear the house. Older children and adults who die have formal funerals and are buried inthevillage cemetery according to Islamic custom. Despite the higher value ofboys, girl babies are loved and are often tenderly cared for. However, when Iobserved neglect of achild, itwasinvariably agirl. Anepisode onher.

Iwould try to pull Mabrouka away from the edge ofthe roof but Iamafraid that I might scare her and cause her torunover the edge, soIsit there holding mybreath, watching her play one foot from the edge. This differential treatment between boys andgirls may account for the 44disparity inthe numbers ofgirls and boys inthe 27household sample. Of187children born to50women from whom pregnancy data were obtained there are 1.26 boys for every onegirl. Childhood Early childhood, from ages one tofour, and later childhood, from age four until marriage, are twodistinct periods inthe hamlet. Until age four, little girls and boys runbarefoot, playing freely with groups ofother children. They play with homemade toys, created from cottonwood sticks and bits ofdiscarded plastic andstring. Sickness from infectious disease continues tobe alarge problem, contributing tothe under-five child mortality 1,000. Vaccination measles, tuberculos is,diph theria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio arelegally required forall children by the Egyptian government (U.S. Institute ofMedicine 1979:46). However, arecent WHO study found that only 30% ofEgyptian children had completed all the necessary inoculations (Horn 1987:55). InGamileya, very few children had even begun any ofthe required immunizations and were thus atrisk for all ofthe above mentioned diseases. Atabout four years ofagegirls begin covering their hair with brightly colored scarves andwearing cotton trousers beneath their long bright dresses. They begin adhering tothe female modesty code, arranging their dresses tocover their legs completely, whenever Squatting orsitting onthefloor. The penalty for improper conduct is harsh. Onethree-year-old girl lifted herdress uptoherwaist impels them tobemodest and obedient, but does not make them meek orpassive. Infront ofstrangers, girls exhibit agreat deal ofshyness, but around their homes they are outgoing andlively. Females are allowed very little geographical mobility: many girls have never left thehamlet and many women have never even traveled tothenearest city. They must beobedient totheir parents, brothers, male cousins, and later totheir husband and his parents. However, within these constraints girls and women express themselves robustly. For example, when thechildren were crowding together totalk tome, they elbowed and pushed each other out ofthe way. Not infrequently agirl would turn and punch aboy, almost knocking himflat. Older women offer their opinions loudly and repetitively toeveryone, including their husbands. Clearly, within the family andwithin their strictly defined roles, girls and women are fully expressive, powerful people. Thesocialization ofboys includes agreat deal ofplayful punching andhitting. After dinner, the whole family sits onthe rush mat inthe living room, watching television. The small boys sit onorrest against their fathers' crossed legs andplayfully slap them. Thefathers and older brothers return theslaps gently atfirst, butwith increasing force. Itisnot long before thelittle boy begins tocry from a painful slap, after which the menjostle him tocomfort him. Assoon as heiscalmed hereaches upwith process seemed to melike agradual toughening ofthe boy to prepare him for the role of aman. Anexcerpt from field notes illustrates theoverbearing manner the boys learn with respect totheir boy head with some clover plants, which his grandmother then grabbed away from him. Running outside hefound acottonwood stick and whacked her onthe head again. Shestarted tocry and his grandmother snatched thestick from his grasp. Again racing out the door he returned with ahuge corns talk, taller than he, which heraised over his head tobeat her with. Atthe same moment his mother appeared inthe doorway, ahuge pan ofdrydirt balanced ontop of her head. She chased him around thehall, notspilling abit of dirt, pulled thecornstalk from him and began thrashing him with it onhis legs and bottom. Hegritted his teeth and stared ather defiantly until she stopped. Turning, she went into the animal room todeposit thedirt. Hejumped upand ,running behind the stairs, emerged with aseven foot long hardwood staff that he raised over his head like alance and charged with, towards his mother intheanimal room. \"Yakelb, eskut yawalid\" (Ohdog, stop ohboy) could beheard from the animal room. Amoment later the two emerged. The mother now with anempty pan atop her head; with one hand she held thestaff and with both amusement andpride. When thechildren become unmanageable, their parents some times threaten them with AbShwal, who isamythical old beggar man, dressed inrags, whocarries alarge sack onhis back. Intohis sack hestuffs naughty children who give too much trouble totheir parents. Atabout five years ofagegirls begin doing women's work. Tiny girls balance small water jugs ontheir heads and learn topat out rounds ofdough. Girls from five toten years are the primary caretakers ofinfants and toddlers. Itiscommon tosee avery little girl struggle tolift her plump two-year-old brother toher hip; when she succeeds his legs hang down below her knees. Inany family gathering ifababy begins tocrytheparents to wash, balancing them ontop oftheir heads on athree-foot wide aluminum 47tray. They make many other trips tothe canal toget wash water, balancing several gallons ontheir heads. Children are sent toschool atabout sixyears ofage, although, as mentioned boys who were not inschool why they did not send them. Invariably, they would shake their heads andreply, \"La\", hiyya fellaha\" (No, sheisapeasant), new tothe people inGamileya and many ofthe parents cannot how fit into orimprove thelives oftheir daughters. Oneskill that ishighly valued, and that several parents mentioned that they would like their daughters tolearn, issewing onafoot driven machine. This skill brings money into the household and makes thegirl more valued asawife. Since the boys most often go toprimary school they donot participate inadult labor asearly asand totheextent that thegirls do. However, from about the age ofseven both boys andgirls help with harvesting the crops and bringing piles ofclover infrom thefields to feed thewater buffalo, cows, and donkeys. Tahara, meaning literally \"purification,\" isthe term for circumcision inEgyptian dialect Arabic. Both Muslims andChristians circumcise their sons and daughters, but the operation occurs at different ages for boys and girls inGami leya. Little boys are circumcised atabout twoyears with great ceremony. The whole family sings andfeasts tocelebrate theevent, which Muslims often perform on theProphet's birthday. Thehealth barber (hallaq sahha) generally performs theoperation that marks the end ofbabyhood and the beginning ofchildhood. Male circumcision involves removal ofthe prepuce from 48thepenis. Itisdone without anes thesia and with little sterility. Ashes from the oven put onthe wound tostop thebleeding andeither kerosene day. Girls are circumcised atabout ten years old, which marks the beginning oftheir preparation for marriage. There isnoofficial ceremony for female circumcision, which isdone byeither the for the Bedouin) whotravels from village tovillage forthis purpose. The formales and isconsidered soimportant that, according toalegend, the Prophet Muhammad was born circumcised (Weideman and Allen 1960:47). Circumcision isnot required byIslamic law forfemales and isillegal according toEgyptian law. Temple carvings and ancient papyri indicate that both male and female circumcision have been practiced inEgypt since the Pharaonic era (Meindarus thetahara, and they were shocked todiscover that Ihadnot been circumcised. They explained that ifagirl isnotcircumcised then herclitoris would grow like a penis (this was accompanied by ahand motion indicating that the clitoris would grow tothe size oftheir index finger). Isaid that 49mine had notgrown--it was tiny. said sothat thegirl nogirl could bemarried until she has hadthis surgery. The women feel strongly that circumcision isnecessary and isnot imposed upon them bymen, who do not know when they doit. Ispoke with four girls who were tobe circumcised the following week and they were wide-eyed and scared, but seemed also tobeexperiencing happy anticipation. For them, this procedure marks astage intheir developing maturity and they welcome it. Menarche marks another step inthedevelopment ofadolescent girls, who begin tomenstruate inthe hamlet between twelve and sixteen years. Since late menarche, possibly secondary tomalnutrition, iscommon, girls are frequently married before their first period. Women in Gamil eya donot believe that men's truation is aprerequisite for marriage. After marriage, most women have frequent pregnancies and periods oflactation between pregnancies. Therefore, they rarely menstruate during their childbearing years. Anumber ofmenstrual health beliefs with thedangers upinside Toprevent cold induced cramps thegirls are cautioned against going out into the cold air. Mothers boil shih (Artemisia herba-alba or wormwood) sothat its steam can flow onto the lower abdomen and perimeal area ofthemenstruating girl. Bathing isavoided until three days after theperiod ceases, until which time the flow isabsorbed byrags. Females and males pass into social adulthood with different experiences. For males, military service transforms them into adults in theeyes oftheir families. Forfemales, marriage isthenecessary 50prerequisite toadult status. Military Service Young men inEgypt have compulsory military service, during which they are poorly fed, poorly paid, and housed inuncomfortable barracks. The length ofservice varies from one tothree years depending onthe young man's education. Since most ofthefell ah\u00edn have not completed secondary school their service isusually thelongest. This isthe young man's first time away where hewas cherished asthe pride ofhis family; notsurprisingly young men complain greatly of being homesick. Clearly, military service isadifficult experience at best. However, military service takes the young man away from the narrow world ofhis hamlet. Ifheisilliterate, hemay learn toread and write. Hemeets people from all over Egypt, learns about city life, and acquires some knowledge ofother countries. Upon his return, the soldier isimmensely more cosmopolitan than his sisters and his prospective wife, who look tohim for information about the world. Marriage and Kinship Ihave described childhood asextending until marriage for females because their mean ageformarriage is15years ofage (range 10to22 years). Furthermore, afemale remains abint (girl) until she is married nomatter how old she is. Marriage issoimportant that of 82 women inthe 27households only two women over 19years ofage had never been married. One ofthese two women had asevere skin disease; the other was 25years old and seemed embarrassed atnot yet being married. 51Of79men over 19years ofage, eight were andpatrilocal inthevillage. Patrilateral parallel cousin marriage isconsidered theideal marriage arrangement in most Muslim and Christian communities inthe Middle East (Patai 1955). Theresidents ofGamileya ranked their they mean aspouse who isnot from one's extended family. One caveat about the\"stranger\" marriages isthat people inGami leya have been intermarrying for generations, sothat itislikely that they marry isa distant cousin. Theactual marriages inGamil eyadiffered from the stated ideal. 26(64%) were toa stranger, 14(34%) were toafather's-brother's daughter, and only one (3%) was to amother's-brother's daughter. One ofthe stranger marriages was also alevorate union, inwhich the man married his dead brother's wife tokeep the children inthe paternal family. Such discrepancies, asthis one between thereal andideal marriage patterns, are widely reported inanthropology. Two aspects ofmarriage that are practiced byMuslims but not by Coptic Christians and isallowed inthe hamlet. Of80ever-married women in the one had been divorced. Polygamy, ofuptofour wives, isallowed byIslam. Of 71ever married men inthe 27 households, eight (11.2%) were married totwo women. However, none were married tomore than two women. One ofthe health consequences ofconsanguineous mating isthe 52increased risk ofrecessive genetic conditions inthe children ofsuch unions. Itispossible that first cousin marriages inGamileya produced more offspring with genetic disorders; however, there was somuch morbidity andmortality from other causes that itwas notpossible to assess the contribution made bygenetic anomalies. Among Bedouin Arabs there is have family organization. They donot keep track oflengthy family histories and can only trace their ancestry back two orthree generations. Fictive kinship istheattribution offamily terms and roles (i.e., sister, cousin, aunt) toanon-family member. When people inGamileya became familiar with that they would protect meand Atthesud, strange women would say, \"Ohsister, help melift this basket tomyhead.\" In this society where family ties are very important, fictive kinship was a way tofit meinto the hamlet that made mefeel very cared for. Marriage isarranged bythe parents but the young man and woman most likely have known each other since childhood. Girls are expected to beobedient totheir parent's choice inmarriage and they must exhibit some shyness andreluctance intheir prospective mate's presence. Iftheprospective spouses areterribly opposed tothemarriage, they may refuse butoccasionally the parents insist ontheir original choice, which may have disastrous consequences. For example, one 12-year-old 53girl was married toan80-year-old man, who died when she was 17. However, most couples seem more favorably matched. Many ofthefirst cousins grew upinthe same house and have known all their lives that they would bemarried. Infact, one ofthefavorite games when the family isgathered around after dinner istopoint out which \"couples\" will marry among the cousins, beginning with the toddlers. They call the couples \"bride and groom,\" tiescarves onthegirls' heads influffy bows, sing \"Ya ya'arusa.\" beautiful bride), and clap rhythmically while thechild couple squirms under theattention. Among Muslims, the marriage is alegal contract isconducted between the years toamass. The bride's father uses the money tobuy gold earrings, bracelets, andring--the shabka--which displays to the whole community how highly valued the wife was asabride. The remaining money isused topurchase bedding and bedroom furniture for the newlywed couple. The shabka formerly included two heavy silver ankle bracelets, called kh\u00fal khl,that many oftheolder village women still wear. However, amore recent trend isfor brides toreceive a gold wedding ring, worn onthethird finger oftheleft hand, which is aninfluence ofWesternization. Coptic couples are married inthe church ofSt. George byapriest. The wife receives the shabka ofgold (bracelets, earrings, and often a ring) from her husband. However, Copts donotpractice the custom of paying mahr asMuslims including her pubic hair. Women continue this type ofdepilation throughout their lives. Another wedding preparation is toredden thebride's hands andfeet with henna tobeautify them. After the wedding the newbride begins wearing theblack elbow length veil known asthetarha, that iswrapped around theface thecotton can bedoubled over toform ahandy pocket for carrying medicines, matches, orother small items. Occasionally, inthe presence ofastrange man awoman might pull the front panel upover part orall ofher face. The most profound alterations inthe woman's life after marriage are change inresidence, toher the beginning ofmany years ofchildbearing. Change inresidence and daughter-in-law status means agreat increase inthe work load. Girls learn women's work intheir natal home and perform most dirty, backbreaking tasks intheir husbands' homes. On top of everything else awife must serve tea toand wait onhermother-in-law, father-in-law, husband andall ofhis brothers. Daughters-in-law grow very lean andmothers-in-law grow plump ininverse proportion. The husband's life changes less upon marriage. Heremains inhis father's house andcontinues todothe work, farming ormanual labor, heperformed before marriage. Hehas passed into manhood wedding does notaffect hisstatus asmuch 55asitdoes hiswife's. For the husband, marriage begins his role as head ofafamily. His sexual needs arefulfilled and helooks forward tothebirth ofhischildren. Heand his wife may grow tolove each other greatly. Many ofthe husbands inthe hamlet glowed with affection and pride when their wives served them tea. Itwasclear that they loved andappreciated their wives. However, the goal ofmarriage inthe hamlet isnot thefulfillment ofromantic love. The ideal marriage isa harmonious union ofthe twofamilies inorder that the couple may work together andraise children whowill care for then whem they areold. Husbands and wives donot expect their spouses tomeet their emotional needs, which arefulfilled bysiblings, cousins, andparents ofthe same sex. Public affection between married couples isnever seen; kissing or hand holding isdone only between members ofthe same sex. marriage tosucceed. isnot avirgin onthe wedding night, then her family will not accept her and shewill bereturned toher family inshame. I asked what would happen toabride who was not avirgin and was told that \"she would bekilled.\" Later, the same woman said, \"Besides, no one would marry her.\" Iwas left with thefeeling that thegirl would probably not bekilled, but thethreat ofher being killed kept most girls from ever testing thelimits ofwhat would happen. Toensure proof ofvirginity, the husband hymen with hisfirst twofingers covered with ahandkerchief. Avillage woman helps with this procedure bytightly holding thegirl's legs apart. The husband passes the blood soaked handkerchief out tothe waiting relatives, who 56celebrate this sign that the marriage hassuccessfully begun. Girls are taught about marital relations bytheir mothers. The mother emphasizes that thegirl must obey her husband and please him. She istold that itisimportant tohave relations with her husband whenever hehaspaid forherinorder that hewould have pleasure inhis sexual relations. Ininterviews, five women stated that the most important role for awoman was tobeagood wife byobeying her husband, helping him inthefields, and serving him athome. Next came the role ofhomemaker, involving cleaning and cooking. Although still considered essential, the role ofmother came last. Never theless, child bearing isextremely important inthe hamlet. Therelatives watch the new bride closely for signs ofpregnancy, which they expect soon after marriage. New brides who have not yet successfully given birth fear infertility and experience great stress. The wife's status increases assoon asshe becomes amother and grows in birth. Child lessness orgiving birth toonly daughters isthe most commonly stated reason that men marry second wives. Daughters help their mothers with housework and are loved bythefamily but sons increase the mother's value. Oneillustration inthe hamlet. Pregnancy data, that were obtained on50of80ever married women inthe 27-household sample, indicated that theaverage 57number ofpregnancies per woman was 5.36 (range 1to18). However, among the 13women inthe sample who had completed their child bearing (age 45andolder), the mean number ofpregnancies was 7.61. Ininformal interviews toexplore the women's self-perception of their health they stated that frequent childbirth was one oftheir major health problems. Forexample, awoman with whom Ibecame quite close was 27years old and had had tenpregnancies. She hadfive living children, two of whom were sons. She felt thought her frequent pregnancies had worn her out and she asked meabout birth control but cautioned menot totell her hamati (mother-in-law), who wanted her to have more children, orher husband, who might beat her. Despite thedesire ofmany women inthe hamlet totake abreak from bearing age(less than 45years) inthe 27households were practicing birth control. The preferred method ofthese women was theoral contraceptive pill. Three ofthe four women had three children each and one had only onechild. Inaddition todisapproval ofhusbands andin-laws, lack ofaccess to health care and ignorance ofthe types ofcontraception available are factors that decrease the use offamily planning. Asecond aspect oftheir lives that the women perceived tocause health problems was theextremely hard work that they perform. Women continue their heavy load ofwork during pregnancy and resume it immediately after thesubu'a ceremony one week after thebirth. Babies are cared for bypaternal grandmothers andolder sisters. Mothers do not do agreat deal ofchild care because their house work issuch a consuming task. While working, the women are exposed toheat from their ovens and cold drafts when they have finished cooking. This 58combination ofhot and cold was held responsible for alarge number of diseases, including eyedisease, fever, andjaundice. Headache was very common among village women and they thought that this was adirect result ofthe heavy loads that they carry ontheir heads. Domestic violence is aproblem inGamileya asitisinevery society. While Ilived inthe hamlet, three wives fled their husbands' homes and sought temporary shelter intheir parents' homes. In addition, anumber ofwomen and men talked and joked about wife beating; several people asked meifmyhusband hit meand when Ianswered, \"No, never,\" they were surprised by myanswer. One condition that protects the women isthat their parents, brothers, and cousins live invery close proximity, soifahusband becomes violent, the wife can run to safety. The twofamilies can then mediate the dispute and put pressure onthe husband tocontrol his abuse. The battered wives Isaw were young anditseemed that asawoman's children age, especially the boys, they may also protect her from her husband's outbursts. The next increase instatus for women occurs when their sons marry and they become mothers-in-law. However, men's status does notincrease comparatively with their sons' marriages. Amen gains agreat deal of formal respect and power when hebecomes the oldest male inhis household. Therefore mother-in-law status and oldest male status are presented ascomparable passages inthelives ofadults inGamileya. Mother-in-law Status Becoming amother-in-law means increased power and respect for the woman. The mother ofsons participates inchoosing their wives. She 59teaches her daughters the importance ofgetting along successfully with their husbands' parents. Similarly, she hopes that herdaughters-in-law will berespectful ofher and oftheother members ofthefamily. These values illustrate thedegree towhich marriage inthevillage is the concern ofthe whole extended family. With mother-in-law status comes adecrease inthe work load. Mothers-in-law trade the heavy, dirty jobs ofcaring for the animals and helping the men inthe fields with increased child care for their grandchildren. However, with this increased child care comes a corresponding increase inexposure tochildhood diseases, trachoma and respiratory infection. Oldest ManStatus Upon the death ofhis father, the oldest man orboy inthe household becomes the head ofthe household. This may happen when the male isquite young, sothat aboy may bethe \"head\" ofahousehold containing three generations ofwomen. The oldest man has final say in household decisions and the home isreferred toashis. For example, when Iwould walk tovisit myfriend, Aziza, and people would ask me where Iwas going, Iwould say, \"I'm going toAziza's house,\" upon which would Finally, to methat house ofhis father's eldest brother. The source ofeveryone's laughter was my mistaken notion that ayoung daughter-in-law could have her own house. Elderly Status Asthevillagers age and become physically less strong, they sit in 60the sun more and doless taxing work. Forexample, the women may sort rice and hold babies and the men may braid donkey tail hair into rope. For some, the event that marks thetransition thehajj. One of the men had made thehajj three times and one had made thetrip two times. Asmentioned, thereturning pilgrams areaddressed and hagga for awoman, followed bytheir first names. Since nearly all Muslims express the hope ofmaking thehajj before they die, many older people arereferred toashagg/hagga whether they have gone to Mecca ornot. Women inGamileya tend tooutlive their husbands, which means that there are more older women than men and more ofthe women are widowed. Of22women age 60andolder (in the 27households), seven were widowed, eight were polygamously married tofour men who were still living, and seven were monogamously married toahusband who wasstill living. Of theeight men age 60andolder inthe same sample, none was awidower. The two male widowers inthe 27households were ages 21years and 50 years; their wives had recently died. Two factors account for this male/female difference. Asmentioned, women live longer than men. In addition, ifaman's wife dies itisnotdifficult for him toremarry whereas itisvery difficult for anolder, previously married woman to remarry. People ofthis age aregreatly revered and are cared for very tenderly bytheir families. Status increases with age inGamileya and bythe time people are referred toasHagg/Hagga, itisatits peak. 61WORK The primary occupation ofthe men inGamileya isfarming crops for sale and consumption. The main cash crops are cotton and wheat, although such vegetables ascabbage, artichokes, and onions are sold aswell. Thefellahin oftheir cotton and governmental agricultural office that iscalled thegam'iyya. Some ofthe wheat crop isreserved tobeground for quntar (50kg. according perquntar. Afedan yields between 12to15'irdabb (140 kg.) ofwheat for which they receive 30L.E. per 'irdabb. From the sale ofthese crops the gam'iyya takes taxes and payment for seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides that thefellahIn purchase oncredit. The cotton isplanted inMarch and harvested inOctober, when the family receives alump sum payment for the crop. This money isused for major expenses and is saved sothat the sons will have the family's land, two were farmers onother people's land (for which they received about 2L.E. per day), 12were manual laborers (truck drivers and workers inthenearby chicken and textile factories), two were employed bythe government inthe gami'eya andrural health unit, onewasanengineer inthe nearby city, and one worked as asecretary inthe hamlet primary school. Afew men from Gamileya were labor migrants: one was employed inacar repair shop in Alexandria and three hadtraveled toIraq and Kuwait tofind work. 62Women's economic contribution intheagricultural sphere has been difficult tocalculate and consequently ignored byresearchers (Adams 1986; Youssef 1974). Intheentire hamlet only two women were formally employed outside the home: one assecretary inthe primary school and one asbank teller inthe nearby city. However, the less recognized work ofwomen includes labor-intensive housework, child care, sewing, assisting the men inthefields, and animal husbandry. Housework inGamileya includes food preparation, washing, sweeping, and child care. The women spend alarge part oftheir day infood preparation, which will bediscussed inthe following section ondiet. Asmentioned previously, the women get piped water from ahamlet atfour kilometers distance. One woman from each family must walk there and back with her donkey nearly every day, which takes two hours ifthe crowd at thepublic tap isnotlarge. They haul wash water from the canal an average ofseven times per day. The dishes arecarried tothe canal to bewashed twice aday aswell as children's clothing and sometimes the children themselves. Adult clothing isscrubbed byhand inahuge copper pan ofheated canal water. The quilted bedding isnever washed, but istaken uptothe roof nearly every day and spread out inthe sun. Every morning all rooms are swept andafter each meal the food scraps are swept from the rush matted floor and fed tothe fowl. Ifthefamily has alatrine and the stone bathing area called ahammam, they must be rinsed with canal water. Used wash water from the men's morning prayer ablutions istaken outside anddiscarded. Child care, which amounts ofbathing ofinfants andtoddlers, isdone bylittle girls andgrandmothers, the 63mothers for heavier labor. Although many menclaimed that their wives were just sitt bait (housewives), the women andgirls often work alongside the men onthe family land. Atcertain times ofthe year, especially the cotton harvest, the whole family picks the crop. The recent increase in education ofboys and factory work orlabor migration foradult men has necessitated increased female participation inthefields. Asmentioned previously, some families own sewing machines onwhich the women sewclothing that they sell toother families inthe hamlet. Ofthe 27households, three had sewing machines, beside which were bolts ofcloth and freshly stitched dresses for women andgirls. Potential customers buy thefabric atthe sqand pay theseamstresses one totwo L.E. for each dress. The largest contribution that the women make totheir families' finances isanimal husbandry. They milk, feed, and clean upafter the cows and water buffalo. They raise goats, sheep and fowl for home consumption and forsale. Thefirst task inthe morning and nearly the last atnight isthe milking. Ittakes tremendous effort tostrip the milk from the distended udders ofthe animals and the women are flushed and sweating when they finish. Since the animals are boarded inside the house, every morning the women scrape upthe manure with their bare hands and carry itout house inpans ontheir pans weighing maybe 50pounds toclean the animal room each morning. Tofill the depression inthe packed dirt floor made by the scooped out dung, the women bring sacks ofdrydirt from thefields, loaded onthe onthefields asfertilizer, used asabuilding material for mud brick houses, oven huts and fowl cages, and asource from which the women make dung cakes that are dried forfuel. Each day the women and children harvest huge piles ofbar sim (Egyptian clover), which they carry infrom thefields tofeed tothe animals. Tofatten the pigeons, chickens, ducks, and geese they push dried, hardened kernels ofcorn off the cob and sometimes stuff them kernel bykernel down thegullet ofabird. Before they let the birds out inthe morning the women examine each one todetermine ifitis about tolay anegg, sothat the egg does not get deposited inthe canal. Atsunset one woman from each family chases the fowl home, calling \"butt-sh\" toget the stubborn ducks out ofthe canal. From the milk ofthe cows and water buffalo the women prepare cream, samna (unchurned butterfat), andsalted logs ofgibna 'arIsh (white cheese) that they bring tothe stiq with eggs, pigeons, and chickens tosell. They receive 30piasters for two small chunks of cheese, and 5L.E. for achicken orapair ofpigeons (these prices are from October 1986). This cash isthen spent onproduce, spices, and delicacies inside thesud. The leftover change istucked safely into a hidden pocket sewed into theneckline oftheir dresses and saved for other expenses. The men and women have separate economic spheres inGamileya. The men earn lump sums ofmoney from cash crops ortheir weekly wage. This money isused for large expenditures, such asadding additions onto their houses orpaying bridewealth fortheir sons. The women contribute tothe daily subsistance ofthe family. Itisthrough the women's 65animal husbandry that they are able tobuy extra food atthe sq, allowing thefamily tosave the income from thecotton crop for major expenses. 66DIET Food intake isinfluenced byitsavailability and bycultural beliefs andpractices that determine which foods areeaten, when, by whom, and how they are prepared. Health andillness are influenced by theinteraction ofnutritional status and disease, which inGamileya is primarily infectious disease. This description ofthe diet inGamileya addresses thebiological andcultural aspects ofnutrition through examining food ascommunication, the crops and market s,water availability, food preparation, average daily diet, snacks, pregnancy and infancy diets, death, food andreligion, anddietary adequacy and malnutrition. inEgypt (Waterbury 1978; Farag 1977). Other nutritional research inEgypt examines specific issues such asmaternal and infant nutrition (Darwish 1979; Mikhail 1982; Field and Ropes 1980 Kader etal1972; el-Mougi etal1981; Burkhardt and Ropes 1981), water availability and storage (White and White 1986; Miller 1984), andagricultural development (Adams 1986). However, none ofthese studies includes afull description ofthediet ofaparticular community. Inthis section provide such for purpose ofilluminating the macrosocial issues described inthe literature asthey occur During the 27households Irecorded everything that was prepared andeaten byevery household member. In addition, Iateeverything the people ate, learned how topat out rounds 67ofbread, pick stones out ofrice, andoperate The purpose recording was ofthe average daily tocalculate nutrient intakes ofindividuals within ahousehold. Interviews onfood beliefs and onseasonal variability ofthe diet, since thestructured observations took place during thewinter. Food asCommunication One ofthe most striking customs inall parts ofEgypt isthe very generous hospitality ofthe people. This hospitality isexpressed most strongly inoffering food. For example, while waiting for the bus from Cairo toAlexandria, acomplete stranger offered me asandwich. I thanked her, butdeclined. Sheinsisted; Ideclined. This occurred several times until Itook the sandwich. Then she went and bought me some tea. Everywhere Itraveled inEgypt, nearly every person Imet was concerned about mydiet. They wanted tomake sure Iwaseating enough andpersistantly urged meto try this Consequently, each ofthe four times Istayed inEgypt, Igained nearly ten pounds. InGamileya, this nurturing ingreetings. When people sayhello they say, \"Tfaddall I,tishrabshay?\" (You are welcome, will you drink tea?). This greeting ismore aformal convention than an actual invitation because people sayitwherever they happen tobe. I have even been invited tocome inand drink tea bywomen standing washing their dishes ofthecanal. Inthe beginning ofmy stay inthe hamlet Itook this invitation seriously and ended up drinking nearly thirty cups oftea per day. Eventually, Irealized that all that was required was tosay \"Thank-you\" several times. Anexcerpt 68from field notes illustrates how royally dinner guests are treated in Gamileya: Iwas invited todinner atthe house ofHagg Ragab and his family. Before Iate, warmed canal water was poured over myhands towash them. The meal was afeast ofrice, beans, chicken, bread, and pickled lemons. When Iwasfull Istopped eating. This husband and wife urged metoeat more. Iate alittle more and stopped. They Iamvery full.\" However, the husband took another chicken piece and, pulling the meat from the bone, handed ittomesaying, \"You must eat.\" Iate some more, getting very uncomfortable, then stopped. Hepicked upmore pieces of chicken and handed them tomeagain. Iate alittle more. Bythis time Iwas leaning backward, taking shallow breaths, because the huge bolus offood was pushing uponmydiaphragm. Ikept saying, \"I'm very astruggle twenty minutes ofalmost fighting with them before they gave in. Crops andMarkets Thefellah Ingrow crops forthemselves andforall ofEgypt. In addition tothe two major cash crops ofcotton and wheat, they grow corn, potatoes, garlic, fava beans, cabbage, artichokes, cauliflower, zucchini, green pepper, yams, sugar cane, carrots, rice, onions, and two kinds ofleafy green vegetables: siris (wild chicory) andjelwin (dande lion greens). Their cows andwater buffalo produce milk, from which the women make butterfat, cream, yoghurt, and long logs ofsalty white cheese made inawoven rush matcalled a\"hasira\". Ducks, geese, pigeons, and chickens provide eggs and meat. However, despite the fact that Egypt has thehighest concentration ofanimals per unit ofland in the world (Horn 1986:25), most ofthe animals are sold and meat is eaten only onceremonial occasions: Holy feast days, funerals, births, and when guests are present. 69From the sqthevillagers buyoranges, tomatoes, lemons, sardines, green onions, kidney beans, black-eyed peas, spices, tea, sugar, and cooking utensils. Inaddition tothis weekly market there aresmall one-room shops inthehamlet, called dukkans, and somewhat larger stores inthevillage center that sell kerosene, tea, sugar, sweets, and canned goods (that nobody ever buys and are caked with dust). Inthe nearby village center thepeasants have their rice milled andtheir corn ground into fine meal. Inaddition, there isthe government store, selling subsidized and rationed wheat flour, tea, and sugar. Next door, the government bakery sells subsidized bread attwopiasters perloaf. Water. Thefellah.In store piped drinking water, mayya hilwa (sweet water), inthezir, which isathree-foot-high clay jug, shaped anipped-in waist like anhourglass that isused inmany parts ofthe advantage clay \"sweats,\" keeping thewater inthe 110\u00b0F. summer temperatures. However, thezir israrely cleaned and each new supply ofwater is poured into theprevious supply. Thezir's cover isanold piece of heavy plastic oraluminum sheet that isnottight fitting and often falls tothefloor. Asadults andchildren dip analuminum can into the 2ir as aladle, their unwashed fingers contaminate the water. Therefore ,even piped water can become asource ofmicrobial contamination. Although almost all water for drinking and making tea ispiped water, families vary inthe degree towhich they use piped water in cooking. During thefull-day observations ofthe 27households, 7(26%) ofthe households used 70preparation. Presumably, most ofthe microorganisms inthe canal water arekilled during cooking, sofor many dishes this practice may not be harmful. However, some families used canal water intheir bread dough. Since the bread takes only 90seconds tobake, many microorganisms may survive tocause illness. Food Preparation Due tothe absence ofpiped water, electricity, refrigeration, and prepared foods, there is atremendous amount ofwork involved inthe preparation offood inGamileya. The women spend agood part ofalmost every morning baking bread and every afternoon cooking the evening meal. Only rarely dofamilies inGamileya buy subsidized bread from the government bakery, preferring instead tobake numerous huge rounds of flat bread. This baking isacommunal activity ofthe women, whosit in the mud brick oven room onburlap sacks around alow wooden table, patting out therolls ofdough until they are thin enough torise inthe air when blown onfrom theside. The youngest daughter-in-law sits, sweating, infront ofthe mudbrick furn (oven), alternately feeding in loaves ofdough and the fuel mixture ofdried dung, hay and cottonwood sticks. Asmentioned, the dough cooks in90seconds, upon which itis scooped out with aniron bar and flung like afrisbee onto apile ofhay tocool. Theair isthick with smoke inthelittle oven hut, stinging the women's eyes until they run with tears. The women believe that this smoke and heat are major causes oftheir eye disease. After sitting in many oven rooms with tears streaming down myface, this folk etiology made intuitive sense to measwell. The women make three different types ofbread: 1/'Ash, which is 71the word for both \"life\" and \"bread\" inEgyptian Arabic, ismade from one-half cornmeal, one-half wheat flour, water, salt, and yeast. Itis soft when warm, crispy when cool, and has anempty pocket inthe center. Itismade two tothree times per week. 2/Bakakimismade from wheat flour, thick cream, salt, water andyeast. This rich delicious bread is only made once per week oreven less often inpoorer households. 3/ Rigag ismade with cornmeal, wheat flour, samna (butterfat that rises to the top ofthe cream when stored several days inthe wooden sandara.), salt, and water. This unleavened loaf resembles atortilla and isbaked about three times per week. Dinner, served atabout six inthe evening, isthelargest meal of the day and takes the women several hours toprepare. They bake steaming casseroles ofrice, cream, milk, andsalt (ruzz bil bram) in the mud brick oven. Rich sauces for the rice are sauteed onthe mud brick stove called tera). Women squat onthe packed dirt floor, chopping onions directly into the boiling mixtures, surrounded bychildren and often animals, since many ofthefamilies cook inthe animal room. Average Daily Diet The family members most often sitcross-legged orkneel ontheleft knee onrush matting around alow round wooden table. They eat with their right hands, asisthecuston inMuslim societies, orwith table spoons. Knives are only used infood preparation and forks are not used atall. Men and boys eatfirst from the communal bowl; women andgirls eat theleftovers. Three meals are eaten and thechildren aregiven 72snacks between these meals. Although there isvariation inthediet, the basic foods are homogeneous from household tohousehold. However, wealthier families are able toafford greater quantities offood and purchased agreater variety offoodstuffs consists foods: Fitar (Breakfast) Bread--dry and crumbled into analuminum pan with heated (not boiled) milk and sugar poured over it. Alternately, there might beleftover rice poured into the bread mixture and, rarely, another leftover food such asfish or stuffed cabbage. Tea--Each person drinks atleast two small cups ofblack tea, with about twotable spoons ofsugar per cup. Occasionally glasses ofheated milk with sugar are given tochildren. Ghada\" (Lunch) Bread--freshly and warm. and 'adIma), sometimes with red pepper init. Thick cream--to dip the bread in. Fresh vegetables--wild chicory ordandelion greens, freshly picked, unwashed and served inabigpile with the rootsstill on. Also, when inseason, cabbage, leeks, green onions, lettuce, cilantro, radishes, and green fava beans. Pickled vegetables--lemons, green beans, cauliflower, etc., prepared bysoaking insalt, pepper, cumin, redpepper, and sometimes orange skins, with water. Tea--black with sugar asatbreakfast. Sometimes either mint or cloves are boiled with the tea tovary theflavor. IfitisMonday orTuesday thefamily may have items that were purchased atthe weekly sug: sardines - salad with tomatoes, green onions, and lemon juice oranges 73halawa (asweet made from crushed sesame seeds and honey) Alternately, there might bebaked potatoes, or acasserole ofonions, tomatoes, garlic, samne, sliced potatoes, pepper, and cumin, orbreaded fried cauliflower, orsliced sauteed eggplant with garlic, tomatoes, cumin, salt and pepper. orfish (caught from theirrigation canal) breaded and sauteed. 'Asha (Dinner) Rice casserole-- rice, cream, milk, water, andsalt. tabbakh--a rich sauce made with onions, tomatoes, samne, cumin, salt, pepper, water and often beans (fava, black-eyed peas orwhite beans) orpotatoes. Alternately, clear chicken broth with lemon and salt. Bread Tea--black with sugar asatbreakfast. Alternate ly, there may bemah's hi(cabbage stuffed with rice and spices), karnabit(breaded, spiced and fried cauliflower), orpasta with samna andonions, or a soup made from thefinely chopped green leafy vegetable called \"mulukhiyya,\" andrarely, hard boiled eggs that are shelled, fried, and dipped incumin andsalt. Snacks Between meals children and sometimes adults snack onthefollowing items: Dates--fresh ordried Yams --roasted in mud brick ovens until the skin is dark and crisp. White corn --roasted on the cob until the kernels are brown and crunchy. Sugar cane --the kids rip off the tough outer bark with their teeth, then chew the inner pulp toget the sweet juice. Bread --freshly baked bread iseaten hot bychildren (and anthropologists) who pass byanoven room where it isbeing baked. The women are very generous with their 74delicious steaming loaves. Sugar--granulated sugar ispoured bymothers in to the eager hands ofchildren as atreat. Carrots--small freshly picked, unwashed carrots areeaten by children and adults. Pickled beans (termis)soaked inwater andsalt. Raw cauliflower root--when the mother ismaking for dinner. Biscuits, sweets, and gum--are sold inthe one room hamlet stores but are only rarely purchased. Occasionally biscuits are made athome ofsamna, wheat flour, and sugar. Pregnancy and Infancy Women's diets donot change greatly during pregnancy although they may eat more oftheir normal diets. Ifthe Ramadan fast occurs during the pregnancy the women usually fast, which mayjeopardize the growth of thedeveloping fetus. Onedietary belief that may tend toincrease the women's intake isthe idea that ifapregnant woman craves some food she must eatitorher baby will beborn with abirthmark intheshape of the food. Ilearned ofanother prenatal food belief when awoman who was seven months pregnant came to mydoor. She explained that she wanted toeat sugar from myright hand soher baby would have blond hair andblue eyes like me. Icomplied with her request but since she was from another hamlet Inever got toseeifthe technique worked. After delivery andestrogens hormonal effects onthemilk-producing breast tissue (Duke 1985:490). 75However, the new mothers often drink only hilba tea, without anywater orother liquids, since they believe that drinking water will cause their abdomens toswell. Thesmall cups ofhilba tea donotprovide enough fluid and the women begin looking dehydrated, with dry oral mucous membranes, which mayactually decrease their milk production. For thefirst week the new mother stays inbed with her baby. She begins breast feeding onthe third day, before which theinfant isgiven anise water with sugar, helba tea, and one teaspoon ofoil per day \"to make him strong.\" The mothers donot believe that colos trum is nutritious for the baby, sothey discard it. Unfortunately, because of this belief, the newborns miss out onthis important source of immunoprotection. Thevillage women breast feed their babies quite unselfconsciously. They may cover the lower part oftheir faces infront ofstrange men (such asthe American ophthalmologist) but they pull their breasts out tofeed their infants while keeping therest oftheir bodies modestly eye isbelieved capable ofdrying upthe mother's milk, sosheguards herself and her baby with and amulets. Another event happens thefamily gets some milk from the dog and the mother drinks it. One dangerous practice inGamileya isthat the mothers donot burp the babies after feeding. Many mothers complained tomethat their infants vomited after being fed anditseemed that the lack ofburping contributed greatly tothis problem. Furthermore, there is no traditional method oftying the baby tothe mother's and aspiration probably claim thelives ofsome infants inthe hamlet who might otherwise survive. Infants enter aworld where contamination oftheir food and beverages decrease thehealth andvitality ofall who survive. Fecal contamination offood begins very early and often causes fatal episodes 26infants (ages 12were fed amixed diet of homemade infant formula andbreast milk, and three (all girls) were completely fed the homemade formula that was amixture ofequal parts of buffalo milk, tea, andwater, with about onetable spoon ofsugar per four ounces offluid. The three baby girls who were completely fedthis formula appeared quite marasmic. The concept ofsterilization ofthe bottle orboiling ofthe formula was unknown tothemothers, which means that bacterial, viral, andparasitic infection starts for many infants inthefirst few andnutrient density ofthe diet isdecreased bythedilution ofthe milk with water and tea, so that the baby's growth suffers tothe extent that this mixture isused. Furthermore, the addition ofsugar toeach four ounce bottle increases the osmotic pressure ofthe formula, drawing water from theintestines andpossibly causing diarrhea and dehydration. Although all women begin breast feeding their babies, they frequently complain that bythe second month their milk has \"dried up.\" Mothers ofonly girls seemed reluctant tobreast feed them inthe hope ofgetting pregnant again sooner andgiving birth to aboy. Also, once awoman becomes pregnant she immediately stops breast feeding and feeds her infant the homemade formula entirely. Since, asmentioned, mothers 77domost ofthe heavy work and childcare isdone bygrandmothers and young girls, there isless opportunity tobreast feed theinfants. Poorly sighted grandmothers prepare theinfants' bottles while the mothers travel tothewater tap orhelp their husbands inthefields. This tothe (1974) has argued that mothers' participation insubsistence activities may decrease their opportunities tobreast feed their children, which inturn increases both child illness and maternal fertility. The situation inGamileya substantiates Nerlove's argument. Further decreasing the quality ofthe diet isthe practice ofwaiting until the baby isapproximately one toone and a half years old tointroduce solid food. Studies oninfant feeding in Cairo found this delay tobeacommon and deleterious practice inthat city aswell (Horn 1987:55). The reason forthis unusually long wait is that the mothers are fearful ofthepotential danger ofthe child choking todeath. tomake itsafe forpre-teething infants, sothe mothers simply wait until the child has teeth tofeed solid food. When solid foods are introduced the mothers start with rice casserole, potatoes, and bread. The and pushed into the baby's mouth with thefingers. When little girls feed thebabies much ofthe food misses the mouth andfalls onthe ground, upon which they pick itupandstuff itback into the babys' mouths. All infants put whatever they can into their mouths, especially 78when they are teething. Inthe hamlet the grandmothers and infants sit inthe sun inthe doorways ofthe houses. The poorly-sight ed grandmothers rarely notice exactly what the babies are chewing on. Not infrequently, Ihave seen teething babies chomping happily ondried pieces ofdung while their grandmothers rest contented lyinthe sun. Clearly, only thevery strongest survive toadulthood inGamileya. Death When someone dies, which occurs nearly every week, itisannounced over theloudspeaker from the top ofthemosque. Immediately ineach household and totake tothe nearest man toslaughter (in Gamileya slaughter must be done byaman). She then plucks, boils, and browns the chicken and packs ahuge tray with rice casserole, warm bread wrapped intowels, water and large enamel bowls oftabbakh sauce. One woman from the household puts ablack dress over herbrightly colored everyday dress, rolls clover orhay into around nest that she puts onher head, and the other women help herlift the huge platter toher head. Shecarries this food tothe family ofthe deceased person, where most ofthe hamlet men and many ofthe women have congregated for asolemn feast. After a couple ofhours the woman returns home, bearing theleftover food, which she feeds toher children. Food andReligion Both Islam and Coptic 79both feast and holy day. Inopposition tothis the Muslim fast ofRamadan and the many Coptic fasts, sharpen theappetite for food ofthefeasts. Islamic festivals are thebasis ofmany ofthe holidays during the year, during which people dress upand eat meat and sweets. The Islamic New Year, Sana Higra, commemorates The Muhammad, Mulid in-Nabi, isthe time when many ofthe weddings and male circumcisions are scheduled because ofthe baraka associated with this occasion. The'Id al-Fitr celebrates the end ofthe Ramadan fast and the\u00baldal-Adha follows forty days later. For the'Idal-Adha thefamily raises alamb tobeslaughtered. Aswith all Islamic animal slaughter, the man holds theanimal's head and says, \"In the name ofGod, God isgreat,\" and cuts thethroat inonestroke. Waiting family members dip their hands inthe fresh blood and make hand prints around the doors ofthe house and onthewalls. These handprints bring baraka tothe ofthis tothose too poor toafford their own. Copts theChristian holy days ofChristmas (which for them isonJanuary 7),Easter, and Epiphany. All Christians and Muslims celebrate Sham al-Nassim one dayafter Easter when everyone \"goes outside tobreathe thefresh spring air.\" This day isalso passed feasting onsardines, colored eggs, and malana (garbanzo Asmentioned earlier, during the month ofRamadan nofood ordrink isconsumed and neither smoking nor sexual relations are permitted from sunrise tosunset. InGamileya, thefast isbroken each evening with a 80shredded honey soaked sweet, called kunaffah, and meat andother special foods are consumed. Copts fast more than 150 days per year: during the 40days ofLent, before Christmas, and every Wednesday and Friday. Their fasts consist oftaking nomeat, animal fat, ormilk products; Qur'an prohibits drinking alcohol (sura W:90), and eating pork, blood and meat from animals that have not been slaughtered according tothe prescribed Islamic method described above (sura W:3). InGami leya, both Muslims and Christians follow these religious proscriptions. Dietary Adequacy andMalnutrition Statistics for Egypt indicate that malnutrition occurs inchildren even though there isenough food available. A1983 World Bank report stated that the per capita caloric supply inEgypt was 2972, which was higher than all other lower and middle income countries cited (White and White 1986). Nevertheless, a1978 study found nearly half ofthe sample children from low income families exhibited mild tomoderate signs of protein-calorie malnutrition (U.S. Institute ofMedicine 1979: 41). These data seem toindicate that while the food mayavailable, itisnot being distributed equally andthat infections may picked crops. However, because ofcustoms, pover ty, and microbial contamination, malnutrition causes growth retardation anddeficiency diseases. 81Certain customs encourage the consumption offood, such asfeasting onholy days and giving snacks tochildren. But certain beliefs discourage food intake and may tip the dietary balance towards malnutrition. Some ofthese beliefs arefairly benign, such asthe belief that eating milk with fish will cause insanity. Fish isonly eaten once per week atmost, soavoiding milk atthat meal would not seriously affect thediet. Somewhat more deleterious for women and girls isthepractice ofeating theleftovers ofthe men and boys. The females seem toeat enough bread andrice, but thefish, cheese and other protein foods are mostly finished bythe males bythe time the communal bowl gets tothe women. Compounding the inadequate diet ofthe women are their frequent pregnancies, which for some are almost attheir biological limit ofreproduction. The most grave consequence ofdietary custom affects the babies and toddlers, who receive diluted, high sucrose, contaminated homemade formula. Thepractice ofdelaying the introduction ofsolid food until one orone and one-half years ofage seems toretard growth and make children ofthis age pale, sickly, and listless. There isarange ofsocioeconomic levels inGamileya and children from the poorer families are atgreater risk formalnutrition. Some families are not able toafford fish ormeat atall. Ifthey raise fowl they may beobliged tosell them for cash. Although most families have acow orwater buffalo, there are some toopoor toafford these milk producing animals. Children inthese families are atgreat risk for malnutrition. Finally, diseases resulting from contamination offood anddrinking 82water are probably the most profound sources ofgrowth retardation and malnutrition inthe hamlet. Inthe day-long observations ofthe 27 households Iobserved offood and drinking water innine (33%) ofthe households. Anorexia due to illness causes decreased intake ofnutrients and diarrhea causes malabsorption ofwhat iseaten (Brown and Black 1981). Furthermore, the body's own immune response requires valuable protein tofight the invaders. This protein may betaken from skeletal muscle, leaving the child wasted when the disease isover (Beisel 1977). Diarrhea has been found toaccount for half ofthe infant deaths inEgypt (Horn 1987). InGamil eya, when thechildren have diarrheal disease the mothers often with hold food and fluids, possibly predisposing them to fatal dehydration and prolonged growth retardation. Ipurchased packets oforal rehydration solution for children who haddiarrhea, but was not once successful inconvincing a mother touse them. Finally, when Irealized that thepeople believe lemon, water, and sugar tobe an effective remedy for many kinds of illness adopted this therapy. Overwhelmingly, growth retardation isthe most striking result of malnutrition. Most children look much younger than their stated ages. Possibly resulting from this growth retardation, puberty occurs fairly late among many hamlet adoles cents. Asmentioned, many girls donot experience Boys who claimed tobeages 15to18had nofacial hair and the high voices ofmuch younger boys. Although itwas impossible toexamine them, they appeared tohave 83delayed development ofsecondary sexual characteristics that would be consistent with delayed puberty. Inaddition togrowth retardation, nutritional diseases affecting children inGami leya and the surrounding communities were noted by physicians onour research team, including: Rickets: ral junction, had been fedexclusively formula, swaddled, and kept out ofthe sun, because itwas believed that she was weak. These factors appear tohave led toa isthehall mark ofthis disease. Pellegra: Poorer families even wheat flour andsubsist onmostly acorn-based Although not disease, caries are a serious nutritionally caused condition inthe hamlet. Most ofthe children have evidence ofdecayed teeth and nearly all ofthe adults have missing teeth. There isnoregular practice ofdental hygiene among most ofthevillagers, such astooth brushing. Even thetraditional Egyptian form oftooth cleaning, the miswak stick (Hassan 1950), isnot used inthe hamlet. The high sucrose intake isprobably amajor factor inthis dental decay. Wealthier adults have some oftheir missing teeth replaced with artificial silver ones, sothat their smiles gleam brightly inthe sun. 84Insummary, food isrelatively plentiful inGamileya and anumber ofbeliefs and practices encourage its consumption, especially during the many ceremonial occasions. However, certain customs tend to decrease thediets ofwomen andchildren. Microorganisms contaminate many ofthefoods andbeverages, but areprobably most deleterious to infants and toddlers, whose immune systems are experiencing these stressors for thefirst time. This potent combination ofpractices decreases infant nutrient intake and contaminates the food that they do get, adding tothe high mortality rate inGamileya anddecreasing thehealth andvitality inthe hamlet and examines thehealth impact ofeach. Theaspects tobeanalyzed are crops, water, dung, insects, crowding, and accidents. The varied andplentiful crops grown bythefell ah.In tend to contribute totheir health. However, the use ofchemical fertilizers andpesticides may poison the farmers while they work inthefields. Thefellah. Inspread these chemicals ontheir crops bythe same they sowtheir seed: thefarmer grasps the hem ofhisgalabiyya in his left hand, making adepression that can hold amound ofseed, fertilizer, orpesticide, andflings the seed orpowdered chemical onto the ground and into the wind with his right hand. Consequently the fellah (farmer) may become covered with thetoxic chemicals, many of which are absorbed through the skin. Theirrigation canals inall ofEgypt andstool aresigns ofharz, asthey call the infection. Since the parasite penetrates the skin ofpeople who are in contact with thewater, men get thedisease while irrigating thefields and women getitwhile washing dishes, drawing water, orhelping the men inthefields. Research conducted near Gamileya found theliver, spleen, and urinary tract leading to cirrhosis and renal failure. Even intheearly stages ofthis chronic disease, continuous blood loss results inanemia andcontributes to 86growth retardation. InGamileya, enlarged spleen issocommon that the fell ah\u00bancond sider it amajor health problem. Egyptian physicians remove theenlarged spleens inorder todecrease theportal hypertension and leading tothe liver. Splenectomy issofrequently performed inthe small private clinics in Sidi Isma'il that many ofthe men and women inthe hamlet have undergone it. There islittle sterility possible inthese small one room clinics and inonethat Ivisited thehealth barber gave anesthesia for the operation. Thus, considerable danger isinvolved inthis procedure. During the time that Ilived inthe hamlet onefourteen year-old newly-married woman died following splenectomy. However, itis proof ofthe strength ofthe Egyptian villagers that many ofthem live through it. Although the villagers were aware ofbilharzia they did not consider enlarged spleen tobe amanifestation oftheinfection. They believed that enlarged spleen was theresult ofimproper diet during times offever. One woman explained that ifyou eat too much when you have afever, then your spleen will grow; the proper diet for fever is liquids and thin soups. The fellah.In quarter their animals indoors tokeep them safe from robbers, 'afrits, and theevil eye. They have been living with their animals since antiquity, asevidenced byHerododus' comment, \"All other men pass their lives separate from animals, the Egyptians have animals always living with them\" (447 B.C./ 1928). These animals represent considerable stolen ordied itwould beagrave loss for thefamily. Nevertheless, they also represent aserious health 87risk. The cows and water buffalo may beinfected (reported tobeBrucell amelitensis, B.abortis, et.al. 1975:682). Both bruce 1losis and M.bovis infection unpasteurized dairy products, which iscommon inthe hamlet; brucellosis can also result from close contact with infected animals and bites from fleas infesting infected animals (Werner 1977). The only animals left outside atnight are theaggressive nocturnal dogs, which can beinfected with rabies. Rabies issuch alarge problem inEgypt that anestimated 2,000 people die from anunprovoked attack byadog the corpses oftwo dead dogs were decomposing inthe irrigation canal. After discovering these two dead dogs Ibecame more and more frightened ofthegrowling live ones. Whenever Ihad togoout atnight village children, who were not afraid ofthe dogs, would surround meand throw fetid upfrom the huge mounds ofit. Animal feces isvaluable forfertilizer, building material, and fuel. Since thefellah'In arefearful ofsomeone stealing their dung, most families pile itclose totheir houses. The people are not aware ofthe potential health threat ofthese feces. In interviews with people in the 25-household sample, 64% did not think that dung could cause disease. Human feces ismixed with animal feces innearly half ofthe households that donot have pitlatrines, because people use the animal room as adefecation site. Even inhouses equipped with latrines the 88small children squat todefecate wherever they happen tobe,which is most often within afew feet oftheir front door. Soon other children andadults walk barefoot over that feces, possibly receiving another dose ofthe hookworm parasite through their skin andcontributing to their anemia. Fecal contamination offood and drinking water isthesource of intestinal parasites, such asAscaris; viral, bacterial, andparasitic diarrheal disease; and systemic diseases, such aspolio andhepatitis A. The long term consequences ofintestinal infections are growth retardation andmalnutrition; the consequence ofpolio may beparalysis for those who survive. Insects are the vectors for several diseases inthe hamlet. Flies hatch from larvae deposited inthe dung piles and rotting food. These eye-seeking flies feed onthenasal mucous and purulent eye drainage of young children, who sometimes have more than tenflies ontheir faces. They gofrom child tochild and appear tobeavector trachoma and other which will bediscussed further 8 (Forsey and Darougar 1981). Fleas (reported tobeorder Siphonaptera) not only may spread disease asmentioned, buttheir very itchy bites induce scratching and secondary infection (Beaver etal1984:707). In the warmer months, from March toOctober, mosquitos hatch inthe stagnant water bethe formalaria andseveral other diseases. Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale malaria cause sporadic infections intheEgyptian delta, but are not endemic (personal communication, Center for Disease Control 1987). Crowding contributes torespiratory, dermatologic, andparasitic 89diseases inGamileya. Much ofthis crowding occurs atnight, since each nuclear family sleeps together inone bed. Compounding the disease exposure caused bycrowding isthe fact that half ofthe hamlet population isunder fifteen years (Courtright etal. 1987). Respiratory diseases, such asupper respiratory infections, otitis media (leading frequently toruptured tympanic membranes), influenza, tuberculosis, and pneumonia infect many people during the rainy winter when thefamily stays huddled together indoors. Respiratory droplet borne diseases such asmumps, measles, and chicken poxperiodically sweep through thesusceptible pediatric population. Skin infections such asimpetigo and ringworm (tinea) appear to time. andchildren. Inapopulation ofthis density ectoparasites thrive. Nearly everyone has head lice, which they periodically treat with hair treatments ofkerosene and combing with anextremely fine-tooth comb. When mothers sit and rest from their work, they often absently pick lice from their children's heads while they gossip with each other. Scabies affected several families during mystay inGamil eya and Idid not escape either ofthese parasites; Igot both head lice and scabies several times during fieldwork. Accidents, especially among young children, contribute greatly to their high mortality rates. Most ofthe houses have roofs without rails that are used todryplants and clothing; children play onthese roofs andoccasionally fall. The water buffalo, cows, and donkeys areusually passive when they are led out tothefields and back home each day. However, some times they become frisky oreven just step inthe wrong 90place and common ofchild the woman who lived next door tomelost her two-year-old son through such adrowning the previous year. Although the highway istwokilometers from Gami leya, pick uptrucks drive through the hamlet totake crops tomarkets for sale. The children runafter the trucks and excitedly jump onthe back and sides for aride. The driver must contend with hundreds ofchildren surrounding hisvehicle; notsurprisingly some ofthese children are injured. Burns are quite common among the village children. Cooking pots andfires are onthe ground. Toddlers crawl and play around them, often falling into thefire orpulling boiling water down ontop ofthem. During mystay inGamileya Isaw many children with burned arms, legs, and faces, which their mothers treated with gentian violet. Itook one small boy tothehospital every day for aweek toreceive treatment for adeep third degree burn onhis arm. The mud brick houses and thatched roofs are quite flammable. While inthe hamlet Iwitnessed one oven room burst into flames. The peasants all ran tothefire, each woman only stopping tograb ahalla (large aluminum pan) forwater. The women efficiently ran back and forthto thecanal with hallas ofwater ontheir heads, which they handed tothe men who threw them onthe flames. Some men climbed tothe roof and hacked upthe smoldering embers. Thanks tothis effort thefire fifteen minutes and nobody was hurt. Insum, Gamileya's environment contains anumber ofserious health hazards. Infectious disease, toxic exposure, and accidents all 91contribute tothe very high incidence context. Although trachoma causes agreat deal ofvisual impairment and consequent loss ofproductivity, for thevillages itisonly one ofthe many afflictions that they suffer. 92HEALTH RESOURCES There are three spheres inwhich health andillness are managed in Gamil eya: within the family, bythe traditional healers, and by biomedical physicians. The family uses amulets and home remedies for disease prevention and treatment ofminor ailments. Home remedies include lemon, water and sugar todrink, which isused for everything from abdominal upsets toeyedisease. Inaddition thevillagers tie akerchief tightly around the head for headache, wrap sheep's wool around the arm orleg for a and rubsalt andoil onthe cover itwith paper for achest cold. Inaddition toadministering home remedies, the cares for individual andhelps todecide onfurther therapy iftheillness does not goaway. Traditional healers every type of who are religious healers, and various other specialists who administer traditional therapies for eyedisease. The traditional healers are resorted toquite often when lower status individuals, such aschildren ornewly married daughters-in-law, are sick. Nearly all ofthe women give birth with thetraditional midwife. Egyptians from the city assume that fellah.In women give birth easily, but like women everywhere, many times their labors are long and 93difficult. Iwas told that ifthechildbirth isextremely long orif asexcessive bleeding, she may betaken bycar tothe nearest hospital (20 km. away). However, hospital delivery even inthe case ofdifficult labors isquite rare. Only one woman that Ispoke with inthe entire hamlet had delivered in a hospital. After delivery thedaya puts apiece ofcloth into thevagina andpresses against itwith her heel to\"get organs up inside again.\" Then, she \"molds\" themother's body all over with her hands to\"get her back into shape again.\" The midwife not only delivers babies butalso advises women who are infertile. One ofher remedies isfor theinfertile women togotothe butcher andget some animal blood, then walk initbarefoot seven times, dip apiece ofcotton into the blood andinsert itinto the vagina me togohome and have myhusband meand come back pregnant soshe could deliver mybaby. When she found outthat myhusband get you!\" The health barber shaves thevillage men and cuts their hair. In addition, with his straightedge razor heperforms eye surgery, circum cises how todointravenous injections (although his aseptic technique is questionable) andprescribes andadministers medications for eyedisease and who sometimes applies atourniquet. Healso 94administers some injections, prescribes the proper diet forhealing, and does massage. Six'attars orherbal istsatthe weekly open market sell herbs, spices, henna toredden hair, hands, andfeet, k\u00fchl todarken theeyes and treat eye disease, and various other medicaments. From them the women buy wormwood, cumin, sheba (alum), and many other medicaments for their home remedies. The tamris is adescendent of aBedouin family from whom she learned her healing skills. She diagnoses diseases ofthe spleen, heart, kidney byplacing her hands over the area. She uses massage and laying onofthe hands for back pain, abdominal problems, and skin rashes. Shetreated mefor lower back pain byspitting onmyback and rubbing it: her treatment worked about aswell asanything else that I had tried. For more severe conditions, such asjaundice, shecauterizes theskin over thearea with hotmetal from theoven, which she says is especially good for curing pain. For other conditions she passes a thread through the skin. Asmentioned previously, the shaikh and shaikha are male and female religious healers. They say prayers for treatment ofvarious diseases and forinfertility. Inaddition, they write verses ofthe Qur'an on pieces ofpaper, called higab, that are Certain shaikhs also conduct thez\u00e4r ceremony that was earlier inthereligion section. Insome parts ofEgypt the zrceremony isvery ayear. 95Physicians inEgypt practice inatwo tiered system containing both governmental andprivate medicine. The local governmental clinic is three kilometers away from the village and adoctor ispresent during the morning hours totreat patients. Most physicians work for the government during the morning hours and have their private clinics in the afternoon (el-Mehairy 1984:19). There are four such private physicians inSidi Isma'il and many more inthe nearby city. However, thevillagers donot like togotothe government doctor for health care. When asked ifthey sought therapy from the government doctor they responded that they \"had noconfidence inhim.\" Others the care issupposed tobefree.\" The government physicians are newly graduated doctors who are forced to doone ortwoyears ofrural service. They often resent this forced service and the low pay of 70 L.E. per month that they receive. Furthermore, being from the educated professional class they are often negatively biased towards their peasant patients. These factors combine tomake them treat thevillagers poorly then usually prefer tosee a private doctor. The sick individual's status inthefamily notonly determines whether heorshewill see abiomedical physician, but also determines how far the family will take him orher for treatment. The higher one's status thefurther one istaken for treatment. 96CHAPTER 5 HISTORY OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS IN EGYPT WITH REFERENCE TO TRACHOMA Theperspective that guides this chapter isanhistorical-political approach tomedical ecology. Idescribe therole of trachoma ocular infections inthe development ofmedical systems throughout Egypt's history and role ofthose medical systems inshaping the ethnomedicine ofthefellah.In inGamileya. Leng (1982) argued that the ofhealth services bythe British colonialists inMalaya occurred because: 1/theindigenous labor force was decimated byinfectious diseases 2/communicable diseases were threatening thelives ofthecolonizers (1982:41 l). El-Mehairy also stressed that \"Western governments undertook international health work toprotect their people from exotic diseases...(and in)... the hope ofpolitical and economic benefit from foreign aid\" (1984:11). While concurring with these arguments, with regard toEgypt Isuggest that the process of anew medical system gaining hegemony because itserved the needs ofanimpera list force began inantiquity. Itisnot an understatement tosay that the Egyptians were not, historically at least, great warriors. Indeed, from the time ofthe Pharaonic rulers until the 1952 revolution Egypt lived under foreign rule. Ibn Ridwan commented onthis aspect ofEgyptian society inthefirst half ofthe 11th century: \"Egypt has little discord and war because ofthe acquiescence ofits people towhoever governs them and the weakness of their resistance\" (Dols 1984: 148). Even since 1952, British, Soviet, and United States political agendas have influenced Egypt andits medical system. 97Egyptian ophthalmic infections, which have been endemic throughout recorded history, conquered the conquerors. Trachoma and other infectious eye conditions spread rapidly insuch crowded conditions as military barracks (Tower 1962; Cornand 1979). The armies were so profoundly afflicted bytrachoma and other ophthalmias that these conditions played amajor role inthe ascent and the focus ofeach system ofhealing. Thus, looking atEgypt's history through the lens of eyedisease reveals the major role that trachoma played initspolitical development. s\u00ba Ananthropological discussion ofmedical systems would be incomplete without looking atthesituation here and now. Redfield's (1956) \"great tradition/little today, biomedicine, isthe most recent of four literate medical systems (Pharaonic, Unani, Prophetic, and biomedicine). The oral tradition of present-day ethnomedicine origins inone ofthe ancient systems, aspresented intable 1. This chapter examines each ofthe major literate medical systems in Egypt, with particular attention tothe treatment oftrachoma and other eyeinfections. Table 2presents including prevalence that tohave atthe time. Toclarify discussion, ahistorical outline ispresented intable 3. Where possible Ihave used English translations oforiginal SOur Cese For Arabic language sources, Iused both Arabic and English versions ofthe source. PHARAONIC Evidence oftrachoma inEgypt during the Pharaonic era comes from artifacts and paintings found inthe tombs rather than from paleopathological studies. The ancient Egyptian mortuary practices did notpreserve theglobe ofthe eye, which receded into the back ofthe orbit during mummification (Sandison 1967). Tocompensate for this atrophy, very skilfully-crafted artificial eyes were commonly inserted into the mummies (Wilson 1972). Thus, itisnotpossible todetermine thepresence ofeyedisease inthese ancient bodies through theless, awealth ofarchaeological evidence suggests that ocular conditions were prevalent. Paintings from the Middle Kingdom (circa 2000 to1750 B.C.) depict blind harpists atreligious functions (1957; ophthalmias inancient Egypt from inscriptions onk\u00fchl-boxes from both the Middle and New Kingdoms. Three eye paints--galena, hematite, and copper sulfate--found inthe tombs ink\u00fchl Harris 1962), arestill used bythefell ahiminGami leya for prevention and treatment ofeye disease. (See Table I). Between 1900 B.C.to1200 B.C.eight medical papyri were written that summarize the medical lore ofthe Pharaonic culture (Leake 1952). 99Thesepapyri contain systematic records ofsymptoms, diagnoses (including advice onwhether thedisease wastreatable ornot), and therapy. ofthese medical records, the Ebers papyrus written in 1550 B.C., gives detailed descriptions of ailments, including granulation, trichiasis, and entropion (Bryan ofthetreatments recommended inthe Ebers papyrus, such as myrrh, breast milk, onions, dung, aloe, and epilation for the inturned eyelashes oftrichiasis, are used bythefell ah.IninGamil eya for treatment ofeye disease. Inaddition, the ancient Egyptians applied some ofthese remedies with the tip of agoose feather (Chance 1939). may newborn babies tomake their eyes \"big andbeautiful.\" Two general treatment homeopathic \"like tocure like\" treatment involved the use ofirritating substances tocure stinging and painful conditions, orwarm substances for burning eyes. According tothis rationale thevillagers inGamileya treat overproduction oftears with onions, either mashed asacompress, orthejuice used aseye drops. They say that the onions treat excessive lacrimation bydrawing outall ofthe tears. InPharaonic medicine gods could both inflict illness and heal it. For example the god Meret-Seger was invoked tocure blindness and Dwaw 100was disease\" (1969:385). for eye disease isthe Mosque of OmHashim inCairo. People afflicted with ocular problems take afew drops ofoil from the lamp above OmHashim's tomb andinstil them into the sick eyes. Also inthe Pharaonic healing tradition the spoken andwritten word were considered to bepowerful enough both tocause and cure disease (Ghalioungui 1963) and theevil eye was abelieved cause of sickness, asitistoday (Krause 1933). The name ofaserious disease was never uttered without first saying aprotective phrase, orthe disease could bemade tooccur. Thevillagers inGamil eya share this belief, especially with respect tothe word shar'a that they use for trichiasis. Asmentioned previously, inGamileya, thereligious healers also treat the headaches that arebelieved tocause eye conditions with scraps ofpaper upon which verses ofthe Qur'an arewritten. According toHerodotus, medical practitioners inancient Egypt were specialists, each attending toaspecific organ system (Ghalioung ui 1969). One ofthe most famous physicians, Iri (Old Kingdom circa 2600 B.C.), also known asPepi-Ankh, was the royal eye specialist and \"shepherd ofthe rectum\" (Arrington 1959). The reputation ofthe Egyptian physicians was sowidespread that according toalegend, inthe fifth century B.C. theruler ofPersia requested from the pharaoh of Egypt the most skillful ofall eyedoctors totreat the dimvision of his beloved mother (Snyder 1965). The pharaoh sent Nebenchari who performed the couching operation ontheelderly woman's cataracts, thus 101curing her blindness and winning the deep gratitude ofthePersian king. However, while Neben chari was inPersia, the pharaoh engaged the services ofhis professional arch rival, who had stolen Nebenchari's manuscript that described thecataract surgery. Inrevenge, Nebenchari used his influence with the Persian king inadevious plan that led to the Persian invasion ofEgypt. Asearly as3,000 B.C., trade existed between the Assyrian and Babylonian societies inMesopotamia and the Pharaonic culture inEgypt (Birchette theAssyrians conquered Egypt (Alport possible that these societies exchanged medical knowledge aswell. InAssyria, during thereign of King Assurbanipal (668 to626 B.C.), there was afull medical library of table tsarranged onshelves and inrooms according tosubject (Birchette 1973:302). of Hammurabi, thesixth king ofthefirst dynasty ofBabylon (Chance 1939). The code physicians' fees and set punishments formalpractice, \"If aphysician...with abronze lancet opens anabcess inthe eye ofa man and destroys the man's eye, they shall cut off his fingers\" (Chance 1939: 2). Among the fewdetails describing eyedisease inthe Code are thebelief that headaches areassociated with bloodshot eyes and the use ofcopper dust for the treatment ofocular ailments, both ofwhich are ofethnomedicine various types ofpractitioners--barber surgeon, 102exorcist, diagnosing seer, and physician--offered their healing skills tothe sick (Ghalioungui 1969). This organization ofhealing practice isvery like that in Egyptian ethnomedicine today. Thus, from the beginning ofrecorded history, inthe area that was tobecome the Middle East, there were literate medical systems with pharmacopia, surgery andreligious therapies for the treatment ofocular conditions, among which was trachoma. The sharing ofmedical knowledge appears tohave occurred between Mesopotamia and Pharaonic Egypt, and elements ofeach ofthese systems are found and thewritings ofGalen (Burge 11976). The humoral pathology system divides the year intofour seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), matter into four elements (fire, earth, water, air), the body into four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile), and gives four qualities toliving things and substances (hot, cold, dry, moist). Treatment fordisease was based ontheprinciple ofopposition; for a disease that was hot and dry, the treatment would becold and moist, etc. (Foster 1978). Unani medicine altered the ancient Egyptian emphasis onspecialization byorgan system towards abelief in imbalance asthe cause ofill-health (Ghalioungui 1969). However, certain Pharaonic ideas were incorporated into Unani medicine, such as thebelief that putrefaction causes infectious illness (Dols 1984). The 103Egyptians knew that topreserve their mummies they had toremove the intestines and thebrain orthey would putrefy and rot the body (Peck 1980). When this idea was taken upbyGalen, itresulted inhis view that bodily surpluses could cause putrefaction and must beeliminated by purging (Dols 1984). The Hippocratic Corpus (written between 430 and 330 B. C.) described aneye ailment that appears tohave been trachoma, Epidemics, cases, the name 'figs' is given tothese\" 1978:124). Thefleshy ofwhich trachoma was considered moist. of condition was believed tobecaused byanexcess ofhumor; the dry the moist toanexcess ofphlegm. This phlegm was thought toflow down from thebrain, which was considered tobe alarge mucus-producing gland, and drip out the eyes and nose. The name \"catarrh,\" which was given tothis flow ofphlegm, was used until quite recently by biomedical physicians. For example, \"vernal catarrh,\" inastandard medical dictionary moist used bythevillagers inGamileya today. Thefirst was described the phlegm by slicing theveins ofthe temple with aknife. The second, which was specific for\"figs\" oftheeyelid, involved everting and rubbing 104away with awooden spindle wrapped with Milesian wool (Chance 1939; Arrington 1959). Unani medicine was first brought toEgypt in 322 B.C. when Alexander the Great established thecity that bears his name, which developed into aninternational medical center with arenowned library (Birchette 1973). Twofactors influenced Alexandria's emergence asa center learning ancient InAlexander's hisfather, tobe his son's tutor (Adamson 1973). Aristotle's personal library included a copy ofevery known medical work, which the young Alexander studied (Birchette 1973). Secondly, Alexander's soldiers inthe Macedonian army were exposed tomany infectious diseases and were ingreat need of medical attention (Adamson 1973). Among these diseases must have been trachoma, which had caused such misery tothe Greek soldiers inthe Peloponesian War wrote Plutus andseveral other plays (Chance 1939). Furthermore, Alexander's regard for medicine was sohigh and the need ofhis army was sogreat that hewas thefirst general tooriginate medical services for his soldiers (Adamson 1973). Perhaps influenced bythe Egyptian practice ofmummification, the early Alexandrian physicians, Herophilus and Erasis tratus (circa 300 B.C.) performed autopsies, and some scholars believe, vivisection on live humans, thus gaining avery sophisticated understanding ofhuman anatomy (Longrigg 1981). Unfortunately, the library atAlexandria was destroyed in 47B.C. soalmost none ofthe early ofwhat for the diagnosis and treatment ofeye conditions (Arrington 1959). Similar to what was suggested intheHippocratic Corpus, Galen's treatment for trachoma included everting the upper lid and scraping itwith apencil made ofpumice. Alexandria was invaded byRome in 30B.C., andlater became part oftheChristian Roman Byzantine Empire (in 395 A.D). During the Roman period, both Heliodorus (circa 100 A.D.) and Paul ofAegina (circa 650 A.D.) studied medicine inAlexandria and developed surgical procedures for the painful inturned lashes oftrichiasis (MacCallan 1936). Heliodorus scalped the eyelids toremove the abrasive hairs. Paul of Aegina pulled the lashes upand out bypinching apiece oftheouter eyelid between twosticks, causing the skin tonecrose and shrink, thus holding the lashes uppermanently. The procedure ofPaul ofAegina was practiced until the last century inEgyptian described inacollection of\"Old Wives' Medicine\" published inArabic Paul ofAegina recognized the stages oftrachoma infection, which the the lingua franca ofEgypt and therest ofthe Muslim world. The medical works of the Greco-Roman period were trans lated into Syriac and Arabic by Christian Nestorian monks, who having escaped from Edessa, Turkey, migrated toPersia and founded the medical school atGundishapur (Mora 1980). According toUllmann, \"Ofall the Greek doctors, Galen was for the Arabs byfar the most significant\" (1978: 10). Noless than 129 of Galen's works were translated into Arabic and his influence was felt in Islamic and European medicine until the 19th century. The most talented translator ofthis era was Hunain Ibn degree\"...\" ofthefollicles oftrachoma. The physicians ofUnani medicine were such specialists inthe preparation ofpowdered eye remedies (called al-k\u00fchl inArabic) that they became known bythetitle al-k\u00fchul (Smith 1972). The powdered k\u00fchls were ground sofinely that the word came tomean a\"fine essence\", which isthe origin ofthe English word \"alcohol\" (Smith 1972). 107Although the term \"k\u00fchl\" has been applied anumber ofmineral substances, thek\u00fchl that contaminated ofk\u00fchl eyedisease medical A.D.) was written intheancient isstill used byCoptic Christians intheir church services. Itcontained 237 prescriptions, many for the eyes, which originated from both Pharaonic and Unani medicine (Krause 1933). This papyrus illustrates thesyncretic blending ofmedical ideas that has been acontinuous phenomenon inEgyptian medicine. Several gifted scholars wrote theories ofvision anatomy 1959; Chance 1939). The most ofthese physicians Ibn Sina, known inEurope as\"Avicenna,\" produced thefive volume Canon ofMedicine (Qanoon at-Tibb). This synthesis ofall that was known ofGreek medicine was the source ofmedical knowledge for European scholars during theMiddle Ages, since many oftheoriginal documents were lost (Hamarneh 1973). Unani practitioners were both philosophers and physicians (Leiber 1979). However, often the \"hands on\"practice oftreating patients was neglected infavor ofscholarly discussion about the nature ofdisease. Even byGalen's time philosophical discourse hadgradually over taken such technical research ashuman dissection, and thequality ofGreek medicine had begun todecline (Nutton 1972). After the Muslim conquest, 108dissection was religiously prohibited, sothat the visual theories of the Arab Unani physicians were based onobservation ofexternal anatomy and study ofthetranslated anatomical studies ofGalen (Sandwith 1905). Two Arab Unani physicians, about trachoma (Smith Cumston 1920). Both ofthese scholars recognized four stages oftrachoma, from early inflammation to chronic roughness. Ibnal-Aissa likened thefirst stage oftrachoma to itto\"an acrid burning humor\" (Smith 1972: 102). Many of the therapies recommended by both doctors are used bythefellah IninGamileya. These include everting thelid and for\"cleansing the body ofthe offending humor... bleeding, beginning first with the cephalic veins\" (Smith 1972: 102). From the 9th through the 13th centuries, when Unani medicine flourished inthe hands ofits Arab practitioners, hospitals oflearning al Mansur Qalaun built amedical foundation (Muristan) with special wards for various ailments, including one for ophthalmia (Sandwith 1905). Al Azhar University was in1005 the teaching ofmedicine, the 109sciences, and Ismaili religious doctrine. European contact with the Middle East onafairly large scale began with theCrusaders, whogained control ofJerusalem andpart ofSyria and invaded Egypt during the 11th through the 13th centuries (Sterns 1983; Cornand 1979). The Crusaders suffered from infectious diseases in Egypt asmuch asprevious armies had and returned toEurope with what appears tohave been trachoma, which they then spread tothecivilian population (Tower 1963; Thygeson 1962; MacCallan 1936). Evidence that this disease may have been trachoma comes from the descriptions ofthe eye diseases ofpilgrims returning from the Holy Lands during the Crusades, including St.Francis ofAssisi (MacCallan 1936). Two years after his return, St. Francis suffered from anocular ailment that severely scarred his upper lid lining and bythe time ofhis death, eight years later, hewas almost blind. Inthe Holy Land during the Crusades twomilitary-religious orders were founded specifically for the care ofsick and injured monk-soldiers and European civilians: the Order ofthe Hospital ofSt.John, which was known asthe Knight Hospitallers, and the Order ofthe German Hospital ofSt. Mary inJerusalem, which was called the Knights Templars. Medical care inthese orders was based onArab-Unani medicine and included rest, diet, herbal pharmacopia, andblood-letting (Sterns 1983). Thus, Arab physicians enthusiastically took upthe Greek medicine ofGalen and theHippocratic Corpus, loyally maintaining the basic philosophy ofhumoral pathology but transforming thedetails and making ittheir own. This transformation resulted from the syncretic weaving ofearlier medical knowledge, ofthePharaonic andother systems, in 110which many ofthe same therapies were employed with different explanations for why they worked. The Greek and Roman colonizers were instrumental inthe ascension ofUnani medicine inEgypt and the prevalence oftrachoma there caused Unani physicians tofocus much of their writings onits description and treatment. Through the agency of thereturning Crusaders, Europe experienced awave ofeyeinfections that may have been trachoma. However, although theCrusading orders built hospitals inthe Middle East, they did not yet introduce medical ideas into Egypt. On the contrary, Europe atthis time was so influenced byArab writers, such as\"Ave cinna,\" that itwas Unani medicine that practiced orders. PROPHETIC Prophetic medicine (Tibb an-Nbi)originated from thepreventive and curative ideas that are embodied inthe Qur'an, which Muslims consider the word ofGod, and the Hadith, which are the collected sayings ofthe Prophet Muhammad. During the time when Greco-Roman medical ideas enjoyed ascendance with the Byzantine elite inEgypt, the Prophet Muhammad (570 to632 A.D.) established anewreligion: Islam. Within 100 years after his death Islam had spread throughout the Mediterranean and the countries that are now part ofthe Arab world (Lewis 1950). Prophetic medicine embodied asystem ofpublic health. The focus oftheProphet's statements concerning health was largely onpurity and pollution, diet (including theslaughter ofanimals, thepreparation and eating offood, andpermissible andforbidden foods), sexuality, the care ofthe sick, and rules governing the treatments ofhealth 111practitioners (summarized from myreview ofthe Qur'an and Hadith). While curative medicine was notheavily the Prophet encouraged thesick toseek treatment. Heisreported tohave said: For every disease there is atreatment. God has not sent any disease without aremedy (Hameed of...spiritual elevation\" Muhammed. Blind people arelisted inthe Qur'an with the lame and the sick asexempt from fighting inwars. The classical Arabic language inwhich (see chapter 5--Ethnosemantics). Some ofthe terms for eye disease that were common inpre-Islamic Arabia, such asramad and'ama (Ullman 1978), are used bythe fellah. IninGami leya their eye ailments. Furthermore, the isused bymodern Egyptian biomedical physicians inthe name \"ramad hubaybi,\" which trachoma, soitis possible that trachoma was among the ocular conditions that afflicted theearly Arab nomads. Pilgrims traveling toMecca forthehajj shared many ofthe same hardships armies suffered, notably crowded makeshift conditions and exposure toinfectious diseases. Eye diseases affected these early Muslim pilgrims, evidence ofwhich istheProphet's saying that thepilgrim who develops sore eyes ispermitted tostop and get treatment (Siddiqi 1979). Despite apparently high levels ofeye disease, Prophetic medicine 112lacks aspecific ophthalmological armamentarium. Only four eye therapies the use oftruffles for anointing theeyes, the importance snakes because harm eyesight, theuse eyes, and medicine byscholars who compare it toUnani medicine asthe way\"native custom, superstition, and magic were given respectability andreligious sanction\" (Dols 1984:896, see also Burgel 1976). Although Prophetic medicine wascertainly not as highly developed asUnani medicine, there are only afew sayings ofthe Prophet regarding charms and \"the rapeutic using Qur'anic verses theevil eye (Jalil 1977). Even the renowned 14th-century Muslim historian, Ibn Khaldun, disparaged Prophetic medicine bycalling it\"Bedouin medicine\" (Rahman 1984:588). The ideas inProphetic medicine probably are, to some extent, Bedouin folk medicine since the Prophet was ofnomadic Bedouin ancestry. However, mixed with desert health lore arenotions of cleanliness similar to(perhaps borrowed from) theBiblical injunctions inthe book ofLeviticus (see Douglas 1966 for ananalysis ofthese). Another influence onProphetic medicine wasthefamous medical school at Gundishapur insouthwestern Iran, where Greek and Indian scholars had been invited toteach (Rahman 1984) and which wasattended byseveral members ofthe Prophet's family (Gran 1979). Therefore, Prophetic medicine is asyncretic blend ofseveral earlier systems and its 113elements are present inrural Egyptian ethnomedicine today. Prophetic medicine gained acceptance through itsassociation with aconquering force, inthis case the newly Islamized Arabs from the Arabian peninsula, who spread their language andculture inthe area that was to become, for Europeans, the Middle East. Anaspect ofEgyptian medical pluralism that isoften lumped together with Prophetic medicine isthehealing system based onpopular Islam that has been called \"Sufi medicine\" (Gran 1979:340). the 11th century, themystical practice emerged inIslam. Sufism, which emphasized direct union with Godrather than reliance onformally codified law, was atfirst seen through ofthegreat theologian Ghazali (1059-11 11A.D.), who merged scolasticism with intuitive Sufi mysticism, that Sufism was granted at least partial orthodox acceptance (Lewis 1958). Aswith popular Islamic practices, Sufi medicine--or maraboutic tothe 19th centuries, Sufi brotherhoods led byor dedicated tomystical holy men became widespread inthe Arab world. Psychospiritual healing traditions became associated with these holy figures and, after their deaths, with their tombs (Gran 1979). The therapy isbased onbaraka (Won Denfer 1976), which asdescribed earlier isconsidered necessary togood health, can treat ill-health, cure infertility, and bring good fortune. One aspect ofSufi medicine that isreminiscent ofPharaonic medicine, and ispracticed inEgypt today, oftombs for cure ofone specific ailment, such asthe tomb of OmHashim and eye disease asmentioned earlier. Other Islamic ideas, such asthe existence ofjinn orspirits, 114play alarge role inSufi medicine ritualized exorcism ceremonies like the zrceremony mentioned intheethnography section (chapter 4). As anoral tradition, Sufi medicine did not gain power byits association with aruling elite. Onthecontrary, popular Sufi healing ceremonies served the needs oftheilliterate peasant class which, like thefellah.In inGamileya, was disenfranchised bythat elite. BIOMEDICINE Biomedicine was introduced into Egypt inthe 19th century by Europeans following the Napoleonic wars (1798 to1815). There have been two phases ofbiomedicine, early and late, demarcated bythe discoveries ofKoch and Pasteur ofthe role ofmicroorganisms in ofthe \"heroic stimulants\" ofThomas Brown (Trevor-Roper 1980). Eyediseases, and many other ailments, were treated with heavy metals (gold, silver, arsenic, andmercury), bleeding with leeches, andpurging. Trachoma andother ocular conditions were attributed toenvironmental and atmospheric influences (i.e. sunlight, moist air, dust), miasma arising from decaying earth and organic matter (Fiebel 1983), unhygienic living, and inadequately-bridled sexuality, especially even trachomatous infiltration was caused by\"excessive onanism.\" Obviously, during this period European medicine wasstill influenced byUnani ideas that were combined with Victorian England's fearful attitude towards sexuality. 115Biomedicine, inthe recent period since the acceptance ofgerm theory, was transformed in1938 with theadvent ofsulfonamides, and later antibiotics, for the treatment oftrachoma (Thyge son 1962). Much ofthe biomedical research onthe cause and treatment oftrachoma has taken place inEgypt. Indeed, Egyptian ophthalmic infections, which so affected the European armies, stimulated this ophthalmological research. Within weeks after arriving inEgypt inJuly 1798, Napoleon's soldiers were simultaneously infected, necessitating several military operations tobeabandoned. Among the remaining men who continued to fight, some required theassistance ofsoldiers who could still see to point their muskets atthe enemy. Although they were only inEgypt for a brief period, thesoldiers ocular needs impelled the French toestablish anophthalmic hospital atGiza (MacCallan 1936). Itwas not long following the building ofthis institution, after three years of fighting both human and microbial enemies, that the French withdrew in 1801 (Feibel 1983). Similarly theBritish, who landed inEgypt in1801, by ocular infections (Feibel 1983). The number ofEnglish soldiers that were partially ortotally blinded was solarge that thegovernment voted 116100,000 per year for the support ofblind soldiers, which was thefirst pension ever granted (Feibel 1983). The rapid spread ofophthalmias to thecivilian population from returning military doctors ofhisperiod, Vetch was contagious through the spread ofpus incommon wash water, towels and bedlinen. Vetch's description ofophthalmia included observations ofgranulations onthe conjunctival the upper eyelids, which hecompared to thevilli inthe small intestine. This metaphor appears tobespecific thefollicles oftrachoma. Vetch's therapy for this ophthalmia did notgreatly differ from that ofmany oftheprevious medical systems and, like those earlier intheethno enthusiasm, inwhich hebled thepatient until the person fainted (Feibel 1983). This treatment illustrates amajor difference between the early biomedical physicians and the Arab Unani doctors. While the procedures may have been the same, such asblood-letting orpurging, the Arab Unani practitioners cautioned moderation inrighting theimbalanced humors; the 19th-century British physicians, onthe other hand, were counted on tohave caused more the whole spread in a virulent form, decimating every army onthe European continent and causing epidemics ofunprecedented proportions in the civilian populations (Duke-Elder 1958). caused International Congress ofOphthalmology that met in Brussels in1857. However, although most ofthe learned discussion was taken upwith this ocular pandemic, \"no unanimity was reached asto causation ortreatment, while even its spread bycontagion was vigorously denied bysome; after the fashion ofthe time itwas weakly concluded that certain localities and the nature ofthe air favoured the onset and spread ofthe affection\" (Duke-Elder 1958: 14). During the middle ofthe 18th century, while Egyptian ophthalmia raged inEurope, European biomedicine became theofficial state medical system inEgypt. Muhammad Ali Pasha al-Kabir became Viceroy ofEgypt, after the previous dynasty, the Mamlukes, lost control ofthe country during their battle with Napoleon (Burrow 1975). Although Muhammad Ali officially ruled Egypt for the Turkish Ottoman Empire, Turkey was quite weak bythat time, which meant that Muhammad Ali's rule wasessentially his own. His success inbattle, evidenced byhis nickname \"the lion of the Levant\" (White 1973), led him tovalue the functioning ofhis army. Itwas tokeep his army ingood health that Muhammad Ali employed Antoine-Barthelemy Clot, better known asClot-Bey, who founded asystem ofpublic health and medical practice inEgypt during the 1820s 1975). Aswith theAlexander's Macedonian army, needs ofamilitary 118service brought anew system toEgypt. Clot-Bey convinced Muhammad Ali that inorder tokeep the army healthy, the general population must bevaccinated against smallpox andthat other contagious diseases must becontrolled. These efforts led tothe establishment of a public health service, aquarantine department, thetraining ofmidwives andbarber surgeons, and the founding ofschools for theteaching of medicine, pharmacy and nursing (Halawani 1951). Eye infections, ofcourse, were among the more problematic contagions affecting the Egyptian population during Clot-Bey's tenure (Burrow 1975). Infact, just 18years earlier in1802, 10were one-eyed, and 20had eyes that were red and covered with pus and scars (Tower 1963). During his 25 years inEgypt Clot-Bey himself suffered 17attacks ofophthalmia, from which hebecame blind inone eye (MacCallan 1936). Perhaps inspired by his own ocular suffering, Clot-Bey's national health service included three ophthalmological clinics that were opened inthe 1840s (Kuhnke 1972). Thebacteriological inEgyptian ophthalmology began with Koch's identification of the Kochs-Weeks bacillus that bears his name (MacCallan 1936). In1883, Koch travelled toAlexandria tostudy a cholera epidemic that was raging and was struck bythe number ofpeople with purulent discharge from their eyes; hemicroscopically examined the pus and made his discovery. In1901, aFrench scientist, Morax, who was also working inAlexandria, distinguished acute conjunctival infections from the chronic infection of trachoma and discovered the Morax-Axenfeld bacillus, which bears his name (MacCallan 1936). This 119medical research was notentirely unidirectional, however. Beginning in thefirst half ofthe 19th century, Egyptian students travelled to Europe tostudy medicine. One ofthese students, Muhammad Ali al-Baqli renowned European trachoma researchers, Ferguson MacCallan (1936), resided inEgypt from 1903 to1923. During that time heoriginated asystematic clinical grading system for trachoma that is still inuse today. His recommended treatments for trachoma carried on thetraditions oftheHippocratic Corpus, including applying copper sulfate totheeverted lid surface and scraping theprotruding follicles both ofwhich are used bythefellah.In today. Since the revolution of1952, Egyptian medicine has been transformed. Egyptian health care providers have taken over the teaching, administration, and practice ofbiomedicine. Inaccordance with Nasser's socialism, there isnearly free medical care, including, by 1974, 3,000 hospital beds for ophthalmological patients (U.S. Inst. ofMed. 1979). United States involvement inEgyptian health care and health research essentially began with Sadat's Open Door Policy (Infitah) of1973 and increased dramatically after the Camp David Peace Treaty of1979. SUMMARY Itseems clear, from this review ofEgyptian medicine, that disease, medical systems andpolitical forces areinterrelated. Each of 120themedical systems inEgypt's history gained ascendence through its association with asociopolitical conquest. Pharaonic, Unani, Prophetic, and biomedicine all have been literate healing traditions associated with aruling elite. Itwas byserving the needs ofthat elite that each system gained hegemony. Ihave examined Egyptian medical history crystalized through the lens ofophthalmia. Ashas been seen, ineach historical period trachoma and other eye infections caused untold suffering and blindness toboth the native Egyptians andtheir conquerors. The magnitude of ocular distress isreflected inthe focus ofeach system onthe cause, prevention, and treatment ofeye disease. However, one might chose any serious infection--plague, typhoid, orschistosomiasis--and look atits prevalence and treatment ineach historical Although infectious ophthalmias have been amajor cause ofsickness anddisability, they are diseases inEgypt. Finally, this diachronic analysis hasilluminated the role of history inshaping present-day traditional medicine. This chapter has documented ofthe contrary, strands ofeach oftheliterate systems have been syncretically blended together and this blending has resulted inthe oral tradition. 12 1Table 1-Part I.

Mubarak 126CHAPTER 5 ETHNOSEMANTICS OF EYE DISEASE This chapter examines the perception, diagnostic categories, and folk etiologies ofeye disease inGamileya, aswell asand the Semantic field, ofhowcultural expressed inlanguage. The semantic field can focus onkinship terms, color names, oronhealth andillness. This approach examines thevocabulary that iselaborated within ofthe four Eskimo for snow (Hymes 1964; 167). Within medical anthropology, Frake's (1961) landmark work on Subanun diagnosis examined which questions the Subanuns these questions the Subanun determined thedisease name ordiagnostic category and ascribed meaning to the disease. Within medical anthropological work conducted inthe Middle East, three studies have focused onethnosemantics tounderstand the meaning ofillness categories orepisodes. bywhich symbols and experiences may coalesce into asyndrome that has meaning within a particular culture. Mary-Jo DelVecchio Good (1980) analyzed the vocabulary that Iranian women use todescribe their health concerns, in which \"blood,\" \"heart distress,\" bybaladiwomen inCairo to transmit information about anillness episode. PERCEPTION OF EYE DISEASE During inter views conducted the 25households, villagers were asked, \"What are the health problems inthe hamlet during the summer/winter?\" Eyedisease was mentioned astheleading health problem inthe summer although itwas not mentioned as aproblem atall inthe winter. Similarly, when in the hamlet 2,\"people in20(80%) ofthe households thought that eye disease was aproblem. However, when asked, \"Does anyone inyour family now have ,orhas anyone had any eye dise ases2,\" many fewer people responded affirmatively. Individuals inonly three (127) ofthe households thought that they currently had eye disease. Inall three ofthese households the number of children ages one to 12with moderate to severe trachoma was greater than the expected number based onthe prevalence oftrachoma inthe hamlet; thus, the families judged correctly that they had eyedisease. However, villagers in 13(52%) of the households thought that they had had eye disease inthe past but did not have itnow andvillagers in9(36%) ofthe households responded that they had never had any eye disease. Ofthese 22households inwhich the members denied current eye disease, 15 had more children (ages one to12)with moderate tosevere trachoma than the expected number for the hamlet; thus, they did notrealize oradmit that they had family members with eyedisease. Willagers inthe remaining seven households judged correctly that their family members were relatively free ofeyedisease. 128Thus, while thevillagers thought that eyedisease was aproblem in thehamlet during the summer they did notperceive ittobeaproblem in the winter. Furthermore, many were reluctant toadmit that their own family members were affected. Although eye disease ismore prevalent in the summer months, asmentioned inchapter 2ophthalmological exams revealed trachoma to beendemic inthe winter aswell. In some cases apparent lack ofperception ofeye disease striking, Atthe time she said this three ofher grandchildren were standing beside her with crusted pus around their eyes. One ofherdaughters had astye (hordeolum) and the nine month old baby she was holding had pus inhisleft eye that three flies were feeding on. There are several possible reasons for this apparent lack of perception. First, eyedisease issoubiquitous inthe hamlet that some redness and discharge from the eyes isconsidered normal, especially inchildren. Inthis setting, ifpeople canstill open their eyes, donot have severe pain, and can see atall, they may not be considered tohave eyedisease. Particularly since trachoma isachronic disease, infecting many people atdifferent times throughout their lives, they may not recognize itasanillness. Second, religious and cultural beliefs discourage the discussion ofdisease. Thesocially acceptable answer to\"How are you?\" is\"Praises toGod!\" a belief that complaining about acondition isquestioning thewill of God. Third, asmentioned previously, there isafear ofthe \"power of the word;\" people are afraid that mentioning health problems may cause them tooccur, which Lipson and Meleis (1987) found among Arab-Americans aswell. During the interviews, people were especially afraid to 129mention the ethnic diagnostic category, sha'ra, which corresponds tothe and occur byspeaking about it. When the word sha'ra was mentioned thevillagers would often hold uptheir hands and say, \"Don't say that word.\" ETHNIC DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES According tothe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis the presence ofnumerous words todescribe aphenomena may influence the people tonotice it (Fishman 1960). Moreover, the premise oflexical studies in asemantic field isthat the preoccupations of ofvocabulary. InGamileya, there are of ethnic diagnostic categories for eyedisease, the 14most common of which are presented intable 4. However, not every villager isable to identify every diagnostic category and ,not surprisingly, the traditional healers have the most extensive eyedisease taxonomies. There are some overlap and disagreement about the categories among the villagers, sothe table should not beinterpreted asrepresenting complete agreement . Some terms, such asmayya bayda (cataract), are used Arabic-speaking physicians aswell asthevillagers. However, the villagers' concept ofthis term, especially its cause andtreatment, differs from the ideas ofthe biomedical physicians. used bythevillagers are not shared bythe Arabic speaking physicians, with theexception physicians households have heard ofthe Arabic biomedical term for trachoma (ramad hubayb)only three were able todescribe the lymphoid follicles orcorneal opacity that characterize various stages ofthedisease and none mentioned trichiasis asbeing associated with trachoma. Knowledge ofthe biomedical name for trachoma wasassociated with parental literacy. Inhouseholds inwhich one or more parents were literate, family members were more likely tohave heard oframad hubaybi (Kendall's tau=0.40 p\u00baO.04). Some ofthe the ramad asadiagnostic category that corresponds tothe biomedical diagnosis ofconjunctivitis rather than being specifically associated with trachoma. However, evidence that the villagers are aware oftrachoma isthat many oftheir ethnic each stages tobeaseparate condition rather than part ofaprogressive syndrome. ETHNOETIOLOGIES Two ofFrake's (1961) questions apply toetiological beliefs eye disease inGami leya: \"What level of belief, concerning ahypothetical case ofeye disease, and the second is apersonal level ofbelief, when eye disease has occured in an individual and heorshe istrying tomake sense ofthe episode. A third level ofetiological belief, that ofsymbolic causation, was elicited byasking specifically about it. When asked, \"What causes eye disease ?,\" the most common answers reflected thehot/cold humoral theories ofthe Unani medical system. In ranked order the responses were: heat,sweat, dampness, and cold. One woman explained thepathological process ofheat as, \"In the summer there isalot ofheat coming from the land. When wework inthe hot sun, sweat gets into the eye and mixes with the heat and the dust and stings.\" Cold inthe eye was described as,\"It happens after awoman hasfinished baking bread. After she leaves the oven, her eye gets exposed toair and shecatches adraft.\" Inaddition, such unpleasant environmental factors asdirty water, dust, smoke, andflies were commonly mentioned ascontributing toeyedisease and one man inthe sample mentioned \"microbes\" as acause. When asked specifically about diet, several individuals thought that salty, spicy food could cause eye disease and several school children mentioned carrots asprotecting eye health. Newborn babies were thought toacquire eyedisease from their mothers' genitals during \"unclean.\" This uncleanness was aresult ofthe mother not washing before andafter sexual relations, notproperly her pubic hair, ornot 132excessive tocause ethnic diagnostic category ofeyedisease had one ormore etiology that was fairly level ofetiological belief waselicited byasking with eye complaints what caused their conditions. Oneseventy year-old man with cataracts inboth eyes described thought precipitated hisvisual decline: became weak.\" andcataracts in her eyes said: \"Igotthis way from carrying heavy loads onmyhead.\" These responses answered thequestion, \"Why did this happen tome(of all people)?\" They included richer detail that enabled theindividual with the when asked, \"Can theevil eye cause eye disease?\" villagers in 16(64%) that (1937) Azande attributed death from afalling granary tobeultimately due to witchcraft. While the proximal cause might beattributed tohot or cold, thedistal cause might beanenvious neighbor's glance. LANGUAGE AND SYMBOLS The language spoken bythevillagers isavariation ofEgyptian dialect Arabic. The concern inthe number ofterms involving vision. Inpoetry isaninsult meaning \"ignorant,\" itisrarely used directly. Instead, there are many euphemisms toindicate poor vision, for well.\") InArab culture poetry been the premier art form. Abu-Lughod (1986) remarked onthe common usage ofthe eye asametaphor for the self and the frequent references toclouded eyes and blindness in Bedouin women's poetry. Poetry isthe form ofthe everyday greetings inGamil eya. For example, when people say \"Good morning\" they literally, thefirst responding, \"Morning of full\" (sabah al-f\u00fcll), is abeautiful smelling flower. Not infrequently, theolder people inthevillage would playfully greet me with, \"Morning ofcream\" (sabah al-'ishta) because they admired mypale skin. This poetry carries over intothe villagers' metaphoric descriptions used todiscuss their eyedisease. For example, an eye isreditis\"like atomato.\" thepupil and makes shadows\" andk\u00fchl, thetraditional eye remedy, works because it, \"eats the redness out.\" This use of metaphoric language appears tobecommon tomany native speakers of Arabic. Reizian's (1984) doctoral study ofArab-Americans noted their rich use ofpoetic metaphors todescribe their medical symptoms. Inproverbs visual imagery also predominates. When thick smoke poured from herneighbor's oven, one woman remarked, \"Al-dukhan al-garib ya\"ama\" (The smoke from those nearby may make you blind.) She explained that her proverb meant that aperson who isclose can doone more harm than someone who isdistant. Non-verbal symbols also illustrate the facination with the eye in Egyptian culture. The Pharaonic eye ofHorus isaclassical example of this preoccupation. More commonly, the eye inthe center ofthe hand in the khamsa wakham inboth verbal and semiotic realms, thepreciousness and perhaps fragility ofvision find expression. SUMMARY This section has examined the semantic field ofeye disease in Gamileya. Theelaboration ofvocabulary describing vision inclassical Arabic and the many ethnic diagnostic categories for eye disease inthe hamlet indicate that eyedisease andvision have been preoccupations within theculture forcenturies. Although fewvillagers recognized the Arabic biomedical term for trachoma, the number ofterms they used to 13.5describe the hallmark signs ofthe stages oftrachoma indicate that it has been amajor ofalternatives within competing healing sequences ofone, orusually more alternatives may beresorted phase toanother when cure isnot 205). Several anumber choices made bythe individual patient. The \"explanatory model\" suggested by Kleinman, Eisenberg and Good (1978) assumes that patients choose therapy and evaluate its efficacy based ontheir beliefs about the causes and treatment ofillness. Young argued that theseriousness or\"gravity\" (1980: 113) ofanillness may influence the choice of therapy. Colson suggested that theeducational level and\"innovation\" of the patient may determine the treatments that heorshe will choose (1971:227-8). All illness episode for thepatient and his orher family. However, the findings ofthe present study indicate that inorder tounderstand patients' choices among available therapies, status and power relations within thefamily and between the patients and practitioners must also beconsidered. Frankenberg (1980) hascalled for anthropologists topay more attention tothe class divisions insocieties inwhich there are competing medical systems. Similarly, Morsy (1981; 1980) argued that status differences within the family, structural principles related to village social organization, and asymmetrical power relations between 142rural peasants and urban elite need tobeincluded intheanalysis of public health problems inthe Middle East. Shestated: Inshort, the limitation ofstudies ofcompeting medical systems inthe Middle East lies, not intheir concern with indigenous medical beliefs, assuch, but intheir emphasis onsuch beliefs tothe neglect ofthe ofhealth care. The results ofthis study substantiate Morsy's argument. Access to and choice of apractitioner for treatment ofeye disease was influenced more byage and gender within the family and byclass differences between patients and their biomedical physicians than bythe ethnomedical beliefs ofthepatients. This chapter first presents the health resources for the treatment ofeye disease inGamil eya and the use oftherapy bythe itanalyzes access totherapy based onthegender and ofthe patient. Finally, alternate hypotheses toexplain the use oftherapy are addressed. LEVELS OF HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY Asmentioned inthe ethnography (chapter 3), therapy isavailable inthree general spheres inthe hamlet: within the family, from the traditional healers, and from the biomedical physicians. For most conditions, especially non-serious eyeailments, thefirst stage for therapy ofaneye disease takes place within the family. When cure does notresult, orifthe problem isgrave, the next step toconsult isthegender and age ofthepatient. 14 3nrural Egypt status increases with age and each age cohort ofmales asgreater status than females. Thestatus techniques andsubstances ofbiomedicine, such asinjections and antibiotics, are used within all three spheres. The majority ofthe fellahin donot hold biomedical beliefs about the cause ofeyedisease. Rather these biomedical modalities are prized asstatus objects. This status value isanimportant influence onthe indigenous practitioners incorporation aspects ofbiomedicine into their practices. TREATMENT MANAGED WITHIN THE FAMILY The family isresponsible for therecognition andclassification of aneye ailment and for deciding ontheappropriate treatment (see table 4). These treatments include home remedies, medicaments purchased from thetraditional herbalist, and drugs purchased from the local pharmacy orthe one-room hamlet stores. The home remedies include drops of strong tea, drops ordrink oflemon, sell many ofthemedicaments that thefellah Inuse for the home treatment ofeye disease. Theherbalists are extremely busy, with never fewer than ten women surrounding them all shouting atonce for what they wish tobuy, and thus donot give much advice about how touse the substances. However, theknowledge for the use ofeach substance ispassed down from neighbors, sothere isnoneed for theherbalist togive instructions. The most popular remedy that the 144villagers buy from theherbalists isk\u00fchl (galena) that they grind with These inrolled cones ofnewspaper and are applied tothe conjunctiva lining the lower lid with the index finger, wet with saliva and dipped into the ground substance. Women, female children, and male babies are the most frequent users ofthese plant and mineral medicaments. Women in18(72%) ofthehouseholds interviewed used k\u00fchl frequently for red, itchy eyes. In Egypt many drugs can bebought without aphysician's prescription atthe ubiquitous pharmacies and the small hamlet stores. The pharmacy inSidi Isma'il consists of two rooms with boxes and bottles ofmedicine and tins ofinfant formula stacked haphazardly ina sort ofordered chaos. Fell ahimcrowd inside, all speaking atonce to describe symptoms--most orone ofhisassistants. The decides onthe appropriate medication and makes pencil lines onthe medicine boxes to indicate how many times per day the medicine should betaken, then wraps the medicine innewspaper. The hamlet stores stock uponeye medicines during the summer, when infectious eye diseases are attheir height. Inthesample ofhouseholds interviewed, 19(76%) ofthefamilies purchased drugs for eyedisease from the pharmacy and 15(60%) bought drugs from both the pharmacy and the hamlet stores. Notall ofthe eye medicines purchased are effective against trachoma orother eye infections. The most common type ofointment was tetracycline and the most common drops were sulfa and chloramphenicol, which areeffective 14.5for treating trachoma and other bacterial infections. The store owners sell parenteral penicillin, meant forintravenous orintramuscular use, mixed with drinking water tobeused aseye drops. This practice is effective against many bacterial infections. However, penicil lin solution does not treat trachoma, it may beirritating tothe conjunctiva ofthe eye, anditmaysensitize susceptible individuals to penic ill inallergy. Two other eye drugs that thevillagers bought contain antihistamines and would not effectively treat the infections that cause most oftheir eye conditions. Onefinal medicine istypical ofthe \"everything but the kitchen sink\" type medicines that are so common in the Third World. Itcontains several antibiotics and cortisone, which may make certain eye infections worse. Like people everywhere, thevillagers save left-over medicine to use again. Arequest bytheresearcher toreview medicines available in the homes revealed any bottles and tubes, carefully put away for the next time they are needed. Often thelabels were smudged but, even so, most ofthepeople areilliterate and cannot read them. Therefore, they mayfrequently use that isout ofdate oruse anadult strength medicine onachild. Eyedisease managed within the family includes awell-developed distinction between prevention and treatment. Table 5lists the preventive andcurative treatments for eyedisease used bypeople inthe eyedisease. Tocounteract this specific threat amulets are worn, children are dressed inold torn clothes and intentionally kept dirty. 14.6Thus, the family defines the eye disease and judges its severity. ome remedies, herbal substances, and biomedical drugs are used within :hefamily for both prevention and treatment. Ifthe condition persists, orifitisjudged tobesevere from theoutset, the next step is toconsult apractitioner, either atraditional healer or a biomedical physician. TRADITIONAL HEALERS Asdescribed inthe ethnography section, the system oftraditional medicine inrural Egypt isquite sophisticated, with practitioners for every type ofproblem. This discussion oftraditional healers will focus only ontherapies used for eye disease. Traditional Midwife Although she performs nocurative therapy, the traditional midwife performs twopreventive treatments for the newborns that shedelivers. After cutting the cord she rubs some ofthe cord blood inthe baby's eyes and mouth. Then, onthethird day oflife she\"slices the baby's eyes open with afeather taken from the wing of agoose orpigeon to insure that the baby's eyes will bebig andbeautiful.\" This feather should have some blood left onitfrom the bird and isusually dipped in onion juice. Then the midwife holds the baby's lids apart and draws the quill end ofthefeather between them. The midwife does notputsilver nitrate drops used countries toprevent blindness from gonococcal infections that might beacquired from the mother during theinfant's birth. Since theprevalence ofgonococcal infection in 147this population isprobably quite lowthis omission may beoflittle consequence. However, infants whose mothers areinfected may beexposed topreventable blindness. Health Barber Thehealth barber performs several types ofeye surgery with his straightedge razor, plucks outinturned eyelashes that rub onthe cornea due totric hias is,and prescribes and administers intravenous medications for eye disease. The most common surgery performed bythe health barber ismaking three vertical slashes onthetemples forpatients whose eyelids are swollen shut. The traditional explanation for this procedure is \"to let the bad blood out,\" thereby decreasing the swelling. After making theincisions herubs powdered k\u00fchl into the wounds and then takes the blood that wasmixed with thek\u00fchl andrubs itinto theaffected eyes. Since isclearly visible, itwas noted during the ophthalmological examinations whether each person had temple scars. Ofthe 375 people inthe 25-household sample, 293 were examined and 61 (21%) had temple scars indicating that this procedure was performed on them when they were children. Amore invasive technique, learned bythe health barber while assisting abiomedical physician, iscurettage oftheinside ofthe lid. This trachoma infection that thevillagers call lahimyya. Five individuals inthe sample had undergone this procedure; all stated that they were helped bythe procedure. The health barber also treats the inverted lashes that are the 148long-term consequences oftrachoma infection. One technique that was formerly used was tocut ahorizontal wedge ofthe outside skin ofthe upper lid topull theinverted lashes outward. The blind beggar who sat outside the weekly open market had had this surgery when hewas ayouth. However, the health barber said that he nolonger performs this operation, since itisnow done inthehospitals. Sometimes even after this surgery has been done the lashes still rubagainst the cornea. If this isthe case the health barber plucks the lashes out. The ophthalmologist noted during the eye exams that several hamlet residents employed this therapy; however, none ofthem were inthe sample interviewed. Inaddition toepilation oflashes the health has developed anew technique ofcauterizing thehair root with ared hot wire. Before lid alocal some conditions with injections. Onecondition, headache, isthought tobeacause of eye disease because itis\"reflected inthe eye and makes the eye red headache thebarber prescribes andadministers intravenous swollen eye, hegives intramuscular penicillin. One individual inthe sample had received intramuscular penicillin from thehealth barber for the treatment ofred swollen eyes. This isanother example ofthe high valuation ofbiomedical techniques and medicines. Religious Healers Totreat the headaches that are believed tocause eyedisease, the shaikh/shaikha write verses oftheQur'an onpieces ofpaper, called 149higab, that are worn bywomen under their heads carves. Prayer onthe eyes ofaclient while writing verses from the Qur'an inpencil onthe afflicted person's forehead isbelieved tobegood for both headache and other types ofeye disease. Villagers from five households inthe sample hadvisited white pottery. The treatment isapplied byeverting the upper lid and rubbing the powder onthe conjunctiva. Patients report that this treatment stings and itches agreat deal but that itworks quite well. T\u00fctya hamra, which isferric oxide orhematite, isbyfar the most Fifteen (60%) ofthe sample households used tutya hamra for the above conditions. Use oft\u00fatya zaraqa, which iscopper sulfate, for eye treatment was reported byonly one household that also uses t\u00fctya hamra. Thread Through the Ear The woman practitioner who passed athread through the ear for eye disease has notraditional title. Itisnosurprise that she also specializes inpiercing the ears ofbaby girls for earrings. The technique, which isbased ontheprinciple ofcounter-irritation, is performed forexcessive tearing bypassing through top oftheear. The thread isleft 150inforthree days, bywhich time pus has begun toooze from thehole. The woman practitioner told methat this technique pulls all ofthe tears from the eye. The villagers use two words, mayya (water) and dam'a (tears) tomean both tears andpurulent discharge from theeye. Inthis case they are obviously equating the pus from the ears with pus intheeye, even though they arereferring totheliquid astears. In the 25households seven children had had this surgery and inthe hamlet there are many adults who hadnoticeable notched scars inthe top of their ears from this procedure. BIOMEDICAL PHYSICIANS Although officially there isfree socialized medical care available, there areobstacles toitsaccess. Anexample notes illustrates thebarriers for eyedisease from the government system: Wesent one man who was blind in one eye and had what seemed to be acorneal abrasion in the sighted eye to the government hospital (20 km. away) intheUniversity car for two days inarow. Thefirst day hewas told itwas toolate tobeseen. Itwas 2PM. The second day he was tested for schistosomiasis inhis stool and urine and sent home with alab slip recording the results that heindeed had schis tosomiasis. Hebrought this tous, thinking that itwas a prescription for eye medicine, because hecannot read. In desperation weasked one ofour Egyptian colleagues from Alexandria totreat the man (although wewere supposed tohave people treated through thelocal system) because ourophthalmologist had not arrived yet from the U.S. Due tosuch barriers, themajority ofthevillagers inour sample sought care from private physicians rather than government physicians for treatment ofeye disease. Sixteen villagers in12(48%) ofthe25-sample households had at least one family member who hadvisited abiomedical physician for eye4A 151disease. Six made visits fornon-surgical treatment for redswollen eyes, eye pain, and headache. Two needed treatment because of accidents: one had afishhook and the other apiece ofwood inthe eye. Eight received surgical treatment: four for lahimyya, one person was operated ontwice forzafar (pterygium), one forsha'ra, and twodid not know what they had been operated onfor. Fourteen (88%) ofthese patients visited aprivate physician. The private physician from whom most ofthevillagers sought treatment practices inthenearest city. Hespeaks tohisfell ah.Inpatients using diagnostic terms with they arefamiliar. Because ofhissensitivity, thevillagers have great trust inhim. COST OF THERAPY: TRADITIONAL W.S. BIOMEDICAL The cost oftherapy varied greatly. The traditional healers average charge wasunder 1L.E. fortheir therapy (range 0to 3L.E.). Treatment bythegovernment 5piasters. Treatment bythe private physicians averaged 8.6 L.E. for medical treatment (range 1.5to 20L.E.) and 40L.E. for surgery (range 15to60L.E.). The fact that thefellahin seek private biomedical therapy, considering its high cost inrelation totheir income, indicates howhighly itisvalued. WHO RECEIVED THERAPY Gender Asmentioned inthe methodology section, byage 30nearly twice as many women inGamileya have trichiasis/entropian from chronic trachoma than men. Despite data that show that more women suffer the potentially blinding sequalae oftrachoma, more males than females 152received therapy from apractitioner. From the sample of375individuals inthe 89household apractitioner 25visited atraditional practitioner and visited abiomedical practitioner. table 6). Thus, 32% ofthe males and 16% ofthe females visited a practitioner. These data suggest that the status associated with male gender allows men greater access totherapy. Further evidence ofthis status hypothesis isthat the five women who visited abiomedical physician were mothers ofsons orgrandmothers. Asdiscussed inthe ethnography section, women gain status asthey give birth tosons and as they age. Even among the women who hadaccess tobiomedical therapy, their age and male children may have granted them the status that influenced their access. Anexample from field notes will support the hypothesis that that women have less access to therapy than men. Mechanic (1962) described the sick role that people learn inall cultures. Welearn how toact when weare sick toelicit care from ourfamilies. InGami leya women and men exhibit different sick role behavior. For most common complaints, such asheadache, sore oritchy eyes, orabdominal distress, the women keep working despite discomfort. They would never lie down in the middle ofthe dayforsimple fatigue orminor ailments. Even during the last part ofpregnancy, they lift heavy water containers and work hard. Thus, fornon-severe illnesses they arequite stoic. However, when the pain becomes severe enough, the women cry, refuse tomove, and 153act like they are dying: The other woman inthe household began topace around the sick woman, saying, \"Ohsister, ohdaughter, one thousand salaams, oh sister.\" Other kinswomen from nearby houses came andjoined inthe chorus, begging God tospare their sister. Soon the men were alerted tothe woman's problem and returned home tofind five women wailing like professional mourners around awoman who was rocking back andforth and crying through clenched teeth. They hastened to call one oftheir relatives orneighbors who owned acar tocome and take the woman to adoctor. Men who are sick did not exhibit this type ofbehavior. They appear tohave access tomedical care without needing toshow anyone how sick they are. The women seem toneed toconvince the men that they are dangerously ill before they are taken tothe doctor. Age. Asmentioned inthe methodology section, children have the highest prevalence ofactive inflammatory trachoma. The sample of 375 individuals contained 222children (ages 0to18) and 153adults, of which 91individuals received therapy. (Two individuals were eliminated from the gender analysis because their gender was not recorded.) More children than adults received therapy. Ofthe 91patients who visited apractitioner, 75were children and 16were adults. However, children's lower status influenced the type ofpractitioner that they visited; children were much more likely tovisit alower status traditional practitioner andadults were more likely tovisit status biomedical practitioner. Ofthe who received therapy: 72(96%) visited atraditional and three (4%) visited a biomedical practitioner. Sixteen adults received therapy: three (19%) visited atraditional practitioner and 13(81%) visited exact test, this difference issignificant atthe poC).0001 level. (see table 7). Although ineach age cohort males have greater status than females, females gain status with age and number ofsons. Bymiddle age awoman with several sons may have greater status than younger males. Among the patients who sought therapy inthe sample, one baby was taken tothe lower status government physician and his mother to ahigher status private physician for the same complaint: ared swollen eye. His mother, who was forty years ofage, had eight living children, four of whom were boys. Inthis case her age and four sons appear tohave given her greater access tohigh status therapy than her male infant had. WHO RECEIVED THERAPY: ALTERNATE HYPOTHESES Rich vs. Poor Thefirst alternate hypothesis toexplain thedifferences in utilization ofbiomedicine isthat the richer people are simply the ones using biomedicine. Totest this hypothesis asocioeconomic scale was constructed that was specific tothe lives ofthe people inthe hamlet and each household was assigned ascore. There were four households oflow, 15ofmedium, and 6ofhigh socioeconomic status (see appendix). This score was cross tabulated with thehousehold use of biomedicine. There was noassociation between socioeconomic status and use ofbiomedicine (Kendall's tau=0.12 poC).53) Thus, wealth did not predict the use ofbiomedicine for eye disease inGamileya. Explanatory Models Asecond alternate hypothesis isthat people used biomedical 155physicians because they understood and agreed with the biomedical explanatory model. Inorder toassess this possibility the interview included questions about etiology ofeye conditions andblindness. The responses tothese questions were categories of\"biomedical and\"traditional one (4%) and revealed belief in abiomedical etiology. According tothis hypothesis, ifthe people responded to these questions with biomedical etiological explanations for disease then they might bemore likely touse biomedicine. This was not atall the case. The responses were crosstabulated with the household use of biomedicine and there was noassociation between belief in abiomedical etiology and use ofbiomedicine (Kendall's ranged from 0.12 to0.58). Educational Level Athird alternate hypothesis, suggested byColson is that more educated \"innovative\" individuals would likely tousebiomedicine. Asmentioned earlier, ofschool ofthe school agegirls are inschool itseemed that those families that sent their girls toschool could beconsidered innovative. The education of the parents andgirls was cross tabul ated byhousehold use of biomedicine. (The education ofthe boys was uniform inthe 25 households and could not beincluded inthestatistical test.) There was noassociation between education ofparents orgirls and use of biomedicine (Kendall's tau ranged from 0.03 to0.09 p60.68 to0.89). Thus, education notpredictive for the use SUMMARY the use bythe gravity ofthe disease seems true for non-serious conditions, which are managed within thefamily using home remedies, medicaments from the herbalist, ordrugs from the pharmacy. For more serious eye conditions the use ofand access totraditional and biomedical practitioners is significantly influenced bythe status associated with age and gender within the family. Class differences account for barriers toaccess to governmental physicians. Because ofpoor treatment bythe physicians, thevillagers overwhelmingly seek biomedical private practitioners. The expense ofthis therapy, considering the poverty ofthepeasants, reinforces its This high status ofbiomedicine inturn solidifies its use status members ofthe family.

Acker knecht failed tomention that the exact mechanism ofaction ofmany biomedical drugs used presently isnotfully understood even bythe researchers who study them. Thus, Ackerknecht's assumption that biomedicine isstrictly rational, leaving the non rational world ofmeaning tothenatives, isafaulty dualism. The opposite perspective, more common inmedical anthropology, examines the symbolic meaning ofillnes and therapy and isexemplified byTurner's (1963) analysis necessary tothe understanding of ethnomedicine, ignoring the patient's physical suffering and the possibility ofalleviating that suffering idealizes and romanticizes ethnomedicine. With the possible exception ofvoodoo death, people do not die from symbols. InGamil eya they die from neonatal tetanus, diarrhea, polio, schistosomiasis, andtuberculosis and they become blind from trachoma and cataracts. Their names for these conditions and their etiological explanations give meaning tothe experience ofthe afflicted. But the treatment isboth symbolic and pragmatic-they do 161not seek therapy only toderive meaning, they seek itbecause they itwill ofethnomedicine--the analysis ofefficacy andculture works symbolically andpharmacologically, each ofwhich must beexamined. Two authors, Moerman (1979) 1,few studies have been conducted that describe ethno-ophthalmologic therapy. Even fewer make any attempt to analyze the potential efficacy orharm ofthe therapy. Turner's symbolic study looked atthe emic qualities that were valued in Lunda medicine. For example, diseases were classified incolor terms (white, black, orred) and the therapeutic quality ineye drops was \"bitterness\" (1963:201). Finseth and Finseth (1975) describe round burn scars onthe face as apart ofWogesha eye therapy inEthiopia. Gwaltney (1970) found that one woman who was blind from onchocerciasis inOaxaca, Mexico, chewed use ofpenicillin ointment bypeople with eye problems as acure-all. Although penicillin isabiomedical substance, inthis case itwas incorporated into the ethnomedicine ofthepeople. However, none of these authors discusses thepotential biological effects ofputting these substances into the eyes. Two ethno-ophthalmological works included some discussion ofthe 162possible efficacy and/or harm ofeye remedies. DuPless is(1978) analyzed Tonga eye remedies, classifying them into animal, vegetable and mineral and measuring the PHofeach substance. The eye drops with an acidic PHoftwo tothree were considered harmful. The author also mentioned that the therapeutic effect ofeye drops could bedue to \"suggestion\" hope that thehealers might beincorporated into the primary health care system. Asdid DuPlessis, they found that some ofthe eye remedies were potentially efficacious and some potentially harmful. These studies addressed thepotential biological outcome ofuse of traditional remedies, but missed agreat deal oftherichness ofmeaning inthe ethnomedicine. EFFICACY Symbolic Both Moerman (1979) and Etkin (1986) argued that healing practices areconsistent with the logic ofthe indigenous medical system and must beviewed within theprinciples ofthat system. Furthermore, according toMoerman, \"The metaphorical structure, the ofmeaning, of a healing discipline isdecisive inits effectiveness\" (1979:60). Levi Strauss (1963) took this argument toamore inclusive level when he said that success orfailure ofahealing ritual issecondary tothe treatment's bearing witness toand validating the system ofshared belief. When the therapies work, itisprecisely this belief, through the agency ofthe placebo effect, ethnomedicine inGamileya is asyncretic blend of five previous medical systems, each with different healing principles. Thevillagers explain their eyedisease therapy using ideas from one or more ofthemedical red eyes. Theapplication of ared substance toinflammed eyes symbolically draws the redness away. Prophetic medicine's emphasis onritual purity and impurity isthe reas onthat pregnant women areespecially careful towash before after sexual relations and toremove their pubic hair. Ifthey neglect these aspects ofhygiene, according tothe hamlet midwife, their babies might beborn with diseased eyes. Baraka, the Sufi healing essence, isintrinsic tothe treatment for woman isrubbed onaspecial stone from Mecca, called \"wada'a\", then instilled into the sick eye every night after sunset until the eye gets better. Since Mecca isthe most holy place inIslamic society, the wada'a contains baraka toheal the eye. Ido not meantoignore the fact that many of the ethnopharmacologic substances have active ingredients that may make them efficacious. But atleast part oftheir efficacy isdue topeoples' belief inthem. The placebo effect, which has been documented to account for between 30 %to60 %oftheeffectiveness ofanyactive medication (Frank 1975), works through physiologic action that is stimulated byfaith inthe treatment. Thevillagers believe inthese remedies, which makes them work, because they make sense within the complex tapestry ofmedical principles that make uptheir ethnomedical 164system. Pharmacological andphysiological ofefficacy ofadrug ortherapeutic regimen (Lilienfeld 1976). Obviously, the ethnomedical techniques and medicines have not been subjected tothis rigorous type oftesting. However, many oftheethno-ophthalmological substances have pharmacologically active ingredients that have been described inmedical botany and ethnopharmacology texts. The problem with using these texts isthat while anherb ormineral substance may have active properties invitro, this does not mean itwill have similar effects inthe eye. Therefore, this section isspeculative; itexaminies thepotential efficacy of traditional ocular data, mechanisms and absorption, distribution, and notderived from studies inwhich they were tested inthe eye. The absorption, distribution, and biotransformation of the substances depend onthe route ofadministration, the concentration of the drug, the frequency ofthe dose, andbiological factors specific to 165the pers ontaking the drug. These pharmacokinetic factors make it difficult tomeasure the effic acy ofany drug, especially an ethnomedical substance inwhich there ismuch variation inhow itis prepared and taken. The routes ofadministration include drops of liquid into theconjunctival sac, compresses applied totheexternal lids, powders rubbed onto theconjunctival ofthe orlower eyelids, and, inthe case ofthehealth barber's remedies, parenteral medications. However, the method ofadministration with each ofthese routes isnot standardized substances. During myobservations inGami Ifound that eye drops sometimes ended upmore onpeople's cheeks than intheir eyes and the strength ofaneyewash depended somewhat more onthe whim ofthe person mixing itthan on astrict recipe. Similarly, theethno-surgical techniques ofthehealth barber are notstandardized and have only been studied anecdotally. Never theless, despite these limitations in assessing the potential efficacy ofthe substances and surgical techniques, some tentative conclusions can bedrawn. Aswith symbolic efficacy, some ofthe eye reme dies are pharmacologically efficacious within the logic ofthe healing traditions. Asdescribed previously, when thevillagers inGami leya have eye drainage that they describe as\"excessive tears,\" they put onion juice intheir eyes. 1 disulfide, causes eyeirritation 1962:164). tears, orasthevillagers putit, \"to draw outall the tears.\" With the same logic thevillagers put very irritating substances into red, irritated eyes. This counter-irritation isexemplified bythe use ofpowdered treatment for aneye that is swollen shut istomake three vertical slashes onthe temple to\"drain out the decrease theperiorbital edema, allowing the eye toopen. Within the biomedical system the remedies can beeffective through astringent, anti-inflammatory, orantimicrobial membranes, causing contraction, decreased secretion, andconstriction of superficial blood vessels (Goodman and Gilman 1975:951). Two examples of astringents that are used bythefell ahin inGamil eya are tea, containing tannic acid, and alum, which isaluminum potassium sulfate. Thevillagers use these substances for red eyes and forexcessive tears; the astringent action oftea and alum could possibly ameliorate these conditions. The classic signs ofinflammation--pain, heat, redness, and swelling--occur inboth infectious and al lergic eye ailments. Substances that decrease inflammation donot treat any underlying infection, but could decrease the discomfort associated with inflammation. Sabr, that thevillage women grind together with their kuhl and rub ontheir conjunctiva, ofburns and wound healing (Morton 1977). Arecent biomedical study involving topical application offresh Aloe vera gel found ittobeaneffective treatment for adjuvant itwas important touse avery small amount ofit. Their caution, considering how many irritating substances they introduce into their eyes, indicates that thesabr isprobably quite one biomedical study, itispossible that itworks todecrease eye redness, itching, swelling, and burning, asthe villagers itdoes. Gilman (1975), the high molecular weight ofdemul cents allows them toform aqueous solutions that have bymechanically coating thesurface. Demul cents areincorporated into some contact lens solutions for this purpose. Since most oftheocular irritation inGamil eya isinfectious in origin, especially from trachoma andother bacterial infections, an important aspect ofefficacy isantimicrobial activity. Several ofthe eye remedies are reported tobeantiseptic, inthat they mayinhibit bacterial growth. These include tea, onion, shih (wormwood), and zinc oxide powder. Afew ofthe substances have been reported tohave antibacterial activity with the potential oftreating infection. Garlic contains anantibacterial substance that has been found tobe effective against gram negative bacteria (Majno 1975). M\u00fcrr orMyrrh, since ancient times highly valued forits wound healing and aromatic qualities, has been found tobespecific for gram positive Staphlococcus 168aureus (Majno 1975). Copper was also found toinhibit bacterial growth invitro (Majno 1975). Probably the most widely used and the most effective traditional eye remedy isbreast milk (Tomsak 1978). Breast milk has been found tocontain awealth ofantimicrobial substances, including the human antibodies secretory IgA, IgM, IgG, other antibacterial factors, such aslysozyme, lactoferrin, andseveral viral neutralizing substances (Tomsak 1978). Thevillagers use breast milk for eyeinjuries that correspond tothe biomedical diagnosis ofcorneal abrasion. This usepotentially offers substantial protection from infection. theobligate intracellular bacteria that causes the only expedient was todestroy the diseased tissue...and thus render thedisease inactive\" (1965:293). This type oftherapy, first described in theHippocratic Corpus, involved everting the upper lid and rubbing orscraping theconjunctival surface. Since theChlamydia lives and reproduces inside theconjunctival cells that line the inner lids, medical orsurgical sloughing ofthis tissue mayalso kill the organism (personal communication Thyge son 1986). Asdescribed previously, the traditional eye remedy tutya (hematite orcopper sulfate) isapplied to the everted upper lid for conditions that correspond tothe biomedical condition oftrachoma. Similarly, thehealth barber everts the upper andcurrettes orscrapes theconjunctiva. However, these modalities are probably notefficacious, since biomedical physicians who employed 169them inthe pre-antibiotic days described the treatment asbeing prolonged andoften ineffective (MacCallan 1931). IATROGENESIS Following Illich's (1976) lead, anthropologists have tended to focus ontheiatrogenesis ofbiomedicine. However, the standard medical definition ofiatrogenesis, \"the creation ofadditional problems or complications resulting from treatment\" (Friel 1974:758) indicates that the concept can beapplied toethnomedical therapy. Indeed, todiscuss thepotential efficacy without addressing thepotential harmful effects romanticizes traditional serious consideration to the ethno-ophthalmology inGami leya itisnecessary toexamine the benefit and the cost. Iatrogenesis from eye therapy can beboth systemic, affecting overall health, andlocal, causing injury and/or infection tothe eye and impairing vision. orlead sulfide ore. Moreover, this poisoning may not only affect those individuals who apply ittotheir eyes, butalso may beexcreted inbreast milk, affecting suckling infants. Acase report from Kuwait describes anexclusively breast fed baby who was brought tothe hospital for convulsions (Harfouche andVerhoestrate 1983). The baby's blood lead level (35.2 mcg./dl.) wasattributed tohismother's regular use ofk\u00fchl, since high lead levels found inher breast milk. Asystemic untoward effect ofthehealth barber's use ofinjections for eye therapy ishepatitis Binfection. Statistics from the World Health Organization and the Egyptian Ministry ofHealth indicate that 170about half ofall Egyptians have contracted the virus, which isspread bythere-use ofsyringes inmedical treatment without sterilization (Horn andneedles is done byphysicians anddentists, the traditional healers would have better aseptic technique than the biomedical practitioners they imitate. Furthermore, when Iobserved a health barber administer aninjection ofantibiotic to asmall child, the dose ofantibiotic was much too large for the child and the needle was notsterilized atall before theinjection. The drugs that the health barber administers can also beharmful. For example, Novalgin, the analgesic that the health barber gives to patients with headache, has been banned inthe United States because it has been found tocause agranulocytosis, apotentially fatal decrease in white blood cells (Silverman, Lee, and Lydecker 1982). Furthermore, thepenicillin that thehealth barber administers quite freely for eye conditions canresult infatal anaphylaxis incases ofallergy. Of course, the biomedical physicians who prescribe these drugs may induce the same iatrogenic effects intheir patients. Afinal systemic effect ofthe ethno-surgery ofthe infection. vaccination against tetanus isrequired bylaw inEgypt, relatively few ofthevillagers have been vaccinated, thus, post-surgical andneonatal tetanus arestill major causes of morbidity andmortality (U.S. Institute ofMedicine 1979). Any break inner aspect ofthe upper lid with his straight edged razor could cause aneye infection. The application of powdered eye medications isalso apotential source ofinfection because they areapplied with asaliva-dampened finger and the powder isshared byfamily members. Anexcerpt from field notes describes the application technique: The woman opened thelittle vial ofblack powder, stuck herfirst twofingers into her mouth toget them wet with saliva, then she put her fingers over thevial one at atime sothey became covered with the powder. Then, she used her third finger topull down her lower lid, exposing the conjunctiva. She then rubbed each finger back and forth over theconjunctiva covering the inner part ofthe lower lid andsclera. She repeated this two times oneach eye (four fingers worth ofpowder). Atthe end her eyes were very red, lids all swollen, andblackish-grey powder wasall over herlids, under her eyes and around them. Tears from her eyes made rivlets through the powder. The technique for children presents adanger ofboth infection and corneal injury, asdescribed inthefollowing exerpt: The mother held herlittle girls down, held their lids apart, and rubbed kuhl ontheir eyes with herfinger eight toten times. To get the powder ontoher finger the mother wet her finger with saliv afrom her own mouth. During theadministration she rubbed directly over the cornea ofeach child, who was wriggling and screaming. Another potential mechanism for infection isthecontamination ofthe substances themselves. Donkey dung compresses for the eye are the prime example ofthis type ofcontamination. Many ofthe remedies have thepotential ofcorneal injury. The cornea, sclera, and inner eyelids are covered byseveral layers of epithelial cells (Duke-Elder 1954). If asuperficial wound occurs to these cells covering the cornea, theresult is acorneal abrasion. 172Although superficial corneal abrasions heal easily without residual visual loss, deeper injuries orcorneal abrasions with associated infection can take much longer toheal and may result inimpaired vision. Anexample ofatechnique that hasgreat for corneal injury midwife's thequill end between the lids ofnewborn babies. Inthehamlet there isone twoyear-old girl who had this procedure done onher third dayafter birth. She isnow blind from central corneal opacities. According toher mother, thegirl was born with normal eyes and acquired herblinding opacities within the first month oflife. While itisnot possible tostate with certainty that themidwife's procedure caused thegirl's blindness, itispossible that this was the case. Aless obvious cause ofcorneal injury isthe powdered substances that thevillagers rub onthe upper and lower conjunctiva. Mechanical injury may occur iftheparticles are notfinely ground andslivers of them lodge inthetissues. Amore potent source ofinjury ischemical reactions induced bythemetals (lead, iron, copper, and zinc) that the villagers introduce into their eyes (Duke-Elder 1954). Since the purpose oftwo ofthese metals (the isto slough upper eyelids, itisentirely that bits ofthe powder could become imbedded inthecorneal epithelium as well. Insome cases these metal lic particles may induce tissue necrosis, resulting inareas ofcorneal opacity (Duke-Elder 1954). This ocular damage would bemore likely ifthere were already existing areas ofcorneal abrasion. 173SUMMARY In. Thevillagers make sense oftheir world, asweall do, byviewing phenomena through their belief system. Eye diseases are nodifferent inthis case than other aspects oflife; they apply theprinciples that guide their lives totheir but Ifound chloramphenicol drops give more improvement from redness and discharge.\" They donot want to merely make sense ofpain, swelling, and redness-- they want ittogo away! Thus, ananalysis ofethnomedicine must take into account both the symbolic andphysiologic aspect ofthe therapy, including thepotential harm ofthe therapy. Toexamine only apart ofthis total thecorrelation environment, behavior, and trachoma inanattempt toidentify risk factors inthe disease. The variables that have been correlated with trachoma and Ballard 1978; 1983; Jones 1975; National Sharma 1986; Taylor etal. textiles (Mann etal. knowledge of trachoma (Portney and Portney (Parthasarathy and Gupta 1962); and shared eye cosmetics (Gilbert 1983). These studies are based onasocial epidemiological perspective that involved large scale survey methods toaddress behavioral variables that areglobal anddifficult tomeasure. Inaddition, some ofthe variables, such \"relatively fewextensive epidemiological studies 179adequately orsuccessfully quantify and test the association of behavioral risk factors with trachoma. More often, socioenvironmental variables rather than behavioral variables are measured\" (1987:17). The advantage ofanthropological methods tostudy behavior isthe combination observation ofbehavior with structured interviews. The combination ofthese twomethods yields not only a detailed description ofthevillagers' behavior, but also provides insight into their beliefs and the meaning oftheir behavior. This chapter first examines \"sanitation\" as acultural concept. Second, the behavioral and interview variables that were crosstabulated with trachoma intensity aredescribed. Third, the major \"protective\" behavior, specifically face washing with soap, that isassociated with low-trachoma intensity ispresented along with thebeliefs that may encourage and discourage itspractice byvillagers. Finally, variables from the observations are crosstabulated with those from the interview todetermine thedifference between what people doand what they say they do, orthe difference between the\"real\" and \"ideal\" behaviors. SANITATION Many epidemiological and biomedical studies ontrachoma infection discuss \"sanitation,\" orrather Belief inSanitation Programs,\" each culture hasits own idea about what cleanliness means. Dunn (1972), inMalaya, and Weir etal. (1952), in Egypt, both developed sanitary-status scoring instruments which guided 180meinthis study. InPurity and Danger, Douglas stated that dirt isrelative, that it isessentially disorder (1966:2). She cited the Hindu custom ofusing cow-dung asacleansing agent. Those ofuswho were taught germ theory define contamination asthe presence ofgerms. Wecannot see the germs and often cannot smell ortaste them, but inorder tokill them weput small amounts ofhorrible tasting chemicals like chlorine into our water. Tous, theaddition of achemical tothe water compare chlorine and cow-dung inthat they are both transforming substances which remove impurities Obviously, Iamnot suggesting the use ofcow dung todisinfect drinking water, but rather that certain cultural concepts ofcleanliness, especially ofritual cleanliness, differ widely among cultures. Inhisanalysis ofritual purity andpollution inIndia, Khare (1962) rightly pointed out that ritual cleanness may overlap with Western notions ofphysical cleanliness oritmay not. InGamileya, many times itdid not. InGami the Muslim concepts ofritual purity and impurity influenced thevillagers' ideas about sanitation. Sexual relations and menstrual blood were seen assopolluting that afull bath was necessitated byexposure tothese conditions. However, cow, buffalo, and donkey dung was not considered very dirty and human feces were only considered mildly unpleasant. Indefining sanitation for the purposes ofthis study, there were three aspects onwhich Ifocused: water contact, feces contact, and washing. Each ofthese aspects was broken down into individual behaviors that could potentially influence trachoma transmission. The 181following section presents the observational andinterview variables that were cross tabulated with trachoma intensity (see Table 10). OBSERVATIONAL WARIABLES Water contact variables Asdescribed previously, the canal isthe source for wash water and thepublic tap inaneighboring hamlet for drinking water. The majority offamilies obtained two ten-gallon plastic jugs ofpiped water every thepublic tapthat stored inaclay vessel (zir) inthe home. The women andgirls drew from thecanal with alarge aluminum pan(halla) anaverage ofseven times per day perfamily. Since the elementary bodies ofChlamydia trachomatis can live in standing water (personal communication Dawson 1987) for several hours, reusing ofwater might beasource ofstanding water inwhich more than one family member washed. Those households with ahammam, the stone area with adrain inwhich people wash and where they can pour water over themselves, might beless likely toreuse standing water. Twelve Asmentioned inthediet section ofchapter 3,the water used in food preparation varied among the households. Seven (26%) ofthe households used only piped water inall food preparation; 15(56%) used polluted canal water inatleast infive (19%) households the source ofwater used preparation was not 182observed. Feces contact variables Latrine: 18(66%) of the households had alatrine that was functioning and was used asanadult defecation site; eight (30%) ofthe households had nolatrine and the adults used the animal room orthe fields asdefecation sites; and inone (4%) household there was a latrine butitwas used asastorage area for cooking pots rather than for defecation. Child defecation site: Even inhomes that had latrines, the children did notalways use them. In14(50%) ofthehouseholds young children (under five years) were observed todefecate inside living areas ofthe house ornear thefront door. This isapossible source of trahcoma infection because Chlamydia trachomatis has been cultured from the rectal swabs from children with active ocular trachoma. Cleaning after defecation: The traditional Islamic method of cleaning after defecation using theleft hand and water was the method described bythe adults. Eighteen children were observed todefecate: Three were cleaned with water inthetraditional method; 8were cleaned with other material, such 7were not cleaned atall. This mayrelate totrachoma transmission because the children who had feces remaining ontheir bodies attracted enormous numbers of flies. None ofthe adults who cleaned the children after defecation was observed towash her hands after thecleaning. Animals: The more animals inthe home, the more dung and the more flies. Twenty-three (85%) ofthehouseholds hadlarge animals (water buffalo, cows, donkeys) and 4(15%) had fowl only. Ofthehouseholds that kept large animals, there were anaverage ofthree animals each. 183Households that had separate entrances for the animals and humans had less manure tracked through theliving, eating and sleeping areas. Twelve (44%) ofthe households had separate entrances and 15(56%) did not . The location ofthe household dung pile greatly influenced the number offlies inornear the house. Four (15%) ofthe households did not have large animals that produce large amounts ofdung and did not have afamily dung pile; 15(56%) ofthefamilies stored their dung away from theentrance ofthe house; and nine (33%) kept their dung right beside the front door ofthe house. Many ofthefamilies prepared orstored food intheanimal room, which provided anopportunity for fecal contamination offood. Eight (30%) ofthe households had their mud brick ovens inthe animal room; 17 (63%) hadtheir mud brick ovens separate from the animal room; 2(7%) of thehouseholds did not have anoven and used their neighbor's oven to bake. Twelve (44%) ofthe households did food preparation, such as peeling, chopping, and boiling food for the evening meal inthe animal room; 15(56%) did these activities separate from the animal room. Five (19%) ofthe households stored their food, such asbread, milk products, oil, etc., inawooden cupboard inthe animal room; 22(81%) ofthe households stored their food inaseparate room. Washing and wiping variables - Face washing decreases thesticky eye andnasal secretions that attract flies. Inaddition, itdecreases passed Innine (33%) ofthehouseholds one or more orbythemother; 184infive (19%) infour (15%) nochildren were observed tohave their faces washed thechildren's faces appeared clean (free ofdirt, nasal and eyedrainage); and innine (33%) nochildren were observed tohave their faces washed and their faces appeared dirty and sticky. Inthose households where the children were not observed tohave had their faces washed, Ireturned early the following morning toobserve thechildren. Ifthe same dirt was inthe same places ontheir faces then the household was scored asnot have washed the children's faces. Adult face washing was somewhat more difficult toobserve accurately since theadults may have washed their faces inprivate. (The observations were specifically focused onthechildren interms of face washing). Adults intwo (7%) ofthe households were observed to wash their faces with soap; adults in 11(4.1%) ofthehouseholds were observed towash with and in 14(52%) ofthe households noadults were observed towash their faces. Hand washing ofmothers could decrease the spread ofocular secretions. Women in 11(41%) households rinsed their hands with water atleast once during the day; women in 16(60%) ofthe households washed their hands with soap and water atleast once during the day. Bathing was not adaily event for most ofthe hamlet residents, particularly during thewinter months when these observations were made. During the full-day observation children inthree (11%) ofthe households were bathed with soap; children in ofthe households were bathed with water; and in22(81%) ofthe households nobathing of 185children was observed. Drying the face isapossible risk factor intrachoma transmission due tothe sharing oftextiles. In 17households 16people were observed todrytheir faces after washing: six aired dry, one used a clean towel; one used aclean galabiya, one used cotton headscarf (worn black headscarf), and one used woman's cotton bloomer undergarment (soiled). In six households areused towel was used for guest hand drying after dinner following aceremonial hand washing with warmed canal water. In the trachoma literature there isfrequent mention of\"sharing oftowels\" as arisk factor. However, inGamil eya towels areexpensive and are more likely tobeused inceremonial ways because oftheir value asstatus objects. Children with runny noses are more likely toattract flies. In15 (56%) ofthe households children wiped away; in 12(44%) ofthehouseholds children had persistent nasal drainage that attracted flies. Crowding Crowding allows more opportunity for sharing ocular drainage, especially during sleep. Inall ofthe households each nuclear family shared abedroom with one bed. When the boys reached puberty they began tosleep with their grandparents. The mean sleeping density in the 27households was 6.83 people per bed (5.5 children and 1.33 parents) (range four tonine people per bed.) Eye seeking flies, which have been reported asMusca sorbens and 186Musca within 30minutes other family members hadfluores cein stain on their eyelids and nares, carried there bytheeye-seeking flies (Jones 1975). Theflies feed ofinfected material (Forsey andDrougar 1981). These studies suggest that flies may be asignificant mode oftrachoma transmission. In 11(41%) ofthe households ontheocular secretions ofthechildren; in 16(59%) ofthe households there were flies around but they did not feed onthe eye drainage of children. Eye wiping Finger-to-eye orclothing-to-eye contact is apotential mechanism for thespread oftrachoma. In10(37%) ofthehouseholds people were observed their their fingers orclothing; in 17(63%) ofthe households nodirect eye wiping was observed. Smoke intensity from the oven during baking was recorded because it was believed bythevillagers to be acause ofeye disease. In addition, when the smoke isreally irritating people are more likely to rub their eyes. In 10(37%) ofthe households the smoke intensity during ofthehouseholds the oven waswell bother 187(7%) ofthe households there was nooven. Sanitation Inaddition to the above-mentioned variables that relate to sanitation each household received ascore for overall sanitation. Nine (33%) ofthe households had above average sanitation inwhich all feces and food scraps were removed very carefully atleast once per day; 12 (44%) ofthe households had and 6(22%) ofthe households had below-average sanitation inwhich feces and food scraps were left everywhere and not removed for the whole day. This variable measured the caretakers' attentiveness tochildren's needs, especially with regard tofeeding them and protecting them from injury due toaccidents. In 18(67%) ofthehouseholds children were adequately fed, their lives were not endangered and they were not ignored; innine (33%) ofthe households children were obviously hungry and not fed and/or serious accidents nearly occurred (i.e. drowning, trampling byawater buffalo, burning, falling from asecond story roof) during theobservation day. INTERVIEW WARIABLES heard oframad hubayb1, but only three were any ofthe oftrachoma as understood bybiomedicine. 188Perception ofeyedisease \"Does anyone in your family now have, orhas anyone had any eyedisease?\" inthree (12%) ofthe households members thought they currently had eyedisease; in 13 (52%) ofthe households members thought they had had eye disease inthe past; and in9(36%) ofthe households members Use Asmentioned inthehierarchy ofresort section (chapter 6), 15 (60%) ofthe households have one or more members who visited a traditional healer for treatment of an eye disease. Regarding traditional substances that are put into the eyes, villagers physician fortreatment ofeyedisease. households purchased biomedical drops orointment from the pharmacy orhamlet store for treatment ofeyedisease. Education Education was assessed separately for boys, girls, and parents. As mentioned, there were 101children ofschool age (55 boys and 46girls). ofwhich 27(17%) (20 males and 7females) stated that they were literate. Socioeconomic status Asmentioned, socioeconomic status was assessed and each household was assigned ofhigh, medium, 6(22%) high socioeconomic status households. PROTECTIVE BEHAWIORS Protective behaviors that are associated with low trachoma intensity can form the basis ofanintervention strategy. Inorder to assess these behaviors the variables were cross tabulated with trachoma intensity ofthe children using Kendall's taustatistic. Of386 household members 164 were children, aged one to 11years, ofwhom 144 (88%) were examined bytheophthalmologist and assigned ascore for trachoma intensity. Trachoma intensity ofchildren was chosen for the analysis because, asmentioned inthe methodology section, thechildren ages one to 11years had the highest prevalence ofactive inflammatory trachoma. The variables significantly associated with low-trachoma intensity were use ofalatrine and face washing ofchildren (see table 10). Face washing ofchildren isnotassociated with latrine soitappears Having alatrine inthe home and washing chilren's faces with soap both appear tobeprotective behaviors. Latrines are important for prevention ofmany diarrheal andparasitic diseases, but their cost in 190Gamileya (100 L.E. each) makes them prohibitively expensive for many of the families and for large scale trachoma intervention projects. Face washing with soap isinexpensive and could form thebasis ofsuch a strategy. The following section addresses thebeliefs that encouraged and discouraged face washing inGamileya. BELIEFS THAT ENCOURAGE AND DISCOURAGE FACE WASHING Two beliefs may have tended toencourage face washing: theritual ablution before prayer that all Muslims must perform and thebelief expressed byafewindividuals that washing with soap andwater prevents eyedisease. Wudu, theritual washing, must beperformed before each ofthefive daily prayers. However, males did not pray regularly until they were seven years old and females did not pray until they were postmenopausal and widowed oranolder co-wife ofapolygamous man. Therefore, children, who have thehighest prevalence ofactive trachoma, and women, who have the highest rates oftrichiasis andblindness, were notpraying and did notregularly perform wudu. When asked about strategies for theprevention and treatment ofeye disease, two (4%) ofthe responses regarding prevention and one (2%) of those regarding treatment advised the use ofclean water, washing, and soap andwater. Although face washing asatherapy isnot awidely held belief, thefact that some ofthe people mentioned itisimportant in planning intervention strategies based onwashing. Rather than introducing anentirely new behavior itwould bepossible tobuild on thepractice ofanexisting behavior. The Egyptian which issold inthe government store inSidi Isma'il for 1there areshortages ofthe soap. Never theless during shortages itis still possible topurchase soap atthestiq, ataslightly higher price. Two traditional beliefs may tend todiscourage face washing. As mentioned, theevil eye isthebelief that theglance ofanenvious person can cause illness ordeath; prevention involves hiding the beauty ofchildren orpossessions. In 15(60%) ofthe households interviewed, respondents agreed with the statement, \"People intentionally keep their children dirty inorder toprevent theevil eye.\" According toUnani humoral pathology, asource of disease. Villagers in 11(44%) ofthe households interviewed felt that itwas dangerous towash when theweather was cold. Innorthern Egypt thewinter months are quite cold and damp. Avoiding washing during these months could contribute totrachoma. However, asmentioned trachoma and other eye infections are atthe highest levels insummer when the weather ishot, andflies the influence ofwealth onface washing ofchildren, these variables were also cross tabulated. Face washing ofchildren was not associated ofthe completely uniform distribution ofboys'education. 192IDEAL W.S. REAL BEHAWIORS The unique aspect tothis study, compared with previous epidemiological studies that have analyzed risk factors for trachoma, is direct observation ofbehavior. Most ofthe epidemio 1ogical investigations used structured questionnaires administered tolarge numbers ofindividuals. While large sample sizes greatly increase statistical power, with sensitive orpersonal issues astructured interview format mayintroduce abias ofits own, especially is acomplete beconsidered inany study, butitis more pronounced among Middle Easterners and other immigrant groups among which saving face isparticularly important\" (1986:9-10). Furthermore, astudy conducted inBangladesh, recall inresponse toquestionnaires onhygienic practices such ashand washing andfeces disposal, found little correlation between observations and interviews (Stanton etal. 1987). Inthe present study theinterview, administered tothe households following the structured observations, contained questions onwashing. Face washing ofchildren and frequency ofprayer, because oftheritual ablution preceeding prayer, were asked about specifically. These responses were then cross tabulated with the same variables recorded during the day ofobservation. There was between a28% and 6.1% discrepancy between observed behavior and responses totheinterview (see Table 11). Anthropologists are quite familiar with this difference between what people doand what they say they do, thedifference between 193real and ideal behavior. SUMMARY Itisclear that theculturally behaviors Notions ofclean inthe hamlet emphasize ritual purity rather than decreasing microbial contamination. Therefore, many aspects oftheir daily lives expose Gamileyans totrachoma transmission. The two\"protective\" behaviors that emerged from thestatistical analysis are latrine ownership and face washing ofchildren. Ofthese scale-trachoma intervention projects. Anthropological methods enhance the study ofinfectious diseases not only byanalyzing behavioral risk factors, but also looking atthe meaning ofeach behavior and thebeliefs that tend toencourage or discourage thebehavior. Furthermore, byexamining thedifferences between observed and stated behavior, anthropological methods provide the most complete picture ofwhat the people areactually doing. 194Table 10 OBSERVATIONAL WARIABLES Water contact variables Frequency ofobtaining piped water Frequency ofobtaining canal water Reusing wash water Presence and use of ahammm Water used infood preparation (piped orcanal) Feces contact variables Latrine Child defecation site Method ofcleaning children after defecation Animals inhouse Separate entrance for animals Location offamily dung pile Location ofoven Location offood preparation Location offood storage Fecal contamination offood ordrinking water Washing and wiping variables Face washing ofchildren Face washing ofadults Hand washing ofmothers Bathing ofchildren Drying offace--textiles used Wiping ofchildren's runny noses Crowding Flies Finger-to-eye andclothing-to-eye contact Sanitation Attentiveness tochildren's needs INTERVIEW WARLABLES disease Knowledge oftrachoma Use oftraditional therapy Use ofbiomedical therapy Socioeconomic status Education ofparents, girls, boys 195Table 11 PROTECTIVE BEHAWIORS: Variables that are associated with inactive or mild trachoma intensity inchildren (0to11).

Indeed, asIhave shown and asanthropologists have always known, inbrief impersonal interviews people maytell you what they think you want tohear. Large but superficial studies may gain statistical power atthe cost of quantifying ofobservation than they dousually. When both observation and interviewing are carried out by aresearcher who has lived for some time with the people and gained their trust the most accurate picture ofthe behavior and beliefs ofthe people isobtained. Asthis work indicates, anthropological methods inanepidemiological research have the potential ofimproving thevalidity ofthedata. The theme ofthis work has been theinter relation ofbiology and culture. Asthe ethnography chapter made clear thefellahin are somuch more than face less peasants with eyedisease. They getmarried, have 198children, fight, laugh, and love. They suffer from many other diseases, which, when acute, may bemore compelling than trachoma. Nevertheless, chronic andcomparatively subtle, trachoma robs people ofthevision necessary for productivity and ishighest among the rural poor insuch hamlets asGamileya. Endemic trachoma has enormously affected the culture. Historically, trachoma and other ophthalmias have influenced the introduction ofliterate medical systems into Egypt. thefragility ofsight has resulted inthe predominance ofvisual imagery inArabic poetry, and proverbs. Although the villagers could notidentify theArabic biomedical term for trachoma and often denied having eyedisease, they commonly used 14ethnic diagnostic terms forocular problems, five ofwhich relate specifically tothe stages oftrachoma. This proliferation ofmetaphor anddescription for vision itis adeep Asdescribed inthehierarchy section, power relations within thefamily andclass differences between thefellahnand their biomedical practitioners profoundly influence access totherapy. Despite theophthalmologic findings that women andchildren have the most trachoma-related ocular problems, they receive proportionately less biomedical treatment than the men intheir families. The status associated with age and gender was found tohave more influence on choice ofand access topractitioners for ocular therapy than socioeconomic status, education, orbelief inthebiomedical explanatory model ofdisease. Although there isofficially socialized medical care inEgypt, thefellah.In receive such poor treatment from the government physicians that they overwhelmingly seek care from private physicians. 199This private biomedical therapy issocostly that thevillagers reserve itsaccess tothehighest members fellah.In have anelaborate ofethno-ophthalmology that islargely directed towards the ofinfectious Many of thetraditional remedies contain astringent, anti-inflammatory, and that Never theless, itisimportant not and ocular pharmacopoeia ishighly irritating and some ofthe more invasive techniques ofthe midwife and health barber could result inocular injury andblindness themselves. Ihave shown that culture, through the behavior andbelief ofits members, influences trachoma transmission. Daily facewashing of children with soap, which was done inone third ofthe households, appears tohave protected those children from intense infection. Regular facewashing throughout the childrens' lives might also protect them from theblinding sequale ofsevere trachoma. The purpose ofthis study was interaction of behavior, belief, and trachoma, inpart toprovide information for primary care eye programs. Clearly, thevillagers have very definite ideas about ocular health andillness. Nurses, physicians, and other health care workers must appreciate this ethnomedical system ifthey are tosuccessfully communicate with thefellahin. Iamnotsuggesting that they must treatments, since have thepotential ofeyeinjury, butthat they must learn theethno ophthalmologic concepts and terms. Most importantly, the barriers to access due tothe enormous class differences between fellah Inpatients 200and their health care providers must beaddressed. These barriers of prejudice andinsensitivity are thegreatest obstacle toeffective health care. Inaddition toimproved access tohealth care, face washing with soap and latrine ownership should form the basis of aprimary eye care inter vention strategy. Asmentioned, thecost oflatrines might make them prohibitively expensive for large scale programs. Nevertheless, their use would offer protection from anumber ofother diseases, which would increase their cost effectiveness. Face washing with soap isa relatively simple behavior toincorporate into anintervention strategy. Health education about face washing should beintroduced through the traditional healers, inthe primary school, and over thetelevision, in order tomost efficiently reach the women andchildren. Such health education must belinked tothebuilding of aclean water source inthe hamlet. Thefellah Incomplain bitterly about their lack ofclean water. Any primary health care strategy that does not address the issue of clean water will not gain their trust. Inconclusion, Ihave presented the lives ofthefellah inof Gamileya through alens oftrachoma, and more Mahassin, Ramadan andall of the others often.

It includes measures ofwomen's economic contribution (i.e. the products of water buffalo, cattle, and sewing) and measures ofwealth that are culture specific (polygamy andHajj). Since themeasures ofpolygamy andHajj only apply toMuslims, thescores were calculated with and without these measures. It was clear that these measures were indicators ofwealth andstatus, sothefinal score included them for all Muslim families. Thescale does notinclude latrine and plumbing in the measurements sothat these may beassessed separately. Water source isalso not included because every family inthe hamlet must get their wash water from the canal and their drinking water from apublic tap at 4km. distance inaneighboring donkey). ormore can read and write 2=more orone person more than one time 11and higher 22.5* - * g - - - - * - - - - \u00ba ***- - -- - - - - - - -- - -\" - - - . . ; - - - . . . - - - * -a- - - . . \u00ba - - - - :- - -- * -- - - - -* - - \u00ba - - - = - - - * - - - - - - --- - - - - - - - - * - -. - \u00ba - - - *- - - - - - \u00ba - - - - *. - * -- - - - - - -- - - .. . - - - - * - * -- - - ,--- - - - - \u00ba ... - - - - - \u00ba - - - -- * - - --- \u00bar - - \u00ba - - * - - * - - - - - --- - - - - - - -- - - \u00ba - - - - \u00ba - - - - *-- - - \". -- - - * - - - - - - - - - - : - ** - ... .. -- *. .. - a --- - - - . - - - *- - - * * * \u00ba -- -- - - * - - - \u00ba !- - \u00ba - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - * \u00ba - - - - -- - - \u00ba - \u00ba -\"- - - -- - \u00ba - * * - - -- \u00ba - - - *- - - - - - - - s - - - * - * *- - - * \u00ba \u00ba - \u00ba -* ~ * -- - - - - \u00ba -- - - : *-* \u00ba - - - - - t - \u00ba - - - - -- - - --- - - - - - -- - :- - - - - - - - * . . - - -:- -- - - - - *--. - - -- - - - - - - - - - *** *** * * : * - - s - - * * * - - ** -- \u00ba - - - - -- - * - - *, * * * * * * * - \u007f* -- - - * * ** - - - *--- - - ---- **- -- ----- - - - - - - - - -. - *- - - -.- - - - * - - - - \u00ba - - - - y - -* = - - - - - - * - \u00ba :- *- * - - - -- - * . -* e : - - *--- \u00ba - - *- : *- *- \u00ba - - - - -- - e -* * ** - * - !- . - ! - - - - - *-- - - - - - - ...--.- * * * - - - - * - ...\" - -- - \u00ba - r * - - - ** * - - - -- ** =* - - - - - - - - w - - - ** - *s - - - - \u007f. - - -- - - * - *- - - -- *. \u00ba *- * - - * - - - - - -- - ~ ,-, *- \u00ba - * - \u007f. - -- - - \u00ba - - - - - - * * - - - s - * : * =** * - - - - - - - * .- - -* - - * - ** * *- : - - - - - - -- a - ** = e i - * * - s \u00ba --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -... . . .- :-. ---- - , \u00ba * =- - - * * * - * * - *. - - *--- - s' - - - ..* -- *** - -- -- -- ** - - - - - - - - - --- * * \"...
