It ensues changes that can lead to acute heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, and sudden death. Myocarditis is caused by several infectious and non-infectious agents. Vaccines are also known to cause myocarditis. The use of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination was started to combat the severity of the COVID-19 infection and reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with it. The vaccination, however, caused side effects like myocarditis, among others. In order to investigate the association between the COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis in adults and adolescents, we conducted a literature review by searching three databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. From the published literature, we found that, though it is rare, the various vaccinations available can cause symptoms of myocarditis as a side effect more commonly in patients who have received both doses of a particular vaccine and that there are significant changes in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and other biochemical markers, with young males being more commonly affected. Further prospective trial-based studies are required to establish a concrete relationship between myocarditis and the COVID-19 vaccine.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-11-29", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
