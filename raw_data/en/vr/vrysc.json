Recently, however, the traditional plant-based brew\u2014made by combining a rare rainforest-grown vine and shrub that produce vivid hallucinations and disorientation, and often enhanced with other plants known for their psychotropic effects\u2014has become a so-called \"it\" drug for Westerners seeking relief from countless afflictions, from trauma, depression, and addiction to arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Formal studies of ayahuasca as a treatment for these conditions is in the early stages, and its surging popularity as a newfound \"miracle medicine\" troubles [Taylor Dysart](https://clals.sas.upenn.edu/people/taylor-dysart), a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of History and Sociology of Science. \"The speed at which the clinical sciences move, especially in conjunction with business ventures, can be alarming,\" says Dysart, whose dissertation traces the Latin American history of ayahuasca, particularly since the mid-19th century. \"In the history of medicine, we spend a lot of time unpacking this idea of a 'magic bullet'\u2014as if there's a panacea, a quick fix for all types of ailments, whether they're social or physiological or psychological or emotional. Hearing talk of ayahuasca in this way makes me nervous because of the potential for the kinds of fallout we are already seeing.\" That includes the overharvesting of ayahuasca around tourist sites throughout Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Ecuador; the ayahuasca vine, Banisteriopsis caapi, thrives only in the thick of the jungle and takes four years to grow, so natural reserves are limited. The poaching of jaguars, a critically endangered species, has also increased, as \"charlatan shamans\" disingenuously claim that jewelry and other trinkets made from jaguar body parts enhance the ayahuasca ceremony experience. And the foreign ownership of many tourism lodges often prevents economic benefits from reaching local communities and spurs rising ayahuasca costs that can restrict natives' access to their own healing traditions. Supported by a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation and a Dissertation Fieldwork Grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation, Dysart is currently conducting fieldwork in Brazil and will continue next in Colombia and then Peru, interviewing and exploring the research archives of dozens of scientists including naturalists, botanists, geographers, ethnographers, folklorists, psychiatrists, cultural and medical anthropologists, and neuroscientists.
