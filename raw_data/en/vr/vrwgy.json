According to Ayurveda, Agni, Ojas (the end essence of total digestion which creates good health), and Ama (toxins) play an essential role in strengthening immunity. When digestion or Agni is robust, the food we eat is converted to abundant vitality & wholesome tissues, and the body efficiently burns off the impurities leading to Ojas, which in turn contributes to a healthy immune system. Whereas if Agni is weak, leading to improper digestion, the formation of Ama (or toxins) ensues, which causes many health complications.
