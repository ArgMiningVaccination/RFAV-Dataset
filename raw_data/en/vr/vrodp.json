A clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine has an [efficacy rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html) of [more than 90 percent](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-clinical-and-supply-updates-covid-19-vaccine) in preventing Covid-19. A Piece of the Coronavirus The SARS-CoV-2 virus is [studded with proteins](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-unveiled.html) that it uses to enter human cells. These so-called spike proteins make a tempting target for potential [vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html) and [treatments](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html). Spikes Spike protein gene Spikes Spike protein gene CORONAVIRUS Like the [Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html), Moderna's vaccine is based on virus's [genetic instructions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html) for building the spike protein. mRNA Inside an Oily Shell The vaccine uses messenger RNA, genetic material that our cells read to make proteins. The molecule \u2014 called mRNA for short \u2014 is fragile and would be chopped to pieces by our natural enzymes if it were injected directly into the body. To protect the vaccine, Moderna wraps the mRNA in oily bubbles made of lipid nanoparticles. Lipid nanoparticles surrounding mRNA Lipid nanoparticles surrounding mRNA Because of their fragility, the mRNA molecules will quickly fall apart at room temperature. Moderna's vaccine will need to be refrigerated, and should be stable for [up to six months](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-longer-shelf-life-its-covid-19-vaccine) when shipped and stored at -4\u00b0F (-20\u00b0C). Entering a Cell After injection, the vaccine particles bump into cells and fuse to them, releasing mRNA. The cell's molecules read its sequence and build spike proteins. The mRNA from the vaccine is eventually destroyed by the cell, leaving no permanent trace.

The vaccinated cells also break up some of the proteins into fragments, which they present on their surface. These protruding spikes and spike protein fragments can then be recognized by the immune system. Spotting the Intruder When a vaccinated cell dies, the debris will contain many spike proteins and protein fragments, which can then be taken up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell. Debris from a dead cell ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Engulfing a spike Digesting proteins Presenting a spike protein fragment HELPER T CELL Debris from a dead cell ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Engulfing a spike Digesting the proteins Presenting a spike protein fragment HELPER T CELL Debris from a dead cell Engulfing a spike ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL Digesting the proteins Presenting a spike protein fragment HELPER T CELL The cell presents fragments of the spike protein on its surface. When other cells called helper T cells detect these fragments, the helper T cells can raise the alarm and help marshal other immune cells to fight the infection. Making Antibodies Other immune cells, called B cells, may bump into the coronavirus spikes on the surface of vaccinated cells, or free-floating spike protein fragments. A few of the B cells may be able to lock onto the spike proteins. If these B cells are then activated by helper T cells, they will start to proliferate and pour out antibodies that target the spike protein.

But because the vaccine is so new, researchers don't know how long its protection might last. First dose 0.5ml Second dose 28 days later First dose Second dose 28 days later First dose Second dose 28 days later It's possible that in the months after vaccination, the number of antibodies and killer T cells will drop. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B cells and memory T cells that might retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades. An early study found that Moderna's vaccine provides protection [for at least three months](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/03/world/covid-19-coronavirus#modernas-vaccine-provides-protection-against-covid-19-for-at-least-three-months-a-study-finds). For more about the vaccine, see [Moderna's Covid Vaccine: What You Need to Know](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/moderna-covid-19-vaccine). Preparation and Injection Each vial of the vaccine contains 10 doses of 0.5 milliliters. The vials need to be warmed to room temperature before injection. No dilution with saline is required. Vaccine Timeline January, 2020 Moderna begins work on a [coronavirus vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/moderna-covid-19-vaccine). March 16 Moderna scientists are the first to put a [Covid-19 vaccine into human trials](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html). April 16 Moderna announces that the United States government will provide $483 million in support for the design and testing of Moderna's vaccine. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health will oversee much of the research, including the clinical trials. July 27 After initial studies yield [promising results](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483), Moderna and the N.I.H. begin Phase 3 testing on 30,000 volunteers across the United States. A quarter of the participants are 65 years or older. July 28 Moderna finds that the vaccine [protects monkeys](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html) from the coronavirus. Aug. 11 The United States government [awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005852/en/Moderna-Announces-Supply-Agreement-U.S.-Government-Initial) the company an additional $1.5 billion in exchange for 100 million doses, if the vaccine is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Nov. 16 Moderna [announces](https://nyti.ms/2Uy7YmA) preliminary data from its Phase 3 trial. Researchers estimate that the vaccine has an [efficacy rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html) of 94.1 percent, far higher than experts had expected when vaccine testing began. Nov. 30 Moderna [applies for emergency use authorization](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/health/covid-vaccine-moderna.html) from the F.D.A. Dec. 2 Moderna registers [a trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04649151) to test the vaccine on children between 12 and 18 years of age. Dec. 18 The F.D.A. [authorizes the Moderna vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/health/covid-vaccine-fda-moderna.html) for emergency use. The first injections of its vaccine could start on Dec. 21. Dec. 23 Canada [authorizes](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2020/12/health-canada-authorizes-moderna-covid-19-vaccine.html) the vaccine. Dec. 31 The company expects to produce 20 million doses by the end of this year, and up to a billion doses in 2021. Each vaccinated person will require two doses. Jan. 4, 2021 Israel [authorizes](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/israeli-ministry-health-authorizes-covid-19-vaccine-moderna-use) the vaccine for emergency use. Feb. 25 Moderna [announces](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial) they are working to produce between 600 million and a billion doses in 2021, and making investments to expand capacity up to 1.4 billion doses in 2022. March Moderna begins a [Phase 1 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04785144?term=covid-19+vaccine&draw=2&rank=95) of a vaccine made specifically for the [B.1.351 variant](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html#B1351) and a [Phase 1 trial](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/first-participants-dosed-phase-1-study-evaluating-mrna-1283) of a new, refrigerator-stable vaccine. April 20 Some vaccinated people are [professing loyalty](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/style/pfizer-or-moderna.html) to the brand they happened to have received. April 25 Nearly 8 percent of Americans who got initial Pfizer or Moderna shots have [missed their second doses](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/business/covid-vaccines-second-doses.html). April 29 Moderna [announces](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-additional-investments-increase-global-supply) they will produce 800 million to 1 billion doses in 2021, and plan to manufacture 3 billion doses in 2022.
