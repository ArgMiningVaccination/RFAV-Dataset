Executive Summary Mercy Hospital Jefferson (MHJ) is a 203-bed hospital located in Festus, Missouri. It is a rural, Catholic hospital and serves as the only hospital in Jefferson County. It is one of four hospitals in Mercy's East Community. MHJ provides 24-hour emergency room care and a full range of diagnostic, preventive and restorative health care services. Additionally, MHJ operates Mercy Clinic physician offices, outpatient hospital services and Urgent Care Centers throughout the county in the cities of Festus, Imperial, Arnold and more. Due to the shortage of health care providers in many areas, including Jefferson County, science and technology are rapidly changing how health care is being delivered today. Mercy's Virtual Care Center that opened in St. Louis in 2015 employs cutting-edge technology that allows health care providers to \"visit\" patients via computer screens and devices when they cannot meet face-to-face. This has the potential to be extremely advantageous to patients in rural communities, such as those in Jefferson County. Throughout this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) report, health indicator data of Jefferson County is compared to that of Missouri, the United States, and top U.S. performers. Inserted infographics and barometer charts (green needle=positive; red needle=negative) provide easy-to-interpret visual representations of comparisons. Based on the findings of this CHNA, Mercy Hospital Jefferson has chosen to address the following three significant health needs identified in Jefferson County: Access to care Mental health Substance useThese needs will be the basis of MHJ's three-year community health improvement plan (CHIP), which guides the coordination and targeting of resources to promote community health. The process of preparing this Community Health Needs Assessment affirmed that Mercy's vision for advancement of health care matches the needs expressed by our community.

Community Served by the Hospital Description of Community Served Mercy Hospital Jefferson's service area is comprised of the 20 municipalities that make up Jefferson County (15 zip codes). For the purposes of this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), MHJ has identified Jefferson County as its community because 61% of those discharged from the hospital in FY2015 were residents of Jefferson County. MHJ is the only hospital in Jefferson County and serves the surrounding counties of St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve and Washington. Demographics The majority of residents of Jefferson County are White (96%), age 18-44 years (34%), have some college credit or an associate's degree and a household income of $50,000 a year or less. The unemployment rate is at 6%. These values are consistent with both state and national data (Sg2 Market Demographics, Nielsen zip code data - 2015, Appendix A). Mercy Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 6 Insurance status According to Insurance Coverage Estimates for 2015 reported by Sg2, the percentage of those covered by health insurance in Jefferson County is higher than state and national data. Like many other communities, Jefferson County is projecting a significant increase (21%) in their 65+ population over the next five years, which will increase the number of those receiving Medicare. Mercy Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 7 Description of Services Available to Community Served Access to Care Jefferson County has 10.3 beds per 10,000 population (203 total beds and a population of 196,580). In addition to Mercy Hospital Jefferson and its outpatient services, Jefferson County is home to the following health care providers: Jefferson County Health Department - public health services Community Treatment Inc. (COMTREA) - Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with primary, specialty and mental health services A map of additional health care providers in Jefferson County and surrounding counties can be found in Appendix B. Jefferson County was declared a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2015. Jefferson County has far less providers per capita than the state of Missouri, as well as the national average. This shortage encompasses primary care, dental/oral care, and mental health services (County Health Rankings - 2014, Appendix C).

Community Health Needs Assessment Process The Jefferson County Health Department (JCHD) serves as the primary community partner for Mercy Hospital Jefferson in both the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) processes. JCHD utilizes the Mobilizing Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) model, bringing agencies across Jefferson County together in a collaborative process. MHJ is currently engaged in the MAPP process through the Jefferson County Community Health Network (See Appendix D to access MAPP assessments). A Community Health Council, led by Eric Ammons, President of Mercy Hospital Jefferson, guided the needs assessment process (Appendix E). The council convenes quarterly and is accountable for ensuring that community benefit activities meet mission compliance and IRS guidelines. It consists of Mercy leaders from various departments, such as behavioral health, finance, care management, philanthropy, etc., and a hospital board member. The Council determines which health initiatives will be put forth in the hospital's three-year Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). Co-workers in Mercy's Community Health & Access Department served on the Council and were the primary leads of the 2016 CHNA. A Saint Louis University Master of Health Administration student provided support by collecting and reviewing data from various sources. These included: surveys, focus groups, published data, and hospital specific data. External sources of published data are as follows: \u00a7 Jefferson County Health Department Annual Summary Report - 2014 This report, compiled by the Jefferson County Health Department, provides county-wide data on healthy behaviors and chronic conditions that result in the leading causes of disease and death in Jefferson County. http://www.jeffcohealth.org/images/stories/AdminServices/2014%20JCHD%20ANNUAL%20REPORT.pdf \u00a7 Jefferson Memorial Community Foundation - 2014 Report The Jefferson Memorial Community Foundation in conjunction with the Mission Center L3C - an organization that provides evaluation, research and capacity-building services to the nonprofit and social impact community - conducted a communitywide assessment of unmet needs in Jefferson County from August 2014 to January 2015. http://jmcfmo.org/media/Needs_Assessment.pdf \u00a7 County Health Rankings 2016 This resource provides county-level data that is updated annually by the University of Wisconsin-Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. www.countyhealthrankings.org Mercy Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 9 \u00a7 Community Data Profiles & Missouri Information for Community Assessment (MICA) This resource, provided by Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services-Bureau of Health Information, includes some of the most comprehensive community health assessment planning tools available, such as community data profiles on 115 Missouri counties, thirty health indicators, and the capability to create customized tables. http://health.mo.gov/data/CommunityDataProfiles/index.html Community Commons This resource provides thousands of meaningful data layers to allow mapping and reporting capabilities for exploring community health to foster positive change.

Community Input The voices of the people of Jefferson County were central to the health needs assessment process. MHJ gathered community input through: a. Surveys - online and printed (for those with no computer access) b. Mercy Community Advisory Panels c. Community Coalitions and Stakeholder Meetings Surveys A Mercy Community Health Qualtrics (a top data collection software application) survey (available in both hard-copy and on-line format) was designed to assess the perceptions and thoughts of community members about the health needs of their community (Appendix F). A total of 84 individuals completed the survey over a 15-month time frame (from the fall of 2014 to the end of 2015). A significant effort was made to bring hard-copy surveys to local food pantries in order to include the voices of populations less likely to access the survey via the internet. A total of 39 survey responses were received as a result of direct distribution in areas with high populations of underserved, low-income individuals. In collaboration with MHJ, a community health survey was created by Victory Health Ministry, the health and wellness arm of Victory Church (Appendix G). The survey was distributed to the church's parishioners, and a total of 154 responses were collected and reviewed. Mercy Community Advisory Panels Online community advisory panels are a key part of Mercy's ongoing dialogue with the community. Individuals are routinely surveyed to assess need, evaluate programming/service ideas, and provide feedback. Members are continuously added to the advisory panel as they sign up for MyMercy, a service that allows community members to connect with their Mercy care team and health information online at their convenience. Recent survey topics included senior services, walk-in/urgent care, and pediatric service needs. Community Coalitions and Stakeholder Meetings Mercy Neighborhood Ministry (MNM) is a department of Mercy also known as the Community Health & Access Department. It is dedicated to improving health and access in the communities Mercy serves, with a particular focus on the underserved population. A MNM Community Outreach Coordinator, designated to the MHJ community, focuses on identifying unmet needs and gaps in services, making connections and referrals, developing partnerships, improving community health, and advocating for the most vulnerable. Mercy Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 11 Through active involvement with community groups, Mercy builds relationships with key community agencies, partnering to develop innovative solutions to address community health needs and issues associated with poverty. Partnering agencies and task forces in which the Outreach Coordinator is involved include: Jefferson County Community Health Network Methamphetamine Action Coalition Smoke Free Jefferson County Mercy Neighborhood Ministry also manages: An emergency assistance fund that provides monetary aid towards basic needs, such as rent and utility fees, for individuals in crisis who are working with a case worker Resource lists on the Mercy website that contain health and social services available in Jefferson County and nearby A listserve consisting of 1,035 members who receive weekly communications announcing community events and services, including job fairs, support groups, health and social service events, and health equity and cultural competence workshops Through continuous daily networking and collaboration, Mercy remains closely engaged with community partners and informed on the needs of the communities it serves.

Prioritized Significant Community Health Needs The nominal group technique was used in the priority setting process. The Mercy Hospital Jefferson Community Health Council was presented with the quantitative and qualitative community health data and members were asked to rank these health issues by level of concern and ability to collaborate on the issue to produce results. The strengths and services of MHJ along with the strategic plan were also considered. The averages of the rankings are included in the table below. Upon review and discussion of the Primary and Secondary data gathered, the hospital's Strategic Plan, and the resources available at the hospital and in the community, the following priorities were selected: 1. Mental Health 2. Substance Use 3. Access to Care Next, the Community Health Council will create the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) for MHJ, identifying specific initiatives related to improving each of these health priorities. The council will set realistic, measureable, and attainable goals that will align with the mission and strategy of the organization. Community Health Issue Level of Concern (Rankings Average) 1=Low, 5=High Potential to Collaborate to Produce Results (Rankings Average) 1=Low, 5= High Substance Abuse (i.e. Meth, Alcohol, Opiates) 4.88 4.25 Mental Health (Depression, Suicide) 4.63 4.67 Violence: Domestic/Family/Child Abuse 4.50 4.25 Access to Care: Services 4.25 3.88 Transportation 4.13 4.63 Dental/Oral Health 4.00 3.50 Tobacco Use 3.75 Coverage 3.75 3.63 Obesity/Poor Nutrition/Physical Inactivity 3.63 4.25 Accidents/Unintentional Injuries 2.50 3.00 Mercy Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 32 VII. Potentially Available Resources Collaboration with other community health and social service providers is key to improving the health of those residing in the MHJ community. Mercy's Community Health & Access Department, known as Mercy Neighborhood Ministry, partners with over 100 community health and social service agencies, and maintains over 40 resource lists that focus on connecting the economically underserved with health and social service resources. These resource lists assist both Mercy staff and partner agencies when referring clients and patients to additional help. All resource lists can be accessed at www.mercy.net/mnm or in print, upon request. Mercy's resource lists can be used in partnership with United Way 2-1-1's resource database to help address significant health care needs. United Way 2-1-1 is a nation-wide organization that connects people to a variety of resources - from basic needs to child care to disaster relief to counseling. United Way of Greater St. Louis serves 16 counties in Illinois and Missouri, including all counties that Mercy serves in the East Community. Local agencies and individuals can learn about and access area resources by calling 2-1-1 and speaking to a trained resource specialist or by accessing the www.211helps.org web database. In 2015, Mercy formed a partnership with the Alive and Well program, a regional initiative that educates health care providers and the community on how trauma impacts our daily lives. The program began in St. Louis and has now expanded to include surrounding areas, including Franklin County. \"Alive and Well, an initiative of the St. Louis Regional Health Commission, is a community-wide effort focused on reducing the impact of stress and trauma on our health and well-being. The research is clear. Stress and traumatic experiences are making many of us sick and together are a leading cause of poor health outcomes.\" (Appendix L) Mercy also maintains strong partnerships with the Jefferson County Health Department (JCHD) and Community Treatment, Inc. (COMTREA), a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). JCHD leads several initiatives to address public health concerns, while COMTREA provides a full spectrum of mental health services, physical health services, dental care and counseling to the Jefferson County community. Other Vital resources available in Jefferson County include (but are not limited to) the following: Partners Responsible for Increasing Drug Education (P.R.I.D.E) Methamphetamine Action Coalition (MAC) Jefferson Franklin Community Action Corporation (JFCAC) JeffCo Express Mercy Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 33 VIII.

Do you have any other feedback about issues facing your community? Please use the box below to share with us. Text Response transportation is an issue for many clients seeking services. Also, we have a large number of uninsured individuals. We need to have healthcare in our community for those who cannot afford insurance, doctor visits and medications. Not at this time. I am new to the Crystal City area and that is why some of the answers imply a lack of knowledge OB CARE! Help!!! Dental services for adults who don't qualify for medicaid and can't afford or don't have access to coverage is an extreme challenge in my community. Wait times for appointments are months, even in situations of severe pain. So they end up in the emergency room repeatedly trying to manage the pain. Those individuals who are just above qualifying for medicaid but can't afford the government mandated insurance are facing great challenges in obtaining healthcare. A lack of urgent care or odd hours care. A lack of in your face education like posters and billboards with easy to understand messages. Messages you could see and understand in a moments passing. \"SICK? STAY HOME.\" or \"ELBOW YOUR COUGH\" maybe \"YOU SMOKE, YOU STINK\" drug use and how it affects families and children. We need options for activities, things to do close to home. Problems particular to my community include lead dust from local industry. There are buried deposits of hazardous chemicals in various parts of the county as well. Poverty is a common problem. People are underserved because they can not afford care and/or do not transportation to get there. Good library system. Extension Office offerers courses for self improvement and how to help the environment. 20% increase in new people using the food bank over the last 6 months. transportation i think Mercy has really moved the community forward and look forward to much more interation and healthy seminars. Jefferson County remains fairly rural in many areaas. i think transportation is often the challenge for this communittee. No There are no proactive behavioral health or substance abuse programs available for children. The few services available are only for crisis. Comtrea is here physically for clients with mental illness but it seems to be very difficult to qualify for help or to get the help that is needed. issues for families being in the sandwich generation between children and aging parents.

Do you have any other feedback about the community programs in your area? Please use the box below to share with us. Text Response Very limited in community programs in my area. Not at this time. Not familiar w/how these programs operate or are carried out. Meals on Wheels need funding expansion. So many are in need. Having programs for chronic medical conditions does not reach the people if transportation is not included. Many people are aware they should be taking better care of their health, but many ignore the information. So while programs are offered, they aren't accomplishing what they set out to do. Once a month free hot cooked dinner for anyone at the local catholic church -\u00ad-\u00ad last number served was 200. There are not many programs in my community. Even if there are programs in the community, many residents do not have an awareness the programs are available. How does the hospital get the info to these people. Many seniors do not have a computer. No Resources are difficult to find for screening. Advertising is very minimal for resources. Prevenative programs are too limited. Lack of dental care for under insured or uninsured individuals or individuals on Medicaid not applicable Statistic Value Total Responses 12 15. We have just a few questions about you and your family.
