Show 1355: Uncovering the Shocking Dangers of Misdiagnosis When you develop a health problem with symptoms that trouble you, the first step is to find out what it is. Diagnosis may be the most basic task a doctor or other healthcare provider undertakes. That doesn't mean it is easy, though. New research is uncovering the shocking dangers of misdiagnosis. The Dangers of Misdiagnosis Include Death and Disability: How common are diagnostic errors? Estimates suggest that between 5 and 11 percent of diagnoses may be wrong, and sometimes those mistakes hurt patients. Doctors may believe that getting it right 90 percent of the time is a pretty good track record, especially since diagnosis can be anything but straightforward. Patients don't seem to feel the same way if they have experienced a misdiagnosis, and especially if it has harmed them. If you look at the rates of serious diseases and just how frequently they may be misdiagnosed, the results are alarming. A team of investigators calculate that problems with diagnosis may cause serious harm to an estimated 795,000 Americans each year. Their estimates actually range from 598,000 to 1,023,000, and include both deaths and permanent disability (BMJ Quality & Safety, July 17, 2023). The top five most dangerous diseases accounted for a disproportionate amount of the harms, nearly 40 percent. They include stroke, sepsis, pneumonia, venous thromboembolism and lung cancer. Overlooking Symptoms of a Stroke: Our guest, Dr. David Newman-Toker, is a neurologist who has been striving for decades to get his colleagues to recognize the subtler symptoms of a stroke. We read him an email we received from a listener named Ralph. Here is what he wrote: \"Count me among the survivors of a diagnostic mistake if you will, but I call it simple laziness on the part of my former GP. For weeks, I complained of massive headaches, accompanied by nausea and vertigo. My GP had me keep a daily record of my blood pressure for 30 days. (No hurries, right?) \"When I showed him the record, he shrugged and said my blood pressure was normal. He had nothing else to say. Two weeks later, I almost died from a serious stroke. It cost me my career and required eight months of rehab. My cardiologist was livid with my (now former) GP, saying he should have referred me to a specialist.\" Dr. Newman-Toker observes that most people now recognize the most obvious symptoms of stroke, such as one-sided weakness or paralysis and problems with understanding or producing speech as well as sudden vision problems. But difficulties with balance (dizziness), nausea and headache, fainting or double vision may be less well recognized. As Ralph's story shows, severe head pain or persistent dizziness deserves prompt attention. Fighting the Dangers of Misdiagnosis with the Four Ts: Dr. Newman-Toker and his colleagues promote the concept of four Ts to help reduce the burden of diagnostic mistakes. Those are: Teamwork Training Technology Tuning These approaches apply primarily to healthcare providers, but we want to know how patients can be part of the team. How Can Patients Avoid the Dangers of Misdiagnosis? Dr. Newman-Toker has three recommendations: 1. Prepare for your visit. Have a succinct synopsis of your symptoms and the time frame and order in which they appeared. 2. Ask important questions. These will vary with the individual situation. However, two of the most important questions are: What is the worst thing this could be? and Why do you think it is not that? 3. Stay vigilant. If your symptoms do not begin to resolve with treatment, bring this to the provider's attention. Ask the question: Might these symptoms be caused by something else? You will have already asked when to expect test results and how soon symptoms should respond to treatment. Don't assume that if you hear nothing you should keep quiet. The Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine: Dr. Newman-Toker is the current president of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine. This organization is dedicated to reducing the toll of diagnostic mistakes. It counts among its members some of the leading researchers on this topic as well as providers striving to limit the dangers of misdiagnosis. Patients can be members too. You'll find it at https://www.improvediagnosis.org The annual conference on The Future of Diagnosis is October 8-11, 2023. This Week's Guest: David Newman-Toker, MD, is Director of the Division of Neuro-Visual & Vestibular Disorders in the Department of Neurology and Professor of Neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Show 1355: Uncovering the Shocking Dangers of Misdiagnosis Would you be surprised to learn that hypnosis is a powerful tool for healing? If your primary exposure to this practice has been in books and movies, you may have a few misconceptions about how it works and what it can do. Some people imagine that when you are hypnotized, you lose control. Instead, it allows you great control of both your body and your mind. How could hypnosis help your health? The Origins of Hypnosis in Western Medicine: Shamans and other indigenous healers may have used techniques similar to this for healing in many different contexts. Europeans first learned of it from Dr. Franz Mesmer, an 18th century physician and showman who coined the term \"animal magnetism.\" Others would later call it \"mesmerism,\" but it was the first demonstration in medicine of the healing power of hypnosis. Dr. Mesmer may have discovered it somewhat by accident, but he figured out how to put it to use. Hypnosis Could Help Your Health: Our guest, Dr. David Spiegel, is probably the country's leading expert on the medical uses of hypnosis. He relates one of his first experiences as a medical student putting it into practice. A teenage girl was in the hospital with a severe asthma attack, struggling to breathe. He was able to help her relax and slow her breath, which in turn helped her breathe more easily and stop wheezing. There are many other conditions that respond well to this powerful approach. People who are hypnotizable can use this technique to ease anxiety and manage stress. Many individuals use it to help them cope with pain. For still others, it is an important part of a stop-smoking program or a way to overcome insomnia. The Status of Hypnosis as a Medical Tool: This approach has been well studied and found to be effective for many medical problems. However, the medical profession has not fully embraced it. Psychiatrists like Dr. Spiegel are more likely to be familiar with the practice than some other specialists. Are You Hypnotizable? Hypnosis can help your health only if you are hypnotizable. Luckily, most people are, at least to some degree. Hypnotizability does not depend upon an ability to visualize. Nor is it linked to intelligence. Dr. Spiegel and his colleagues have created an app (Reveri) to allow people to test their own hypnotizability and to put their aptitude for this technique into practice improving their health. How Can You Find an Expert? If you have a complicated health problem and would like to try hypnosis to manage it, you may wish to start with personal attention from a health professional. For less complex situations, the app itself may be enough. To find a person who has been trained in using hypnosis to help your health, check with one of the two professional associations that certify such specialists. They are the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis and the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis. This Week's Guest: Dr. David Spiegel is Willson Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Director of the Center on Stress and Health, and Medical Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Spiegel has more than 40 years of clinical and research experience studying psycho-oncology, stress and health, pain control, sleep, hypnosis, utilizing neuroimaging and conducting randomized clinical trials. He has published thirteen books, 425 scientific journal articles, and 175 book chapters on hypnosis, psychosocial oncology, stress physiology, trauma, and psychotherapy. He is Past-President of the American College of Psychiatrists, the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, and is a member of the National Academy of Medicine.

Show 1353: Cutting Edge Cardiology from a Top Heart Doctor When you think of preventing heart disease, what comes to mind? We hope you envision regular exercise and a healthful diet (whatever that means to you). Perhaps you also plan for regular checkups and know what your cholesterol levels are. If they have been high, you may be taking a statin cholesterol-lowering drug to get them down. What else does cutting edge cardiology have to offer? Cutting Edge Cardiology or simvastatin (Zocor) are quite effective at lowering cholesterol. However, not everyone is able to benefit from a statin. Some people find that they cause side effects that may be intolerable. Others need more cholesterol-lowering power than a statin can provide. Our guest today, Dr. Steve Nissen, describes the advantages of a relatively new drug called bempedoic acid (Nexletol). Is Nexletol the Next Thing for Lowering Cholesterol? The FDA approved Nexletol in 2020, and doctors have been wondering how best to use it. Initially, they were encouraged to add a prescription for Nexletol if a patient did not get enough response from a statin alone. Dr. Nissen and his colleagues conducted a world-wide study of nearly 14,000 people at high risk for cardiovascular events like heart attacks (JAMA, July 11, 2023). These were people who found statins challenging, so Nexletol was the only cholesterol-lowering therapy they used during 40 months of the trial. More than 4,000 volunteers didn't have heart disease at the start of the study. For them, Nexletol significantly reduced the chance of cardiovascular complications compared to placebo. According to the researchers, 43 people would need to take Nexletol for that time so that one person could avoid a serious outcome. This is what we call the \"Number Needed to Treat,\" or NNT. Other Drugs Used in Cutting Edge Cardiology: Dr. Nissen's big study demonstrates that bempedoic acid has important health consequences as well as lowering cholesterol. We also asked him about other lipid-lowering medications known as PCSK-9 inhibitors. He reviewed the benefits and risks of evolocumab (Repatha) and inclisiran differently from both statins and bempedoic acid to lower cholesterol, especially LDL cholesterol. They are especially helpful for people with familial hyperlipidemia, a genetic condition in which cholesterol soars. As it does, it raises the risk of heart disease. For such people, cardiologists try to get LDL down to 55 mg/dL or so. Have You Had Your Lp(a) Tested? Another genetic factor making its way into cutting edge cardiology is lipoprotein a, also called Lp(a) [ell-pee-little a]. Although doctors have known about this blood particle for decades, they have not given it much attention. Diets that are usually recommended for heart health don't seem to change Lp(a) levels much, and neither does exercise. Cardiologists have not had any prescription medicines to offer, either. They do work hard to help these people lower all their other cardiac risk factors and minimize their chances of a heart attack otherwise. Now that is about to change. Dr. Nissen has been overseeing a clinical trial of a drug, pelacarsen, that may be able to reduce the levels of this sticky substance that can clog arteries and cause blood clots. If the medication makes a real difference, the FDA could well approve it and cardiologists will begin to use it. Patients who could benefit most are those with a strong family history of early heart attacks as well as elevated levels of Lp(a). We will be interested to learn how much the medication is able to reduce rates of heart attack and death compared to placebo. One other topic in our discussion of cutting edge cardiology involves a drug that is more than a hundred years old! Cardiologists do not recommend aspirin for people who have never had a heart attack. But it can be quite helpful for those who do have heart disease. Moreover, aspirin can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems among people with elevated Lp(a) (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Oct. 2022). This Week's Guest: Steven Nissen, MD, MACC, is Chief Academic Officer of the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Nissen holds the Lewis and Patricia Dickey Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at the Lerner School of Medicine.

Show 1353: Cutting Edge Cardiology from a Top Heart Doctor Show 1352: Home Tests, Tech and Tools to Improve Your Health Only a few decades ago, most households had very limited ways of measuring their members' health. There were thermometers to tell if someone had a fever. A bathroom scale could tell if you were losing or gaining weight. For quite a while, if you wanted to know about your blood sugar or your blood pressure, you had to go to the doctor's office. Now, most people can measure those themselves. Home tests, tech and tools can help you monitor your health. Home Tests, Tech and Tools to Improve Your Health: Today, there are dozens of devices. People can monitor their physical activity with a device they wear on their wrist like a watch. In fact, a device very much like a watch can monitor your heartbeat and alert you if it becomes irregular. Some listeners have learned they had atrial fibrillation through such a device. That allowed them to contact the doctor so it could be addressed. Individuals with diabetes no longer have to stick their fingers with a lancet and feed the spot of blood on a little strip of special paper through a reader. (Some still do that, and even that is far more convenient than having blood sugar measured only at the clinic. It's also much more accurate that the urine tests that people with diabetes had to use back in the 20th century.) Now, blood sugar can be monitored continuously with a device about the size of a half-dollar. You attach it to your body for two weeks at a time, and any time you want to know your blood sugar, you wave your smart phone near it. As a result, you'll be able to see how exercise affects your blood sugar. In addition, you can track which foods send it soaring and whether folding them into an entire meal makes any difference. Blood Pressure Monitors at Home: Of all the home tests, tech and tools you could use, blood pressure monitors might be among the most common. Many doctors encourage their patients to track their blood pressure at home. Others don't, in the belief that this activity can make some individuals with hypertension anxious. (Of course, anxiety can make blood pressure rise as well, putting these folks into a vicious cycle.) Do you have a home blood pressure monitor? How often do you use it, and do you share the readings with your primary care provider? On this live show, you are the star. Call in your story about your favorite home health tech to 919-962-3366 between 7 and 8 am EDT on August 19, 2023. The People's Pharmacy Pediatrician Shares His Home Tech and Tools: We asked pediatrician and frequent guest on The People's Pharmacy Dr. Alan Greene about the home tests, tech and tools he likes. Dr. Greene is enthusiastic about the Oura ring he has been wearing for seven years. It tracks his sleep and physical activity. Moreover, it also monitors \"readiness,\" as a way of assessing cardiovascular health. Its measure of oxygen saturation can alert a wearer to sleep apnea, and changes in heart rate variability are among the first signs of a viral infection such as COVID. The pandemic also introduced a lot of us to the value of an inexpensive home oximeter that fits on the finger to measure oxygen. Home Tests That You May Like: Dr. Greene also discussed the value of home tests. Here again, many people have begun using home tests for COVID-19 as a result of the pandemic. A home strep test is now available and quite helpful for parents. (Other people may also find it useful.) One of Dr. Greene's favorite apps is called TrendWeight, because it gives you the long view instead of focusing on short-term fluctuations. Please feel free to email your stories and questions ahead of time to radio@peoplespharmacy.com. Or call us at 919-962-3366 between 7 and 8 am EDT on 8/19/23. What home tests have you found most helpful? This Week's Guest: Alan Greene, MD, is a pediatrician in private practice, committed to giving extraordinary care to his patients. In 1995, he launched DrGreene.com, cited by the AMA as \"the pioneer physician Website.\" In 2022 he launched DrGreene.ai which provides answers to health questions for over half the world's population in their native language. Dr. Greene is the founder of La Conexi\u00f3n and the founding president of the Society for Participatory Medicine. He is the author of Feeding Baby Green, Raising Baby Green, and From First Kicks to First Steps. He published his first children's book, Flower Moon, in 2023.

Show 1352: Home Tests, Tech and Tools to Improve Your Health Show 1351: Are You Risking Your Life Trusting Mail Order Medicines? Have you ever taken a package out of your mailbox on a hot day and noticed that it was warm to the touch? If the pouch contained a tee shirt or a pair of sneakers, you probably didn't think much more of it. But millions of people get their medications by mail, and some medicines are not supposed to get warm. Do life-saving medicines lose potency during shipping? Does It Matter If Medicines Lose Potency During Shipping? Our guest, Loretta Boesing, is a mother with a young son who needed a liver transplant to save his life when he was two years old. Immediately, he required injections of medication twice daily to keep his body from rejecting the transplanted liver. Loretta has been very conscientious about this. But when her insurance required her to get the medicine by mail order, it arrived on a hot day (102 F) and was warm or possibly hot to the touch. Within two weeks, her son was suffering the effects of rejection because the medicine was no longer doing its job. In the hospital, the same compound was able to reverse the setback, because the hospital's injection had not been subjected to intense heat. Problems with Mail Order Pharmacy: Like many Americans, Loretta was pressured to get her son's medicine through the mail. Unlike most, she was sufficiently motivated to fight that pressure. After all, her son's life depends on the medication, and she had discovered the possibility that mail order medicines lose potency when they get too warm. (Extreme cold can also compromise medication effectiveness, but we are more likely to think of that in the winter months rather than in the summer.) Loretta found that she had to enlist the media so that her insurance would allow her to pick the medicine up at the pharmacy. What Loretta Learned: Millions of people may be taking medications that have not been held within the temperature range that the FDA specifies. It is very difficult for a patient to determine whether these medicines lose potency in transit. However, pharmacy students in Oklahoma conducted a study in collaboration with Loretta's group. They mailed out packages to 100 members of the group. Each one contained a data logger and temperature sensor that would tell them if the inside of the package had exceeded the limits for a common medication. Sadly, 80% of the packages did. This trial suggests that ordinary shipping methods may be inappropriate for delicate drugs such as, for example, monoclonal antibodies. Mail order pharmacies could include these inexpensive temperature monitors in their packages, and some may. We once ordered probiotics for a pet. The supplier shipped them in an insulated container with a temperature strip. (We were relieved to see the probiotics had not gotten too warm.) Such devices register when a temperature has exceeded a specified maximum. Manufacturers often include them in shipments of vaccines or frozen foods. But too often, medicines are not treated with the same care you might use in shipping chocolates in hot weather. (That's despite the fact the outcome for your health is far more serious!) Loretta was appalled to learn that often wholesalers ship to pharmacies in the same vehicles used for general package delivery. Try Independent Pharmacies: One tip for other patients: Loretta found that many independent pharmacies will deliver prescriptions in temperature-controlled vehicles (possibly a private car with air conditioning). This is an option worth exploring even if it costs a bit more. We have heard from a very organized reader who logged the temperatures in his Arizona mailbox for more than a month. That experiment convinced him to switch from mail order delivery of his medications to picking them up at the pharmacy and taking them straight home. Like Loretta, he found \"Neither the drug companies nor the FDA seemed to provide helpful information when I asked them about this problem.\" Who Is in Charge? Loretta contacted the FDA, thinking that the organization that sets temperature guidelines would be involved in enforcing them. The Food and Drug Administration told her it is not responsible. The mail order pharmacies say they can't control the shipping companies. Of course, the shipping companies say it's not their problem if customers choose their services for shipping. Ultimately, she contacted the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, but got very little traction there, either. As a result, she has been addressing individual state Boards of Pharmacy. The Oklahoma Board of Pharmacy has recently issued new regulations that should make medicines shipped in that state safer for patient. She and her organization are approaching Boards of Pharmacy in other states to educate them that life-saving drugs lose potency when exposed to extreme conditions en route. Perhaps if consumers apply enough pressure, the professional organizations will respond. Loretta suggests that some pharmacists suffer moral injury because they are dispensing drugs that they know may not be as effective as they ought to be. The patients receiving those drugs may suffer even more when life-saving medications begin to fail. This Week's Guest: Loretta Boesing founded Unite for Safe Medications after a series of events led to Loretta's son being unable to access his medications safely. She is an expert on the unregulated temperature extremes in mail order pharmacy. www.uniteforsafemeds.com The phone number for Unite for Safe Medications is 877-474-9777 Loretta Boesing, founder of Unite for Safe Medications Listen to the Podcast: The podcast of this program will be available Monday, August 14, 2023, after broadcast on August 12.

Show 1350: Why Psychotherapy Matters: Lessons from a Harvard Zen Master and Psychiatrist If you tell your healthcare provider that you're feeling anxious or depressed, chances are they will prescribe you a medication. Millions of people take anti-anxiety pills or antidepressants, and many find that the medicine makes life more bearable. But can you understand what makes your life meaningful? For that, you might need to tell your story to a compassionate listener who can reflect it back to you and help you make sense of it. That's why psychotherapy matters. Talking with Dr. Robert Waldinger About Why Psychotherapy Matters: A few months ago, we spoke with Dr. Robert Waldinger about his book, The Good Life. In it he described a long-running study about the factors that contribute to happiness and a meaningful life. For more than eight decades, Harvard researchers have studied two groups of people as they proceed through life: Harvard undergraduates and kids from struggling families in the Boston area. The scientists wanted to learn what helps people thrive, and they found that relationships are key. We were so intrigued by Dr. Waldinger's background as a Zen master, meditation expert and psychiatrist that we wanted to know more about how the study affected him and how he uses psychodynamic therapy in his practice. In this conversation, we discuss why psychotherapy matters. Psychotherapy Matters, and So Do Medications: In treating people with mental illness, psychiatrists often use some psychoactive medicines, including antipsychotics like Zyprexa or Geodon as well as antidepressants like Paxil or anti-anxiety drugs like Xanax. Insurance companies rarely balk at covering these medications. However, insurance doesn't always cover talk therapy. Why don't they embrace it as enthusiastically as pharmacotherapy? It may take concerted lobbying to get them to acknowledge that psychotherapy matters too. How does psychodynamic therapy, which is what Dr. Waldinger practices, differ from classic psychoanalysis? We find out how he prepares psychiatry residents for this kind of healing. Talk therapy can be used as part of the treatment for serious mental illness as well as to help people with less acute suffering gain some perspective on their situations. We also discuss why the unconscious mind is so powerful. It is what seems to drive us to make similar mistakes in relationships over and over again. When we start to understand what we are doing, we can adopt a different approach that may be more successful. We were intrigued to learn how Dr. Waldinger's experience with Zen has shaped his approach to psychotherapy. Finding a Listener: Telling your story is crucial, and so is a compassionate listener. Dr. Waldinger suggests that finding a person who \"gets\" you is more important than that the therapist have a certain type of credential. In some cases, clergy may be able to fill this role. A nurse practitioner or a social worker may also be skilled in listening and helping a person reframe their own story. Compassion and understanding are why psychotherapy matters. This Week's Guest: Robert Waldinger, MD is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development at Massachusetts General Hospital, and cofounder of the Lifespan Research Foundation. Along with being a practicing psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Dr. Waldinger is also a Zen master (Roshi) and teaches meditation in New England and around the world. Dr. Waldinger, with co-author Marc Schulz, PhD, is the author of The Good Life: Lessons From the World's Longest Scientific Study on Happiness.

This episode is all about solutions to summer skin problems. Sunscreens offer the promise of protection from sunburn, but are they as good as we think they are? Does sunscreen block vitamin D formation? Find out which sunscreen ingredients work best and learn the best ways to use sunscreen and other tactics to minimize sun damage. Just as important, learn what NOT to do. Don't squeeze limes in the sunshine or splash lime juice on your skin! Solutions for Summer Skin Problems: Sunburns are not the only problem you might encounter this summer. Sometimes people develop rashes as if they were allergic to sunlight. Other people develop rashes for a more prosaic reason-they've tangled with poison oak or poison ivy. Do the creams that claim to prevent poison ivy really work? Once the itch has begun, what can you do to ease it? To find solutions for summer skin problems, call in your questions to 919-962-3366 between 7 and 8 am EDT on July 29, 2023. Our dermatologist experts will have answers. Stings and Bites: What should you do if you get stung? If you don't have an allergic reaction to the sting, you're probably focused on easing the pain. What are the best approaches for stings and bites? We'll discuss preventing as well as treating mosquito bites, tick bites, chigger bites and other solutions for summer skin problems. Blisters and Burns: A long hike in the woods can be a lovely way to spend a summer day. But if your feet aren't ready, the resulting blisters can be painful! How should you prepare to avoid blisters? Just as important, how should you treat any blister that develops? Campfires are another summertime delight, but only if you can avoid getting burned. What should you do if you accidentally bump into a burning log or a hot pan? Is first aid different in your home kitchen and at the campsite? More Solutions for Summer Skin Situations: You may have had trouble with heat rash or under-breast irritation. This condition has a fancy medical name, inframammary intertrigo, but solutions are scarce. What works best for preventing this problem? How can you overcome it once it has begun? Another problem, though it is not specific to summertime, is molluscum contagiosum. This potentially itchy infection is most common in children, and it often resolves on its own, provided you are very patient. The FDA has just approved the first medication for these bumps.

The temperature in Rome this week was 107 degrees Fahrenheit. It is anticipated that the islands of Sicily and Sardinia could reach as high as 118. Temperatures were also dangerously high in Athens, leading authorities there to close the Acropolis. Many countries in Europe do not have air conditioning. Sanbao in China broke records at 126 degrees. In the Middle East, the heat index was over 150 degrees, which is not compatible with human life. Death Valley in the United States recorded a near record of 128 degrees. People in Florida can't even cool off by getting into the ocean. Water temperatures there have been close to 100 degrees. Learn how such extreme heat challenges human health. High Heat Challenges Human Health: Last year, a summer heat wave killed more than 60,000 people in Europe. When temperatures rise, what are the dangers? You may also wonder who is most susceptible to the problems of excess heat. To find out, we talked with the interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment. Dr. Kari Nadeau points out that human bodies have difficulty dispersing excess heat when the ambient temperatures get warmer than our usual body temperatures. Who Is Most Vulnerable to Heat Challenges? Dr. Nadeau points out that older individuals, pregnant people and infants as well as those with chronic conditions have particular difficulties responding to high heat. In addition, many people with chronic conditions, especially hypertension, diabetes, asthma and cardiovascular disease, are likely to suffer ill effects from heat challenges. People who live in under-resourced communities are prone to these conditions and may also have difficulties finding a cool place to ride out the heat wave. One approach Dr. Nadeau suggests if you don't have access to air conditioning is to set up a fan and have it blow air on you over a container of ice water. When heat challenges our capacity to cope, the damages show up in stages. The mildest stage of heat stress can make people feel dizzy (heat syncope). They may notice mild swelling in the feet or fingers, and they may experience muscle cramps or a rash. Withdrawing from heat is usually adequate to address these problems. At the next stage, termed heat exhaustion, people start to feel weak and nauseated. They often suffer with headaches and more severe dizziness or faintness. Their bodies may become depleted of salt (and possibly other minerals), and they may experience elevated body temperature and extreme fatigue. These people require cooling, and fast. The most severe stage is heat stroke. As people begin to experience overwhelming heat, the brain starts to fail. In addition to feeling dizzy, people may become confused and stop thinking clearly. As a result, they may not take the necessary steps to get emergency medical treatment. In these heat challenges, cells lining the blood vessels and the gut begin to deteriorate. When sweating stops, core body temperature rises dangerously and heart rhythm changes. This is a medical emergency. What Drugs Interfere with Our Heat Responses? Certain medicines make it harder for our bodies to meet heat challenges. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide are popular drugs used to treat hypertension or heart failure. But because they encourage the body to get rid of excess fluids, people taking these medicines have less ability to cool themselves by sweating. Some drugs that usually make us sweat more (such as the antidepressants bupropion or paroxetine) may make it harder to sweat in response to heat challenges. Most importantly, medications that interfere with the ability to sweat may really cause trouble for people exposed to high temperatures. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl and also the PM in nighttime pain relievers) are notable for this. Some medicines used to treat mental illness also block sweating and become dangerous in heat. We think it makes sense to ask the prescriber and the pharmacist if your medicines could make you more vulnerable to heat.

As a result, your heart beats faster and harder, your hands shake, your pupils dilate and your muscles are mobilized for fast action. This is extremely useful in a crisis. But what if your body goes into crisis mode every day, whether there is a real emergency or not? What happens to the adrenal glands that produce your stress hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline? Could you develop adrenal fatigue? What Is Adrenal Dysfunction? When endocrinologists talk about diseases of the adrenal glands, they are thinking about Addison's disease. In this condition, the immune system attacks the adrenal glands, and they stop producing cortisol and aldosterone. Doctors diagnose the opposite condition, Cushing's syndrome, when the glands churn out too much of these hormones. President Kennedy may be one of the best-known individuals to suffer from Addison's disease. Your body is a system, and all of the glands that make hormones communicate with one another. When you take that into account, it seems less surprising that a person with an autoimmune thyroid condition such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis might also be susceptible to problems with the adrenal glands. Dr. Izabella Wentz says that happens more often than we might imagine. Recognizing Adrenal Fatigue: Dr. Wentz suggests that some of the symptoms signaling that the adrenal glands are having problems might be nonspecific, maybe even common. She suggests that anxiety and brain fog could be tip-offs. Inability to tolerate bright light, unexplained pain, troubles with libido and fatigue even after sleeping all night are other symptoms. Of course, sleeping all night is often a problem. Sufferers may have trouble getting the sleep they need. Other symptoms: a craving for salt and a tendency to feel lightheaded if you stand up too fast. (Doctors call this orthostatic hypotension.) When we asked Dr. Wentz about diagnosing adrenal dysfunction, she suggested a series of saliva tests to determine levels of cortisol. Normally, you start the day with a relatively high level of this hormone, which drop gradually over the course of the day. If the levels fail to drop, or if the pattern is backwards, you may need to take steps to correct it. What Can You Do About Adrenal Fatigue? For those who have trouble sleeping, Dr. Wentz recommends making sure you have enough magnesium in your system. Rather than taking supplements, she suggests soaking in a hot bath with Epsom salts before bed. The skin will absorb some of the magnesium you need, and the hot bath will help you get the sleep that is essential. Maintaining a good balance of blood sugar, neither too high nor too low, is another good way to help coax the body out of chronic stress mode. Avoid high-carb breakfasts like bagels or pancakes, and instead make sure to get enough protein by eating eggs or drinking a smoothie with a good dose of whey protein, for example. Other recommendations will sound familiar. Spend time in nature when you can. Get some physical activity daily-but not too much, and not too late in the day. Practice relaxation or meditation. Read Dr. Wentz's book.

Show 1295: How Delicious Flavors Shape Human Behavior (Archive) This week on our nationally syndicated radio show, our topic is evolution and the role of delicious flavors. We talk with Dr. Rob Dunn, ecologist and evolutionary biologist, about how the search for food with delicious flavors as well as high nutrient content might have shaped our behavior as we evolved. How Humans Define Delicious Flavors: If you think about your favorite flavors, you'll probably be able to conjure up quite a range, from mint-chocolate chip ice cream to a seared steak or miso soup with mushrooms. Taking culture into account expands the range even more. For example, most Americans would not think of grasshoppers as delicious, but in Oaxaca, Mexico, they are a delicacy. When we lived there, we found them very tasty. Rob Dunn suggests that the search for delicious foods has encouraged us to eat things that can help us survive and thrive. And we are not alone. Animals and birds have evolved taste perception that is well suited to their ecological niches. Moreover, primates are likely to share these preferences with others in their group. Dr. Dunn describes how chimpanzees in one rainforest location use tools to acquire the ants they like to eat. In neighboring regions, chimps eat different ants and use different tools to access them. Each group has its own culinary culture, a term we are more likely to associate with humans than with chimps. The Science of Taste: Scientists have not paid a great deal of attention to taste, partly because it is difficult to study. It is a complex sense that draws on the sense of smell in addition to the five flavors that our taste buds register. However, the research needs to be interdisciplinary, and that can be a challenge. How Delicious Flavors at Dinner Make Us Human: When you find something with especially delicious flavors, whether it is aged cheese or a great cup of coffee, you may want to share it with your family members and friends. When we share food, it encourages the release of oxytocin, a hormone associated with social bonding. While animals can share, and some do, humans are especially good at this. Dinner parties and village festivals, Mardi Gras and Thanksgiving dinner are all great examples of the cultural overlay that humans have added to the act of sharing food. Rob Dunn co-authored Delicious with his wife, medical anthropologist Monica Sanchez. Did Humans Hunt the Tastiest Species to Extinction? Quite a number of large mammals once hunted by early humans became extinct. Did people hunt them to extinction? We can't go back in time to study this process as it happened. Consequently, it is a contentious issue. But there is certainly evidence that points in that direction. Wooly mammoths, for example, may just have been too tasty, even though they were doubtless dangerous to hunt. Beyond Delicious Flavors to Future Evolution: In A Natural History of the Future: What the Laws of Biology Tell Us About the Destiny of the Human Species, Dr. Dunn suggests that trying to control nature is fruitless. His metaphor is the Mississippi River, which regularly washes over the levies built to contain it and floods communities on its banks. Understanding evolution and the law of natural selection is key to human health and survival. Natural Selection in Action: Understanding natural selection is crucial when it comes to microbial resistance to antibiotics. In one experiment Dr. Dunn describes, the researchers (including Michael Baym and Roy Kishony and others) set up a giant petri dish (Science, Sep. 9, 2016). They called it the Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena (MEGA) plate and it had increasingly concentrated levels of antibiotics from the edges to the center. Bacteria without resistance to these antibiotics were introduced at the edge of the MEGA plate. In less than two weeks, they had evolved resistance to highly toxic concentrations of the antibiotic. That is the power of evolution! The question is whether we can learn to appreciate, respect and potentially harness that power for our own future well-being. This Week's Guest: Rob Dunn is an ecologist and evolutionary biologist, focusing on the biodiversity of humans. He is the William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor in the Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina State University and in the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics at the University of Copenhagen.
