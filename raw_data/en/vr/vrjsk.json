Like many of his breed, this 8-year-old German shepherd has chronic arthritis caused by a hereditary malformation of his hip joints. Prince needs relief from his constant pain, but long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, Tylenol or cortisone have had undesirable side effects, like upset stomach, dizziness and loss of appetite, which shouldn't happen to a dog. What can be done? Homeopathic medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic and nutrition, say veterinarians who are committed to using alternative therapies in their practices. Dr. Martin DeAngelis, owner of the Village Animal Clinic in Ardsley and one of the few veterinarians in Westchester who is board-certified in veterinary surgery, not only does all the general and referral surgery in his practice but also travels to other hospitals in the region to perform surgery. Dr. DeAngelis strongly believes in homeopathic medicine, however, and has been using homeopathy in his practice for nine years. \"Yes,\" he said in answer to a question, \"homeopathic medicine and surgery can coexist. The ultimate goal is to help the animal. I use homeopathy in conjunction with surgery after an operation to reduce the trauma of the surgery.\" Like Cures Like Homeopathic medicine, he explained, is based on a 19th-century discovery that minute concentrations of plant and mineral extracts can help heal many conditions in humans and animals. \"Two basic principles of homeopathy which are quite foreign to usual concepts of conventional medical practices are that higher distillations are more potent in actions and that 'like cures like,' which means that minute amounts of something that causes a condition -- itching, for example -- would be used to treat an itchy condition.\" Dr. DeAngelis said he became interested in homeopathy when he was asked to evaluate the alternative therapies practiced by a peer, Dr. Allen Schoen at the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan nine years ago. \"Dr. Schoen was using acupuncture and homeopathic medicine in his practice,\" he said, \"I found his methods so effective that I integrated homeopathy into my practice. I have found it to be very effective in the treatment of many different orthopedic diseases. I frequently use homeopathic medicines in combination with nutritional supplements and vitamin therapy with good results.\" Homeopathy, Dr. DeAngelis emphasized, is especially valuable in treating dogs with chronic arthritis. \"It is not uncommon for puppies as young as 9 months old to have arthritis,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's a lifelong condition, so they need relief for years and years. Over such a long period of time, drugs will have toxic side effects and conventional medicines don't promote healing.\" 'A Synergistic Effect' By using homeopathic remedies like Traumeel (a dilution of plant extracts including arnica, a common herb that relieves pain and inflammation) and Zeel (which is composed of 12 herbal extracts), Dr. DeAngelis said he is able to treat many different orthopedic diseases. Doses are administered by injection or by pill. \"My experience with many animals, particularly those suffering with arthritis and bone inflammation, has been that in approximately 80 percent of the cases we have been able to successfully manage our patients without drugs that affect other organs adversely. With an additional 5 to 10 percent we're able to use homeopathy along with reduced amounts of drugs, which minimizes dependence on drugs and reduces their side effects.\" Acknowledging that there are still veterinarians who think homeopathic treatments are \"baloney,\" Dr. DeAngelis emphasized that homeopathic medicines are natural and actually work with the body to heal itself. \"They have a synergistic effect, unlike drugs, which do not promote healing as much as they suppress symptoms,\" he said. Yet, he doesn't rule out the use of drugs when they are appropriate. There are times when allopathic drugs -- which treat a disease by producing effects different from or opposite to those of the disease -- are the treatment of choice, he said. \"But I am open to combinations of treatments that include acupuncture that will benefit the animal,\" he added. Dr. Schoen, who pioneered the use of alternative medicine in his practice starting in 1981, is one of a handful of certified veterinarian acupuncturists. He got interested in alternative treatments, he said, when he began to see the limitations of conventional medicine. \"In my practice, which was mainly in northern Westchester and Putnam, where there are a lot of horses, I treated jumpers, hunters and dressage horses who had chronic back problems. Those were the athletes. \"I also treated small animals such as dogs that had degenerative conditions. I became concerned when I saw that the medicines we were using for chronic conditions such as arthritis in dogs and back problems in the horses were not promoting healing, and that the side effects could be devastating,\" Dr. Schoen said. \"I started to examine alternative treatments and I got interested in acupuncture, chiropractic and herbal remedies.\" Acupuncture, he said, he successfully used in the treatment of a 10-year-old dog that was so crippled with arthritis that it was paralyzed. \"After three acupuncture treatments, it was able to stand up,\" he said. And acupuncture was equally successful when used on a dressage horse. \"What happened was that all of a sudden the owner could not ride it. It balked so much,\" Dr. Schoen recalled. \"The owner was so upset that he sent the horse to Cornell to be examined. They couldn't find anything wrong with it, but three days after it had acupuncture on its back and chiropractic treatments, the horse was restored to health.\" The more he learned about alternative treatments, he said, it became more and more of his practice. \"To such an extent that in 1989 I sold my practice, the Brook Farm Veterinary Center in Patterson in Putnam County. I still use its facilities but I practice alternative medicine solely now. My patients come to me by referrals from other veterinarians and from recommendations from owners.\" Dr. Schoen, who now teaches acupuncture, chiropractic and herbal medicine alternative medicines at veterinary schools worldwide, said his philosophy is that everything has its place and that every treatment has its limitations. \"The key is to use whatever is appropriate for an existing condition, which will include drugs such as antibiotics,\" he said. When it comes to alternative treatments, Dr. Schoen said he believes more veterinarians are open to their use. \"At the beginning, herbal medicine, acupuncture and chiropractic were viewed with suspicion by veterinarians who used only conventional medicine, but now they are much more accepting. They send me the referrals, and that is the bulk of my practice. We work together as a team for the benefit of the patient,\" "}
