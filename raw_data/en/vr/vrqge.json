Administration of inactivated viruses are the common and mature platform of developing new vaccines. CoronaVac is an inactivated vaccine that has undergone preclinical tests and phase I/II clinical trials. Methods: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial with CoronaVac among healthy healthcare professionals in 16 centres in Brazil. Participants received two doses of vaccine (3 g in 0.5 mL) vaccine or placebo at day 0 and 14. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases confirmed by RT-PCR 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Prevention of disease severity was a major secondary efficacy endpoint, and adverse events incidence up to seven days after immunization was the primary safety outcome. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04456595. Findings: Between July 21 and Dec 16, 2020, 12 396 participants were enrolled and received at least one vaccine or placebo dose. There were 9,823 participants who received the two doses and were followed for at least 14 days and had, therefore, reached the final efficacy analysis. There were 253 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the cohort: 85 cases (11.0/100 person-year) among 4,953 participants in the vaccine group, and 168 cases (22\u00b73/100 person-year) among 4,870 participants in the placebo group. The primary efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was 50\u00b77% (95%CI 36\u00b70-62\u00b70). The secondary efficacy against cases requiring assistance (score 3) and moderate and severe cases (score 4) were 83\u00b77% (95%CI 58\u00b70-93.7) and 100% (95%CI 56\u00b74-100.0) respectively. All 6 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group. The incidence of adverse reactions, which was mainly pain at the administration site, was higher in the vaccine group (77\u00b71%) than in the placebo group (66\u00b74%). There were 67 serious adverse events reported by 64 participants and all were determined to be unrelated to vaccination, including two fatal cases. In a subset of participants, neutralizing antibody assays showed similar seroconversion B.1.128, P.1, and P.2 variants. Interpretation: A phase 3 clinical trial conducted in healthcare professionals in Brazil demonstrated that the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine has a good safety profile and is efficacious against any symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and highly protective against moderate and severe COVID-19.
