There are multiple problems with prior methodologies of 40 effecting protein expression . For example , heterologous yl - P - Y deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) introduced into a cell can be inherited by daughter cells ( whether or not the heterologous DNA has integrated into the chromosome ) or by offspring . Introduced DNA can integrate into host cell genomic DNA 45 at some frequency , resulting in alterations and / or damage to the host cell genomic DNA . In addition , multiple steps must occur before a protein is made . Once inside the cell , DNA - Y \u2014 PEZ must be transported into the nucleus where it is transcribed into RNA . The RNA transcribed from DNA must then enter 50 Rel the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein .
