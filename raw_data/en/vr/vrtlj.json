The initial curriculum chosen was a Physician Assis - tant studies program, and the second was an Anes thesiologist Assistant (AA) program. Robin Schugar, DHSc, PA-C, is program director for the Physician Assistant (PA) program, and she said, \"The university is very particular about conducting extensive research in the areas where they decide to expand the programs; they see what the needs are to be sure the program can be successful and contribute in a positive way in the health care field.\" Dr. Thomas Nguyen, Dean of Academic Affairs and Retention, agreed that both the PA and AA programs were in high demand and would benefit the health care sector.

FALLON Q. Is there a doctor in the house?A. Quite possibly , especially if physi- cians and community health care centers take telehealth to the next level through WITHmyDOC. WITHmyDOC is a digital health com- pany which virtually connects patients to their care teams, providing real-time data to control symptom and disease progression. Founded in 2018, WITHmyDOC uses a web-based intelli-gence platform for remote patient moni-toring (RPM) which is transforming healthcare delivery . Through the platform, partnering health systems, physician practices and healthcare organizations can provide remote patient monitoring that facili-tates proactive intervention for chronic care management and telehealth visits. According to Jorge Rodriguez, VP Sales and Marketing, who joined the company in pre-COVID 2020, the pan-demic has played a role in accelerating improved acceptance of the value of remote patient monitoring. While software engineers, digital experts and developers knew that capa-bility and opportunity existed pre-COVID for connecting providers and patients outside of physician offices and health clinics; the practice of telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring T ransforming Healthcare Delivery Jorge Rodriguez Dr. Stephen D. Nimer BY DANIEL CASCIATO iCare was developed with a very simple premise\u2014that today's healthcare organizations should focus on patient care, not software. iCare uses the latest technology and a proven clinical engine to provide users with the flexibility and ease of use they demand while providing a secure and affordable solution that is built for the future of healthcare. \"As an advanced electronic health record system, or EHR, iCare simplifies the experience for the user,\" says Michael W . Kesti, Chairman of the Government Relations Group, LLC, and an expert in the EHR Market . Kesti has 40 years experience in healthcare and has been a senior advisor to EHR companies, including developing and implementing plans, conducting competitive analyses, and reviewing and overseeing the implementation of numerous EHR systems in hospitals and physician practices across the USA. \"iCare allows any user to maneuver around through the different aspects of the system without leaving one screen, without issues of coordination, and potentially losing data,\" he adds. iCare provides a complete solution for clinical, billing and administrative functionality at a fraction of the cost of legacy software. The Enterprise Cloud Electronic Health Record (EHR) from iCare is a fresh alternative to legacy software. iCare software makes EHR implementation fast, intuitive and affordable and the result will be better patient care. iCare: An Advanced EHR Delivered in the Cloud Medical IT Michael W.

All too often, physicians become employees of hospitals, compa-nies backed by private equity sponsors or health plans, or part of large medical groups and/or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), and they are not truly integrated into the practice, and are not happy . Some even tell their physicians that everything will be the same in the new model. Many organizations strive for true clini- cal integration, an active and ongoing pro-gram to evaluate and modify the practices of physicians in networks to facilitate a high degree of interdependence and coop-eration of its physician members with the goals of improving care, reducing costs, and improving access to care. Conversely , others focus mainly on ensuring their physicians are engaged productive mem-bers of their organizations. Healthcare is complicated. The time cli- nicians spend on non-patient care activi-ties has significantly increased. Unfor - tunately , organizational growth often comes with less transparency , less time for physician input, and discussion of what works for the clinicians and what does not. All too often, the prevailing system smothers physicians because they are anti-thetical to building a cohesive medical group. These systems often include not only their compensation, but their work-flow , and ways to treat their patients. Incentive payment systems may even be put in place without input of the physi-cians, and the appropriate recalibration over time to account for a physician's spe-cific patient population. WRVU requirements to keep physician compensation levels often take priority over the factors that drive clinical integra-tion. WRVUs measure productivity , not the status of clinical integration. Key per-formance indicator (KPI) data collection and measuring systems monitoring clini-cal integration effectiveness should vary according to a health systems' unique characteristics. In general, the KPIs should measure the extent there is: \u0081 Coordinated care across the continu- um of healthcare services required includ-ing supporting education and social serv-ices. \u0081 Patient and/or family involvement in care planning for all patients. \u0081 Primary care availability demonstrat- ed by the mix of inpatient to ambulatory visit volume. \u0081 Team effectiveness and cross referral within the healthcare system. \u0081 Common use of proven individualiza- tion of care pathways for patients with co-morbidities. \u0081 Performance measurement tools that measure clinical outcomes and those out-comes are tracked and shared across stake-holders. Most healthcare systems have shared patient electronic charts across the care continuum. Physicians have the patient information at hand and historical data is there for subsequent analysis. What is often missing is management ensuring organizational goals and aims are agreed upon by the providers and care teams and dedicated resources are in alignment with desired outcomes. When physicians become employees of large organizations, their quality of care and behavior become the subject of sys-tem-wide policies and the opportunity to resolve quality or behavioral issues infor-mally is often lost. Rather than receiving collegial intervention, the employee of a hospital, health plan or large medical group may be subjected to a formal disci-plinary pr ocess in which the decision- makers are system level administrators with no knowledge of the physician as an individual. Harsh outcomes may result from such reviews and the physi-cian's employment may be jeopardized by events that were formerly resolved by a conversation. We need to revive the recognition that an encounter involves a patient and a physician and for the former to be satis-fied, it is important to be responsive to the needs and desires of the treating physician. We need to ensure that physicians under-stand the data and data analytics. Systems should be designed for the particular patient population served and the treating physician. Clinicians must have the tools to improve care in a cost-effective manner, and incentives designed accordingly . It is not sufficient to merely have a fair market value consultant declare that the compen-sation of the physicians is at the 50th or 75th percentile. Physicians need to be involved in these processes, including when health plan contracts are negotiated. Designer solutions need to be employed, and starting tomorrow is too late.

The good news is that with the generosity of our community , House of Hope continues to give those men and women the tools to overcome addiction and pursue a life of quality . We reunite them with their families and restore their lives. The stories are heartbreaking. Last February , after Anna tried to commit suicide, she went to jail, lost her job and her daughter was taken away . Life had been spiraling out of control after years of addiction, and she had hit rock bottom. Addiction, like most other diseases, progresses with time, and Anna hadn't realized how consuming and dark her situation had become. She was offered a choice to either go back to jail or try House of Hope. Her choice to come to House of Hope has made all the difference. With the help of consistent therapy , counselors and the community , Anna worked hard and was determined to change her perspective on life. Now she's building a new life with her daughter, has earned her GED and is on the way to culinary school. Through our programs, we serve hundreds of people in Broward County , providing more than 25,000 hours of life altering therapy . Our work continues through the holidays, the ongoing pandemic, periods of quarantine and a myriad of other world events. We would not be successful with financial support from our donors. Our clients receive structure, thera-py , case management and support, which are the keys to return to sobriety and restore lives. You may know a loved one, friend or colleague like Anna. To help them or even you navigate the holidays, keep in mind the following: Avoid big changes, despite the times: During the holidays make the effort to maintain a consistent routine, diet and exer-cise while avoiding alcohol and other substances will help keep your mental and physical wellness intact. Identify and cut the triggers: Identifying the trig- gers that lead to unhealthy habits is the first step. Cut them or plan to reduce them, including intake of alcohol and other substances, overeating and anything that might trigger stress. Avoid discus-sions that elicit emotional responses such as poli-tics or religion. Surrounding yourself with people or doing activities that make you comfortable and happy is a good way to maintain good mental health and balance in your life. Take care of you: The continued uncertainty of the pandemic, paired with economic and civil crises here and globally , still has the power to increase stress levels. Take care of your physical, mental and emotional well-being. Avoid negativity , surround yourself with positive people, relax and stay upbeat. Make yourself a priority . Life is busy , always coming and going, particularly around the holidays. We are all looking for our place of peace. We find solace but some of us can't. Remember them. They are your brother, sister, mother, father, relative, neighbor or co-worker. Help us help them get their lives on the right track and return to their families economically stable and sober. At House of Hope, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in Fort Lauderdale, we have so many stories of success, hope and resilience, like Anna's. For more than 50 years, we have been giving the men and women in our programs the best chance to become healthy and to lead productive lives in our community . We thank you for your support.

Founded in 1988 by Albert T a\u00f1o, M.D. and his partner , Jorge E. Perez, M.D., today the KIDZ team of dedicated pediatric subspecialists, advanced practice providers, nursing and hearing professionals works in hospitals and private offices in six Florida counties. While birthrates are going down in much of the United States, South Florida is bucking that trend, with only a slight drop in the birthrate. South Florida's needs likewise are different than elsewhere, creating a more dynamic environment. Q. What attracted you to neonatology? A. Pediatric and neonatal healthcare is challenging due to the vari- ables among patients, including vast differences in body size and func-tion, significant emotional and social needs, and possible sensitivity to medications. While the challenges are significant, the results are very rewarding. I realized I wanted to stay in the field while doing rotations in medical school. Q. How does the practice of neonatology in South Florida compare with leading medical communities? A. Neonatology in South Florida is on the forefront of medical practice. We as a physician-led group are progressive, and our hospital leaders are not afraid of change. Quite the contrary - our hospitals partner with us to address opportunities and chal-lenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Like us, the hospitals are proud of the achievements in neonatal medicine that have been achieved in the last 30 years. A significant contribution is from our nursing professionals, who have such a good clinical eye. Nurses are a special breed, and our nursing care in South Florida is superb. We couldn't have achieved the current standard of practice without working closely with our nurses. Q. Some states have adopted Level 4 neonatology units. Where is South Florida on that issue? A. Level 4 units have existed for more than a decade in other regions. ACHA made it a priority to set guidelines for certifying neonatal units and establishing the Level 4 units in our state. Seventeen physician specialists from across Florida came together to discuss the state of neonatal medicine and determine the criteria for Level 4 units. I'm proud to have served on that committee. We achieved a consensus which protects the Level 2 units in the more rural parts of the state, while establishing guidelines for the Level 3 and 4 units in larger metropolitan areas. When they're expecting, parents are often worried about a hospital's ability to rise to unexpected needs. Parents can have a tremendous level of comfort that our systems are working well. For instance, every deliv- ery in Miami-Dade has a neonatologist or neonatal nurse practitioner on-site who can resuscitate your infant. The first minutes of life are cru- cial, and Jorge and I are proud to have been instrumental in raising that bar. Another area in which we have had a great deal of impact is in post- natal practices such as kangaroo care, which means extended skin-to- skin contact after the birth. It was initially implemented for premature babies but now , it's standard practice for all deliveries. The neonatology profession has served our community well. We are proud of the thou- sands of babies that we've brought into the world. Q. Since you and Dr. Perez founded KIDZ in 1988, you've had significant and steady growth. It's been more than 33 years. To what do you attribute your ability to attract many of the most established and well-respected subspecialists in South Florida to your team? A. Numerous factors have contributed to our growth. First of all, a focus on quality and accountability starts at the top. Jorge and I check our ego at the door, and we look for professionals like us who have an open mind and want to make a difference. We are also strict about following protocols and we vet our associates carefully . We've learned to listen to and trust our gut. Q. Tell us about this statement: \"A normal delivery is a postpartum diagnosis.\" A. When a woman gives birth, you want everything to fall in place. Until the baby is delivered and it's over, you can't know the details about the delivery , whether it's typ-ical, atypical, or heart-stopping. It's an important reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of maintaining protocols that are at the forefront of the practice of medicine. Q. What else do you want parents to know about KIDZ Medical? A. We provide high quality and cost-effective medical care using evidence-based tools, proficient level of training and education, clinical research, and state-of-the-art medical technology . We've described KIDZ as an academic group in a private setting. More importantly , we want to leave a legacy in South Florida. Q&A with Albert T a\u00f1o, M.D., Practicing Neonatologist and Co-Founder, KIDZ Medical Services Recently , while looking for a used car for my dad, I found myself sitting in the office of the 'Certified Pre-Owned Inventory Manager'. Call me a little skeptical, but he seemed a lot like a used car sales-man to me. I've never been big on titles or job descriptions. Let's face it, most of the time it is not possible to encapsulate everything that someone is responsible for in a three or four-word title or two-page Word document, but there are some excep-tions. Sometimes a person's title or recognized responsibilities can have a dramatic impact not only on them, but on the people they interact with every day . Carefully chosen words can help some-one take more pride in what they do and therefore result in better customer or patient satisfaction. For example, compare the haggard title of 'Receptionist' with the more enlight-ened 'Director of first impressions.' How might someone in this position do a better job of greeting visitors? Instead of an 'Admissions Clerk', how about a 'Patient Advocate'? Could interactions patients or their families have with these individuals feel less transactional? Once, I saw 'Ear to ear smile' as one of the requirements listed on a job description. Think that might send an inspiring message? Point is simple, what you call your team members can have a remark-able effect of how they feel, act and interact. Patient care will always be about being great at what you do, but patient experience is all about how you do it. Perceptions go a long way in shaping our reality . The right title and list of job responsibilities can easily help us evolve the culture of our organizations. As we enter 2022, feel free to mix things up by tweaking stale titles and outdated job responsibilities. The team may surprise you with their response and your patients will certainly feel the difference. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

Millions of people rely on NSAIDs to control symptoms of chronic pain and inflam-mation, however, NSAIDs come with some risk. Studies have shown they may cause toxicity to one's liver, kidneys, and upper GI-tract. PrRelf combines pow- erful flavonoids from Skull Cap and Green Tea to provide extraordinary anti-inflammatory support, while added benefits of Boswellia and T urmeric supercharge the anti-inflammatory action. CBG and Delta-8 isolate round out the overall anal-gesic effects. Unlike NSAIDs that may cause undesirable side effects, PrRelf is a combination of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) ingredients, that have shown no toxicity over periods of long-term use. It is a COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor. P rRel f's convenient form makes it easy to consume, and the Appleberry flavor is derived from organic fruit extract. The 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule announced substantial payment increases for Medicare Chronic Care Management (CCM), even though most other services will receive about 4% less than in 2021. The increases incentivize greater participation in CCM with reimbursement for the min-imal billable CCM services, at least 20 minutes of telephone contact (CPT 99490), jumping on average from $42.17 to $62.16, a 51% increase! At this new reimbursement, a practice enrolling 300 eligible Medicare patients has the potential to gross over $225,000 in yearly CCM revenue. Creating such a profitable new revenue stream helps offset the nega-tive financial effects of disruption and pay-ment reductions that are contributing to physician loss of satisfaction and burnout. Historically , the ACA in 2010 mandated care coordination and disease manage-ment services be delivered to Medicare and Medicaid patients having 2 or more chronic medical conditions. In response, CMS launched Medicare CCM in January 2015 as a telephonic program for enhanc-ing health and care for this targeted, vul-nerable patient population which utilizes the vast majority (>90%) of Medicare funds. This critical primary care compo-nent of health care transformation has been shown to lower total costs of care and improve patient outcomes; it is one of the top CMS innovations meeting the Quadruple Aim framework that guides continuous improvement in health care delivery . Why this payment incentive? From the start, Medicare has fully intended for as many eligible beneficiaries as possible to be enrolled in CCM in order to meaningfully improve the health of the high-utilizer population, and as a result, help sustain Medicare. However, there has been surprisingly slow adoption, low patient enrollment, and an unexpected refractoriness to participating in CCM, even though this primary care-focused program improves care management, cre-ates a financial opportunity , and prepares participants for value-based payments! A survey in 2015 revealed much of the chal-lenge to advancing CCM is due to a lack of physician awareness of the program's ben-efits and a general perception that Medicare reimbursements for these servic-es are too low. Why a Next Gen CCM program? By performing an ROI/gap analysis, most medical practices find they lack the resources and capabilities required to implement a profitable, high value CCM program. However, a solution for these practices is to outsource CCM services. Unfortunately , some earlier CCM compa-nies viewed the program as merely a finan-cial offering, failing to recognize the importance of CCM to health care trans-formation. To reconcile this disparity , Your Doctor In Touch (YDIT) developed a novel, innovative Next Generation (Next Gen) CCM program adherent to Medicare's vision for CCM. How does YDIT's Next Gen CCM advance the program? Next Gen CCM strategies that advance Medicare CCM include: 1) Alignment and care coordination: These processes involving all providers and the patient are essential to the success-ful delivery of Next Gen CCM and they are initiated ASAP following patient enroll-ment. 2) Precision and personalization: Patient-centricity and meeting patients where they're at by asking patients \"What matters?\" rather than \"What's the matter?\" and leveraging shared decision-making to engage patients in their care. 3) Whole-person health: Management and coordination of all aspects of care and bridging identified gaps in care ensures holistic medicine. 4) Patient safety and risk management: Vigilant care managers routinely review determinants of health to assess each patient's health risks and regularly evaluate at-home safety and risk of harm, from medications to falls. 5) Early detection and reporting of patient deterioration: To improve patient outcomes and reduce Medicare waste, ongoing surveillance for patient deteriora-tion is performed, and once detected, an alert is immediately sent to the supervising physician with the intention of circum-venting an avoidable ED visit or hospital-ization. 6) Enhance patient experience of care: Increasing patient satisfaction resulting from the above strategies will improve CAHPS scores. 7) High-value care: Electronical clinical quality measures (eCQM) to be submitted for Medicare incentive payments are mon-itored and managed. The completion of reportable measures is regularly assessed, coordinated, and documented in the EHR for each physician by CCM staff. This value-added feature keeps physicians updated on which measures remain to be performed and is available to all medical practices and health care systems partici-pating in the Medicare Quality Payment Program. For independent practices that are not part of a larger organization, Next Gen CCM will compile and file reports and attain Medicare rate enhancements for them as they would receive, for example, as an ACO member. Thus, Next-Gen CCM increases physician income through dual Medicare payments --- direct reimburse-ment for CCM services plus a positive per-formance payment adjustment. In summary , the additional benefits of Next Gen CCM advance the Quadruple Aim, making CCM worth re-assessing as a service that enhances patient satisfaction, conserves Medicare dollars, helps primary care practices increase revenue, and most importantly , improves the lives of the patients who entrust their care to us every day .

Don't get me wrong, I love what I do every day at my office and at the surgery center. I also love teaching medical students, residents, patients and staff. I feel privileged to have such a meaningful career that allows me to make a difference in people's lives one on one. However, as of late, I have felt that was not enough. There are so many fac-tors threatening the physician-patient relationship that I am compelled to make every effort to preserve that central piece of the practice of medicine. I am convinced that the best way to do this is to all act together as a team. And by ALL I mean you and me. You is a collec-tive, including physicians, nurses, support staff, hospital administrators, pharmacists, pharmaceutical companies, government legislators, medical device companies, aca-demic institutions, professors, lawyers, the media and most importantly , the patients. This is not an exhaustive list of the multi-tude of players in this game we call health-care in America. If you do not find yourself in any of the groups I mentioned, it's because I failed to mention everyone involved. Consider yourself included. If WE don't learn to work together and understand our respective points of view , no one wins the game. My personal mission is to cultivate unity: unity among our medical societies, unity among physician specialties, unity among all levels of healthcare practitioners and unity in the medical community as a whole. The Mission of the Broward County Medical Association is \"to promote the integrity of patient care and public health and to enhance the professional interests of physicians in Broward County .\" Our Association unites allopathic and osteo-pathic physicians, of all specialties in order to secure access to health care of the high-est quality for the residents of Broward County , to maintain the integrity of med-ical practice and care delivery for the citi-zens of Broward and to advocate for the interests of the patients of Broward County , and for the interests of practicing physicians in caring for their patients. In 2020, our immediate past president, Dr. Shahnaz Fatteh, creatively overcame the unexpected challenges of leading us during a pandemic. She quickly adapted by setting aside her prior plans and instead established virtual meetings, kept every-one informed about the latest develop-ments in the spread and treatment of COVID-19, addressed the media and organized efforts to support local health-care heroes. Then, on a night like this in late 2020, she offered her home for a small socially distanced installation of our cur-rent president and one of my first friends at the BCMA, Dr. Abby Berens. Vaccines against COVID-19 were only being offered to hospital workers at the time. Physicians in the community and their staff without hospital affiliation, had no access to the vaccines. We then created a joint effort with the Department of Health in Broward County to offer vac-cines to community physicians and their staff, so they could also be protected while treating patients. More recently , we organized a press release under the leadership of Dr. Berens, where a large group of our physicians in white coats gathered to educate our community on the importance of vaccina-tions against COVID-19. He was featured on NBC 6 and I was featured in Spanish television on Telemundo. Following this, Dr. Berens continued to educate the public through various addi-tional television interviews concerning prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Abby warmly welcomed me during the first event I attended with the BCMA. Later, we attended the Physician Leadership Academy together along with Dr. Fatteh and then went on to serve on the BCMA Board of Directors. Since then, he has set an example for me as both a patient and physician advocate. I thank him for paving the way for me in 2021. I would like to take a moment to share with you what led to my involvement in the BCMA. It started one evening in 2012 when I was looking for a place to have din-ner on my first night in a small town in Northern Florida called Green Cove Springs. I had driven up there for part-time work after leaving the University of Miami and before establishing my current prac-tice in Hollywood. As I waited for my table at a Pizza Hut, I was befriended by an older couple, who then asked me to join them for dinner. That couple was Russell and Sharon Jackson. Russ had dedicated his life to public health. He was a former Executive with the Florida Medical Association. Beyond that, he was an excellent histori-an, with a particular interest in the history of medicine in Florida. From then on, I became very close with Russ and Sharon and we had many dinners together each time I went up to Green Cove Springs. I learned a great deal about the medical history of Florida from Russ. Russ and Sharon had no children and began to view me as their daughter. I only worked there for two months, but I con-tinued to drive up and visit with them even after I established my practice in Broward. Unfortunately , Sharon was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer and passed away a few months later. Russ and I stayed in touch and he introduced me to Cynthia Peterson, CEO of the BCMA, when I began to work in Broward County . He encouraged me to become involved in my county association and stressed the impor-tance of participating in organized medi-cine. Sadly , Russ passed away this year. In appreciation of Russ, I wanted to offer you a copy of one of his articles. The work is entitled \"A Friend to All Humanity\" and it was written about Dr. James Jackson, the namesake for the insti-tution where I completed my training in Miami, Florida: Jackson Memorial Hospital. I am honored to be installed as the 95th President of the Broward County Medical Association. I look forward to 2022 with excitement and I am ready to take on the challenges that face my colleagues and our patients in Broward County . 8 January 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News BCMA President's Message2022... AHEAD ... 2022... A ... 2022... A LOOK AHEAD ... BY VANIA E. FERNANDEZ, MD BY VANESSA ORR As the legal saying goes, there are three sides to every story: the plaintiff's side, the defense's side, and the truth, which is somewhere in the middle. And while courts and juries used to be able to come to a conclusion based on the facts, in these days of social inflation, perception is often just as important as reality . \"Social inflation is causing much high- er jury awards and increased insurance losses\u2014not only in medical malpractice cases, but in all areas of litigation,\" explained Tom Murphy , producer, National Health Care Practice Danna-Gracey , a Division of Risk Strategies. Social inflation is a term used to describe the rising costs of insurance claims resulting from things like increas-ing litigation, broader definitions of lia-bility , more plaintiff-friendly legal deci-sions, and massive jury awards, some-times known as nuclear verdicts. For example, a study by Verdict Search showed that between 2019-2020, there was a more than 300 percent increase in the frequency of verdicts of $20 million or more from a previous study that cov-ered verdicts between 2001-2010. \"A $2 million verdict 15 to 20 years ago would be $30 or $40 million now ,\" said Murphy . Murphy says that part of the reason for these verdicts is an almost generation-long decay of public trust in corporations, spurred by social media and the changing demographics of the younger generations. \"When you see a corporation do some- thing that is not in the public interest, or getting bad PR even if they did not neces-sarily do something wrong, Gen Z and the younger generations start texting and talk-ing about it, and it catches on like wild-fire,\" he said. He adds that 'a culture of fault,' in which people automatically blame others when something bad happens to them, also con-tributes to increased litigation and higher jury verdicts. \"It's an interesting dynamic; in the past year or so with COVID, people were more willing to support hospitals because they were trying to help people and save lives,\" said Murphy . \"And while that has helped a little, we're still seeing individuals looking to blame someone and looking for money . This culture of fault is very dangerous to medical practices and to all businesses. \"Not only does the average person have a skewed perception of the economic dis-parity between corporations and regular individuals, but they also have a different perception of the value of an injury , result-ing in higher claims values and judge-ments,\" he added. For example, in 2019 in the U.S., there were 73 court approved class-action settle-ments totaling $2.1 billion. In 2020, there were 77 court approved class-action settle-ments that totaled $4.2 billion. \"In one year, the settlements dou- bled\u2014that's a staggering statistic,\" said Murphy , adding that the average settle-ment in 2020 per class action suit was $54.5 million, a 15 percent increase year over year for the past 10 years. Other factors that contribute to social inflation are the sophistication of the plaintiff bar, in which tactics include the use of jury consultants and psychologists specializing in group dynamics with the goal of influencing the size of jury awards, and private equity firms becom-ing involved in litigation funding. \"Millennials and Gen Z age groups have a different world view than older groups, and they are now serving on juries,\" said Murphy . \"They prefer to be part of a consensus, which impacts the outcome of verdicts. At the beginning of a case, the plaintiff bar looks for the jury foreman or leaders and tries to influence them by using psychological tactics to try to get the rest of jury to agree to ver-dicts that have values that far exceed what a normal jury would find. \"Private equity firms give law firms the funding needed to take on cases that in the past they may have been hesitant to pursue,\" he added. \"They are spending billions to get involved in litigation with the goal of taking a percentage of the award if the firm wins the case.\" Murphy adds that while social infla- tion trends are hard to predict, he doesn't see it going away any time soon. \"Everything goes in cycles in terms of lawsuits and litigation, but this is differ-ent,\" he said. \"Information is now out there in the flash of an eye, and no one is vetting it; and it's having a huge impact on court cases and awards.\" For more information, call T om Murphy or Matt Gracey at (800) 966-2120 or visit www.dannagracey.com. T om Murphy Social Inflation Influencing Lawsuits, Verdict AmountsMalpractice Insurance EXPERT ADVICE Healthcare is its own particular category and doesn't necessarily con-form to standard market-ing practices. Marketing budgets aren't first on the depth chart when allocat-ing a hospital or health-care system's annual budget. However, ever since we entered the new normal of life in a COVID envi-ronment, the importance of marketing cannot and should not be overlooked. The impor-tance of telling a story in today's video-obsessed culture is no longer the exception but the rule. Hospitals are their only little city comprised of many different depart-ments all committed to achieving the goal of providing excellent healthcare. Each department has its challenges and needs. Marketing must maintain a brand and image and get patients; after all, a hospital is also a business. Human Resources needs to retain staff. The insurance department must han-dle a tremendous amount of red tape. Perhaps most importantly and often overlooked is the training, communi-cation, and continuing education required for public safety . It can be challenging to ensure everyone gets the same message because of the stag-gering hospital work schedules. Video content can solve all those problems. It's a simple solution to a complicated situation. Through the power of video, you can dissemi-nate any message with sight, sound, motion, and emotion. Need to discuss a new hospital policy? Produce a video and post it on your pri-vate network with a link. Need to keep morale up? Create a video showing all the good work your hospital is doing. Need to hire more staff? Create a video on the ben-efits of working in healthcare. The possibilities are endless, and the process is not as complicated as you think when working with the right production company . Crown Street Films has the experience necessary to help hospitals and healthcare systems alike stand out with creative, informa-tive, and professionally produced con-tent.

What Video Can Do For You BY CHAD TINGLE South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com January 2022 9 E-mail Your Editorial Submissions to editorial@southfloridahospitalnews.comOmicron is the newest COVID-19 variant dominat- ing the headlines. While this new strain of the virus is rais-ing questions, we continue to learn more information about Omicron every day . As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public healthcare part-ners continue to monitor Omicron, here's what we know about the variant so far: Why Is This Happening? The virus that causes COVID-19 is con- stantly changing, which produces new variants of the virus. While some variants persist, others disappear. Public health experts, such as the CDC and the World Health Organization, are monitoring Omicron and other variants to assess transmissibility , severity of infection and symptoms, as well as the effectiveness of vaccines, diagnostic testing and treat-ments. What We Know This newest variant was first identified in South Africa and has subsequently spread to the U.S. Based on the limited number of cases, it appears this variant spreads more quickly than its predeces-sors, but the severity of symptoms may be milder. Again, public health experts are still assessing Omicron, so it's too early to make defini-tive statements about this variant and so it's impor-tant that the public follow safety measures. As we learned with the Delta variant, vaccines are expected to be effective in reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death. While some treatments may not be as effective against Omicron, mono- clonal antibody treatments may help the immune system recognize and respond more effectively to the virus. What You Can Do As we continue to fight this global pan- demic, getting vaccinated and receiving the recommended booster shot is your most powerful defense against COVID-19. Wearing a mask indoors is also effective in reducing the spread of the virus, espe-cially if you're unvaccinated. Continue washing your hands and practicing physi-cal distancing when necessary . If you're experiencing any cold or flu- like symptoms, please stay home, distance yourself from others and consult your physicians if symptoms persist. Seek emer-gency medical care if needed. Dr. Joshua Lenchus is Broward Health's interim chief medical officer. Omicron: What We Know About the Newest COVID Variant BY JOSHUA LENCHUS, DO, RPH, FACP , SFHM 10 January 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News E-mail Your Editorial Submissions to editorial@southfloridahospitalnews.comThree Ways for Hospitals to Measure Health Equity The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the deadly dispari- ties lurking in the U.S. healthcare system, which resulted in worse health outcomes for marginalized and vulnerable people. Now , hospitals and health sys-tems throughout the U.S. are prioritizing health equi-ty for their patient popula-tions. In order to advance health equity , however, you first have to be able to measure it. And as BDO's 2021 Health Equity Survey discovered, there's no industry standard for measuring health equity . But that doesn't mean your health equity efforts are in vain. What's important is that you choose a measurement method and stick to it. Here are three ways you can measure health equity in your patient popula-tions: 1. Quality of care. According to BDO's survey , 62% of respondents use quality of care (QOC) KPIs \u2014 including health outcomes, hospital admissions and read-missions, mortality rates and access to care \u2014 to measure health equity . You can use these metrics to identify who in your community struggles the most to receive equitable care, then refocus your health equity efforts to understand and address the underlying causes. 2.Community engagement. Com - munity engagement can take the form of community surveys and health assess-ments, patient satisfaction and respons-es to community outreach. According to our survey , 34% of respondents track community engagement, which you can use to determine who you are struggling to engage with in your community and update your outreach and messaging accordingly . 3. Demographics. Although demo- graphics are often overlooked \u2014 just 22% of our survey respondents said they measure demographics to track health equity progress \u2014 they're key to designing an approach to health equity that res-onates with your patient population. Once you understand the demo-graphics that your organization primarily serves, you can invest time into training your staff to better understand and connect with those populations. There's no right or wrong way to measure health equity . The important thing is that you select your KPIs based on your organization's existing resources, patient population and approach to dispensing care. It's also crucial that you remain consistent. Once you've chosen a KPI to measure, you have to stick with it. Otherwise, you'll lose the ability to track your progress over time.

Here are some insider tips regarding ACO transparency to its members: Five Things to Know - Understanding the inner workings of an ACO: 1. Legal Entity - An ACO is a legal entity just like any other; it can be structured as a corporation, a partnership, an LLC, under applicable state or federal laws. At first, it may appear to be very similar to any other corporation, but it is really not; many other rules apply . 2. Mission - An ACO's mission must be in furtherance of providing quality healthcare, increasing patient access to healthcare, and with an eye toward sharing in the sav-ings generated by the plan or the program. 3. Governing Body - An ACO has to have a separate and unique governing body , such as a board of directors or managers. The ACO par-ticipants must be given the opportunity for \"meaningful participation\" in the ACO's governance. If it is to be deemed a physician-owned ACO, at least 75% of the ACO must be owned or controlled by the physicians. 4. Controlling the ACO - The ACO's have voting powers just like any other corpo- ration, but they are also required to maintain a \"conflict of interest policy\" that applies to the members of the governing body . They are required to be transparent, to disclose conflicts, and to disclose the methodology of how profits or Medicare savings are divided among its participants. 5. Healthcare Alignment - The ACO is required to maintain a senior level member who is a physician and a medical director of the organization. This position is not required to be full time, but it is responsible for clinical oversight and for overseeing and establishing the quality assurance and improvement programs of the ACO. If you would like to find out more about what the rights, responsibilities and obligations of an ACO and its participants are, visit www.MirzaHealthLaw.com or call/text Ben Mirza at (954)445-5503 or email BAM@MirzaHealthLaw.com. BY BEN ASSAD MIRZA, ESQ., LLM, MPHA Physician-Led Healthcare Reform Physicians have a unique vantage point on the short com- ings of the health care delivery system. They witness first-hand the impact of ever-increasing insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs for their patients. Costs which strain family resources or make insurance coverage unobtainable. They bear the brunt of the administrative cost and frustra-tions of trying to secure medically necessary services for their patients through utilization controls enacted by insur-ance companies. For physicians in private practice, like most businesses, they experience the pain of the annual Group Health Insurance renewal cycle when they receive annual premium increases with little transparency over their utilization of services. And yet, there is constant downward pressure on reimbursement rates for physician services from governmental and commercial payers. While the DCMA continues to fight for our members, reform of the system through legislative and regulatory pressure has admittedly been difficult. Success in those venues is never certain given the influence of other stakeholders. This reality has led the DCMA to pursue programs that we can control and tools to help physicians reform care delivery where they can. Just over a year ago, the DCMA announced a strategic partnership with FBMC and Physicians Health Benefits to create a self-funded health insurance platform for our physician members. The short-term goals of the program were to provide transparency , accountability and premium control for our physician practices that provide health insurance to their employees. The long-term goal is to encourage more of our members, as well as other organiza- tions and businesses in the community , to consider similar platforms that provide claims transparency , lower administrative costs, the ability to keep your excess premium, and bring down out-of-pocket costs for employees that utilize services strategically . Since its launch, there have been many lessons learned and the program has morphed considerably . But the success we are having in reaching those goals with our current par-ticipants is extremely encouraging. It seems like there might be a way after all for physicians to take back a little bit of control in the health care system. Reach out to the DCMA if you are interested in learn-ing more.

Box 19268 Plantation FL 33318 We are in the throes of change in healthcare. I found an article written many years ago that was future facing and spoke to some changes that we were supposed to be seeing in healthcare. Things like a vaccine against the common cold (2009), human cloning (2009), genetic therapy (2014), most diseases treated at home (2020) and, by 2030, cancer, and heart disease will be wiped out. I am not sure about most of these predictions, but some almost came true! That got me to thinking, \"what are futurists saying is the updated vision of the future of healthcare?\" Let's take a few minutes and see. The University of California San Francisco sees in the year 2050 game-changing predictions that include universal healthcare for all Americans, a pill to treat obesity , oral male contraceptives, lab-grown organs, AIDS eradication, and interoperability solved (yes, in 2050). Unfortunately , pandemics wiping out millions and superbugs proliferating are also in their future. While I hope I am still here in 2050 and enjoying all the benefits of this new med- ical reality , let's look a little closer to home, say , 2030. I am much more comfortable with these predictions as I can see a clear path to them coming true. Wearable technology measuring bodily functions becomes more generally avail- able and more affordable. Look at the number of people who already wear wrist-watches (1 in 3) that monitor several body functions. The current number of add-ons to your smart phones that allow you to do more advanced at-home monitoring. In the near future, these devices will also routinely monitor body temperature and blood oxygen levels. Genetic testing and genomic profiling will be widely used to identify inherited mutations and the genomic profiling will be looking for things that you picked up along the way that have nothing to do with your heredity . Telehealth, I will say no more. The COVID-19 pandemic has identified the need for us to continue to refine how healthcare can be delivered virtually . All these devices are collecting information and we are going to learn how to use it to our commu-nity advantage. How to improve treatment meth-ods, how to alert the general community about health risks, these benefits are all coming. Finally , the ultimate benefit of all this technology and data analysis is an improvement in health outcome. With better data and analysis, treatments modalities will be more indi-vidually prescribed with the additional benefit of making healthcare more cost effective (best treatment modalities the first time). I saw another article that was \"on the edge\" but is likely going to be in our George Jetson future (Google it). It said, \"A microscopic robot is implanted inside your daughter at birth. Whenever an illness begins, before she feels a symptom, it sends alerts to you and her doctor. Immediately the doctor pre-scribes genome-based drug therapies concocted for her biology and sends the medication to you by drone. Your health is also monitored by sensory equipment connected to remote specialists. Before you can feel a cancer symptom or travel to a distant hospital for a CT scan or MRI, nanobots collect tissue samples, replace damaged cells with healthy cells and absorb any toxins in your blood. Even your elderly father with Parkinson's no longer needs to be taken to his neurolo-gist's office; internal nanobots discharge dopamine in a specific location in his brain.\" Say it is so! Jaime CaldwellA message from our President Dreaming 12 January 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsMedicare eligibles have two coverage options - Original Medicare whose cover- ages are called Part A, B, C and D or Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare Part C). Individual needs drive the best option choice that must be evaluated annually . Newly Eligible Enrollees The most common Medicare eligibility factor is the 65th birthday . For newly eli-gible individuals, decision angst is reduced. 1. New enrollees have seven months to enroll. The Medicare Advantage plan option may be selected three months before the birthday month through three months after the birthday month. 2. If a Medicare Advantage plan is selected, the individual can during any time in the next 12 months revert to original Medicare coverage without waiting a full year for the next annual enrollment period. Existing Medicare Enrollees Existing Medicare enrollees can review their health plan benefits at least every year. Changing Medicare benefit coverage requires a decision between October 15th and December 7th - The Medicare Annual Enrollment Period or the Annual Election Period (AEP). 1 During the AEP , a Medicare eligible enrolled in Medicare Part A and B can: \u0081 Switch from Medicare Advantage back to original Medicare coverage. \u0081 If enrolled in original Medicare, the enrollee can add a Medicare supplement plan. These plans only apply in conjunction with those enrolled in Original Medicare and are provided by private insurers. \u0081 Disenroll from original Medicare and enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. \u0081 Switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another. \u0081 Enroll in a Part D prescription drug plan or change from one Part D prescription drug plan to another. \u0081 If enrolled in Original Medicare and supplemental benefits, switch or cancel Medicare dental and vision plans. Supplemental benefit plans are provided by private insurers and there is a premium involved. Individuals Enrolled in and Keeping an Advantage Plan For individuals enrolled in and keeping an Advantage Plan, the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (OEP) runs annually between January 1 and March 31. 2 A Medicare eligible can only enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan if they enroll in Medicare Part A and B. For most eligibles the 2022 monthly premium for Part B is $170.60. Usually there is no month-ly Part A premium covering the hospital and facility coverage if an enrollee or spouse paid Medicare taxes for a certain amount of time. People select Medicare Advantage due to lower overall cost of coverage and the simplicity of having a health, prescription, hearing, vision and den-tal benefit under one plan. One payor covers most healthcare expenditures for inpatient and outpatient care, and pharmaceuticals. Advantage Plans also typically cap the insured's maximum-out-of-pocket cost. It's important to verify the plan network includes: \u0081 Preferred doctors and hospitals and Centers of Excellence that treat illness. \u0081 Preferred provider's referral options. \u0081 Access to the right providers in the right setting at the right time. Beware most managed care organizations may offer narrow provider network options and/or impose restrictions to access to reduce cost. The most popular Advantage Plans belong to Humana (35%) and United Health Group (22%) 3; they dominate the South Florida market. Advantage Plan versus orig- inal Medicare penetration varies markedly by county: Miami-Dade County (74%) is highly penetrated (74%) followed by Broward (62%), and Palm Beach County (44%). Original Medicare The benefit of original Medicare is freedom of provider choice anywhere in the U.S. Many South Floridians are 'snowbirds' and or reside in multiple geographies so orig-inal Medicare with a Medicare Supplement can make sense for this cohort. Nationally 93% of primary care doctors accept Medicare, but only 70% accept new patients. 4 Consequently it is very important to confirm the physician who resolves most of an individual's health issues accepts Medicare. For people desiring comprehensive health insurance coverage and minimal finan- cial risk, Original Medicare necessitates multiple policies; some are government spon-sored and some are private entity offerings. Consider: \u0081 Original Medicare Part A covers hospital stays, limited skilled nursing facility/ rehabilitation (SNF) care, hospice care and limited home care services. Most people with Medicare Part A also purchase Part B which covers diagnostic and preventive services such as wellness checkups, vaccinations and colonoscopies. \u0081 Medicare pays for only a portion of inpatient and outpatient services. Insureds need a supplemental policy that covers the \"gaps\" under Medicare Parts A & B. Medigap policies are standardized, and named by letters, Plans A-N. The challenge is picking the right plan benefits based on individual needs. \u0081 Medicare doesn't cover prescription drug costs. Individuals must investigate Part D plans in select geographies that have varying prices for pharmaceuticals in their for-mularies. This contrasts to Medicare Advantage plans that offer Part D under the same single premium that includes Part A and Part B services. What's Next Answering the question, \"What is the most important reason for obtaining health care benefits?\" supports making the right Medicare option selection. Medicare eligible can do their own homework on the Medicare.gov website or use an insurance profes-sional. Insurance professionals put top priorities into perspective and save research time on selecting Medicare health and drug plans, identifying participating Medicare doc-tors/other providers, and determining the quality ratings of Medicare Advantage plans.

Although Plantation General had provided outstanding medical care to central Broward residents for more than 50 years, the time had come to tran-sition to a state-of-the-art hospital six miles away . That day , HCA Florida Healthcare wel- comed the first patients to its brand-new HCA Florida University Hospital in Davie. The $360-million facility on University Drive, adjacent to Nova Southeastern University , offers the best of both worlds to South Floridians: a world-class medical facility combined with a unique concierge approach to healthcare. The lights of police-escorted emer- gency vehicles illuminated the streets as these healthcare professionals success-fully met the challenge of transferring every patient from Plantation General to HCA Florida University Hospital safely and without interruption in care. It was no easy task, but one the staff had prepared for over many months. With a communications team ready to transition operations at each hospital, the process was akin to a symphony , carefully orchestrated to execute each patient's transfer flawlessly . \"During our transition, our number one goal was to make the process as seamless as possible for our patients,\" said Madeline Nava, Chief Executive Officer of HCA Florida University Hospital. \"Fortunately , we were able to rely on careful planning and training to transfer all the patients quickly and with great success.\" With 600 physicians, HCA Florida University Hospital has plenty of room to grow. It starts with 165 beds, but can expand to 600 based on the community's needs. The hospital offers maternity , Level III NICU, orthopedics, oncology , neuroscience, diagnostic services, imag-ing, and more. \"HCA Healthcare built this hospital with intuitive technology and a thought-ful layout, allowing our staff to provide care with speed and quality ,\" said Kristin Hinsley , Chief Operating Officer of HCA Florida University Hospital. \"Everything from the placement of elevators to the concierge on each floor.\" The 330,000-square-foot multispecial- ty facility is equipped with the latest technology in order to offer a full range of robotic and minimally invasive surgi-cal services and the best acute patient care in the area. The hospital boasts the newest avail- able CT, MRI, and mammography imag-ing, a newborn footprint identification system for every baby , smart beds, and high-tech neonatal intensive care moni-tors - just some of the features that make HCA Florida University Hospital \"the hospital of the future.\" The surgical floor includes a multimil- lion-dollar robotic surgical system pro-viding surgeons with 3D high-definition views with zoom 10 times greater than the human eye. This ultramodern surgi-cal assistant will enable surgeons to make smaller incisions and maneuver the tiny instruments with smooth preci-sion and greater range of motion. This will all combine to help patients recover faster and feel less pain than traditional surgeries. To elevate the patient experience, the adult inpatient unit features 80 private patient rooms equipped with smart TVs. These TVs not only provide extra com-fort but also help care teams communi-cate with patients by displaying sched-ules, goals, pain levels, and provider information.

Jessica Miller 14 January 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsONCOLOGY UPDATE in South Florida ...ONCOLOGY UPDATE in South Florida BY GEORGI PIPKIN Thanks to the collabo- ration of physician scien-tists, patients with blood cancers are benefitting from rapidly evolving research, advances in immunotherapy and tar-geted molecular therapy . When some of the nation's top experts gather in January at the Third Miami Cancer Institute Summit of the Americas on Immunotherapies for Hematologic Malignancies, it's with the knowledge that sharing their findings will lead to even more options at the bedside. Some 186,400 people in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and other blood cancers this year, according to the American Cancer Society . Thousands more are already in treatment. \"The speed at which the field is advancing is very encouraging,\" said symposium director Guenther Koehne, M.D., Ph.D., deputy director and chief of Blood & Marrow Transplant and Hematologic Oncology at Miami Cancer Institute, a part of Baptist Health. \"But to maintain our forward progress we must not do our research in silos. We must share so that we can build upon what we have learned.\" The in-person program, Jan. 21 and 22, features a powerhouse faculty that includes physicians from Memorial Sloan Kettering, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Columbia University's Herbert Irving Compre - hensive Cancer Center, the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania and other leading institu-tions. Approximately 300 physicians and other healthcare providers attended last year's virtual Summit. Dr. Koehne came to Baptist Health's Miami Cancer Institute from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where in 1973, the world's first suc-cessful allogeneic transplant was per-formed. A pioneer in allogeneic stem cell transplantation and immunotherapies, Dr. Koehne believes the Summit offers a unique opportunity particularly for oncologists, hematologists, pharmacists, oncology nurses and other specialists to hear directly from those responsible for treatment breakthroughs. \"Treatments are becoming more sophisticated and every day we are learn-ing more about how to target treatment to the individual,\" he said. \"By dis-cussing the most recent research, we move science forward, ultimately offer-ing more options to patients and improv-ing their outcomes.\" Among the symposium topics are advances in immunologically and molec-ular based system therapies, new targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia, the role and timing of hematopoietic cell transplantation and the latest on CAR cell therapies. Miami Cancer Institute's Blood and Marrow Transplantation program was launched in July of 2019. It hit the 100-patient milestone in just 18 months. In addition, in July of 2020, as the program continued to expand, Hope Tower opened on the Baptist Hospital campus, adjacent to the Institute. With 39 private rooms on 6 Hope and 45 private rooms on 5 Hope dedicated tor bone marrow and immunotherapy patients, the new facility gives patients who face lengthy hospital stays because of their compro-mised immune systems a spacious accommodation that includes a refrigera-tor, microwave, large bathroom and even room to exercise. At the Summit, Dr. Koehne will share his research and the Institute's experi-ence.

Based on evidence from pivotal, clinical trials in which colleagues at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center par-ticipated and from what we've seen since Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy was FDA approved for wide-spread use, the treatment is a game-chang-er for patients with B-cell acute lym-phoblastic leukemia, aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and multiple myeloma patients that have relapsed after multiple lines of conventional treatments. CAR-T therapy involves harvesting a patient's T cells from blood and genetically altering them to produce synthetic mole-cules on the surface of these cells called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that better equip them to fight these cancers. The modified cells are introduced to the body through a blood transfusion, with the CARs enabling the T cells to recognize and attach to a specific protein in the membrane of tumor cells and kill them while minimizing damage to healthy cells. We've traditionally treated blood can- cers with chemotherapy and antibodies and while those are still important pieces of the puzzle, having this new treatment option is important for several reasons. In addition to being less toxic than some of the aggressive treatments used to cure blood cancer in patients that have relapsed (i.e. stem cell transplantation), it can be effective in cases where the patient's body no longer responds to classic chemothera-py drug combinations. In those situations, picture the cancer cells being bulletproof to traditional chemotherapy , enabling them to continue to reproduce. These cancers can also hide from the patient's immune system (i.e. normal T-cell), which would normally get rid of these abnormal cells. But now we've introduced CAR-T and the tumor cells haven't yet figured out this new opponent, so they're not able to camouflage from them. In the best-case scenario, the cancer cells are powerless to prevent the attach-ment, especially since the CAR-T cells bring the rest of the immune system with them to the battle. Strategic Partnership Much of what we're accomplishing locally is the result of an alliance formed in 2017 between the Tampa-based H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and South Florida's Memorial Healthcare System. At that time, the two healthcare organizations created a malignant hematology & cellular therapy program on the campus of Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines. Today , it is the is the only facility in Broward and Palm Beach counties currently offering CAR-T as a treatment for Acute lym-phoblastic leukemia, Diffuse large lymphoma, Mantle mediastinal lymphoma with different CAR-T cell products. In 2022, we are looking to expand the CAR-T cell ther-apy services to patients with multiple myeloma and offer CAR-T clinical trials in part-nership with Moffitt. First Patient in Broward County The best news is the dramatic effect the immunotherapy has had for our patients. Leticia Lopez, a former Plantation resident now living in Henderson, Nevada, had struggled with Diffuse Large B cell lym-phoma since 2007. Multiple rounds of chemotherapy , radiation and even autolo-gous stem cell transplant would keep the disease at bay for periods during the last decade and half, only to have it return each time. Last June, she returned to South Florida for a pet scan to confirm what she already suspected: the unrelent-ing feeling that something was stuck in her throat was indeed the return of cancer. It was then, at 74-years-old, Leticia decided she would live out her remaining days as best as could, unwilling to subject herself to the side effects and collateral damage additional, extended rounds of chemotherapy would cause. Favorable Prognosis Timing, however, was finally on Leticia's side. CAR-T cell therapy had recently been approved and she was a candidate we thought would benefit from the approach. In late September Leticia chose to undergo the procedure, having her blood drawn so that the T cells could be reengineered and then reintroduced into her body with the weaponry to successfully attack cancer cells. I'm excited to report that the tumor near the base of Leticia's neck is gone and within recent weeks she reported feeling \"like nothing had happened.\" T wo subse-quent scans were clean, showing no signs of the disease. Our girl is cancer-free, and with tremendous optimism that this time it's for good! CAR-T cell therapy changed the trajec- tory of Leticia's life and we're seeing it have similar results for other patients as well. If you or someone you know has one of the blood cancers listed above, I urge you to learn more about this new form of immunotherapy by calling (954) 265-4325 or visiting our website at https://mof-fitt.org/treatments/immunotherapy/cellu-lar-immunotherapy/car-t-therapy/ to begin the process of determining whether CAR-T may be a treatment option.

Sylvester's scientists also achieve research breakthroughs in their laborato-ries, leading to better understanding of the genetic, environmental, and metabolic fac-tors that drive the growth of cancer cells and could provide targets for new thera-pies. \"This type of translational research is the cornerstone of our comprehensive approach to cancer,\" says Nimer. \"Through the years, we have built one of the best cancer epigenetic programs in the world. We also have phenomenal pro-grams in fields like stem cell transplanta-tion, sarcomas and hematologic malignan-cies or blood cancers.\" Today , Sylvester has more than 300 can- cer-focused physicians and researchers, including more than 200 cancer experts recruited from the nation's top cancer institutions over the past decade. Dr. Nimer points to Sylvester's culture of excellence, innovation, and compassionate patient care as keys to the center's recruit-ment strategy . \"We have a phenomenal culture of teamwork here that includes collaboration across medical disciplines as well as incredible community outreach and engagement\" says Dr. Nimer. \"As an up-and-coming cancer center, we have mod-eled Sylvester as a startup. As a result, we have recruited professionals from all over the country who are excited to be a part of our growth. After all, we support innova-tive approaches to all aspects of cancer care, creating a buzz that attracts talented people of all levels of experience.\" Dr. Nimer adds that Sylvester's support- ive atmosphere includes medical, nursing and other healthcare professionals, as well as patients and families. \"I think everyone here will tell you how positive the atmos-phere is,\" he says. \"It's not easy to be a can-cer specialist for your entire career, and deal with life-or-death situations, so we try to take care of our people in all regards.\" Multidisciplinary collaboration is anoth- er distinctive aspect of Sylvester's compre-hensive cancer care including research, clinical and educational initiatives from areas as diverse as music, engineering, marine species and computer science. \"We also have collaborative programs with cancer specialists in more than 15 dif-ferent countries,\" adds Dr. Nimer. \"We offer training programs for professionals to help them address cancer challenges in their own countries. That's a vital part of our mission.\" Recognizing the center's focus on addressing inequities in cancer care, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently designated Sylvester as the first WHO Collaborating Centre for Cervical Cancer Elimination.

They take notes and go through a system. Most EHRs don't follow that type of system so it forces the doctor to do patient encounters differently than they were trained or used to, or that just comes naturally to them. With the advanced technology that we have, doctors should be able to have up-to-date and very accurate information at their fin-gertips on any given patient and be able to maneuver around very quickly . iCare has basically taken the clunkiness out of the elec-tronic health record system and made it more intuitive.\" There are several primary benefits of iCare's EHR system, according to Kesti. \"It's ease of use, the ease of learning how to use it, and so very little or limited training time needed,\" he says. \"There's also very little implementation which is key when you ask a physician to switch their system. The iCare system takes the physician's data and populates it into the right locations and spots. So it takes away that headache of changing.\" iCare is also reliable. It leverages secure and innovative cloud environments, available to give users peace of mind. It's also affordable. In fact, it costs less to operate than any solution on the market. \"Another great benefit is that it's universal,\" explains Kesti. \"It can be used for all different areas, from a large hospital to a multi-practice to a small practice, and in different departments in the hospital. It can cover a broad range of disciplines as well. For example, cardiologists can use it because they can easily adapt these. They have templates that they can pick from that are car-diac specific and then they can adapt them to what they want.\" Healthcare providers should be reviewing their EHR systems on a regular basis, notes Kesti. \"You should be reviewing your EHR every six to twelve months to make sure different factors are being met,\" he says. If you've had your system for more than three years, you should assess it. You should take a look at what else is out there if it's not meeting your needs. Most EHRs do update themselves. It's like your phone or laptop. When do you know when you need a new laptop? You can't wait until it stops working. You're always assessing it to make sure your needs are met. Can you imagine, if you're in a hospital and your EHR stops working? You can't wait until it stops working, but before it even starts getting slow , it's probably a sign that you need an upgrade or a new system.\" For more information, visit www.icare.com.

Originally from New York, Kavall said, \"I've always been an entrepreneur, and I knew that when I came to Florida I want-ed to focus on health, wellness, and indi-vidualized care for people. It's always been my mission and vision to create something that is personalized, some-thing where we're delivering superior attention to our clients based on their needs, not just in the health care realm, but also holistically , physically , emotion-ally - all different aspects of wellness.\" This personalized care is offered by a team of approximately 15 nurses, all highly educated and qualified, who visit people in their homes, whether for a one-time visit or for ongoing care. \"The clients don't have to go anywhere! It's a benefit leading to our customers staying away from getting exposed, while they remain in the comfort of their own home. It is a concierge service that pro-vides consistency and comfort without any inconvenience.\" After hearing consistent requests, Quality Health Care Concierge expanded into COVID Testing, but once again, in the comfort of the individual's home. COVID testing is now a large portion of the business, as many travelers are head-ing overseas. Kavall said, \"We have found that a lot of people are traveling internationally , and a number of large corporations are mandating their employees be tested; but nobody wants to go to urgent care, nobody wants to stand in long lines at test centers.\" In those instances, a nurse is sent to the person's home or designated location to perform a non-invasive test. \"Our team can guarantee results the same day , oftentimes within just a few hours, and we work with multiple CLIA Certified Laboratories. It's ideal for international travel because they're usually in a time crunch, with most people having 24 to 72 hours to get to their destination. But for others, it's the peace of mind that a professional is able to help them without needing to leave the comfort of their home or hotel.\" Kavall said the rapid response time is part of the quality offered by the compa-ny . The response is always same-day , as the team is hyper-responsive to get folks the appointment they need. Phone lines operate 24/7, meaning customer service is always accessible via call or text mes-saging, so a customer who may be busy in a meeting can send a text to schedule their same-day appointment. \"We're real-ly on top of it to make sure everybody gets what they need, and especially when they need it. We take pride in our repu-tation, making our process seamless and very simple.\" The coverage area includes all of Southeast Florida, and Kavall said they have even been to Florida's Gulf Coast. She said, \"Quality Health Care often-times has high-end clients who prefer to continue about their day without any inconvenience. They want to know that a registered nurse will be there without skipping a beat.\" Kavall is expecting business to increase in January as President Biden has mandated that all companies with more than 100 employees have everyone tested who is not vaccinated. She said Quality Health Care Concierge already has large corporate contracts where nurs-es are sent to corporations for weekly testing. \"We get the test done very dis-creetly , and we make it very comfortable. Privacy and compliance are top priority .\" She added, \"I take quality into consid- eration, that's so important to me. I have my hands in every detail, every day , to make sure we're producing the right kind of quality service. As you can imagine, that's one of the reasons why I named the company Quality Health Care Con - cierge.\" In 2022, Kavall is expanding Quality Health Care Concierge to provide at-home IV Therapy , Mobile Phlebotomy , Remote Telemedicine, Holistic Care Support, and multiple other services to further the concierge experience.

Quality Health Care Concierge Expands to Help Ease COVID T esting Michelle Kavall MEDICAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 24 January 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital Newsvisits and remote patient monitoring had limited acceptance with only a 1% mar-ket share. However, when the pandemic further contributed to staffing shortages and professional stress and burnout, it fortified the entrepreneurial spirit of WITHmyDOC to provide new method-ologies and remote resources for physi-cians and patients. \"Now , the increased education and improved reimbursement guidelines have given remote patient monitoring more traction and physician acceptance which results in a greater opportunity for remote patient care,\" he said. With the extreme nursing shortages caused by expansion of lucrative oppor-tunities for travel nurses; and heightened physician burnout rates due to intense hospital-based monitoring of COVID patients; along with the COVID fear trend of patients postponing office visits; there was a need for an alternate business strategy for physician practices to pro-vide quality care to patients. Patients have many reasons for not mak- ing it to the office from transportation issues to childcare responsibilities, or job and low-income constraints. Virtual mon-itoring can alleviate many of these valid excuses with home monitoring devices and video to provide needed diagnosis and care to patients in their homes, communi-ty settings and other locations particularly as hospitals face the crisis of high occu-pancy due to COVID. RPM@Home\u00ae WITHmyDOC created and launched the RPM@Home\u00ae program which places high value on patient engagement, adop-tion and adherence resulting in improved outcomes. Using artificial intelligence this plat- form helps monitor patients and trans-mits real-time data enabling healthcare providers to review patient biometric data as frequently as needed between office visits, making it easier to detect, diagnose and treat symptoms such as high blood pressure, low oxygen levels, increase/decrease in weight due to med-ications, arrhythmias, high temperature and elevated blood glucose levels. Studies show that incorporating RPM in chronic disease management of patients with co-morbidities can significantly improve patient quality of life by pre-venting complications. RPM@Home\u00ae patients are provided with wireless sensor kits to use at home to electronically record vital signs that are to be monitored. For example, the O2 saturation sensor is a clip the patient puts on his finger to record the oxygen level; an EKG patch is put on the chest and it records tracing of the heart rhythm; the blood pressure monitor wirelessly records systolic and diastolic measures directly into the sys-tem. The kit also includes an 8-inch tablet, which is used to capture and record information into the database. Education and Communication Is Vital However, providing equipment to patients at no cost, without vital educa-tion of and communication with patients regarding the commitment to monitoring their vitals to avoid further deterioration does not promise patient adherence suc-cess. For example, thanks to client feed-back, WITHmyDOC recognized that nurse staffing shortages are creating problems for physicians and so they cre-ated their teams - PEP squad (Patient Engagement Professionals) and MED squad (RN Patient specialists) - to help with the heavy lifting, according to Rodriguez. \"Our PEP squad provides training to ensure confidence, knowledge, and ease of use. They work with patients in their home to introduce RPM and follow-up to assure understanding not only on how to use the equipment itself, but on the importance of consistent transmission of their physiological data to the care team for monitoring. Additionally , our MED Squad specialists are available if a full-service clinical monitoring program is preferred and provides a valuable benefit by easing the burden on physicians,\" he said. WITHmyDOC nurses can provide monitoring of key vitals and simultane-ously encourage patient engagement through regular communications, check-ins and reminders. The MED squad checks the automatic alerts categorized into non-urgent, urgent, and emergent groupings and con-nects with the physician to determine care plans. The staff understands how important it is for patients to become comfortable with the new technology and ease-of-use early on and for physi-cian alerts to be shared in real time. Rodriguez explained that the RPM@Home\u00ae system is not meant to replace traditional office visits. Its pur-pose is to consistently provide more data to physicians to help guide their deci-sion-making, increasing proactive inter-vention to reduce costly ER visits that are a financial burden on our health and sat-isfy reimbursement guidelines. Providers can increase their care footprint through the use of RPM, relieving their time stress and yielding more job satisfaction. Improved Care for Vulnerable Populations Additionally , the American Rescue Plan and the FCC COVID-19 Telehealth program now allows Community Health Centers to use federal grant funding for telehealth and RPM services specifically for the vulnerable under-insured and uninsured communities who otherwise often forego care due to lack of trans-portation, inability to find a doctor or lack of time to seek primary care due to physical challenges, home childcare responsibilities and/or job hour limita-tions. Care is postponed until it is urgent and often at a higher cost and more omi-nous to recuperation. Rodriguez summarized, \"RPM@Home\u00ae kit offers many advantages u sing the latest breakthroughs in medical technology to monitor chronically ill patients that typi-cally require more attention. Proactively reducing ER visits and readmissions min-imizes emergent situations which could help to alleviate provider burnout. The platform allows providers to receive real-time patient information to quickly and efficiently review a large number of mon-itored patients. Its reporting functionali-ty also facilitates billing.\" \"By using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics, this user-friendly , end-to-end, web-based intelligence sys-tem is designed for success, and is here to stay ,\" he predicts.

Located in a desired section of Jupiter known as Abacoa, the 48,941-square-foot facility will be across the street to the south of Rendina's headquarters on approximately 5 acres of land. The hospital will be fully leased and operated by PAM Health (\"PAM\"), an industry leading operator of physical rehabilitation and specialty hospitals across the country . The hospital will serve patients in the Palm Beach and Martin County regions by offer- ing inpatient and outpatient programs, a procedure room, pharmacy , physical therapy , occupational therapy and speech therapy . Once open and operating, PAM will employ over 100 full-time and 60 part-time employees at this location. A thorough study of the market, including a bed need analysis, was used to identify the ideal location for the new hospital. \"PAM Health will use the new location to address a gap in market,\" said Richard M. Rendina, Chairman and CEO of Rendina. \"Not only is this Rendina's first inpatient reha-bilitation project, but an opportunity to address a growing need in our own backyard by providing our community rehabilitation services from the best operator in this space.\" Astrea CEO Erik de Vries and President Richard Fiske have a successful track record developing similar facilities and brought the opportunity to Rendina in 2020. Richard Fiske is a longtime member of Rendina's Advisory Board. \"We are thrilled to partner with Rendina and PAM Health to deliver this state-of-the- art physical rehabilitation hospital that will provide high quality care to the community and serve an unmet need,\" said Richard Fiske, President of Astrea. The hospital is expected to open in Q4 of 2022. First Hospital Based Focused Ultrasound Incisionless Procedure for Parkinson's & Essential T remors in the Region Takes Place at Delray Medical Center Delray Medical Center is now the first hospital in the region to treat a patient with the new MR-guided focused ultrasound by INSIGHTEC. This technology is a scalpel-free treatment for essential tremor and medication-refractory tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease. This device uses sound wave energy to treat brain tissue as the source of the tremor and there is no surgical incision or anesthesia necessary . The MR-guided focused ultrasound combines two technologies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which pinpoints the exact location in the brain responsible for the tremor, and ultrasound, which precisely delivers over 1,000 highly focused beams of acoustic energy at that exact location without damaging any surrounding brain tissue. Some of the benefits to this technology include: \u0081 No surgical incisions resulting in reduced risk of infection. \u0081 Quicker recovery time with no surgical incision, allowing a return to daily activities within days. \u0081 Performed as an outpatient procedure - most patients go home within 23 hours. \u0081 Immediate and significant reduction in hand tremors. \u0081 Treatment has minimum side effects. Palm Beach Health Network Increases Ease of Access to Its Services with a New T enet T ransfer Center The Palm Beach Health Network announces the formation of the new Tenet Transfer Center.

It is staffed 24/7 by registered nurses and clinicians trained in crit-ical care and emergency medicine, and they are well-versed on the Palm Beach Health Network's services and departments. \"The goal of our new transfer center is to provide a seamless experience for the patient, provider or sending-facility , and make access to our comprehensive services easier, while getting patients to the facility that can best accommodate their needs,\" said Maggie Gill, chief executive officer of the Palm Beach Health Network and Delray Medical Center. \"The Palm Beach Health Network offers the highest-level of care within Palm Beach County , along with a wide array of service lines and technology , and this convenient option will allow clinicians get their patients into our system with ease.\" Some of the capabilities of the transfer center include: \u0081 Responsive and single point of access-no phone transfers between departments and holds; faster connection to on-call clinical specialists who understand your patients' needs. \u0081 Predictable and efficient patient transfers facilitated by an experienced RN staff. \u0081 Efficient delivery of pertinent clinical documentation. \u0081 Enhanced care coordination and timely follow-up regarding patient disposition. \u0081 Access to high-quality services at hospitals that can provide the appropriate level of care. \u0081 Increased reporting to provide transparency on completed patient transfers. \u0081 COVID-Safe standards in place for the safety of patients and visitors. \u0081 Continued expansion of services to meet patients' needs. Health Care District Opens New T esting Site The Health Care District of Palm Beach County announced a new COVID-19 testing site opening in Belle Glade. The District's mobile health clinic will provide rapid antigen testing while stationed outside the county's only public hospital, Lakeside Medical Center, located at 39200 Hooker Highway . \"As the Omicron variant becomes more dominant and COVID-19 hospitalizations continue to rise across the state, the Health Care District wants to enhance testing during the holidays to help take pressure off the Emergency Room in Belle Glade,\" said Belma Andri , M.D., MPH, Chief Medical Officer at the District. \"We'll be providing people with testing and if needed, treatment, thanks to AMR.\" American Medical Response (AMR) will be onsite providing Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment to patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and meet the criteria to receive it. No appointment is needed and walk-ups are welcome. Eliza and Hugh Culverhouse Jr. Make $1 Million Donation to the Desai Sethi Urology Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine As a display of immense gratitude, Eliza and Hugh Culverhouse Jr., have made an extraordinary $1 million donation to further the Desai Sethi Urology Institute at the University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine as a global leader in the field of urology . The gift is in honor of Dipen J. Parekh, M.D., the chief operating officer at the University of Miami Health System, executive dean for clinical affairs, founding director of the Desai Sethi Urology Institute at the Miller School, and the Victor A. Politano, M.D. Endowed Chair in Urology . Parekh is one of the world's most experienced robotic sur-geons in urologic oncology and is the founding director of the new Urology Institute. Hugh Culverhouse, a successful South Florida attorney and businessman, witnessed Dr. Parekh's expertise firsthand in March of 2020. \"My prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level started skyrocketing and I have a family his- tory of prostate cancer,\" said Culverhouse. \"Dr. Parekh was extremely sensitive in explaining to me why my prostate needed to be removed.\" After a successful surgery and an ideal recovery , \"the outcome has been nothing short of incredible. I have quickly regained control of my urinary functions. Everything I was afraid I would lose, I did not,\" said Culverhouse. \"I live without the fear of dying in the same manner as my father and grandfather. A life without fear is precious.\" The Culverhouse's extraordinary generosity will help in the establishment of a premier Urology Institute within the Miller School, which will accelerate breakthrough advances in research and expand clinical care.What's New...

Usually they're able to do quite well, they really excel.\" The PA class began in January 2021 and the AA followed in September, and both programs have proved to be good additions to the univer-sity . Dr. Schugar said the PA field is very com-petitive, and as a brand new program, it received more than 1,500 applications for the initial 40 cohort spaces. She said the program increased the class size to 50 the second year, and for accrediting purposes it must remain at that size for several years; but the number of applications increased to 2,200 for those 50 spots. Dr. Nguyen added that \"the students from that class are from all over the United States. It's a very sought after field of study .\" One reason, according to Dr. Schugar, is that the field offers numerous opportunities. \"Unlike nurse practitioners, physician assis-tants get trained in all disciplines of medicine - emergency , women's health, pediatric - and they do their clinical experiences in all those areas. So they're well-rounded and are able to fit in almost anywhere.\" The PA program runs for 27 months, while the AA program is 29 months. The length is necessary because of the heavy clinical experi-ence required by the accrediting body . Additionally , all students are required to go to campus for their studies and their labs, which will be done face-to-face. Jeff Carroll, program director for the AA pro- gram, said, \"Our accrediting body requires 2,000 clinical hours in their training. With our previous numbers at South University , we're well over 2,500.\" The number of hours required is one reason for the nine-quarter for-mat. Carroll also pointed out that the AA program has an affiliation with the University of Florida's College of Medicine in the Department of Anesthesiology . \"Their program is one of the best in the country , with all of the resources they have, so we partner with them to use those resources for our anesthesiology training. We're very proud to have that type of resource.\" Before finalizing the new programs, advice was sought from PACs - program advisory committees - that are made up of area profes-sionals, both clinical and faculty . Dr. Schugar said, \"We meet with the PACs about every other quarter, especially now while we're grow-ing the program, because we want to get input on certain things about the curriculum - what's necessary , or if there are any deficits that we need to correct.\" Dr. Nguyen said, \"One of the strong points of the programs is we partner with community health care providers, and one sign of a quality PA program is to have strong clinical affilia-tions to give our students hands-on training that's essential from quality hospitals and clin-ics.\" Dr. Ilaria Gadalla, Physician Assistant Department Chair and Interim Assistant Dean for the College of Health Professions, and Dr. Jeffrey Bishop, medical director for the PA pro-gram, are well-known practicing physicians from the community , and Dr. Schugar said, \"Because of them and their connections, we have been able to secure more than adequate clinical rotation for our students, which is something most programs are really struggling to do right now.\" Dr. Nguyen added, \"Our stu-dents are very privileged to have them involved in our curriculum design and construction, and to receive training from seasoned PAs and physicians.\" For more information, call (561) 273-6500 or visit www.southuniversity.edu/west-palm-beach.

National nonprofit, the Leapfrog Group, has recognized Jupiter Medical Center with its Top Hospital Award, one of the most competitive distinctions that hospitals can receive. Only 46 hospitals in the nation have been designated as Top Hospitals. This award comes just three weeks after Jupiter Medical Center earned its seventh consecutive Leapfrog \"A\" Hospital Safety Grade for achieving the highest standards in safety . Jupiter Medical Center was the only hospital in the region awarded with seven consecutive \"A\" grades.

The new program will allow children who have neurological conditions which require surgery to receive that high level of care at Golisano Children's Hospital instead of traveling outside of the area to larger cities, like Miami or St. Petersburg. \"We are so proud to be able to offer this service to the children and families in our community ,\" said Alyssa Bostwick, chief nurse executive and vice president of operations at Golisano Children's Hospital. \"There is a huge need in our region for pediatric neuro-surgery , and more importantly , it's growing every year. Due to the population growth in Southwest Florida, and younger families moving to the area, we're seeing more and more children who need our services. This neurosurgery program, in affiliation with Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, has been two years in the making and we know it will have a major impact.\" The affiliation with Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital began in 2019 when the two organizations entered into an agreement to expand care for kids across Florida's west coast by working togeth-er to deliver the highest quality care, leverage resources and create better value for families. Through the affiliation, the two children's hospitals collaborate in several ways, including pediatric research studies and protocols, telehealth counseling and consultations, educational conferences, and the recruitment of a dedicated pediatric neurosurgeon to be based out of Golisano Children's Hospital. Through the extensive recruiting process, Dr. Theodore Spinks, a pediatric neurosurgeon with more than 15 years of experience, has been chosen to lead the neurosurgery program at Golisano Children's Hospital. He recently joined the team and has already performed several surgeries, allowing families to stay in Southwest Florida to receive this high level of care. Subscribe to...

The White, Stanton and Hersey appoint- ments follow the Company's October 1, 2021, closing of the acquisition of Harvest Health and Recreation Inc. (\"Harvest\"). \"We are thrilled to officially announce the appointment of several members of the legacy Harvest team to key roles within our organization,\" said Kim Rivers, Trulieve's Chief Executive Officer. \"The addition of talent and experienced leader-ship was a key component of the Harvest acquisition and further advances our strat-egy of expansion through the addition of regional assets and teams within our hub model. We also are adding to our leader-ship team as the company continues to experience significant growth.\" These leaders deliver a breadth of expe- rience from multiple industries to Trulieve's leadership team: Steve White, President - Mr. White co- founded Harvest Health & Recreation in 2011 and served as Chief Executive Officer until the acquisition of the compa-ny by Trulieve. As an early pioneer in the U.S. legal cannabis industry , Mr. White led the company as it grew from a single dis-pensary to become one of the top multi-state operators with cultivation, manufac-turing, and retail operations in several markets. Mr. White spearheaded one of the industry's most successful license application teams, paving the way for rapid growth through organic license awards and capital efficient expansion. As a former litigator, Steve White successfully navigated the complex patchwork of dif-ferent regulatory regimes across various U.S. markets while advocating for expand-ed access to cannabis for patients and adult use consumers. Steve White serves as a member of the boards of the Arizona Dispensary Association and charitable organization Harvesting Hope. Mr. White graduated from Arizona State University Honors College summa cum laude with a B.S. in Political Science and earned a Juris Doctorate from Washington & Lee University , School of Law. Nicole Stanton, Vice President and General Counsel - Ms. Stanton served as Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Harvest since 2019, oversee-ing the legal department and compliance program. She received the Public Company General Counsel of the Year award by the Arizona Corporate Counsel in April 2021. That same year, the Harvest legal department was nominated for Legal Department of the Year. Prior to joining Harvest, Ms. Stanton was employed by the national law firm of Quarles & Brady LLP for nearly 20 years. She served as the office managing partner of the firm's Phoenix office from 2013-2018, as well as the firm's assistant general counsel from 2009-2019. While managing partner, she was respon-sible for overseeing more than 100 lawyers and 75 professional legal staff, covering 11 different legal practice areas.

As mentioned, I was impressed with our patient testimonials, yet disturbed to find they have no job protections, lost telehealth for re-certifications, and are subjected to repeated threats of pro-posed THC caps from the Florida legislators. Now I am fighting for my new patients, who are seemingly discriminated against based on their medication. Since joining the Florida Medical Marijuana Physicians Group, I have connected with other like-minded individuals who are advocating for their patients' rights, and together we are ensuring that this field moves forward scientifically and systemat-ically , while protecting our patients' needs and safety . Do you see Florida moving toward recreational cannabis and how will this affect your practice? Yes, eventually I see Florida moving forward with recreational cannabis for adult use in several years. I believe this will benefit those who are unwilling or afraid to access the system medically . I think there will still be a role for medical cannabis for those patients who prefer evidence-based professional guidance, as well as pre-ferred access to medical products (perhaps higher-potency), faster service at the dispensaries, and no taxes. Until then, I can assure that we will continue to advo-cate for expanded patient access to this important medicine, as well as hiring and employment protections for patients, reciprocity for out-of-state card holders to access our system when visiting, no medical THC caps, product safety , patient edu-cation, and telehealth for re-certification of existing patients.

In such cases, statistics may or may not be as important as the bottom line. This in no way minimizes the importance of the information. It simply involves a different process and/or approach and applies the data in a way to meet business-related goals. Is there a connection or a disconnect with such different approaches and perception of cannabis-based research? More than likely the answer to these questions is \"yes\" to both. There is clearly a connection that should occur between research grounded in business as well as research grounded in science. For exam-ple, if medical researchers find a statistical difference in favor of a positive interven-tion using a combination of or an isolate of a cannabinoid, the effective use for patients will only be successfully conveyed and disseminated through effective meas-ures learned through marketing the prod-uct, identifying price points and margins, and ongoing improvements and findings. However, regardless of how good a prod-uct appears to demonstrate positive find-ings, if this is not conveyed in a profession-al business-like manner, it will not reach its potential from either a healthcare or a business perspective. Where the majority of the industry to date has found itself is the polar opposite of what was just described. Though cer-tainly not the case with all cannabis-based companies, many have in fact found suc-cessful business practices based upon their own internal research. The outcome has been positive, some finding greater success than others. However, few of the numer-ous cannabis-based businesses that manu-facture and sell product to consumers have actually conducted the clinical research previously described to the standards expected in the medical and healthcare industry . Additionally , of those that have conducted product efficacy research, the majority have done so in-house. There is truly nothing wrong with this approach, as it does make sense to test one's own prod-uct. In fact, most would argue that it is an essential step that needs to take place to be able to stand behind a product and sell it to a consumer base. However, such findings and any statements claimed from one's own research will be viewed as being biased in opinion from those in the med-ical and healthcare industry . Think about it, have you ever seen a cannabis company put out information that they tested their own product, and it wasn't good? Of course not, so the expectation of any self-published or even just self-promoted \"evi-dence\" will be expected to state nothing but positive claims of one's own product. This is typically referred to having a con-flict of interest - that is, those doing the testing have a financially vested interested in reporting positive results. There is no shortage of business research in the cannabis space. In fact, as noted, many credible companies are performing their own-house product research as it relates to consumer benefits. In fact, some could argue that in a relatively new area of fast-growing interest that ample research already exists. For example, a simple National Library of Medicine search solely using the word \"cannabis\" yields over 27,000 published research articles. However, most healthcare providers do not read where these studies are being published: Plant Science, Molecules, or Nature as a few examples. Some do read journals like Addiction, and slowly more are paying attention to the Journal of Cannabis Research and Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research. It is a process. The area of research that could be served well is continued product research performed by 3rd party , independent testing researchers with results being published in journals that focus and emphasize clinical applica-tion. In particular, journals of specialized areas such a sports medicine, geriatrics, pediatrics, neurology and others would benefit from contemporary cannabis-based findings. Society is at an international tipping point toward its views of cannabis. In some places, scientific research is leading the way . In others, business research is leading the way . Yet in other places, a dis-connect remains that connects the two worlds absent any perceived or real con-flicts of interest. Identifying models that address such concerns will be a key to the future success of any efficacious findings that cannabis intervention may play in the well-being of individuals. Likewise, stud-ies without bias can produce true under-standings of any concerns related to short or long-term adverse effects, unknown drug interactions, and potentially findings that haven't yet even been considered. This is an opportunistic time to define cannabis research in a collaborative way that is inclusive of all those vested in the industry . Private business partnering with research Universities is one reputable method of achieving this goal. It is a process. It takes time, it takes educating, and it requires patience from the begin-ning to the end. The process is something University researchers excel in and are pre-pared for the many hurdles, and often-times one that private business is not pre-pared for. Building teams and working together on realistic timelines, having a solid strategic plan in place, and recogniz-ing funding amounts necessary to achieve study goals are all essential building blocks toward unbiased research. Doing so then allows the findings of studies to be report-ed and presented to all stakeholders in the highest and most professional manner possible. Cannabis research is ripe for ideas, part- nerships, sharing of findings, and product efficacy . Consumer demand will drive apportion of acceptance and reputable research will drive the rest!

This holds true in the case of med-ical marijuana certification and recertifi-cation as well. \"What distinguishes me and my prac- tice is that I'm available, accessible, and I believe it's important to educate people to empower them to make better choic-es,\" said Daphnee Moise-Johnson, M.D., Vivant Medical Group. \"Medical mari-juana is a medicine, and it needs to be treated as such.\" Dr. Moise-Johnson has been an emer- gency room physician for 20 years and opened Vivant Medical Marijuana in Tampa six months ago to provide more a preventative type of care to patients. \"I wanted to get into more functional, integrative medicine to better help peo-ple find answers to their health problems before they find themselves at the ER in the middle of the night,\" she said. While Dr. Moise-Johnson believes strongly in the benefits of medical mari-juana, she wants to ensure that the med- January 2022 Continued on page 352019 Cannabis Business Award's Publication of the Year Kevin M. Hughes, MD Board-certified Pediatrician and Certifying Medical Cannabis Physician All Natural MD What benefits do you see for patients throughout Florida within this space? I have personally witnessed the benefits of cannabis helping both mine and my partner's patients. I honestly did not expect the feedback that I have received. I thought people on chronic opiates or benzodiazepines would always stay on these med-ications, or possibly succumb to them. Instead, I see patients abandoning these harmful medications, as well as unexpected ones such as antidepressants, stimulants for ADHD, gabapentin, sleep aids, and even blood pressure and diabetic medications! Cannabis can help with pain, anxiety , depression, PTSD, OCD, overall mood regulation, sleep, movement disorders, appetite, attention, creativity , weight control, exercise tolerance and recovery , to name several. Because of this program, a patient can now order, by name, a safely cultivated or manufactured cannabis product that has either worked for them before or helped others with similar conditions. What motivates you to be a part of the cannabis industry and how did you get started? I am a board-certified pediatrician and had been working at the same pediatric urgent care center for the past twenty years, a practice that I helped grow from infan-cy , and where I intended to retire. Along came COVID and selfish corporate policies, and I was terminated for trying to keep my patients and staff safe. Naturally , I was devastated to leave my niche after years of service to my patients and my community . After becoming a cannabis patient, I soon started to understand the plant as a med-ication. I immersed myself in research articles and courses to further advance my knowledge and soon joined my current practice, All Natural MD, which has been Dr. Kevin M.

KONIN It is likely a safe assumption that if you are reading this edition of Cannabis News Florida that you take up some space in the cannabis world. Perhaps you come from the business angle, or the agricultural space, possibly analytical chemistry , healthcare, or many others. We make up an extremely diverse group of individuals who collaborate in one shape or another to achieve one of many common goals: understanding, achieving, and dissemi-nating cannabis efficacy . Each of our unique disciplines view \"research\" slightly differently . For exam-ple, in the medical and healthcare profes-sions, we lean toward a commonly and possibly overused term called \"evidence-based\" research. This simply means that to be able to validate that something works, it has undergone the highest levels of clinical studies and has shown a statis-tical significance. We throw out terms such as meta-analysis, systematic reviews, and double-blind clinical trials just to name a few. By contrast, research knowl-edge such as those presented in a case study format, or by an expert opinion, are viewed to represent a lower level of acceptance. Additionally , such studies may be viewed differently if they were per-formed in a lab, on animal models, or pro-posed in theory as compared to human studies.

Millions of people rely on NSAIDs to control symptoms of chronic pain and inflammation, however, NSAIDs come with some risk. Studies have shown they may cause toxi-city to one's liver, kidneys, and upper GI-tract. PrRelf combines powerful flavonoids from Skull Cap and Green Tea to provide extraordinary anti-inflammatory support, while added benefits of Boswellia and T urmeric supercharge the anti-inflamma-tory action. CBG and Delta-8 isolate round out the overall analgesic effects. Unlike NSAIDs that may cause undesirable side effects, PrRelf is a combina-tion of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) ingredients, that have shown no toxicity over periods of long-term use. It is a COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor. PrRelf's convenient form makes it easy to consume, and the Appleberry flavor is derived from organic fruit extract.
