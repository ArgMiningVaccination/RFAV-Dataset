Med Hypotheses ; 171: 111015, Feb. em Ingl\u00eas covidwho-2211143 ABSTRACT [Therapeutic]applications of synthetic [mRNA]were proposed more than 30 years ago, and are currently the basis of one of the [vaccine]platforms used at a massive scale as part of the [public health]strategy to get COVID-19 under control. To date, there are no published studies on the biodistribution, cellular uptake, endosomal escape, translation rates, functional [half-life]and inactivation [kinetics]of synthetic [mRNA], rates and duration of [vaccine]-induced [antigen]expression in different [cell]types. Furthermore, despite the assumption that there is no possibility of genomic integration of [therapeutic]synthetic [mRNA], only one recent study has examined interactions between [vaccine] [mRNA]and the [genome]of transfected [mRNA]entry [reverse transcription]of full length [vaccine] [mRNA]sequences, and nuclear entry. This finding should be a major [safety]concern, given the possibility of synthetic [mRNA]-driven [epigenetic]and genomic modifications arising. We propose that in susceptible individuals, cytosolic clearance of [nucleotide]modified synthetic (nms-mRNAs) is impeded. Sustained [cytoplasm]deregulates activates endogenous [transposable elements](TEs), causing of the [mRNA]copies to be reverse transcribed. The cytosolic accumulation of the [mRNA]and the reverse [RNA]and [DNA]sensory pathways. leads to autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions, while activated TEs increase the [risk]of [insertional mutagenesis]of the reverse transcribed molecules, which vaccines], it is essential and urgent to fully understand the intracellular cascades initiated by cellular uptake of synthetic [mRNA]and the consequences of these molecular events.
