Standards and techniques underlie theNation's modern and distrib- utes standard samples foruse inproduction and research. For Government, theBureau develops methods foracceptance testing of materials inprocurement andhelps devise codes and specifications. In addition, the scientific staff oftheBureau provides technical advice to various scientific andGovernment groups andundertakes alarge variety ofstudies tomeet To perform alltheabove services effectively, theBureau must retain a highly competent staffandmust conduct active andimaginative basic research inallofthe fields ofthephysical sciences, especially assuch research relates totheBureau's sistance wasdeveloped that ismore precise performed thanmost existing techniques.

Plastics research sponsored bytheArmy Ordnance Corps ledtoa practical procedure formass-producing plastic springs from glass fiber- reinforced resin. Untilnow plastic springs havebeen little usedbecause suitable techniques formaking springs ofthetypes needed have been lacking. However, springs formed bythisprocess have canbe molded directly todimensions without developing any considerable internal stress. Their high corrosion resistance should make them of value forapplications inchemical plants andinstallations subject toacid fumes from thestrength- to-weight ratios ofplastics, which areoften higher than those obtained with spring-making metals. Also, thebroad range oftransparent and colored materials that canbeusedmakes striking decorative effects possible. Data Processing Systems. Thisprogram, embracing both digital and analog electronic computers, includes research, development, systems design and analysis, andtechnical advisory services. During thepast yearanincreasing number design ofhigh-speed digital computers. Studies inthisarea aredirected toward more effective means fororganizing electronic components into systems forcarrying outcomputing anddata processing operations. Development ofmore advanced logical systems isexpected tomake possible considerable increases inover-all speed andcomputing power without corresponding increases intheperformance require- oftheelectronic components. Thus far,improved designs have resulted inaddition andmultiplication units capable ofoperating 150 times faster than those inSEAC constructed from essentially thesame components. Toprevent radioactive material from falling oninhabited areas after anuclear explosion, extensive calculations must bemadewhen tests are planned todetermine thefallout pattern. With high-speed electronic digital computers, such canbeeliminated andthecalculation time reduced to15minutes. However, thedigital computers areusually large, permanent, expensive installations. To provide even faster predictions with portable, relatively inexpensive equipment, theBureau developed aspecial-purpose analog computer for theWeather Bureau andtheAtomic Thiscomputer gives instantly, within anareaof250miles bevery useful tocivil defense.

During 1956, thetotal funds obligated forboth areas ofactivity, in- cluding construction and facilities, were $21,997,846. Ofthis total, about $8,306,246 came from direct Congressional appropriation forthe basic program, andtheremaining $13,691,600 represented programs con- ducted forotherGovernment agencies. During thispast year, several events have occurred that willhavean important bearing upon thecharacter andfuture iscontingent upon Congressional approval ofthe plans and before Completion toreconstitute itsresearch anddevelopment programs sothatmajor support came from directly appropriated funds and sothat greater emphasis might beplaced upon research related tostandards ofphysical measurement andtomethods ofmeasurement.
