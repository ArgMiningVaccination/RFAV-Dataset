Overview Indiana University When you become a student at Indiana University, you join an academic community internationally known for the excellence and diversity of its programs. With well over 1,000 degree programs, the university attracts students from all 50 states and around the world. Indiana University was founded at Bloomington in 1820 and is one of the oldest and largest institutions of higher education in the Midwest. It serves close to 100,000 students on eight campuses. The residential campus at Bloomington and the urban center at Indianapolis form the core of the university. Campuses in Gary, Fort Wayne, Kokomo, New Albany, Richmond, and South Bend join Bloomington and Indianapolis in bringing an education of high quality within reach of all of Indiana's citizens. Faculty The IU Northwest resident faculty numbers 137. They are assisted in their teaching responsibilities by associate faculty drawn from neighboring academic institutions, area businesses, local government, and not-for-profit agencies. All resident faculty at IU Northwest have academic appointments from Indiana University. Their conditions of employment, rank, salary, fringe benefits, teaching and research expectations, and promotion are the same as their colleagues in respective departments at all Indiana University campuses. The faculty of IU Northwest has its own faculty governance body, based upon a constitution written from principles embodied in the Indiana University Academic Handbook . Committees established by this faculty organization guide the conduct of the academic program at IU Northwest in a tradition that encouragesindividual faculty members to recommend policy in all areas affecting their interests and those of their students. Students The student body at IU Northwest numbers more than 3400 persons working toward certificates and associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees . Of that number, close to 400 are enrolled in graduate studies. The rich economic, cultural, and racial diversity of the northwest region of the state of Indiana is found on the campus. About 70 percent of the students reside in Lake County; 16 percent reside in Porter County; and 5 percent reside in Jasper, Newton, LaPorte, and Starke Counties. Students, therefore, come with family backgrounds in steel and related industries, government agencies, service industries, the professions, and farming. With respect to the rich cultural and racial composition of the region, approximately 49 percent of the students are Caucasian, 17 percent are African American, 27 percent are Latino, and 7 percent are other groups. We have been designated a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) since 2020. About 74% of our first year students and 87% of our seniors work full or part time while pursuing their education at the university. About 32 percent of the students enrolled at the campus are 25 years of age or older. Alumni Engagement The Alumni Engagement Office was established on the IU Northwest campus in 1967 when the IU Alumni Association staffed the local office with a field representative. There is now a full-time Alumni Engagement Director to serve the alumni and students of Indiana University. History IU Northwest is the result of growth and change that began in 1921 when the university offered its first formal classes in Lake County as part of a program sponsored by the Gary Public School System. Under various names and in various locations, Indiana University has been serving the needs of higher education in northwest Indiana ever since. In 1932 Indiana University initiated the Calumet Center in East Chicago; and by 1939, through funds granted by the state legislature and the federal government, the Calumet Center was serving students in a building in Tod Park on a site donated by the City of East Chicago. When Gary College was founded in 1933, Indiana University discontinued classes in Gary except for a few advanced courses. But in 1948, at the request of the Gary School Board, the university assumed the management of Gary College, which became the Gary Center of Indiana University. Gary Center classes were held after school hours and in the evenings at the Horace Mann High School until 1949, when all the main facilities of the center were moved to the commercial wing of the City Methodist Church, a move that allowed for a considerable expansion of the center's program. In 1955, with approval from the Gary Board of Park Commissioners, the Common Council of the city authorized the sale of 27 acres of Gleason Park to Indiana University for the purpose of establishing a Gary Center campus (the present site of IU Northwest).2Facilities, Maps, and Directions In May of 1959, the first classes were held in the new location. Recognizing the growth of such centers and the increasing demands for higher education throughout the state, Indiana University in 1963 reorganized its various \"extension\" centers into regional campuses, and the Gary Center and the Calumet Center became the Northwest Campus of Indiana University. Soon after this reorganization, the first degree programs were authorized, and the Northwest Campus became a four- year college. The first commencement was held at the Northwest Campus in June of 1967. In 1968, the IU Board of Trustees changed the name of the Northwest Campus to IU Northwest. Facilities, Maps, and Directions Campus and Buildings The campus of IU Northwest in Gary is adjacent to 240 acres of wooded park land. The city of Gary has already given 32.8 acres of this park property to Indiana University for the campus. The Gleason Park site is bounded on the north by an interstate expressway (I 80-94), on the east by a major north-south artery (Broadway-Indiana 53), on the west by the Gleason Park Golf Course, and on the south by residential housing. The northeast and northwest corners of the 240-acre tract lie adjacent to expressway cloverleaf exchanges east and west. Eight of the buildings used by IU Northwest are located on the 27-acre main campus site. The buildings are Raintree Hall, a classroom/office building and the Moraine student union building, which were put into operation in 1969; Hawthorn Hall, a four-story classroom/office building, which was occupied in 1976; and the John W. Anderson Library/Conference Center completed in the spring of 1980. A three-story science/laboratory building, Marram Hall, opened in 1991, and the Savannah Center, which houses an art gallery, auditorium, health club and bookstore, opened in 2000. In 2006, the University dedicated the Dunes Medical/Professional Building and in 2017, the University dedicated the new Arts and Sciences Building that houses two theatres, an art gallery, classrooms and faculty offices. Two other structures contain university offices, research offices, and campus support services. There are also a greenhouse and facilities and annex buildings. Maps and Directions IU Northwest is conveniently located in Gary, Indiana. We're easy to get to\u2014just minutes from I-90, I-80/94, I-65, US-12, US-20, and SR-53. The John W. Anderson Library The John W. Anderson Library is the information hub of the IU Northwest campus. The Library helps students with their research and information needs while providing space for individual and group study. The library has small study rooms that seats up to four people and two Student Collaborative Rooms for larger group collaboration. Students can schedule one-on-one research consultations with a librarian to get help with things like: Selecting an initial topic for a research paper or other research assignments Evaluating and critiquing resources based on context Identifying fake news, misinformation, and how it spreads Citation help Creating short custom-made videos or webpages Through the IU Northwest library, students have access to millions of resources from the other IU libraries. Books, journal articles and other resources from the Bloomington, Indianapolis, and other regional campus libraries can be quickly obtained for students and faculty. The Calumet Regional Archives collects, preserves, and makes available records of local organizations and individuals that document the history of Indiana's Calumet Region (Lake and Porter Counties) for use by students, scholars, and the general public. There are more than 5,000 cubic feet of these documents, preserved for the education and enjoyment of future generations.

Summer Sessions In addition to the regular session, Indiana University Northwest regularly offers summer sessions. These sessions are for students who want to study on the graduate level, to supplement courses taken during the regular year, or to speed up the completion of university study. They also allow high school graduates to enter the university immediately and to continue their education without interruption. Admission, orientation, and testing can thus be completed before the fall semester opens. Students admitted to the College of Health and Human Services may be required to enroll in summer session courses. These students should consult with their program directors for further information. Overseas Study Programs Indiana University Program Credit earned in overseas study programs sponsored by Indiana University or participated in by Indiana University on a consortium basis is considered Indiana University credit, not transfer credit. Consequently, university scholarships and loans are applicable to fees for these programs. Credit usually satisfies Indiana University degree requirements and meets the senior residency requirement. Programs are not restricted to language majors. Indiana University's programs include academic year programs in Bologna (Italy), Canterbury (Britain), Hamburg (Germany), Jerusalem (Israel), Lima (Peru), Madrid (Spain), Nagoya (Japan), Paris (France), S\u00e2o Paulo (Brazil), Seoul (South Korea), Aix-en-Provence(France), and Zomba (Malawi); semester programs in Beijing (China), Belize, Hangzhou (China), Leiden (Netherlands), St. Petersburg (Russia), Ljubljana (Slovenia), London (Britain), Maastrict (Netherlands), Moscow (Russia), Rennes (France), Rome (Italy), Rotterdam (Netherlands), Seville (Spain), and Singapore; summer programs in Costa Rica, Dijon (France), Florence (Italy), Graz (Austria), Guanajuato (Mexico), St. Petersburg (Russia), Quebec (Canada), Salamanca (Spain), and Mexico City (Mexico). Other Study-Abroad Programs Overseas study programs sponsored by institutions and organizations other than Indiana University are of varying quality. University policy on the acceptability of transfer credit from such programs is as follows: Transfer credit will be granted in accordance with usual Indiana University policy for credit earned in programs administered by a regionally accredited U.S. college or university or by a foreign institution that is recognized by the Ministry of Education of the country as a university-level institution. Transfer credit will similarly be granted for university- level course work completed at institutions or agencies that have been officially evaluated by Indiana University. Transfer credits may in certain cases be granted for university-level course work completed at nonaccredited overseas institutions and agencies that have not been evaluated by Indiana University but for which an academic record with grades is issued, but the maximum quantity will be 1 Indiana University credit hour for each 2 credit hours (or the equivalent) appearing on the transcript of the institution or agency. In many cases, despite the issuance of a transcript, no transcript credit will be granted. No credit will be granted for work completed in programs for which no grades or transcripts are issued. Other Policies In all transfer cases, the quantity of credit awarded by Indiana University will never exceed the number of credit hours that can be earned at an Indiana University campus in the same amount of time. Many courses completed in study abroad programs fall into a sequential pattern among Indiana University departmental offerings. In all cases where sequential-type courses are involved, the respective academic departments may at their discretion require examinations before any transfer is granted. In order to avoid misunderstanding, students who plan to participate in overseas study programs that are not sponsored by Indiana University are strongly urged to consult their major departments or schools before making any commitment. None of the preceding affects in any way the procedures for establishing credit by examination outlined in this bulletin. For further information, contact the campus international programs coordinator in the Department of Modern Languages .6Admissions Admissions The Office of Admissions is one of several offices on campus for prospective students to begin learning about the university. Students may secure admissions applications, academic brochures, and other information about admissions and enrollment.

Determining Resident Status Rules Determining Resident and Nonresident Student Status for Indiana University Fee Purposes These Rules establish the policy under which students shall be classified as residents or nonresidents upon all campuses of Indiana University for University fee purposes. Nonresident students shall pay a nonresident fee in addition to fees paid by a resident student. These Rules shall take effect February 1, 1974; provided, that no person properly classified as a resident student before February 1, 1974, shall be adversely affected by this Rule, if he or she attended the university before that date and while he or she remains continuously enrolled in the university. 1. \"Residence\" as the term, or any of its variations (e.g., \"resided\"), as used in the context of these Rules, means the place where an individual has his or her permanent home, at which he or she remains when not called elsewhere for labor, studies, or other special or temporary purposes, and to which he or she returns in seasons of repose. It is the place a person has voluntarily fixed as a permanent habitation for himself or herself with an intent to remain in such place for an indefinite period. A person at any one time has but one residence, and a residence cannot be lost until another is gained. a. A person entering the state from another state or country does not at that time acquire residence for the purpose of these Rules, but except as provided in Rule 2(c)1, such person must be a resident for 12 months in order to qualify as a resident student for fee purposes. b. Physical presence in Indiana for the predominant purpose of attending a college, university, or other institution of higher education, shall not be counted in determining the 12-month period of residence; nor shall absence from Indiana for such purpose deprive a person of resident student status. 2. A person shall be classified as a \"resident student\" if he or she has continuously resided in Indiana for at least 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the first scheduled day of classes of the semester or other session in which the individual registers in the University, subject to the exception in (c)1 below. a. The residence of an unemancipated person under 21 years of age follows that of the parents or of a legal guardian who has actual custody of such person or administers the property of such person. In the case ofdivorce or separation, if either parent meets the residence requirements, such person will be considered a resident.2 b. If such person comes from another state or country for the predominant purpose of attending the University, he or she shall not be admitted to resident student status upon the basis of the residence of a guardian in fact, except upon appeal to the Standing Committee on Residence in each case.1 c. Such person may be classified as a resident student without meeting the 12-month residence requirement within Indiana if his or her presence in Indiana results from the establishment by his or her parents of their residence within the state and if he or she proves that the move was predominantly for reasons other than to enable such person to become entitled to the status of \"resident student.\"1 d. When it shall appear that the parents of a person properly classified as a \"resident student\" under subparagraph (c) above have removed their residence from Indiana, such person shall then be reclassified to the status of nonresident; provided, that no such reclassification shall be effective until the beginning of a semester next following such removal. e. A person once properly classified as a resident student shall be deemed to remain a resident student so long as remaining continuously enrolled in the university until such person's degree shall have been earned, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (d) above.3 3. The foreign citizenship of a person shall not be a factor in determining resident student status if such person has legal capacity to remain permanently in the United States.3 4. A person classified as a nonresident student may show that he or she is exempt from paying the nonresident fee by clear and convincing evidence that he or she has been a resident (see Rule 1 above) of Indiana for the 12 months prior to the first scheduled day of classes of the semester in which his or her fee status is to be changed. Such a student will be allowed to present his or her evidence only after the expiration of 12 months from the residence qualifying date, i.e., the date upon which the student commenced the 12-month period for residence. The following factors will be considered relevant in evaluating a requested change in a student's nonresident status and in evaluating whether his or her physical presence in Indiana is for the predominant purpose of attending a college, university, or other institution of higher education. The existence of one or more of these factors will not require a finding of resident student status, nor shall the non-existence of one or more require a finding of nonresident student status. All factors will be considered in combination, and ordinarily resident student status will not result from the doing of acts which are required or routinely done by sojourners in the state or which are merely auxiliary to the fulfillment of educational purposes. a. The residence of a student's parents or guardians. b. The situs of the source of the student's income. c. To whom a student pays his or her taxes, including property taxes. d. The state in which a student's automobile is registered. e. The state issuing the student's driver's license. f. Where the student is registered to vote.10Financial Information g. The marriage of the student to a resident of Indiana. h. Ownership of property in Indiana and outside of Indiana. i. The residence claimed by the student on loan applications, federal income tax returns, and other documents. j. The place of the student's summer employment, attendance at summer school, or vacation. k. The student's future plans including committed place of future employment or future studies. l. Admission to a licensed profession in Indiana. m. Membership in civic, community, and other organizations in Indiana or elsewhere. n. All present and intended future connections or contacts outside of Indiana. o. The facts and documents pertaining to the person's past and existing status as a student. p. Parents' tax returns and other information, particularly when emancipation is claimed. 5. The fact that a person pays taxes and votes in the state does not in itself establish residence, but will be considered as hereinbefore set forth. 6. The registrar or the person fulfilling those duties on each campus shall classify each student as resident or nonresident and may require proof of all relevant facts. The burden of proof is upon the student making a claim to a resident student status. 7. A Standing Committee on Residence shall be appointed by the president of the university and shall include two students from among such as may be nominated by the student body presidents of one or more of the campuses of the university. If fewer than four are nominated, the president may appoint from among students not nominated. 8. A student who is not satisfied by the determination of the registrar has the right to lodge a written appeal with the Standing Committee on Residence within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the registrar's determination, which committee shall review the appeal in a fair manner and shall afford to the student a personal hearing upon written request. A student may be represented by counsel at such hearing. The committee shall report its determination to the student in writing. If no appeal is taken within the time provided herein, the decision of the registrar shall be final and binding. 9. The Standing Committee on Residence is authorized to classify a student as a resident student, though not meeting the specific requirements herein set forth, if such student's situation presents unusual circumstances and the individual classification is within the general scope of these Rules. The decision of the committee shall be final and shall be deemed equivalent to a decision of the Trustees of Indiana University. 10. A student or prospective student who shall knowingly provide false information or shall refuse to provide or shall conceal information for the purpose of improperly achieving resident student status shall be subject to the full range of penalties, including expulsion, provided for by the university, as well as to such other punishment which may be provided for by law. 11. A student who does not pay additional monies which may be due because of his or her classification as anonresident student within 30 days after demand, shall thereupon be indefinitely suspended. 12. A student or prospective student who fails to request resident student status within a particular semester or session and to pursue a timely appeal (see rule 8) to the Standing Committee on Residence shall be deemed to have waived any alleged overpayment of fees for that semester or session. 13. If any provision of these rules or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of these rules which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of these rules are severable. 1 Rules 2(b) and 2(c) apply only to unemancipated persons under 21 years of age. 2 Invocation of the provision in Rule 2(a) that applies to cases of divorce or separation requires appropriate legal documentation. 3 NOTE: Effective Fall 2007, students with immigration statuses which permit the establishment of a domicile in the United States may be eligible to pay resident fees. Current eligible classifications are: A-1, A-2, A-3, E-1, E-2, V-3. Continuing eligibility to remain classified as a resident student for fee-paying purpose depends upon the continued maintenance of eligible immigration status. Contact the registrar's office for more information. Financial Information Basic Costs Expenses for attending Indiana University Northwest for an academic year, including in-state fees for 30 credit hours, books, and supplies, total approximately $15,100. Expenditures for clothing, travel, entertainment, and personal items are not included in this estimate. Fees Tuition and fees are determined by the Indiana University Board of Trustees and are subject to change by action of the trustees. Students are advised to consult the fee schedule section of the campus or the Indiana University Northwest Office of Student Accounts Web site (www.iun.edu/bursar/) to determine the current fees and due dates for any given semester. Deferment Plans In accordance with Indiana University Northwest's commitment to provide quality education at a reasonable cost, deferment plans are offered to eligible students. Eligibility is based on the total amount of a student's assessed tuition and fees for a semester and past payment history with the university. To participate in a deferment/payment plan, the minimum amount due on your bill must be paid by the due date. The minimum amount due consists of approximately 25-35 percent of the total bill. A deferment fee is charged for this service. During the fall and spring semester, up to 4 payments can be made. Each payment must be made by the pre- determined due dates for each semester. Contact the Office of the Bursar for specific details.Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants 11 Refund of Student Fees When a student withdraws from a course or courses, a refund will be made for most courses involved according to the refund policy stated in the campus Schedule of Classes. Full refund of fees is given only during the first week of classes. Students are advised to consult the Indiana University Northwest Office of Student Accounts Web site or contact the Office of the Bursar for more detailed information regarding the refund of student fees. Special Credit Any student who is full-time (12 cr.-18 cr.) does not need to pay for special credits under the banded tuition fees for full-time students, regardless of their Freshman to Senior status. Transfer and new students in their first year who are part time are also exempt from charge for special credits. All others must pay a per credit rate for eligible special credits. Each academic unit determines in which courses, if any, special credit by examination may be earned. Financial Aid & Scholarships In addition to developing local scholarship assistance programs, Indiana University Northwest participates in the full variety of federal and state-sponsored programs. The financial aid program serves students from diverse parts of society. Every student who applies for financial aid and has demonstrated financial need is assured some type of financial assistance. In order to be considered for financial assistance, a student must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The application can be completed on line at www.studentaid.gov . The FAFSA applications should be completed by April 15 for the following academic year to meet the state grant deadline. Financial assistance, in various forms, is available for students attending any Indiana University campus. Because scholarship and grant funds are limited, the student's entire need for funds cannot always be met from these sources. Therefore, several types of financial aid may be combined to meet the student's financial need. It is not uncommon for a student, particularly with a large financial need, to receive assistance in the forms of scholarships, grants, loans, and employment earnings, or some combination of these sources. Scholarships Most scholarships are awarded on the basis of the applicant's academic achievement and potential for college success. Some scholarships also require demonstrated financial need. Local Scholarships Scholarship funds, established and provided by individuals, organizations, business, industry, and other private organizations in the area, are available to students attending IU Northwest. These may be offered in addition to the scholarships awarded by the university which can be viewed at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, Scholarships page.Children of Veterans, Law Enforcement Officers, and Firefighters Indiana residents who are children of disabled or wounded veterans, who are children of missing-in-action or prisoner-of-war veterans of Vietnam, or who are children of law enforcement officers or firefighters killed in the line of duty are eligible for a partial fee remittance. Inquire at the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at IU Northwest. Federal College Work-Study Program The federal government has provided funds to stimulate and promote part-time employment of students in institutions of higher education. To be eligible for this program, students must be enrolled during the semester in which they wish to be employed. The student must also verify a need for financial assistance. Under this program, employment is limited to an average of 20 hours per week whenever regular classes are in session. Federal Direct Student Loans Direct Loans are low-interest loans for students and parents to help pay for the cost of a student's education after high school. The lender is the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) rather than a bank or other financial institution. Students must meet general guidelines for eligibility for federal aid, and must be enrolled at least half time. Repayment begins six months after the student completes the program or is enrolled below a half-time status. Graduate students may be eligible for up to $20,500 per year in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program and undergraduate students may be eligible for up to $12,500 depending on dependency status and grade level. If graduate program official costs of attendance exceeds the Direct Loan limit, credit-worthy students may borrow the additional amount up to cost of attendance in the Graduate PLUS Program. Federal Pell Grant The federal Pell Grants program provides financial assistance to those who need it to attend post-secondary educational institutions. Grants are intended to be the \"floor\" of a financial aid package and may be combined with other forms of financial aid in order to meet the full cost of education. The amount is determined by the student's and/or the family's financial resources. Federal Direct PLUS Loan (Parents' Loans for Undergraduate Students) The PLUS loan allows parents to borrow on behalf of their dependent undergraduate children who are enrolled at least half time. Loans to parents of dependent undergraduate students are made for up to the full cost of the student's education less the student's financial aid. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants All undergraduate students admitted to the university are eligible for this award on the basis of high financial need. The amount of the grant is determined by the student's financial need for funds. First preference must be given to Federal Pell Grant recipients.12Vocational Rehabilitation Vocational Rehabilitation A person with a disability may qualify for financial assistance through the Vocational Rehabilitation Program. Application must be made directly to the Vocational Rehabilitation Division in the student's area. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Program Graduate or professional students are now eligible to borrow under the PLUS Loan Program up to their cost of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance. The terms and conditions applicable to Parent PLUS Loans also apply to Graduate/Professional PLUS Loans. Satisfactory Academic Progress To be eligible to continue to receive any Federal, State of Indiana, or IU Northwest financial aid, a student must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress (SAP) toward an approved certificate or degree. The financial aid SAP standards may differ from requirements set forth by IU Northwest academic schools and departments. The measure of SAP must include all college course work attempted at IU Northwest and elsewhere. SAP is applied to all attempted courses that appear on the student academic transcript, whether or not financial aid was received for all attempted courses. SAP is monitored once a year, at the end of the spring semester. Students are expected to understand the SAP policy and comply with it. To demonstrate SAP, students are expected to earn credit for at least 67 percent of the credits they attempt. Students are therefore not eligible to receive any further financial aid once they have attempted 150 percent of the credits that are needed to complete their particular academic program. In addition, undergraduate students must maintain a minimum 2.00 program grade point average and graduate students must maintain a minimum 3.0 program grade point average. Students who fail to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy are considered not meeting SAP and are no longer eligible for financial aid. A student can appeal their SAP status through the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. Students not meeting SAP will be sent an email informing them of the steps they need to take in order to submit a SAP appeal. Complete appeals must consist of the appeal form completed and signed by both academic advisor and student, along with all relevant documentation. Withdrawing after the Awarding of Financial Aid Should a student withdraw from a class or classes, once financial aid has already been credited to the student's bursar account for the dropped class or classes, some recalculation of the financial aid may be necessary. Students should always consult with a Financial Aid Counselor before withdrawing from any class or classes, especially once financial aid has already been credited to the student's bursar account.Policies & Procedures The Student's Responsibility All colleges establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These regulations concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and campus residence. Advisors, directors, and deans will always help a student meet those requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, the faculty and the Trustees of Indiana University vote upon the conferring of the degree. If requirements have not been satisfied, the degree will be withheld pending adequate fulfillment. For that reason it is important: (1) for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and remain informed throughout their college careers; and (2) for students to realize that while IU Northwest establishes certain minimum standards that apply to its students, other standards may be established by its various academic divisions. Therefore, students should refer to the appropriate section(s) of this bulletin for a more complete statement of academic policy. Academic Standing Candidates in Good Standing for Baccalaureate Degrees Students are considered to be candidates in good standing for an Indiana University baccalaureate degree when their academic grade point averages are not less than a C (2.0) average for the last semester's work and when the cumulative average is not below this same level. Class Standing Class standing is based on the number of credit hours completed: freshman, fewer than 30; sophomore, 30-59; junior, 60-89; senior, 90 or more. Student Load Students may register for a single course or for up to a full-time college program. Students who register for 12 or more credit hours per semester (12 or more across the summer sessions) are full-time students. It is not recommended that a person employed full time take more than 6 credit hours of academic work during each regular semester, either in residence or in absentia, or more than 3 credit hours in each summer session. Students who expect to graduate in four academic years, not counting summer sessions, should carry at least 15 credit hours during each semester of the regular academic year . Except with special permission from the College/School, a student is not permitted to carry more than 17 credit hours. Chancellor's List Students carrying 12 letter-grade credit hours or more who earn a 4.0 grade point average for the semester are placed on the Chancellor's List. Part-time students enrolled in a degree or certificate program will be placed on the Chancellor's List provided they carry 12 letter-grade credit hours or more during the regular academic year (August to May) and earn a 4.0 grade point average.Withdrawals from Courses 13 Dean's List Students carrying 12 letter-grade credit hours or more who earn a 3.3 grade point average or higher for the semester are placed on the Dean's List. Part-time students enrolled in a degree or certificate program will be placed on the Dean's List provided they carry 12 letter-grade credit hours or more during the regular academic year (August to May) and earn a 3.3 or higher grade point average. Absence Illness is usually the only acceptable excuse for absence from class. Absences must be explained to the satisfaction of the instructor, who will decide whether omitted work may be made up. The instructor will report a student's excessive absence to the chairperson of the academic division in which the student is majoring. A student who misses a final examination and who has a passing grade up to that time may be given a grade of Incomplete until the instructor or the division chairperson has had an opportunity to review the reason for the absence. Probation Students are placed on probation whenever their cumulative grade point average is below 2.0 unless their academic program has established a higher standard. A student on probation remains on probation until their cumulative GPA is 2.0 or higher. The ramifications of probation on a student's status at the University depend upon the academic unit in which the student is enrolled. Students who are placed on probation should discuss it with their academic advisor as soon as possible, to learn what is necessary to be allowed to continue with the academic program. Dismissal Students are dismissed from the university when they have ceased to make adequate progress toward their degrees. A student who has failed to earn a C average in any two semesters and whose cumulative average is below 2.0 is considered to be making insufficient progress toward the degree. A student earning less than a D average (1.0) for a semester, and whose cumulative grade point falls below a C (2.0) average, is dismissed by the academic unit. If this is the first dismissal, the student may petition the academic unit for reinstatement . Depending on the academic program, a student who has been reinstated by petition may be required to earn more than a C average in order to be considered to be making satisfactory progress toward the degree. Reinstatement Dismissed students must remain out of their academic program for at least one regular semester during or after which they may petition their academic divisions for reinstatement. Reinstatement after a second dismissal will rarely be approved. Applications for reinstatement must be received no later than August 1 for the fall semester, December 1 for the spring semester, April 1 for the first summer session, and May 1 for the second summer session. Those dates serve as a general guideline, but students should check with the appropriate academic unit office for special unit deadlines.Academic Forgiveness Policy Undergraduate students who have not attended Indiana University for at least two years, are pursuing their first bachelor's degree, and are returning to IU Northwest for the fall semester, 2010 or later, may request academic forgiveness. Forgiveness means that all grades earned during the term(s) in question will not be counted in the calculation of the program GPA. The grades will remain on the student's official transcript and will count in the IU GPA. Academic forgiveness may be requested for no more than two terms of IU Northwest coursework. Two consecutive summer sessions may be considered a single academic term for purposes of this policy. The petition must be submitted upon application for admission to a degree-granting unit. If the student has not yet been admitted to a degree-granting unit, the student should submit a notification of intent to petition for academic forgiveness as part of the academic advising process. Academic forgiveness may be invoked only once in a student's academic career. Academic forgiveness is inapplicable to any grades issued as a result of academic dishonesty. Academic forgiveness petition forms are available from your academic school or division. Beginning with the Fall 2010 semester, after approval of the Academic forgiveness petition, the original grades will remain on a student's academic record (official and unofficial transcripts), but the GPA and hours earned calculations will be adjusted appropriately in the Program statistics. Academic forgiveness does not impact/change the Indiana University earned hours or GPA calculations. The policy does impact the Student Program statistics in order to provide academic units at IU Northwest with statistics that support awarding an IU Northwest degree(s). Academic forgiveness is campus-specific. Semesters forgiven at IU Northwest need not be forgiven at any other IU campus. Academic forgiveness only applies to students who have not completed a bachelor's degree. Invocation of academic forgiveness does not preclude a student using other available, course-specific grade replacement options, subject to each academic unit's rules and procedures. The Academic Forgiveness Policy does not circumvent any specific additional admissions or grade policies by particular schools/divisions. On the Degree Progress report, a text statement will be placed above the semester approved for forgiveness that reads: \"Academic courses for this term are forgiven by IU Northwest, mm/dd/yyyy.\" In addition, under each course forgiven, there will be a text statement that reads: \"Attention: No Academic Program Credit or GPA (Forgiven).\" Addition of Courses after Semester Start No student is permitted to enroll in any regularly scheduled course or for any additional hours of credit in any course after the first week of a semester or session unless the instructor of the course approves that an exception be made and the request is approved by the student's advisor. Withdrawals from Courses A student may withdraw from a course during the first 9 weeks of the semester (fourth week of a summer session)14Grades and will receive a grade of W. After the ninth week (fourth week of a summer session), the grade shall be W or F as determined by the instructor. This is an electronic process. Please see https:// www.iun.edu/registrar/students/add-drop-course.htm for more details. If the student is a College of Arts and Sciences student, they need to follow the online process for late withdrawals within the college at http://www.iun.edu/coas/policies-and-procedures/late- withdrawal-policy.htm Withdrawals during the automatic W period require the approval of the academic advisor. After the automatic withdrawal period, a student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean. This approval is given only for urgent reasons relating to extended illness or equivalent distress. To qualify for the grade of W, a student must be passing the course on the date of withdrawal. If the student is failing, the grade recorded on the date of withdrawal will be F. Students who alter their original class schedules, whether by personal incentive or by university directive, must do so officially by the procedure outlined above. Students who do not assume this responsibility are jeopardizing their records by the possibility of incurring an F in a course not properly dropped or not receiving credit in a course improperly added. Students who simply stop attending classes without formally withdrawing will jeopardize their student status, will become liable for repayment of all federal financial aid and tuition and fees. Note: Currently due to the pandemic, the withdrawal deadline has been extended. Please find the current dates at Important Dates - Indiana University Northwest (iun.edu). Grades The official grading system of the university is as follows: A, B, C, D, F, I (Incomplete), W (Withdrawn), P (Passed), S (Satisfactory), R (Deferred Grade), and FX (Failure Removed from GPA Calculations). The University Faculty Council has passed a resolution that permits the use of plus and minus grades. The faculty council has also established a formula that attaches varying weights to these grades in computing grade point averages: A+ or A = 4.0; A- = 3.7; B+ = 3.3; B = 1.3; D = 1.0; D- = 0.7; F = 0.0. The legislation was framed in general terms and applies to instructors teaching graduates and undergraduates on all campuses of Indiana University. Within the policy, individual instructors and academic units can elect to require its faculty to assign 1.only straight letter grades; 2.any combination of plus, minus, and straight letter grades; or 3.Pass/Fail in clinical or other phases of course work, or to permit individual students in specified courses to elect Pass/Fail options. The weights assigned by the registrar will be those specified above. It is the responsibility of the academic unit to adopt procedures for electing options, implementingthe decision, and announcing its decision to faculty and students. The quality of a student's work is indicated by the following grades: A = Unusal degree of academic excellence B = Above average achievement C = Average achievement D = Passing work but below desired standards F = Failure in a course S = Satisfactory P = Passed (Pass/Fail Option) W = Withdrawn I = Incomplete R = Deferred Grade FX Credit by Examination Veterans Credit Grade Appeals Withdrawn The grade W is given when the student, with the approval of the academic advisor, officially withdraws during the first 9 weeks of a semester or the first four weeks of a summer session. Thereafter, it is given only when the student withdraws with the approval of the instructor and the division chairperson and if the student is passing on the date of withdrawal. Passed (Pass/Fail Option) Students may elect to take one course each semester with a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail), with a maximum of two such courses each school year, including summer sessions. The student must exercise the election of this option within the first three weeks of the semester or first two weeks of the summer sessions. Required courses and courses used to meet concentration requirements may not be taken under this option. The responsibility for approval, as well as special regulations affecting the option, rests with the chairperson of the student's College/ School under procedures that the division establishes. A grade of P is not counted in the cumulative grade point average, but a grade of F is included. A grade of P cannot be subsequently changed to a grade of A, B, C, or D. Satisfactory Certain courses are offered under the S/F grading policy. Credits earned with the grade S count toward graduation but are not computed in the grade point average. In any course in which the grade S is used, the only other grade permitted will be F. Deferred Grade Used on the final grade report, the R indicates that the nature of the course is such that the work of the student can be evaluated only after two or more terms. The grade R is appropriate only so long as there is work in progress. The deferred grade procedure can be used only with approval of the academic unit and the willingness of the student to take the extended course before receiving a grade. Removal of a Deferred Grade At the end of the second term of a deferred grade course, the instructor will submit the student's grade for the last term on the grade sheet for that term and/or send a Removal of Deferred Grade CardVeterans Credit 15 through the office of the student's school to the registrar's office. If work is interrupted because of extenuating circumstances, a special arrangement between student and instructor must be made on a term-to--term basis. If a student drops out of a course before the work is complete, the instructor must assign a regular grade (A, B, C, W, etc.) for the course. Incomplete The grade I may be given only when the work of the course is substantially completed and when the student's work is of a passing quality. When an Incomplete is assigned, a record must be maintained in the department in which the grade was given. The record will include the reason for recording the Incomplete, the course number and hours of credit, the signature of the instructor, and a guide for its removal, with a suggested final grade in the event of the departure or extended absence of the instructor from the campus. The time allowed for the removal of an Incomplete is one calendar year from the date of its recording, however the chairperson of the student's College/School may authorize adjustment of this period in exceptional circumstances. By assigning an Incomplete, the instructor implicitly authorizes and requires the I to be changed to an F at the end of the appropriate time period, if that instructor does not otherwise act to remove the I. The registrar will automatically change the I to an F at the end of the appropriate time period. A grade of Incomplete may be removed if the student completes the work within the time limit or if the student's chairperson authorizes the change of the Incomplete to W. Students may not reregister in a course in which they have a grade of Incomplete. Extended-X Applied retroactively from Spring 2017 forward-any prior grade, not otherwise excluded by this policy, is eligible for replacement by grades earned in Spring 2017 and beyond. Undergraduate students who receive a grade lower than an A may be eligible, upon retaking the course, to remove the earlier grade from their grade point average (GPA). The original grade will be replaced on the transcript with the letter grade followed by an X (e.g., a D would be replaced with a DX, a C with a CX, etc.) and the new grade will be recorded in the semester the course was retaken. Students wishing to exercise this option must request the change from their academic unit who will complete the appropriate form and send to the Registrar. Please note the following restrictions: Students may apply for an Extended-X for a maximum of 3 courses or 10 credits, whichever comes first. A student may use the Extended-X option only once for a given course. A student receiving a grade of W or I will not qualify for removal of the original grade. Courses repeatable with different content are not eligible for replacement under this policy unless an academic unit chooses to permit this by means of a specific authorization procedure. Students must complete the Extended-X process prior to graduation. Graduate students are not eligible for an Extended-X. (This applies to solely graduate students, not to graduate courses) A student who has failed a course due to academic dishonesty may not retake that course for grade replacement under this policy. Not all schools recognize the Extended-X policy in the same manner. Students should refer to their school's web site, advisors or records office to determine their eligibility for application of this policy. Students planning to apply to professional or graduate schools should consult their advisor as many programs manually recalculate applicants' GPAs, and the originally received grade will still be published on the student 's transcript. Transfer courses are not eligible attempts under this policy. Only graded courses taken at JU are eligible prior attempts. Credit by Examination The student may receive credit for certain courses by specific scores on College Board Achievement (AP) Tests; by specific scores on College-level Examination Program tests (CLEP); by specific scores on International Baccalaureate (IB) tests; by specific scores on Cambridge International Advanced A or AS level tests; by outstanding performance on advanced placement examinations given before the beginning of each academic year in French, German, and Spanish; and by successful performance on appropriate examinations while at Indiana University. Students who believe they are eligible for special credit because of superior preparation or independent study are urged to accelerate their college programs in this manner. Please see the Office of Admissions for more details. Where credit by examination is awarded by the university, that credit will be recorded simply with the grade S on the student's transcript unless the examination clearly merits an A grade. Failure to pass the examination carries no penalty and is not recorded. See \"Special Credit\" under \"Financial Information.\" Veterans Credit Veterans of military service are eligible for academic credit as a result of their military training and experience. The university follows the provisions of the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide for the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services in granting credit. In general, this provides that a student who has completed from six months to one year is eligible for 2 credit hours, equivalent to first- year ROTC; and a veteran of more than one year is eligible for 4 credit hours, equivalent to two years of ROTC, and 2 credit hours for one year of freshman physical education, less any physical education or basic ROTC credit previously earned. Additional credit as may be justified is awarded for special training programs. Copies of official discharge or separation papers or transcripts must be submitted as a basis for granting credit. The Office of Admissions administers evaluation of service credit. Students attending the university with educational assistance from the G.I. Bill should note that for full- time monthly payment 12 hours of credit must be taken. Three- quarter-time benefit is paid for 9 to 11 hours of credit; half time consists of 6 to 8 credit hours or the equivalent.16Grade Appeals Grade Appeals Academic units should not consider petitions for change of grade from concluded courses older than 5 years. Academic units may choose to use a shorter time period than the campus limit. For the situation where a student believes there was an error in the calculation or assigning of a course grade or they are seeking a withdrawal, it is the responsibility of the student to contact the course instructor to discuss the grade and make his or her case to have the grade changed. If the course instructor declines to support the student's request for a change of grade or in situations where the instructor cannot be contacted, the student may appeal the course grade following the procedures established by the awarding academic unit. The Change of Grade Request requires course information (course title, semester taken) and a reason for the requested change. Additional documentation to substantiate the reason may be required. If the student's performance or withdrawal was medically related, the student should provide appropriate supporting documentation. Decisions on grade changes are made within the schools. If the request is supported, the school will notify the Office of the Registrar of the new grade. If the request is denied, students will be so notified by the school. The student may then appeal to the Academic Affairs Committee of the Faculty Organization.

Emergency Closings Occasionally, Indiana University Northwest is forced to close because of weather emergencies. In the case of severe storms that occur overnight, every effort is made to assess conditions early enough in the day to notify the mass media of a campus closing in time to alert students, faculty, and staff members before they set out for the campus. In periods of very bad winter weather, students are urged to monitor northwest Indiana radio stations for closing announcements as well as Indiana University Northwest's Web page (www.iun.edu). Graduation Procedures18Degree Requirements Degree Requirements Each Program sets its own degree requirements. Students, therefore, should be sure that they are fully informed as to the requirements of the College/School from which they expect to receive their degree. Students are responsible for understanding all requirements for graduation and for completing them by the time they expect to graduate. Information about a specific school or college can be found in their section of the bulletin. Requests for deviation from department, program, or school requirements may be granted only by written approval from the respective chairperson, director, and dean (or a designated administrative representative). Disposition at each level is final. Credit Deadline All credit of candidates for degrees, except that for the work of the current semester, must be on record at least one month prior to the conferring of the degrees. Application for Degree Each College/School sets its own dates and procedures for filing applications for degrees. Students, therefore, should be sure that they are fully informed about the dates and procedures used in the College/School from which they expect to receive their degree. Degrees Awarded with Distinction To graduate with academic distinction, baccalaureate and associate degree candidates must rank within the highest 10 percent of the graduating class of their respective degree-granting College/School. Additionally, baccalaureate degree candidates must have completed a minimum of 60 credit hours at Indiana University. Associate degree candidates must have completed at least half the hours required for their degree at Indiana University. Each degree-granting College/School determines the appropriate GPA requirements for the three levels of recognition: distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction. Transfer to Other Indiana University Campuses The policy stated below concerning transfer credit pertains to undergraduate students only. Each campus has established one office to serve as the central information source for intercampus transfers. Some campuses have priority dates for students to declare an interest in making an intercampus transfer. Even if a campus has no priority date, it is important to start investigating the transfer requirements as early as possible to assure the best possibility of enrolling in your desired courses. Consult the intercampus transfer Web site at Intercampus Transfers - Indiana University Northwest (iun.edu) for detailed information and a listing of campus contacts and intercampus transfer policies. You can also initiate an intercampus transfer by completing the form on the web site.Students who want to transfer from one Indiana University campus to another campus should follow these procedures: 1.Meet with your home campus advisor to discuss academic preparation, grades, and other eligibility issues. You can get a general idea of how your classes may apply to another degree by using the Academic Adivising Report (AAR), a computerized degree-audit system available on the Web through One.IU.edu. While the advising capacity of the AAR is qualified by each individual's circumstances, it can help you learn how courses will apply toward different degrees. 2.Consult the intercampus transfer office at the proposed new campus if academic and/or eligibility questions remain. Remember that application for intercampus transfer does not guarantee admission to the campus or a specific school on the campus. Campuses may provide additional information and contact points for questions*. 3.If applicable, talk to the financial aid offices at the present and proposed campuses. Your aid eligibility does not transfer automatically from one campus to another. 4.Visit the new campus to explore possible academic and social adjustment issues; some campuses may establish special open house events for those students who have expressed interest. Some campuses may also require that you attend a special orientation program or take placement examinations. 5.If you decide to proceed with the transfer, complete the intercampus transfer form. The receiving campus will respond to you and your home campus. If you decide later not to transfer, you should notify both campuses. *Some academic programs require specific qualifications in addition to those enumerated in this policy. Other Transfer Policies In all transfer cases, the quantity of credit awarded by Indiana University will never exceed the number of credit hours that can be earned at an Indiana University campus in the same amount of time. Many courses completed in study abroad programs fall into a sequential pattern among Indiana University departmental offerings. In all cases where sequential-type courses are involved, the respective academic departments may at their discretion require examinations before any transfer is granted. In order to avoid misunderstanding, students who plan to participate in overseas study programs that are not sponsored by Indiana University are strongly urged to consult their major departments or schools before making any commitment. None of the preceding affects in any way the procedures for establishing credit by examination outlined in this bulletin. Student Rights and Responsibilities The IU Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (the Code), which is published online at https:// studentcode.iu.edu/index.html ensures that students' rights are protected. While they're entitled to respect and civility, they also have responsibilities to the campusAcademic Success and Achievement Programs (ASAP) 19 community. The Code outlines these responsibilities and the university's expectations for students' behavior. It also explains the processes that IU Northwest follows when a student is believed to have violated the Code. Nondiscrimination Policy Indiana University pledges itself to continue its commitment to the achievement of equal opportunity within the university and throughout American society as a whole. In this regard, Indiana University will recruit, hire, promote, educate, and provide services to persons based upon their individual qualifications. Indiana University prohibits discrimination based on arbitrary consideration of such characteristics as age, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Indiana University shall take affirmative action, positive and extraordinary, to overcome the discriminatory effects of traditional policies and procedures with regard to the disabled, minorities, women, and Vietnam-era veterans.

We provide undergraduate and graduate education in a broad range of arts and sciences disciplines that prepare students for rewarding careers of their choice. We also provide the academic coursework that is the foundation for success in majors across the university. The college is dedicated to helping our students develop the communication, reasoning, andanalytic skills necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing world. The skills and content offered in the college are the core of what it means to be educated in the 21st Century. We invite all of our students to delve into the vast offerings of the College with the expectation that expanding your knowledge of the liberal arts and sciences will lead to better lives and more successful and fulfilling careers. At the core of our programs, many unique to the region, are the analytical, cognitive, and expressive skills needed to assimilate and advance knowledge. An arts and sciences education focuses on an understanding of the human condition\u2014past and present\u2014and the world in which we live. It emphasizes a humanistic and aesthetic appreciation of cultural life as well as valuing of science and its methodology in which intellect, logical processes, ethical perspectives, and problem solving are vital. The strong research and creative activities of our faculty encourage students toward a life of learning and reflection. Intrinsic to a liberal arts and sciences education is preparing graduates to appreciate, contribute to, and thrive in a diverse, culturally rich, technologically, and scientifically advanced society with a compelling history, a promising future, and a capacity for transformation. Through our teaching, research, creative arts, and professional and community services, we engage in the vitality of Northwest Indiana. An informed, educated population is not only democracy's strongest, best hope, it is also society's wisest investment. That, more than anything else, is the endeavor of the faculty and staff of the College of Arts and Sciences. At present, the college consists of 11 departments and one school offering baccalaureate degrees in the following areas: Actuarial Science, African American and African Diaspora Studies, Anthropology, Applied Science, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Communication, Computer Information Systems, Data Science, Economics, English, Fine Arts, French, General Studies, Geology, History, Informatics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Spanish, Sustainability, and Theatre.

Freshmen are encouraged to visit departments in which they are interested to discuss possible programs with faculty and advisors. Additional information is available in the College of Arts and Sciences offices, Hawthorn Hall, Room 225. General Requirements The following requirements pertain to IU Northwest only. Students contemplating transfer to other campuses should consult the appropriate bulletins and the Academic Advising Report (AAR) electronic system. Baccalaureate Degrees Professional and faculty advisors from the student's major department provides academic counseling for each student in the College of Arts and Sciences prior to each semester's enrollment. Although academic counseling is intended to provide effective guidance and every student is encouraged to seek the counsel of a faculty advisor, all students are responsible for planning their own programs and for meeting the following degree requirements by the time they expect to graduate. Students who have been awarded a baccalaureate degree cannot at a later date change the degree to include additional majors and/or minors. (Note: Degree requirements are not the same at every campus of Indiana University.) Minimum of 120 credit hours. At least 105 credit hours must be in courses in the College of Arts and Sciences unless a student pursues a minor or a certificate in another division of the university that grants degrees. If so, the 105 credit hour minimum in Arts and Sciences may be reduced sufficiently to allow the student to fulfill the minimum number of credit hours for the other division's minor or certificate, providing that all other Arts and Sciences requirements are met. Under these specific circumstances, the credit hour minimum can be no lower than 86 credit hours. If no such non\u2014 Arts and Sciences minor or certificate is pursued, the remaining 15 credit hours may be taken in the College of Arts and Sciences or in other divisions in the university. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Minimum of 3 COAS Intensive Writing courses totalling at least 9 credits for the B.A. and the B.F.A.26Goals of the Curriculum degrees For all other degrees a minimum of 2 COAS Intensive Writing courses totaling at least 6 cr. are required. (A complete list of courses that fulfill these requirements is located in and can be searched through the Matrix App at www.iun.edu/ coas/student-tools/index.htm .) Minimum of 36 credit hours in courses at the 300-400 (junior-senior) level. Minimum of 25 credit hours with grades of C- or higher in the major field and a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in the major field. 15-20 credit hours with grades of C- or higher in the minor field and a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in the minor field. Twenty-six (26) credit hours of the work of the senior year must be completed while in residence at the IU Northwest campus. At least 10 credit hours of course work in the major field must be completed on the IU Northwest campus. To meet Intensive Writing, IIIA Lab, or IIIC Lab requirements, IU Northwest COAS students must complete classes and sections offered through IU Northwest and authorized by the College as an IW, IIIA Lab, or IIIC Lab. These designations will appear under the classes in the schedule of classes. For example, if a particular upper level history class is offered by IU Northwest and indicates that it carries IW credit, that class section will carry IW credit. If a second section of the same class is offered from either IU Northwest or through a different campus and it is not identified as carrying IW credit, then none will be assigned. Work for credit in the College of Arts and Sciences may be done at Bloomington or other Indiana University campuses. Not more than 60 credit hours earned in accredited two-year institutions of higher education, nor more than 90 credit hours from accredited four-year institutions of higher education, may be applied toward a degree. A student who fails to complete a degree within 10 years of matriculation will forfeit the automatic right to use the requirements in effect at the time of matriculation. In such cases, the dean, in consultation with the student's major department chair, will determine which set of requirements, or what particular combination of old and new requirements, will be appropriate for the student. All credit of candidates for degrees, except that of the current semester, must be on record at least six weeks prior to the conferring of degrees. An application for a degree must be filed in the Office of the College of Arts and Sciences no later than July 1 for December graduation. May and August graduates must file the application for graduation by October 15. Degrees are conferred in May, August, and December. Commencement is held only in May. Goals of the Curriculum A well-rounded college graduate must have knowledge and skills that span a variety of fields. For this reason, the requirements for IU Northwest's Arts and Sciences degrees are designed to expose students to a broad range of subjects and methods. The four groups of requirementspromote the development of foundational skills, breadth of knowledge, and appreciation for diversity. Group I: Foundation Courses: English, Mathematics, and Public Speaking Successful graduates must express themselves clearly and effectively in English. They must be able to write documents and deliver presentations that display logical organization, proper grammar, and appropriate word choices. Thus, all Bachelor of Arts students are required to complete both an English and a Public Speaking requirement. Students must also cultivate a set of basic mathematical skills. These are essential for logical reasoning and have wide applications in a variety of fields of study. The Mathematics requirement ensures that all students develop their quantitative skills and learn to interpret\u2014 and draw conclusions from\u2014data presented in tables and graphs. Group II: Foreign Languages Learning a foreign language increases the effectiveness of cross-cultural communication. It connects students with the world in ways that are not always available locally. The Foreign Language requirement for Bachelor of Arts degrees is designed to give each student a working knowledge of a second language. The benefits are not only cultural but also practical: knowledge of a foreign language is a vital skill for those who pursue careers in business, education, social services, health care, government, and many other fields. Group IIIA, Mathematics and Physical/Life Sciences Courses in this group train students in the use of the scientific method. They expose learners to forms of inquiry that rely on observation, measurement, and the rigorous experimental testing of hypotheses. Typical Group IIIA disciplines include, but are not limited to, Anthropology, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics. Since learning an experimental science is not just a theoretical, but also a practical endeavor, students must take at least one course that includes a laboratory experience. Group IIIB, Social and Behavioral Sciences The social and behavioral sciences focus on the systematic and objective study of human behavior and social institutions. These disciplines apply rigorous methods to the observation and analysis of a broad range of human activities and interactions. Group IIIB includes courses in disciplines such as African-American and African Diaspora Studies , Anthropology, Communication, Economics, Geography, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Women's and Gender Studies. Group IIIC, Humanities Courses in the humanities help students reflect on the complexity of the human experience, appreciate the range of human thought and emotion, learn about aesthetic expression across artistic fields, and grapple with moral issues. Such courses focus on language, literature, history, art, theater, religion, philosophy, and related fields. The approach may be comparative, historical, orList of Degrees and Programs Offered 27 analytical, but the emphasis is always on strengthening the students' interpretive, critical, and writing skills. Since the development of creativity is an essential component of the humanities, students must take at least one Group IIIC course that incorporates a laboratory experience. Group IV: Diversity An appreciation for the value of diversity is one of the essential qualities of an educated person. The Group IV requirements are designed to help students deepen their understanding of how diversity contributes to the cultural, social, and intellectual growth of individuals and societies. Group IVA: History Students working towards a Bachelor of Arts degree are required to take at least one history course chosen from a set that includes U. S. History, Western Civilization, and World History. The goal of the requirement is to help students place important events in their proper historical context and appreciate the many ways in which the past still shapes our present decisions, institutions, and ways of life. Group IVB: Racial Minority Experience in the United States The goal of this requirement is to expand our students' understanding of the many racial, linguistic, cultural, and ethnic diversities that exist in the United States. In addition to their primary focus on a racial minority experience in the United States, courses in this group have a secondary focus on cultural histories, injustice, and the interconnectedness of communities. Group IVC. Additional Diversities (social class, language, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disabilities, nonwestern culture) Students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree are also required to explore diversity from the perspective of social class, religion, gender, sexuality, age, or ability. Group IVC courses focus on special populations and communities, exploring their complex relationship with\u2014 and contributions to\u2014society at large. Academic Forgiveness Policy Undergraduate students who have not attended any IU campus for at least two years, are pursuing their first bachelor's degree, and are enrolling at IU Northwest for the fall semester 2012, or later, may request academic forgiveness. Forgiveness means that all grades earned during the term(s) in question will not be counted in the calculation of the program GPA. The grades will remain on the student's official transcript and will count in the IU GPA. This policy will affect only the student's College of Arts and Sciences record. Academic forgiveness may be requested for no more than two terms of IU coursework, consecutive or not. Two consecutive summer sessions may be considered a single academic term for purposes of this policy. The petition must be submitted within the first two semesters after the two year hiatus. Students may petition the COAS office to request application of the Academic Forgiveness Policy. Students may apply for forgiveness in anticipation of entering COAS if they otherwise fit the guidelines. Students will need to provide evidence that would indicate a significant changein their ability to succeed in academic work. A semester of good grades after the hiatus and before the petition can constitute such evidence. Reevaluation of fundamental skills may be required by the Dean before the student can proceed. Academic forgiveness may be invoked only once in a student's academic career. Academic forgiveness is inapplicable to any grades issued as a result of academic dishonesty. The original grades earned by the student will remain on a student's academic record (official and unofficial transcripts), but the GPA and hours earned calculations will be adjusted appropriately in the Program statistics. Academic forgiveness does not change the Indiana University earned hours or GPA calculations. Academic forgiveness is IUN and COAS specific. Semesters forgiven at IU Northwest need not be forgiven at any other IU campuses (nor by another IUN college, school, or division).

The BA requires fewer credits that are directly linked to a particular major. Instead, students complete courses across a wide range of disciplines.This provides a great deal of flexibility to customize their education to reach their individual goals and interests. The BA programs help students develop strong written and verbal communication skills, reasoning skills, the ability to solve complex problems, to work well with others, and to adapt to a changing workplace. Students learn how to think independently, how to make sound judgments, how to discover new perspectives, and acquire the tools to defend your point of view. These are the most valuable skills of an educated person in the 21st Century. Specific Requirements In addition to the general requirements for all degrees in the university, candidates for the B.A. degree must complete Groups I-V of the distribution requirements. Students may elect to follow the requirements currently in effect or the requirements that were in effect when they matriculated. Classes may be attributed towards satisfying all designated requirements across Groups I, II, III, IV,V and the minor. For instance, a student may complete a designated mathematics course and use that to satisfy a requirement within Group I, within Group IIIA, within Group V or within the minor. No more than 9 credit hours within a single discipline will be counted across Groups I, II, III, and IV, and the minor. The list of disciplines and courses designated for each requirement group may be found in Appendix I in the Bulletin and can be searched through the Matrix App at www.iun.edu/coas/student-tools/index.htm. Group I: Foundation Courses English Composition Every student must demonstrate the ability to use correct, clear, effective English. The student may satisfy this requirement in the following way: By completing ENG W131 Elementary Composition I (3 cr.), with a grade of C (2.0) or higherGroup II: Foreign Language 29 Mathematics May be fulfilled in one of the following ways: By completing, with a grade of C (2.0) or higher, one of the following courses: MATH M100, MATH M118, MATH M119, MATH M125, MATH M127, or MATH M215. By exemption (without credit) through an appropriate examination as determined by the Department of Mathematics. Intensive Writing Intensive writing courses totalling at least 9 credit hours must be completed after completing the ENG W131 requirement: By completing intensive writing courses at the 200 level or above in the English department, or By completing \"Intensive Writing Courses\" in any arts and sciences department. If so designated, the course may also be counted toward fulfilling other arts and sciences degree requirements (e.g., distribution, major, 300-400 level). An intensive writing course is one in which the writing component is fully integrated with the content and objectives of the course. Thus, a student would not be able to pass the course without fulfilling the intensive writing component and, conversely, it would be equally impossible for a student to pass the intensive writing component and not receive a passing grade in the course. Oral Communication Every student must demonstrate the ability to deliver presentations with logical organization, proper grammar, appropriate word choices, coherent sentence structure, and that take the characteristics of the audience into account. Students may satisfy this requirement by completing SPCH S121 Public Speaking with a grade of C (2.0) or higher. First Year Seminar The first year seminar is required for students who have just begun college, those who are transferring fewer than 30 credits from a four-year college, and those transferring in from a two-year college (including TSAP students). The student may satisfy this requirement in the following way: By completing a \"First-Year Seminar\" course in any arts and sciences department. If so designated, the course may also be counted toward fulfilling other arts and sciences degree requirements. By completing and transferring at least 30 credits (not counting dual credits) from an accredited four- year college or university. Group II: Foreign Language The College of Arts and Sciences entrance requirement is two courses at the 100 level in a foreign language. Students admitted to Arts and Sciences without this background will be required to complete these courses. The requirement may be met by examination or by successful completion of the courses taken. (Two years of good high school work in a foreign language shouldenable a student to place out of the first 8 credit hours and into 200-level courses.) The B.A. degree requirement of foreign language may be fulfilled in the following ways: By completing satisfactorily 6 credit hours of course work (200 and 250) or the equivalent in a foreign language. By completing the 200 level course and two semesters of designated culture courses taught in English from the same language base. These culture courses may be taken at any point during the student's program of study of a foreign language. The two semesters of culture courses taken in lieu of 250 will only be counted under Group II and cannot simultaneously be counted in any other Group distribution. See online Matrix located on the COAS webpages for a list of acceptable classes. By attaining a placement test score sufficient for placement in courses at the first- semester third-year level or above in a foreign language. If a student places into the 250 level, she will need only to complete that class to meet the Group II requirement. SPECIAL CREDIT AS A RESULT OF PLACEMENT TEST Special credit may be awarded for the two highest courses a student tests out of (100, 150, 200, or 250), up to a maximum of 8 credits. Any student who is full-time (12cr. - 18cr.) does not need to pay for special credits under the banded tuition fee for full-time students, regardless of their freshman to senior status. Transfer and new students in their first year who are part-time are also exempt from charge for special credits. All others must pay a per credit rate for eligible special credits. For more information about the placement test and eligibility requirements, please visit: Proficiency Examinations A student may complete the language requirement by taking a proficiency examination administered by the department concerned. Please note that no credit is conferred through this process. Students with a background in a language other than those taught at IU Northwest may take an examination from the relevant department at IU Bloomington. Such examinations will be given after the student has petitioned the IU Bloomington department and received the consent of the department. Native Speakers of a Foreign Language Students are considered \"native speakers of a foreign language\" if they have completed secondary (high) school in that language. They may not earn credit for any courses at the fist or secondary-year level in their native language but they may be exempted from the foreign language requirement. If the student did not complete secondary (high) school in another language, he or she may take the placement test.30Group III: Distribution For more information about the placement test and eligibility requirements, please visit: http://www.iun.edu/ placement-testing/modern-languages/index.htm For questions, please contact the Department of Modern Languages at 219-980-6714.

Students must complete one course from the list of Group IV C courses (A complete list of courses that fulfill these requirements is located in and can be searched through the Matrix App at www.iun.edu/coas/ student-tools/index.htm . Group V: Requirements for the Major Students should plan a tentative outline of their academic program in their major with their advisors in their academic department as soon as they matriculate or declare a major. The following are minimum requirements for any major. Further and detailed requirements are to be found in the departmental statements in this bulletin. The specific departmental requirements that must be fulfilled by each student are those published in the bulletin current at thetime the major is declared, or those in the bulletin current at the time of graduation, whichever the student chooses. Group Va: Courses within the Major At least 25 credit hours must be taken in the major subject area. For B.A. programs, no major department may require more than 42 credit hours in the major. (This stipulation does not apply to interdepartmental majors.) The cumulative grade point average of courses used to satisfy the major (Group Va) must be at least 2.0. Any course in which the student receives a grade below C- (1.7) may not be used to fulfill requirements for the major. However, any non-repeated course that the student passes will count toward the 120 credit hour total. A course used to satisfy requirements for the major (Group Va) can be used to satisfy requirements in Groups I, II, III, and IV. At least 10 credit hours within the major discipline must be completed while in residence at IU Northwest. Individual departments may require a minor of 15 to 20 credit hours in another subject. Any course taken to satisfy the requirements of a minor must be completed with a grade of C- or higher; and the cumulative grade point average of all courses taken in the minor must be at least 2.0 (C). At least 6 credit hours of courses in the minor must be taken in residence at IU Northwest. (See the individual departmental listings.) Students must take 3 credit hours of capstone course work. The course may also be counted toward fulfilling other arts and sciences degree requirements (e.g., intensive writing, major, 300-400 level). Consult departmental advisors for details. Group Vb: Ancillary Courses Required by the Major Departments may require a set of ancillary courses taught outside of the major discipline to support learning within the discipline (for example, a chemistry major needs a background in calculus to succeed within chemistry). Any course in which the student receives a grade below C- (1.7) may not be used to satisfy an ancillary (Group Vb) requirement. However, any non-repeated course that the student passes will count toward the 120 credit hour total. A course used to satisfy ancillary requirements for the major (Group Vb) can be used to satisfy requirements in Groups I, II, III, IV, or a minor. They cannot be used to satisfy requirements within the major (Group Va). For procedure regarding change of major, see the Student Ombudsperson in the College Office.

Up to three courses (9cr. max) taken to satisfy the major (Group Va) may be used to satisfy requirements for the minor. Students may pursue a minor in a different discipline than their major. For instance, a French major may pursue a sociology minor, but a French major cannot pursue a French minor. Students may have more than one minor. Students' major(s) and minor(s) may be listed on their transcripts. Students must advise the College of Arts and Sciences Office of the minor(s) and receive advisement from the minor department. Students who have been awarded a baccalaureate degree cannot at a later date change the degree to include additional majors and/or minors. Bachelor of Science The Bachelor of Science degree programs are designed to provide an in depth education about a specific field. As such, they could be thought of as a specific purpose degree. The programs are focused on learning a great deal about the specific subject matter. They typically require more credits that are directly linked to the major. Students are expected to concentrate their academic energies on mastering the technical and practical facets of their field. They have fewer opportunities to explore topics outside of their major. Many students pursuing BS degrees use these credentials to enter specific careers or to prepare for specific graduate programs. Specific Requirements In addition to the general requirements for baccalaureate degrees of the university, candidates for the B.S. degree must complete the group requirements as follows. Students may elect to follow the requirements currently in effect or the requirements that were in effect when they matriculated. Classes may be attributed towards satisfying all designated requirements across Groups I, II, III, IV, V, and the minor. For instance, a student may complete a designated mathematics course and use that to satisfy a requirement within Group I, within Group IIIA, and within Group V. No more than 9 credit hours per discipline will be counted across Groups I, II, III, IV, and the minor. The list of disciplines and courses designated for each requirement group may be found in Appendix I in the Bulletin and can be searched through the Matrix App at www.iun.edu/coas/student-tools/index.htm. Minors Group I: Foundation for Effective Learning English Composition Students must demonstrate the ability to use correct, clear, effective English. The student may satisfy this requirement by completing: ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition I (3 cr.), with a grade of C (2.0) or higher. Oral Communication Every student must demonstrate the ability to deliver presentations with logical organization, proper grammar,appropriate word choices, coherent sentence structure, and that take the characteristics of the audience into account. Students may satisfy this requirement by completing SPCH-S 121 Public Speaking with a grade of C (2.0) or higher. Mathematics Every student must demonstrate mathematical reasoning. Students may satisfy this requirement in either of the following ways: By completing, with a grade of C (2.0) or higher, one of the following courses: MATH-M 100, MATH- M 118, MATH-M 119, MATH-M 125, MATH -M 127, MATH-M 215. This course can sometimes be used to satisfy requirements within the major. For example, the Mathematics and Chemistry majors require MATH-M 215. By exemption (without credit) through an appropriate examination as determined by the Department of Mathematics. First Year Seminar The first year seminar is required for students who have just begun college, those who are transferring fewer than 30 credits from a four-year college, and those transferring in from a two-year college (including TSAP students). The student may satisfy this requirement in the following way: By completing a \"First-Year Seminar\" course in any arts and sciences department. If so designated, the course may also be counted toward fulfilling other arts and sciences degree requirements. By completing and transferring at least 30 credits (not counting dual credits) from an accredited four- year college or university. Group II: Intensive Writing Two intensive writing courses (totalling at least 6 credit hours) must be completed aftercompleting the ENG W131 requirement: By completing intensive writing courses at the 200 level or above in the English department, or By completing one or two \"Intensive Writing Courses\" in any Arts and Sciences department. If so designated, the course may also be counted toward fulfilling other arts and sciences degree requirements (e.g., distribution, major, 300-400 level). An intensive writing course is one in which the writing component is fully integrated with the content and objectives of the course. Thus, a student would not be able to pass the course without fulfilling the intensive writing component and, conversely, it would be equally impossible for a student to pass the intensive writing component and not receive a passing grade in the course Group III: Distribution IIIA. Mathematics, physical sciences, and life sciences. A student must take at least one science course in Group IIIA that includes a laboratory (at least 4 credit hours of the lab and associated lecture). Departments may require additional math and science32Group IV: Diversity courses. These can be found in Group Vb of the major when applicable. IIIB. Social and behavioral sciences.

Courses Outside the College of Arts and Sciences A candidate for a baccalaureate degree in the College of Arts and Sciences must complete satisfactorily at least 105 credit hours in courses in the College of Arts and Sciences unless a student pursues a minor or a certificate in another division of the university that grants degrees. If so, the 105 credit hour minimum in Arts and Sciences may be reduced sufficiently to allow the student to fulfill the minimum number of credit hours for the other division's minor or certificate, providing that all other Arts and Sciences requirements are met. If no such non- Arts and Sciences minor or certificate is pursued, the remaining 15 credit hours may be taken in the College of Arts and Sciences or in divisions of the university that grant degrees. Any credits in excess of 120 will appear on the academic transcript and will be credited to the academic record. Courses Outside IU Northwest Current IU Northwest COAS students who seek to take additional courses at another college or university that are specifically required for their IU Northwest majorMajor in Communication 39 are strongly advised to seek prior approval by their departmental chair, the chair of the department offering the course, and the dean of COAS before those courses are taken to ensure the transfer of those courses back to IU Northwest and the acceptance of those courses for their degree requirements. Students who leave IU Northwest for a semester or longer, take courses elsewhere, and return to IU Northwest at a later date must go through the usual transfer of credit process as required for students new to IU Northwest; their department chairs and Dean have the right to deny approval of the acceptance of those courses by IU Northwest. Prior approval is advised. Double Majors and Double Degree Often, students are passionate about more than one field, are ambitious, and want to improve their marketability. In that case, students may complete the requirements of two (or more) majors and their associated distribution requirements to complete two majors, qualify for two degrees, and recieve two diplomas. That is, a student may pursue a BA in History and a BS in Geology and if the student completes both sets of major and both sets of requirements, will recieve two degrees and two diplomas. Students pursuing a double degree may use courses in either or both degrees to satisfy designated distribution requirements.

THTR-D231 Departments Biology Phone: (219) 980-6724 Webpage: http://www.iun.edu/biology About the Department of Biology Biology is the study of life. The Department of Biology at IU Northwest offers an interdisciplinary program in the life sciences leading to a Bachelor of Science degree, or a Bachelor of Arts degree. Students majoring in other subjects may also earn a Minor in Biology. Our undergraduate programs are designed to interface with the faculty's expertise in biomedical sciences, biotechnology, and environmental and ecological sciences. The programs are diverse, flexible, and designed to accommodate individuals who have a wide range of interests within the life sciences. Courses are available for students seeking preprofessional training in the medical sciences (premedical, predental, and allied health sciences), for those pursuing occupations in biotechnology, forensics, and the pharmaceutical industry, for students intending to continue with graduate studies, and for those interested in environment and conservation. We firmly believe that the training of an undergraduate student is enhanced by experience in the \"discovery side\" of the discipline. Thus, students are encouraged to participate in research with faculty mentors. Our faculty maintain active research programs, offering students the opportunity to engage in research projects across a broad spectrum of life science disciplines. Each student majoring in biology is encouraged to acquire in-depth knowledge in related scientific disciplines or in other areas of study that use biology or contribute to biological methodologies. Biology students are thus encouraged to consider obtaining a minor in another area of study. The student's advisor will help plan such aMajor in Biology - B.S. 45 program, which may be in disciplines in the College of Arts and Sciences or in other divisions of the university. In addition to course work structured for the biology major, the Biology Department offers an array of classes designed for students majoring in other disciplines who are interested in certain areas of the life sciences. The Department of Biology sponsors a chapter of Beta Beta Beta, the national biology honor society. Moreover, many of our students belong to student run organizations with faculty advisors such as the Biology Club and the PreProfessional Studies Club. These organizations foster friendships and community among students interested in the biological sciences and other sciences, and offer outside avenues for learning and gaining experience related to their formal training within the department. Special Programs for Preprofessional Students in the Health Sciences Students interested in a preprofessional curriculum for medicine, dentistry, podiatry, optometry, or other health fields should refer to the preprofessional curriculum section in this bulletin. No specific major or degree program is required for preprofessional students. Students desiring a B.S. or B.A. biology degree should consult with the biology faculty and advisor to plan their course work. Most professional schools prefer students who will have completed a B.S. or B.A. degree before actually beginning the professional curriculum. Options for Special Credit Course credit may be awarded for high scores on the Advanced Placement and College Entrance Examination Board tests. Please see the Admissions Office and/or the Biology Department for more information. Major in Biology - B.S.

Psychology Phone: (219) 980-6680 Website: http://www.iun.edu/psychology/ About the Department of Psychology The Department of Psychology offers a major in psychology leading to the B.A. degree and the B.S. degree, a major in neuroscience leading to a B.A. degree and the B.S. degree, a major in psychology with a concentration in Women's and Gender Studies leading to the B.A. degree, a Masters in Clinical Counseling to help prepare students for work in Addictions Counseling, and provides course work for undergraduates who want to satisfy distribution requirements. As a science, psychology seeks to understand the basic principles by which living organisms adapt their behavior to the changing physical and social environments in which they live. The breadth of the discipline, with its links to the humanities, mathematics, and other social and natural sciences, encourages the development of broad problem-solving skills through exposure to experimental methodology and statistical analysis, and contributes to personal growth and the development of communication skills. Techniques and skills obtained in the B.A. and B.S. programs are applicable in many careers and provide background for students entering graduate work in psychology and related areas, as well as the professions of medicine, dentistry, law, and business. Career opportunities for psychology majors at the bachelor's degree level exist in mental health clinics, social welfare agencies, government, personnel departments, and business and industry. A wider range of professional opportunities is open to those who complete master's or doctoral degrees. It is strongly recommended that prospective majors discuss their career objectives with a member of the Department of Psychology early so that appropriate course planning can be accomplished. The Department of Psychology maintains a chapter of Psi Chi, the international honor society in psychology. With both academic and social interests, the chapter sponsors speakers, workshops, films, and field trips. Students interested in joining should contact the department chairperson.

Anthropology Anthropology gives students a holistic understanding of human existence in an ecological, evolutionaryperspective. It studies the interrelationships of human biology and human behavior, particularly that behavior which we call culture, both in the past and in the present.

Credits Eligible for Transfer from Institutions Other than Indiana University A maximum of 90 credit hours at an institution other than Indiana University can be applied to the B.G.S. degree, provided that grades are at least C. In order for transfer credit to be applied to any of the required areas of learning, courses taken must be equivalent in nature to those offered by Indiana University in these areas. Courses taken at another institution in which the student received the grade of C- or below will not be transferable for credit. In addition, there is a 64 credit hour maximum for courses applied toward the B.G.S. degree from community/associate's colleges. Students who have been dismissed from another postsecondary institution cannot be admitted to the General Studies Degree Program until at least one calendar year has passed since the date of dismissal. University regulations require that the admissions office indicate on the credit transfer report any deficiencies in grade point average (grade point average below 2.0 on a 4.0 scale) at another institution. Credit by Examination at Other Institutions If the transcript indicates credit by examination, and if students do not enroll in sequential courses to validate their knowledge in the subject matter, credit will be granted only on the basis of review by the appropriate academic department of Indiana University. Credits Awarded for Educational Programs in Noncollegiate Organizations Where relevant to the academic program sponsored by the General Studies Degree Program, the Program will consider the evaluation and credit recommendations of the two publications below as a guide in awarding credit to persons who have successfully completed noncollegiate or in- company sponsored instruction: American Council on Education, The National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs University of the State of New York, A Guide to Educational Programs in Noncollegiate Organizations Military Service and Law Enforcement Credit Veterans of military service and military and law enforcement personnel on active duty are eligible for academic credit as a result of their training and experience.

Copies of official discharge, separation papers, certificates of completion (in-service schools), or transcripts must be submitted as a basis for granting credit. Consult the BGS advisor for detail. Bachelor of Applied Science The Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) is an interdisciplinary degree designed for students who have completed an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and who would benefit from a Bachelor's degree for career or personal advancement. The BAS gives students theunique opportunity to apply sixty of their technical AAS credits to an Indiana University bachelor's degree. Since the credits accumulated in these types of programs do not readily transfer to traditional baccalaureate programs, the BAS degree was designed to provide students with an opportunity to advance their professional skills. The BAS is a very flexible degree. Every student could design his or her own program of study. Students will work closely with an academic advisor to select a set of classes that best fits his or her individual needs. Not only can students build a unique curriculum that aligns with his or her educational and career goals, but students can complete the degree while taking only classes on campus, taking only classes offered online, or any combination of the above. The BAS degree is a joint degree program by all five IU-managed regional campuses. The joint degree format permits the campuses to share faculty resources and thereby provide educational opportunities to students in their regions that those students might not otherwise have. Students may take BAS courses from any of the five campuses and have those courses apply to their BAS degree at their home campus. Admission The Bachelor of Applied Science is a degree-completion program, and all incoming students must have an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree from a regionally accredited community college. This degree is not available for traditional freshmen. Please speak with an advisor if you have any questions. Degrees Awarded with Distinction The Bachelor of Applied Science Program recognizes outstanding performance in course work by awarding degrees with three levels of distinction: distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction. In order to graduate with distinction, students must have at least 60 graded IU credit hours towards the BAS degree. (Pass/fail and self- acquired competency credits and courses not applicable to the degree such as remedial courses are not counted in calculating the number of credit hours.) Courses with S grades (not self-acquired competency) are counted in these 60 hours. The levels of distinction, which are printed on both the student's transcript and the IU diploma, are determined by the overall cumulative grade point average of each graduating class and generally approximates the following GPAs: 3.50-3.74 distinction 3.75-3.89 high distinction 3.90-4.00 highest distinction Required Areas of Study The curriculum consists of 120 credit hours (60-64 of those are transferred in from an accredited community college). The courses are divided between four specific sets of courses: General education courses (can be taken at IU Northwest or transferred in) Applied science courses (transferred from an accredited community college) Required BAS Core Courses (18 credits from required competencies)Graduate 87 Required track courses Electives Currently, there are two available tracts: 1) Health Management and 2) Interdisciplinary. Using the Interdisciplinary Tract, you can create your own program designed to meet the goals of the individual student. In addition, several other tracts may be added. Please see a General Studies advisor (980-6828) for more information and for a complete curricular mapping of each concentration. Consult the website for program updates at www.iun.edu and search BAS Program. Required Courses Course requirements fall into five categories, and are defined by student learning outcomes. 1.General Education (varies by campus) 30 - 42 hours Using the Statewide General Education Core as the basis, campuses will retain their own general education curriculum. Some campuses require more than the 30 hours in the SGEC. However, many AAS degree- holders will have earned 9 - 15 credit hours in general education as part of their AAS degree, and those courses are expected to count toward the general education requirements of each campus. 2.Applied Science Courses (transferred in from an AAS degree) 48 - 51 hours 3.BAS Core (required) 18 hours Students take courses that meet the following learning outcomes: 1.Demonstrate knowledge and skills in accounting and bookkeeping. 2.Demonstrate knowledge and skills in economics. 3.Demonstrate knowledge and skills in legal, ethical, social, and/or international topics. 4.Demonstrate knowledge and skills in supervision. 5.Demonstrate knowledge and skills in marketing. 6.Demonstrate knowledge and skills in communication. 4.BAS Track (one required) 12 hours Students must select either the Health Care Management track, the Sustainability track or the Individualized track. The Health Care Management track is designed to appeal to individuals who hold an AAS degree in one of the many health care fields (such as Medical Assisting, Health Care Support, Paramedic Science, and Medical Laboratory Technology). In this track, students take courses that meet the following learning outcomes: 1.Compare and contrast the U.S. health-care system, including reimbursement, with other systems around the world. 2.Demonstrate an understanding of the ethical, legal, financial, and political factors that influence the provision of health services in the U.S.3.Evaluate access to and cost of US health care, including reimbursement practices, for different types of care. 4.Effectively assess and implement improvements in clinical care, customer service, and human resource planning in a health care setting. 5.(Capstone) Integrate knowledge and skills and apply to health management issues or challenges. The Sustainability Studies track has the following learning outcomes: 1.Students will describe how environment, society, and economy are interrelated and impact each other. 2.Students will articulate how their educational experiences applies to work and career choices. 3.Students will apply principles of sustainability to innovatively solve problems and implement sustainable practices. The Individualized track is a highly flexible track designed to meet the needs of many different AAS degree holders. For example, a student with an AAS in Criminal Justice who wants to advance his or her career in criminal justice might design a track to include upper-division courses in Criminal Justice, Public Affairs, or (if he or she works with youth offenders and their families) Sociology and Psychology. A student with an AAS in Design Technology who wishes to change careers might select courses in web development and graphic design. A student with an AAS in Advanced Manufacturing who has a goal of becoming a supervisor or manager might choose courses emphasizing human resource development, communication, and other management skills. In this track, students select 12 hours of courses based on their individual interests, backgrounds, and needs. One of these courses will be a required capstone course. The learning outcomes for this track are as follows: 1.Demonstrate the ability to think critically in the fields studied. 2.Effectively present central ideas, issues, and methods of inquiry specific to the fields studied. Apply knowledge and skills from general education, the BAS core, and the Individualized Track to issues or challenges in their area of technical expertise. 5. Electives 0 - 12 hours Courses counted toward the concentration must be taken for a letter grade. Students must maintain an overall GPA of 2.0 or higher. As per IU campus policy, at least 30 hours must be at the 300 level or higher.

Policies and Procedures The general regulations and policies detailed in this bulletin apply to all students in the college's graduate and post-baccalaureate programs. General Scholarship Rule Any student who does not possess the necessary preliminary training or who lacks other qualifications may be required by the college to enroll in such courses designated by the college or other corrective actions as is necessary or desirable. The college may review a student's record at any time and take whatever actions seem necessary for the best interest of that student or the college. Any student whose work is unsatisfactory or whose conduct is unethical may be dismissed from the college. Academic Regulations Students must have their programs of study approved by the program director. Courses at the 300 or 400 level that are available to be taken for graduate credit as a graduate level class will include additional assignments beyond those required90Master of Science in Clinical Counseling for undergraduate credit. Enrollment in such courses requires the approval of the instructor and of the program director. It is sometimes possible for a student to take a graduate level course at IUN or elsewhere that can count as an elective in the graduate program; permission for this must be given by the program director before the student registers. Students who have graduate course credits before they enroll in one of the graduate programs may have some credits transferred into the program, but such transfers of credits will not be considered until the student has demonstrated satisfactory progress in their current program. Courses used for another degree or certificate cannot also be used to satisfy graduate program requirements. An average grade of B (3.0) is required for graduation, and no course with a grade lower than B-(2.7) will be counted toward the degree. Students are required to retain good academic standing, i.e., to maintain a GPA of at least 2.7. Failure to maintain good standing may result in dismissal from the program. Students whose GPA falls below 3.0 are considered to be on probation; they must earn at least a B- in each of their next two classes with a 3.0 GPA in those two classes in order to continue in the program. Other academic regulations and policies are established by the Graduate Studies Committees of the College of Arts and Sciences. Students should consult their program director for further information. Master of Science in Clinical Counseling Admission Students are admitted to the Master of Clinical Counseling program by the MSCC Admissions Committee of the Psychology Department.

Students interrupting their studies, pursuing part-time study, or full-time students taking more than one year to complete prerequisite requirements are subject to policy and curriculum changes as they occur. Curriculum changes during the progress toward the degree may result in revision of degree requirements. Drug-free Campus Students are prohibited by Indiana University to use or possess alcoholic beverages, any drug or controlled substance, or drug paraphernalia on university property or in the course of a university activity or student organization activity. Students are responsible for acquainting themselves with this policy and the sanctions for violation of the policy. Professional Liability Insurance All students in the College of Health and Human Services having patient/client contact will be covered under the malpractice contract for Indiana University. This liability insurance will not extend to employment outside of course-related activities. The student should be aware that failure to pay course and other fees will result in non-coverage under the malpractice contract of Indiana University. Such non-coverage makes the student ineligible to attend clinical classes. Some programs may require additional professional liability insurance; see specific program policies. Standards of Conduct Students are subject to the standards of conduct as defined in Indiana University's Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. Stated due process will be followed for any student found to be in violation of this code. All Indiana University students are responsible for acquainting themselves with and adhering to policies outlined in this document. Additionally, all students are expected to adhere to the College of Health and Human Services Honor Code of Professional Conduct. The CHHS Code can be found at: http://www.iun.edu/chhs/ docs/chhs_code_conduct.pdf . Dress Code In clinical courses, students wear the designated uniform of the program. All students wear the designated photo identification badge when in a clinical agency. Students not appropriately attired may be asked to leave the clinical area by their instructor. Such an occurrence constitutes an absence. See program information for program-specific policies.Drug Screen Clinical sites may require students to have a drug screen prior to attending clinical at their agency, or may require one on demand in certain situations. Failure to comply immediately will result in removal from the site and possible dismissal from the program. Additionally, a positive drug screen may prevent students from being able to be placed in a clinical agency. See program information for program-specific policies. Health Requirements Students in many College of Health and Human Services programs are required to show proof that they have met the immunization, physical examination, and laboratory examination requirements of hospitals and other health agencies used for clinical experiences, as well as CPR certification. Specific instructions will be distributed prior to clinical assignment. Failure to meet those health requirements will make the student ineligible for clinical classes. See program information for program-specific policies. Criminal History Check Many of the clinical sites where College of Health and Human Services students complete their hands-on clinical experiences (such as hospitals, clinics, and other agencies) require verification of having undergone a criminal background check before students can be placed in their organizations. Failure to meet this requirement will make the student ineligible for clinical classes. It is possible that a positive criminal history may prevent students from progressing in a College of Health and Human Services program. See program information for program-specific policies. Transportation Students are to provide their own transportation for educational experiences requiring travel. Classes and clinical facilities are distributed in various locations throughout Northwest Indiana and the Chicago area, with limited public transportation. Students using cars for clinical must be able to show proof of auto insurance that is compliant with Indiana law. In addition, the student must show proof of a valid driver's license. Indiana University does not assume liability for individual incidents involving personal vehicles. Policies & Procedures Admission to the College of Health and Human Services programs requires a separate application and admission process. The admission policies of individual programs within the College comply with the following standards. Disciplinary Probation Disciplinary probation is administered according to theCollege of Health and Human Services Disciplinary and Appeals Process . Absences Loss of time in any one clinical area may require that the student repeat the course. Faculty will distribute program- specific absence policies. Audit Students An audit student officially registers for a class and pays applicable credit hour rates. Upon completion, the course is entered on the permanent university record as one taken for no credit (NC). Check with your academic98Class Standing counselor for specific instructions. Required general education courses taken for NC will not apply toward completion of program requirements. Students may not audit any clinical course. The opportunity to audit a didactic course is dependent on the availability of space and permission of the instructor. Class Standing Within Indiana University, class standing is based on the total number of credit hours a student has earned. However, within a program, class standing is assigned according to a student's progress in the professional curriculum. Completion of Degree Requirements The program records specialist must receive removal of all Incomplete and deferred grades, special credit, and Independent Study course grades no later than three weeks prior to the end of classes of the student's last semester before graduation. Cumulative Grade Point Average All work attempted at Indiana University is used to calculate the cumulative grade point average. Courses transferred from another institution are not included for calculation in the cumulative grade point average. However, the pre-program grade point average is calculated by including all (transfer and IU) courses used toward the degree. Dismissal Upon the recommendation of the faculty in the student's program, a student may be dismissed from the College of Health and Human Services. Dismissal is based on the failure to meet academic or professional standards. The student will be informed of the dismissal in writing by the dean of the College of Health and Human Services or the dean's representative. A student in the College of Health and Human Services may be dismissed from the school when, in the judgment of the faculty, the student has ceased to make satisfactory progress toward a degree. When an undergraduate student fails to attain a C (2.0) grade point average in any two consecutive academic sessions, has a cumulative grade point average below C (2.0) for two consecutive sessions, or fails to earn higher than a D (1.0) grade point average in any one semester or has a pattern of withdrawal from professional courses, the student is automatically considered to be making unsatisfactory progress toward a degree and is thereby eligible for dismissal. In addition, a student who fails to meet program-specific academic requirements is considered not to be making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree and may be dismissed. At the time of initial enrollment, each student receives a copy of the program-specific academic requirements. A student failing to meet the standards of professional and personal conduct may also be recommended for dismissal. Honors The College of Health and Human Services offers the following honors to recognize superior student performances. In addition, see specific program information.Degrees Awarded with Distinction To graduate with academic distinction, degree candidates must rank within the highest 10 percent of the graduating class. Additionally, baccalaureate degree candidates must have completed a minimum of 60 credit hours at Indiana University. Academic distinction is conferred on graduates as follows: 3.83 - 4.00 Highest Distinction 3.66 - 3.82 High Distinction 3.50 - 3.65 Distinction Distinction is based on course work completed at Indiana University, including the final semester. Dean's List Full time students at IU Northwest who earned a 3.3 grade point average or higher for the semester and part time students who earned a 3.3 grade point average or higher carrying 12 credit hours or more during the regular academic school year are placed on the Dean's List. Programs have specific policies regarding reinstatement or reenrollment of students who have withdrawn or are dismissed. See program specific information. Intercampus Transfers Students in good academic standing may seek intercampus transfer by petitioning the faculty on the campus of desired transfer at least one semester in advance of requested transfer. Intercampus transfer requests will be evaluated individually on the basis of student record review and the availability of course positions, faculty, and facilities to meet student needs and program objectives. Probation Upon the recommendation of the faculty in the student's program, a student is placed on probation. Probationary recommendations are made when the student does not meet standards of academic performance or professional behavior. A student will be placed on academic probation for the academic session following the one in which the student fails to attain a minimum C (2.0) cumulative and semester grade point average. Individual programs may have additional academic and professional standards. A student who fails to meet these program-specific standards may also be placed on probation. Students are informed of program- specific standards upon entering the program. A student will be removed from probation after satisfactorily completing the program's specified requirements. Students are notified in writing of probationary actions by the College of Health and Human Services dean or the dean's representative. Residency Requirement A minimum of 51 percent of the required courses must be completed at Indiana University. Courses assigned to the Indiana University transcript through the process of validation will not count toward meeting the residency requirement. The Indiana University campus on which the student met the residency requirement will award the degree. Some program exceptions may exist, See program specific requirements. Semester Load To be considered a full-time student by the university, the student must register for a minimum of 12 credit hoursCurriculum 99 each fall and spring semester and a total of 6 or more credit hours during a summer session. The maximum load is 18 credit hours. Students who want to carry more than 18 credits must obtain permission of the program director or dean. In addition, students should have a cumulative B (3.0) average or have earned a B (3.0) average in their last semester. Students in Good Standing Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of C (2.0) and a minimum grade point average of 2.0 for the most recent academic session and meet additional programmatic, academic, and professional standards in order to be considered in good standing. Students are informed of programmatic, academic, and professional standards during program orientation. Withdrawals (Grade of W) Withdrawals are issued to students wishing to withdraw from any or all courses if the official withdrawal process is completed by the automatic withdrawal deadline dates printed in the current class schedule. A grade of W will appear on student transcripts when students complete the official withdrawal process with the appropriate approval. After the automatic withdrawal deadline, the grade awarded will be an F or W as determined by the instructor. Withdrawal after the automatic deadline is not automatic and requires approval of the College of Health and Human Services dean or the dean's representative; permission will be granted only in extraordinary circumstances. W is an option after the withdrawal deadline only if the student is passing. A grade of FN will be recorded on the official transcript if a student stops attending but does not officially withdraw from class. Schools & Divisions Applied Health Sciences Administrator Linda R.

Krause, CDA, LDH, MPA Assistant Dean, College of Health & Human Services Director, Dental Education, Clinical Associate Professor Web site: www.iun.edu/dental / Phone: (219) 980-6770 About Dental Education The IU Northwest Dental Education department offers an entry-level Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene degree, a Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene Degree Completion program, and a Certificate in Dental Assisting. Detailed information is presented in the sections that follow. While every effort has been made to provide accurate information, students should seek academic advice from the Dental Education Advisor before making final decisions based on the program descriptions contained in this bulletin. Mission The mission of the Dental Education Programs is to be a leader in providing high quality education and clinical experiences to undergraduate students for future roles as oral healthcare providers. Our programs are committed to excellence in the theory and practice of dental hygiene/dental assisting and in the development of competent, socially sensitive, culturally diverse, and ethically responsible professionals.Program Goals At the completion of the dental hygiene/dental assisting programs students will be able to: A. Exhibit the highest level of competency and professionalism B. Deliver high quality patient care by the use of sound judgement, critical thinking skills, and evidence-based decision making C. Emphasize the role of the dental hygienist/dental assistant as a patient educator and advocate involved in community oral health engagement activities related to health promotion and disease prevention Accreditation The programs in Dental Assisting and Dental Hygiene are accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation. The Commission is a specialized accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. The Commission on Dental Accreditation can be contacted at (800) 621-8099 ext. 4653 or at 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611-2678. The Commission's web address is: http://www.ada.org/en/ coda. Professional Student Memberships Students currently enrolled in one of the accredited Dental Education programs are required to be a member of the national, state, and local constituents of the American Dental Assistants' Association (ADAA) or the American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA). In addition, there are many member benefits for students including opportunities for personal and professional development. The purpose of this membership is for the students to become familiar with the organization and structure of their professional association. Admission Policies Essential Performance Standards A certificate in dental assisting or degree in dental hygiene attests to the mastery of knowledge and skills. Graduates must possess the essential knowledge and skills to function in a variety of clinical situations and render a wide spectrum of patient care in a safe and effective manner. The Dental Education faculty has therefore specified non- academic criteria, Essential Performance Standards , which all applicants and students are expected to meet in order to participate in the dental assisting and dental hygiene programs. These criteria include the following five categories: observation; communication; motor function; intellectual-conceptual, integrative and qualitative abilities; and behavior and social attributes. Dental Education Policy & Procedure Handbook All Dental Education students are provided with a Dental Education Policy & Procedure Handbook prior to their Student Orientation . This document is updated annually to reflect ongoing changes in clinical and program requirements and policies. While the Dental Education department provides these updates, it is the student's responsibility to maintain the currency of the handbook and refer to the most current regulations. CPR Requirement All Dental Education students enrolled in their respective programs must present evidence of current healthcareDental Assisting Admission Procedures 101 provider certification prior to the beginning of each year. Two options are available: American Heart Association's Basic Life Support for HealthCare Provider level (preferred) American Red Cross CPR/AED for the Professional Rescuer OSHA Regulations Health requirements and OSHA regulations include annual education on bloodborne pathogens. See the Dental Education Policy & Procedure Handbook for annual regulatory requirements. Health Requirements All Dental Education students must show proof annually that they have met the immunization, physical examination, and dental examination requirements prior to participating in any clinical courses. Specific instructions are distributed prior to the Student Orientation . Special circumstances may arise which require additional action. Failure to meet health requirements and their deadlines makes the student ineligible for clinical courses and therefore, the student will receive an absence(s). Criminal Background Checks Most of the clinical sites where IU Northwest Dental Education students complete their hands-on clinical experiences require a national criminal background check before students can be placed in their assigned facilities. Based on the requirements of these agencies, as well as state and federal regulations, all students in the Dental Education programs must undergo a national background check prior to admission and annually thereafter. The Dental Education department has selected CastleBranch.com to complete these background checks. The results of a student's background check may impact his or her admission status in the Dental Education programs, preclude students from attending clinical, and/ or affect ability to obtain licensure. If an incident occurs that would change the student's background check, the student is required to notify the Dental Education department immediately. The student will be required to pay for a background re-check. Failure to adhere to the above policy will result in dismissal from the program. The student will not be able to re-register until this requirement is met. The student will be responsible for any late registration fees incurred. If clinical time is missed, the student is subject to the clinical absence policy. Drug Screen Policy Some clinical sites may require a drug screen. In addition, faculty reserves the right to require a drug screen, at the student's expense, if the situation warrants. Failure to comply immediately will result in dismissal from the Dental Education program. Personal Health Insurance The Dental Education department strongly encourages students to carry personal health insurance. The department will not be liable for any health problems requiring medical treatment for students enrolled in the programs. Professional Liability Insurance All students in the Dental Education programs having patient/client contact are covered under the malpractice contract for Indiana University. This liability insurancedoes not extend to employment outside of course- related activities. The student should know that failure to pay course and other fees results in non-coverage under Indiana University's malpractice contract. Non- coverage makes the student ineligible to attend clinicals or externships.

National Background Check Policy Most of the clinical sites where Indiana University Northwest School of Nursing students complete their hands-on clinical experiences (such as hospitals, clinics, and other agencies) require a national criminal background check before students can be placed in112Admission Policies their organization. Based on the requirements of these agencies, as well as state and federal regulations, all students in the School of Nursing must undergo a national background check prior to admission and annually thereafter (more information will be given on admission). The background check includes the residency history for the past seven years, including all counties of residence. The results of a student's background check may impact his or her admission status in the School of Nursing, preclude students from attending clinical, and/or affect ability to obtain licensure as a registered nurse (RN) in the state of Indiana and other states. Per the School of Nursing's clinical affiliation agreements, all background checks that are other than negative will be sent to the student's clinical agency/agencies for review. If a clinical agency refuses to allow a student to participate in a clinical at the agency, the student may not be allowed to progress in the nursing program. If an incident occurs that would change your background check, you are required to notify the School of Nursing immediately. You may be required to pay for a background re-check. Failure to adhere to the above policy will result in dismissal from the program. The student will not be able to re-register until this requirement is met. The student will be responsible for any late registration fees incurred. If clinical time is missed, the student is subject to the clinical absence policy. Health Requirements All nursing students at IU Northwest must show proof that they have met the immunization (including mandatory yearly seasonal flu vaccination), physical examination, and laboratory examination requirements of hospitals and other health agencies used for clinical experiences, as well as health care provider CPR certification. Specific instructions will be distributed prior to clinical assignment. Failure to meet those health requirements will make the student ineligible for clinical classes. Annual OSHA training related to blood-borne pathogens is required of all students. Students will be notified of training dates and times. The School of Nursing faculty and administrators strongly encourage students to carry personal health insurance. The school will not be liable for any health problems requiring medical treatment for students enrolled in programs, including illness or injury during clinical rotation. Students failing to submit documentation by the stated deadline will not be able to attend clinical courses. The clinical absence policy applies. Drug Screen Policy Some clinical sites require a drug screen. In addition, faculty reserve the right to require a drug screen, at the student's expense, if the situation warrants. Failure to comply immediately will result in dismissal from the nursing program. Dress Code Nursing students wear the designated uniform of the school. All students wear the designated photo identification badge. For experience in community nursing, all students wear the uniform designated by agency policy.Students not appropriately attired may be asked to leave the clinical area by their instructor. Such an occurrence constitutes an absence. Application Ineligiblity A student shall be ineligible for the nursing program if, by the second completed attempt, he/she fails to earn a minimum grade of C (2.0) in any required general- education course. Students may repeat no more than three required general-education courses. Of the three courses, no more than two sciences may be repeated. A pattern of course withdrawals may reduce the student's chances of admission to the undergraduate nursing program. Students must meet minimum cumulative and pre-nursing GPA requirements. Eligibility for Licensure Any person who makes application for examination and registration as a registered nurse in the state of Indiana shall submit to the Indiana State Board of Nursing at the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency written evidence, verified by oath, that he/she has completed an approved high school course of study or the equivalent as approved by the appropriate educational agency; has completed the prescribed curriculum in a state- accredited school of nursing and holds a diploma or certificate there from; and has not been convicted of any act that would constitute a ground for disciplinary sanction under the state board rules and regulations or of any felony that has direct bearing on the individual's ability to practice competently. (Note: Convictions include the possession and use of drugs or controlled substances.) Most states, including Indiana, require a national criminal background check. Rules and regulations governing licensing in Indiana are available from the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency. International students and graduates of schools of nursing that are outside the United States must meet the requirements of the Indiana State Board of Nursing for eligibility to sit for the licensing examination. Application for National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) The School of Nursing will make available the necessary forms to take the examination in Indiana. Those students taking the examination in other states are responsible for obtaining the appropriate forms from those states. It is the student's responsibility to complete the application process and meet the mailing and payment deadlines for taking the NCLEX (state board examination for licensure). School of Nursing Dean's List Full-time undergraduate students in the School of Nursing will be placed on the School of Nursing Dean's List each semester that they receive a GPA of 3.5 or above. Part-time students will be honored after they have had consecutive fall and spring semesters (during the same academic year) on a part-time basis and they have accumulated 12 credit hours or more. Repeating Courses Academic Policies 113 See School of Nursing Policy on repeat of Nursing courses. Academic Policies Academic Standing/Progression Standards Students Admitted to the Nursing Major The following policies apply to all students admitted to the baccalaureate major in the School of Nursing. Good Standing Students who maintain a C (2.0) or higher average in all courses, a grade of C (2.0) or higher in all courses required for the degree, and a grade of S in clinical nursing courses will be in good academic standing. Academic Probation A student will be placed on probation when any of the following conditions exist: 1.Cumulative grade point average is below 2.0. 2.Semester grade point average is below 2.0. 3.A grade below C has been earned in a required course. 4.Professional or personal misconduct (may result in dismissal from the School of Nursing).

A student may be dismissed from the School of Nursing without being placed on probation when any of these conditions exist. The faculty reserves the right to require the withdrawal of any student whose personal integrity, health, or conductdemonstrates unfitness to continue preparation for professional nursing. Dismissal is subject to the appeal process. The student can initiate the appeal through a letter sent to the coordinator of Student Services, who will forward it to the faculty. Reentry Failure to register in each sequential semester, excluding summer sessions, constitutes an interruption in the student's program. Students who have so interrupted their programs are required to submit written request of intent to reenter the program to the academic advisor. All requests for reentry will be evaluated on the basis of available resources. Students who reenter must adhere to the academic policies in effect at the time of reentry. Reentry of students who have interrupted their study, for any reason, is not guaranteed. Reentry may require vaidation of skill competency. Graduation/Degree Requirements Prospective students should study the requirements for admission to the School of Nursing, the specific curriculum requirements and sequences, and requirements for the degree. Students are responsible for meeting degree requirements and for making application for the degree. The deadlines for filing the application for a degree are September 1 for December and May graduation. The School of Nursing is not responsible for certifying students for the degree if they do not file the application. All candidates for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree must fulfill the following requirements: 1.Satisfactory completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours that apply to the degree. 2.Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. 3.Minimum of a C (2.0) in each required course or equivalent.

S/F Grades for Clinical Nursing Courses A student must receive a grade of S (satisfactory) in each clinical nursing course. Failure to receive a grade of S constitutes failure. An S indicates a grade of A, B, or C (2.0). Faculty evaluate the quailty of clinical performance by standards listed in course syllabi. Repeat of Nursing Courses A student who receives less than a C (2.0) in a nursing didactic course or less than an S in a clinical course may be permitted to repeat the course. A student will receive no more than two opportunities to successfully complete a given nursing course. Failure to receive a C (2.0) upon repeating a nursing course or failure in two or more nursing didactic or clinical nursing courses will result in dismissal. Repeat of Required General Education Courses To qualify for admission and progression, a student must earn a grade of C (2.0) or higher in all required general- education courses (C- is not acceptable) by the second completed attempt. Students may repeat no more than three (3) required B.S.N. general- education courses. Of114 B.S.N. Curriculum Plans the three (3) courses, no more than two (2) sciences may be repeated. Pass/Fail Option A maximum of 6 elective credit hours taken under this option may be applied to the B.S.N. degree. Required prerequisite courses may not be taken uder this option. Independent Study Courses Required and elective courses for the nursing major, except public speaking, currently available as independent study at Indiana University may be taken for credit. Some courses, however, may not meet degree requirements. Students must contact the Coordinator of Nursing Student Services before enrollment. Nursing majors are required to have the academic advisor's signature for all independent study courses. Final examinations in all independent study courses must be completed no later than three weeks prior to the expected graduation date. Courses Excluded from the Degree Credits earned in remedial courses do not apply to the B.S.N. degree. Credits from courses that have been repeated may be counted only one time to meet the credit hour requirement for the degree. The second completed attempt will be counted toward the GPA. Withdrawal from a Nursing Course If a student withdraws from a didactic course, withdrawal from the co-requisite clinical course is required (and vice versa) if it is before the Automatic Withdrawal Date. A pattern of withdrawals may make the student ineligible to progress; see the School of Nursing Withdrawal Policy. Seven-Year Limit Anatomy and Physiology I and II, Microbiology, Chemistry, Statistics, and Life Span Development have a seven year age limit. Students may opt to (1) take the course again or (2) challenge the course by examination. B.S.N. Curriculum Plans General Education Requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.)

Academic Policies Academic Standing/Progression Standards for Students Admitted to the MSN Program Good Standing: Students must achieve a grade of B- or higher in all nursing courses, and maintain a grade point average of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing. Academic Probation: A student is placed on academic probation when the cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 or if he or she earns below a B- in a required course. Students who are placed on academic probation for two semesters will be dismissed from the program. A student will be placed on probation when any of the following conditions exist:1.Cumulative grade point average is below 3.0. 2.Semester grade point average is below 3.0. 3.A grade below B- has been earned in a required course. Academic probation will be removed after the semester when the following conditions exist: 1.Cumulative grade point average is 3.0 or higher. 2.Semester grade point average is 3.0 or higher. 3.A grade of B- or above has been earned in the required course(s). Dismissal: A MSN student may be dismissed from the program when, in the judgment of the Graduate Faculty Council, there is a lack of progress toward the degree. Lack of progress includes, but is not limited to the following: Failure to achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Failure to meet Indiana University School of Nursing Essential Abilities expectations (refer to the Statement of Essential Abilities listed under General Policies of the School of Nursing in this section of this publication). Failure to achieve a grade of B- or above in a nursing course after two attempts. Dismissal may occur without prior probation for certain reasons, including but not limited to the following. Any student who is academically dismissed at one Indiana University campus is also in dismissal status at all other Indiana University campuses. Falsification of records and reports, plagiarism, or cheating on an examination, quiz, or any other assignment is cause for dismissal (see Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct; and CHHS Code of Conduct). The faculty reserves the right to dismiss any nursing student whose personal integrity, health, or conduct demonstrates unfitness to continue preparation for the profession of nursing. Integrity and conduct is judged according to the standards of the most recent Code of Ethics for Nurses as adopted by the American Nurses' Association and the IU School of Nursing Statement of Essential Abilities.

The dismissal of any nursing student is contingent upon review by the Graduate Faculty Council on the campus of enrollment. Nursing student dismissal is subject to the CHHS Disciplinary and Appeals Process. Reentry/Reinstatement: Failure to register in each sequential semester, including summer sessions, constitutes an interruption in the student's program. Students who have so interrupted their programs are required to submit written request of intent to reenter the program to the Graduate Track Coordinator. All requests for reentry will be evaluated on the basis of available resources. Students who reenter must adhere to the academic policies in effect at the time of reentry. Reentry of students who have interrupted their study, for any reason, is not guaranteed. Reentry may require validation of knowledge and skills competency. M.S.N. Curriculum Plan 119 Graduation/Degree Requirements: Grades for Clinical Nursing Courses Students must receive a grade of (S)atisfactory in all clinical courses. Failure to receive a grade of S constitutes failure. When the clinical course is part of an overall didactic course, the student must receive a minimum of B- in the didactic portion and an S in the clinical portion to pass the course. Repeat of Nursing Courses See Resuming Progression below. Students may repeat a course only once. Failure to successfully complete both the didactic and clinical portions (where applicable) of any course on the second attempt will result in dismissal. Withdrawal : Withdrawal from a Nursing Course: Students may withdraw from a course via One.IU until the automatic withdrawal deadline. Once the deadline for course withdrawals has passed, the student will need the permission of the Director of the School of Nursing to withdraw and a grade of either \"F\" or \"W\" will be awarded as determined by the instructor. \"W\" is an option after the withdrawal deadline only if the student is passing with a didactic grade of B (3.0) and/or a satisfactory clinical performance. If the student stops attending, but does not officially withdraw from the class, an \"FN\" will be recorded on the transcript. More than one (1) academic withdrawal in a semester is considered lack of progress toward the degree. Note: Withdrawal from the didactic portion of a course requires withdrawal from the clinical portion of the course also. Withdrawal from Nursing Program: Students who wish to withdraw from all courses are required to make an appointment and meet with the Graduate Track Coordinator or Associate Director. Withdrawal from the nursing program requires a student to seek reinstatement to the program. Resuming Progression : Eligible nursing students who wish to resume studies or repeat a course must request approval (i.e. petition) from the faculty. Students must include a Plan for Success addressing areas of deficiency in their request. Nursing students who wish to resume progression must submit a written request to the Graduate Track Coordinator by May 1 for fall reinstatement, October 1 for spring reinstatement, and February 1 for summer session reinstatement. This request requires a list of the specific courses in which the student wishes to enroll and, as appropriate, an explanation of any extenuating circumstances that may have hindered academic performance, and a Plan for Success addressing areas of deficiency. All requests for progression are evaluated on the basis of available resources, and, if appropriate, on the satisfactory completion of any conditions and /or faculty recommendations' existing at the time progression was disrupted. Resuming students must adhere to the academic policies in effect at the time of resuming studies, and to any conditions applied to approval of the request. Students withdrawing from required nursing coursework are considered to be out-of-sequence students. The date of graduation for out-of-sequence students is not guaranteed.Time Limit on Coursework All coursework must be completed in 4 years (10 semesters). M.S.N.

The School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IU Northwest offers academic programs at the baccalaureate and master's degree levels for both IU Northwest students and for individuals presently working in public affairs, criminal justice, health services, human services, nonprofit organizations, or environmental affairs settings. The school also operates a unit designed to address a variety of public issues and problems, in particular those in northwest Indiana. SPEA conducts research on public problems, provides services to public agencies, and engages in educational programs designed to aid public officials and to inform the public on a variety of public issues. Public Service Internship Program The Public Service Internship Program involves participation by undergraduate students. Undergraduate students enroll in SPEA V380 Internship in Public Affairs or SPEA J380 Internship in Criminal Justice. Graduate students enroll in SPEA V585 Practicum in Public Affairs. Full-time assignment in a public service internship for one semester is acknowledged up to 6 credit hours. Internship credit is recommended for undergraduate students. In the undergraduate program, a maximum of 15 credit hours is allowed for participation in off-campus experiences.Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice 121 Internship possibilities are developed by the school and involve specific job descriptions from public and private agencies willing to involve students in significant professional activities in public and environmental affairs. The student has the option of identifying their own internship site; however, the site must be approved by the internship coordinator. In all cases, specific job details and descriptions of supervisory capacity of the agencies must be filed before credit may be arranged. No off-campus experiences are approved for credit unless the necessary information is filed and approved before the assignment begins. It is recommended the approval process be complete prior to the internship semester. Information can be obtained from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IU Northwest. While the internship program is intended for students enrolled in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, students in related disciplines who have an interest in the public sector and meet eligibility requirements may be considered for admission on a provisional basis. Undergraduate Programs Bachelor Degrees Degree Policies The School of Public and Environmental Affairs offers three Bachelor of Science degree programs. The degrees are the Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management and the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs. 1.A minimum of 120 credit hours distributed to meet degree requirements with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 for all course work completed is required. 2.A grade point average of at least 2.3 in SPEA core and concentration courses is required. 3.No more than 90 credit hours of transfer credit from another accredited institution may be applied toward the bachelor degree. 4.Courses taken on the Pass/Fail option can only be applied as electives in meeting degree requirements. In no case can more than eight Pass/Fail courses be used in meeting degree requirements. 5.Credit work for this degree can be completed at any campus of Indiana University. 6.Candidates for degrees must file an application for graduation. Application should be filled at least six weeks prior to the conferring of degrees.

Graduate Studies Master of Public Affairs The graduate program of the Public and Environmental Affairs consists of the Master of Public Affairs degree. The mission of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs Masters of Public Affairs Program is to sustain a diverse collaborative community of learning that provides professional education to develop ethical, motivated, and effective leaders and to impact our changing region, nation, and world through community engagement and research. The Master of Public Affairs program, which is fully accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA), is an integrated course of study that requires a minimum of 36 credit hours. The program provides knowledge and experience that can be used by the professional in various roles within a changing public sector. It is also an interdisciplinary, professional program drawing on diverse faculty talents and resources. The goal of the program is to equip the individual with the necessary skills and knowledge to enter local, state, or federal government or quasi-governmental service and to broaden comprehension of the economic, environmental, political, and social context in which the public servant works. The curriculum of this program as contained in the core requirements encompasses preparation in a broad range of skills relevant to the operation of public agencies. It is, therefore, interdisciplinary, based on the academic disciplines, but not limited to any one; it is also problem- oriented, bringing the disciplines to bear on critical social, environmental, economic, and administrative conditions. Although the environment of public service is diverse and changing, effectiveness in that environment requires the development of special skills attained through detailed study in a chosen field of concentration. The fields of concentration span the variety of professional specialties found in public service. Thus, the program provides both expertise in a specific concentration area and in the core requirements, and a general working knowledge of public affairs. Master of Public Affairs Academic Features: The Master of Public Affairs is a 36 credit hour degree program in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. The program provides knowledge and experience that can be used by the professional in various roles within the changing public and nonprofit sectors.

A minimum GRE score of 280 on the GRE is required for admission to the program. 3. Submit a copy of resume or curriculum vitae. 5. Letter of intent (this is applicants personal statement as to why they want to pursue the degree, what they hope to gain from it, career goals, etc.) 6. Two (2) professional references - applicants will enter the contact info (name, address, phone and email address for each reference). Once application is submitted the references will receive a invitation to complete their reference electronically. References should be of a professional nature and cannot be from a fulltime faculty member in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Baccalaureate Degree Certification of a baccalaureate degree is required for entrance into the Master of Public Affairs Program. Although the student may not have completed the undergraduate work at the time of application, a decision will be made on the strength of the student's work at the time of application. However, a final transcript, showing baccalaureate degree must become a part of the permanent record before the student can be formally admitted.Application Validity Following notice of admission, an applicant has one calendar year in which to enroll. Supplementary transcripts of any academic work undertaken during that period are required, and the division may request additional letters of recommendation. Should the updated material prove unsatisfactory, the admission may be canceled. If the applicant fails to enroll within one year, a complete new application is required. Examinations for Admission The School of Public and Environmental Affairs will consider results from the GRE, GMAT or LSAT, but the GRE is most common among our applicants. Preparing to take the test and getting official test scores can be a lengthy process, so plan accordingly. Admission Committee Each application is considered carefully by the graduate program committee. While the applicant's undergraduate scholastic performance is the most significant index of ability to do graduate work, recommendations and the student's letter of intent are taken into account. The aim is to select those applicants who can successfully complete graduate study and be effective in public affairs. Degree Policies and Procedures Graduation Requirements It is the responsibility of students to be certain that their graduation and other academic requirements are met. The graduate advisor office in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs will keep a record of the student's progress and will aid in program planning. Non-degree Students Graduate non-degree students make take up to 12 graduate credits. These courses may not necessarily be used toward the Certiticate or Master of Public Affairs (see later for more information about the Certificate Program). Financial aid is not offered for non-degree candidates. Grade of Incomplete An Incomplete indicates that the work is satisfactory as of the end of the semester but has not yet been completed. This grade may be awarded only when the student's work is of passing quality and have only one assignment or exam to complete. In addition, evidence that personal hardship would render it unjust to hold that student to the time limits previously fixed for the completion of the work. Normally, faculty members are reluctant to give the grade of Incomplete. One calendar year is allowed for the removal of an Incomplete unless the Director authorizes an adjustment of this period due to exceptional circumstances. If those procedures are not followed, the I is changed to F. Grade Average, Provisional, and Probationary Status Students may be admitted on a provisional basis for particular reasons, such as deficiencies in certain areas. The provisional status will be removed upon fulfillment of the stipulated conditions. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (A=4.0) or higher for all work taken for graduate credit must be earned as a prerequisite for130Master of Public Affairs Degree Requirements continuation in good standing and for graduation. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 will be placed on probation. To be removed from academic probation, a student must raise the overall cumulative grade point average to 3.0 or higher. If a student earns less than a 3.0 grad point average for a given semester while on academic probation, the student is dismissed from the Master of Public Affairs program. In order to earn either the Master of Public Affairs or the Certificate, a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher at graduation is required. Petitioning Procedures A student may find it necessary to petition the Graduate Program Committee relative to such matters as dismissal, requirements, transfers, class load, etc. Such requests must be presented in writing to the Graduate Program Committee. Midcareer Options The purpose of the midcareer option of the Master of Public Affairs graduate program is to enhance the professional capabilities of those with previous training or experience in public service. It is a program capable of being specially designed to meet the educational and professional needs of the individual. Some administrators are engaged in professional capacities requiring deeper understanding of certain specialties. Others with considerable experience in a specialization may wish to broaden their knowledge and perspectives. The midcareer option can accommodate those needs. Credit waiver may be granted to midcareer option students for significant administrative or policy-level work experience. This work experience may be of a managerial nature or may be in program or policy development (which may or may not include experience in management, e.g., as a planner). The work experience need not necessarily be with a governmental agency. Many private and quasi-public organizations have significant governmental contacts. Furthermore, much management- level experience in the private sector is applicable to the public sector. Students wishing to take full advantage of the midcareer option should apply as soon as regular admission to the program has been granted. The Graduate Program Committee makes a determination of eligibility for the midcareer option for each applicant. Students granted the midcareer option for more than 3 credit hours may not take SPEA V585 Practicum in Public Affairs for credit. Decisions about the midcareer option are made separately from decisions about transfer of credit. Under no circumstances will the midcareer option and the transfer of credit total more than 6 credit hours of the 36 credit hour degree requirement. Students receiving the midcareer option should carefully plan their programs in consultation with an advisor as early as possible. Certification of the plan of study by the graduate advisor is necessary. Transfer Credit from other Graduate Programs Previous graduate credit from other schools at Indiana University or other universities may be accepted toward adegree in the Master of Public Affairs program up to a total of 6 credit hours. The particular courses to be awarded credit will be arranged with the Director. A \"Transfer of Credit\" Form must be completed, and approval must be granted for each course for which transfer credit is desired. This is true both for previous work at Indiana University, outside the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, and for graduate work at other institutions. General Scholarship Rule Any student who does not possess the necessary preliminary training or who lacks other qualifications may be required to enroll in such courses designated or to take such other corrective action as is necessary or desirable. The School of Public and Environmental Affairs may review a student's record at any time and take whatever actions seem necessary for the best interest of that student. Any student whose work is unsatisfactory or whose conduct is unethical may be dismissed from the program.

The BS degree in Radiologic Sciences offers individuals the opportunity to pursue three separate concentrations- an advanced clinical concentration for the associate degree radiographer, diagnostic medical sonography, or radiation therapy. The diagnostic medical sonography and radiation therapy programs are open to individuals with either a health professional AS degree background or a non-health professions background. Diagnostic medical sonographers are concerned with the proper operation of the ultrasound equipment and preparation of patients for various types of diagnosticprocedures. Upon request of a physician, they examine various parts of the body by using sound waves. Radiation therapists use different forms of ionizing radiation for the treatment of benign and malignant tumors. They administer the prescribed dose of ionizing radiation to specific sites of the patient's body as directed by the physician. Associate of Science in Radiography About the A.S. in Radiography Radiology is a science involving the medical use of x- rays, radium, and radioactive isotopes in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Radiographers are essential members of the health care team. They are experts in the performance of examinations requiring the use of x-rays and highly complex machinery to produce a quality x-ray image (radiograph) of the internal parts of the body for interpretation by a medical doctor (radiologist). Radiographers find employment possibilities in various medical settings, ranging from doctors' offices to large medical centers. In addition, some seek employment in industry or in the marketing and sales of x-ray products. Length of the Program 24 months beginning in May. Professional course work begins in Summer Session II. Structure of the Program The Radiography Program is a full-time day program involving classroom and laboratory experiences on campus and clinical experiences at local hospitals.

Repeated Courses Required social work courses may be repeated only after the student is reinstated in the program with permission. Incompletes Instructors at Indiana University School of Social Work follow closely the university policy regarding the assignment of grades of Incomplete (I). An Incomplete may be assigned by an instructor when exceptional circumstances, such as an illness, injury, or a family emergency, prevent a student from finishing all the work required for the course. Instructors may award the grade of Incomplete only when such hardship would render it unjust to hold the student to the time limits previously set. Furthermore, the grade of Incomplete may be given only when the student has completed three-fourths of the semester with course work of passing quality. The instructor, on a case-by-case basis, evaluates incompletes. The grade of Incomplete (I) will be changed to a grade by the instructor of record, based upon the contract devised by the course instructor and approved by the B.S.W. Program Director. If the terms of the Incomplete contract are not met by the student, the instructor will assign the original grade. Pass/Fail Grades A maximum of four pass/fail courses may be applied to the B.S.W. degree. All general education, supportive area requirements, and required social work courses need a letter grade.

Students' Rights and Responsibilities IUSSW students in social work programs have a right to participate in decision-making activities about the school. Students regularly contribute to the continued development and growth of our programs. Indeed, the school values students' input in several critical areas: faculty and course evaluations, school committee work, student field placements and others. All students enrolled at the School of Social Work have an opportunity each semester to evaluate their courses and instructors. At the end of each course, students are electronically sent standardized faculty evaluation forms to complete. These evaluations are confidential, and the results are computer generated. The evaluations are returned to the faculty to use for strengthening content, teaching, and learning methods to improve instruction. Through their elected and/or volunteer representatives, students provide input to and learn from B.S.W. and M.S.W. program committees and various others that might be convened throughout the year. Student representatives are viewed as valuable members of these committees. Each student has the opportunity to have input into the selection of his or her field practicum assignments. The field practicum coordinator works closely with students to negotiate suitable placements. Students have the right to provide feedback about school policies and procedures as well as the behavior of faculty and staff members. In providing either positive or critical feedback, students are expected to follow professional social work norms, values, and ethics. For example, students, who believe that a faculty or staff member's behavior is discourteous or ineffective, should discuss the concern directly with the person or people in question. Students, who have reason to believe addressing the person directly would place them in some jeopardy, shouldAcademic Regulations and Policies 149 register the concern with the director of the program, who will address and respond to the issue. Students, who believe that they have been treated unfairly or unprofessionally by a faculty or staff member, or that a policy or procedure is unjust or unwise, may submit in writing a formal grievance petition to the dean of the College of Health and Human Services. Grievance petitions are reserved for those issues or incidences that warrant formal investigation and full exploration. Such petitions should be submitted in a professional manner, consistent with social work norms, values, and ethics. Student complaints regarding discrimination, sexual harassment, racial harassment, and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation have established complaint procedures available in the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct . Academic and Scholarly Guidelines Students admitted to the Indiana University School of Social Work have already demonstrated potential for superior academic work. Most students are therefore very familiar and comfortable with high academic and scholarly standards. Obviously, students are expected to attend face-to-face, online, classroom and practicum course meetings. Regular attendance is viewed as the responsibility of each social work student. Active participation in course activities is the expected norm. In participating, it is expected that students reflect interest in, and respect for, their colleagues in a manner that is congruent with the values, ethics, and skills of the profession, and those of the Student Code of Conduct. In written assignments, students are expected to prepare documents in a scholarly and professional manner. Submissions should be typewritten in double- spaced format and carefully edited for spelling and grammar. All direct quotations, paraphrases, empirical research findings, and other restatements of the research, scholarship, or creative work of others must be appropriately annotated using the standard bibliographic citation methods set out in the most recent edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA) . The APA manual serves as the guide for style and format of all papers submitted in the School of Social Work. Social work graduates require well-developed and refined communication skills, including the use of the written word. Writing well helps graduates communicate information accurately and concisely. For this reason, formal writing assignments in social work courses are evaluated on the basis of both the quality of the scholarly content and the quality of its presentation. Electronic Communication Students are expected to follow appropriate e- mail etiquette when communicating with faculty, staff, and peers. Correct grammar is expected at all times. Inappropriate use of e-mail will be grounds for student review. For specific guidelines, please visit informationpolicy.iu.edu/policies/ .

Handbooks. Criminal Offense Disclosure and Sexual Offenders Policy As part of the application process, students provide a disclosure statement regarding past criminal offences and driving infractions. Master and Bachelor of Social Work graduates are eligible to apply for legal licensure by the State of Indiana. While such disclosures does not pre-empt an admissions decision for either the B.S.W. or M.S.W. program, admitted students must realize that a criminal history and past driving infractions may impose limitations for students and professionals attempting to obtain field placements, employment in certain practice settings, and eligibility for licensure. It is the policy of the School of Social Work that no student or applicant who has been convicted of sex offences against children shall be eligible for admission or matriculation into the B.S.W., M.S.W. or Ph.D. programs. Any student who is already in an IUSSW program and whose name appears on the Registry during the time of matriculation, or has been convicted of an offense for which the student can be listed on the Registry, shall be ineligible for continuation or completion of the B.S.W. or M.S.W. degree. Any faculty member, student, field instructor, or other person within the school who becomes aware of such a situation should bring it to the attention of the respective program director for appropriate action. This policy and the right of appeal is discussed further in the section on Students' Rights and Responsibilities. Master of Social Work Curriculum Social work is a dynamic profession concerned with the changing needs of people and society. To respond to such needs, the curriculum of the School of Social Work undergoes continuing review by the faculty with the participation of members of the practice community, and others. Students must complete 60 credit hours of graduate-level course work in order to meet the minimum requirements for the Master of Social Work degree. The MSW curriculum includes three distinct levels through which students progress toward the advanced degree in social work. All students complete a common foundation and concentration curriculum that emphasizes a generalist perspective for social work practice. The Foundation Curriculum includes a one-semester practicum of a minimum of 320 clock hours. Following that, students complete the MSW program's Concentration Curriculum in Clinical and Community Practice that prepares them for advanced social workpractice within one of three practice areas: health, mental health and addictions, or school social work. The Concentration Practicum of a minimum of 640 clock hours is usually completed over the two final semesters. All Foundation Curriculum course work must be completed before students are eligible to enroll in any required courses in the Concentration Curriculum. The overall objectives of the Foundation and Concentration Curricula of the M.S.W program include development of: 1.Basic, generalist competence applicable to a broad range of social work practice; 2.Basic competence at all levels: individual, family, groups, communities, and organizations; 3.Basic competence for practice in social service delivery systems Foundation Curriculum (21 cr.)

The third level of preparation consists of courses in the student's selected focus area: Health Focus Area Students, who elect to practice in the health arena, apply the knowledge and skills of advanced social work practice to build and work effectively with interprofessional teams that include physicians, nurses, dentists, psychiatrists and other health care professionals. They learn the medical terminology to conduct bio-psycho-social assessments based on myriad disease entities and patient dynamics. As social workers, they understand how healthcare is financed in the United States, analyze how financial resources for healthcare affect individual patient care, and advocate for change that improves access for allInstructional Programs 151 individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation or other factors.

When primary and secondary school students exhibit behaviors and problems that impede their academic and social progress, they may benefit from interventions that social workers are prepared to deliver. The commitment to utilizing social workers in school settings ebbs and flows, often dictated by fiscal resources for education in general. Nonetheless, preparation of students to enter this field of practice remains a priority for the School of Social Work. Students who enter this field are prepared with clinical skills for working with children and adolescents and their families; with team- building skills for working with school administrators and teachers; and, community skills to garner the resources necessary for to promote a safe, secure environment for those served in the school system.

The general education aspects of the program are then complemented by study in the basic areas of business administration, with distinctive focus on leadership and teamwork. In addition, all undergraduate study programs include courses that ensure a basic understanding of management principles and practices in the dynamic economic, social, and political environment of today. Consideration is also given to basic trends or developments that are likely to shape the pattern of the world in the years ahead. Bachelor of Science in Business The undergraduate program typically occupies the three final undergraduate years and leads to the Bachelor of Science in Business degree. This professional degree has extensive arts, science, and humanities content. The Bachelor of Science in Business degree is awarded when a student has successfully completed (1) a core of general education courses, (2) a core of prescribed business courses, (3) a group of courses in a concentration, and (4) elective courses to meet distributional and total credit hour requirements. Courses are available to meet the general education core, the business core, elective requirements, and the requirements of three concentrations: accounting /finance, business administration and business economics.Transfer Credit Policy 155 Chancellor's B.S. in Business Administration (Online) The Chancellors' BS in Business Administration is offered collaboratively by the IU East, IU Kokomo, IU Northwest, IU South Bend, and IU Southeast campuses.

No more than half of the required courses for either minor may be transfer credit from another institution. Master of Business Administration Prerequisites 161 Background The School of Business and Economics initiated graduate education in business with the establishment of the M.S.B.A. degree in 1969 and succeeded it in 1988 with the M.B.A. The program is designed for individuals who are employed in positions of responsibility within the business community and who are pursuing a graduate education concurrently with their employment. To serve these students, all graduate courses are offered in the evening in a hybrid format. In addition, a Saturday, cohort based program is also available. From its inception, the program has enjoyed a broad base of support and participation from the Northwestern Indiana business community. Purpose The M.B.A. program focuses on teamwork and executive leadership and provides a professional education in business for students who possess the baccalaureate degree in any discipline. For most students, the M.B.A. is a terminal professional degree designed to enhance their performance in present and future managerial positions. Increasingly, individuals employed in non-business fields have used the M.B.A. program to broaden their academic training and enhance their prospects for a career in business. Goals The Faculty of the School of Business and Economics of Indiana University Northwest have identified the following Student Learning Goals to provide assurance that the graduate degree programs of the School provide an educational experience for our students consistent with our mission. MBA students can: display effective teamwork skills. exhibit effective leadership skills with a focus on ethical and social responsibilities. employ key productivity and collaborative business software in the analysis of business decision situations. show expertise of the functional business disciplines. demonstrate the ability to think critically and analytically, and integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines to make effective business decisions. display knowledge of multicultural and diverse perspectives to make effective business decisions. demonstrate knowledge and understanding of ethical and social issues in making effective business decisions. Graduate Admissions to the School of Business and Economics Admission to the M.B.A. program is limited to students of demonstrated aptitude, ability, and scholarship. The decision is based upon a composite evaluation of the applicant's Undergraduate academic performance as measured by the cumulative grade point average; and Scores earned on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT).Admission Test All applicants to the M.B.A. program are required to submit their Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or their Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores. Students must take the GMAT/ GRE at least one month before the application deadline for the semester of application. Information on entrance exams is contained in the application packet available from the Office of Graduate Studies in Business, Indiana University Northwest. Students may be eligible to waive the requirement if they meet at least one of the following requirements: Graduates with 3.2 undergraduate GPA or higher in business core courses. Completed the 5 courses (15 credit hours) that are part of the Graduate Certificate in Management within the past 2 years with a minimum 3.2 graduate GPA. Minimum of 5 years of progressively responsible, preferably post-baccalaureate, professional work or US military experience. External certifications such as CFA, CFP, CPA, PMP, or similar.

Application Deadline Candidates may enter the program at the beginning of the fall, spring, or summer semesters. The application deadline is one month before classes start. A completed application and all supporting documents must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies in Business and Economics by the established deadline date. An official transcript from each college attended is required as part of the application. Prerequisites Prior to enrolling in graduate courses in the M.B.A. proficiencies in math and computer skills. Students should have a minimum of a college-level finite mathematics class. The Indiana University course equivalent is MATH M118 Finite Mathematics. Students are also expected to be proficient in Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint. Students will be required to take an excel assessment prior to the beginning of their first enrolled semester. Any deficiencies will require self-paced tutorials, Excel prep courses, tutoring, and other options available to them to satisfy the prerequisites. Candidates who are deficient in any of these areas should speak with the director of Undergraduate and Graduate162Policies & Procedures Programs to review the different options available to them to satisfy the prerequisites. Students must complete all the foundation courses before taking core classes. Some core classes also have specific course prerequisites. They will be stated in the schedule of classes. Proper enrollment is the individual responsibility of each student. The School of Business and Economics may cancel improper enrollment at any time, and if credit is earned in such an enrollment, the school may refuse to apply that credit toward a degree or may require enrollment in an additional class. Policies & Procedures Students with exceptional circumstances in regard to the policies stated in this bulletin should contact the director for advising. Course Load Since most M.B.A. students are employed full time, they normally carry a course load of 6 to 9 credit hours (two to three courses) per semester. Students should understand graduate courses require more time dedicated to study outside of the classroom. Students should expect to spend 12-15 hours in study outside of class for every three hours in class. Time Allowed for Completion of Degree A maximum of six years is allowed for completion of the program. The six-year period begins with the first semester of course work following the granting of admission status into the program. For those students entering with no undergraduate business training, the program can be completed in approximately three years. Students with an undergraduate degree in business may qualify to directly enter the 30 credit hour M.B.A. core program that can be completed in one year of full time study or within 20-24 months on a part time basis. Continuation in Good Standing The 3.0 grade point average required for the awarding of the MBA degree requires close monitoring of the graduate student's academic progress. If a student receives a C- or below he/she must repeat the course. Both grades will be included in the GPA. Students whose GPA has dipped below 3.0 are placed on probation and will be permitted to enroll in an additional 6 credit hours (two courses). A student will be dismissed from the program for any of the following reasons: Failure to raise GPA to a 3.0 within 6 credit hours of subsequent coursework Maintaining a cumulative GPA below 3.0 after 12 credit hours of work Receiving of three grades of C Receiving of a grade of F in any graduate course results in immediate dismissal Failure to abide by the School of Business and Economics' Standards of Professional Conduct Dismissal A student will be dismissed from the program for any of the following reasons: Failure to raise GPA to a 3.0 within 6 credit hours of subsequent courseworkMaintaining a cumulative GPA below 3.0 after 12 credit hours of work Receiving of three grades of C Receiving of a grade of F in any graduate course results in immediate dismissal Failure to abide by the School of Business and Economics' Standards of Professional Conduct Upon the recommendation of the Graduate/Undergraduate Committee and with the approval of the Dean of the School of Business & Economics, any student whose work is unsatisfactory or whose conduct is unethical may be dismissed from the School. This includes violations of the School's Standards of Professional Conduct contained within this bulletin. Students should be familiar with the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct, particularly in areas of academic misconduct. Academic misconduct may involve human, hard-copy, or electronic resources. Students should understand dismissal can occur if any activity is deemed to undermine the academic integrity of the institution. Waivers If a student has completed course work encompassing material included in the foundation of the program, certain waivers may be granted. Students are permitted waivers for foundation courses only. No waivers for core classes are permitted. Students can be considered for waivers if they have taken specific undergraduate course work with a grade of B or better (B\u2014 does not count) from an AACSB Accredited school within the past five (5) years. The student will be notified as to waivers granted when the application for admission is formally approved. Contact the Director for more information. Non-Degree Status Prospective students who may require foundation courses can begin the program as a non-degree student. Students with a non-degree status may only take up to 12 credit hours of M.B.A. foundation courses. M.B.A. Core courses are not open to non-degree students. Additionally, students who must take all five of the M.B.A. foundational courses essentially have completed the Graduate Certificate in Management. Successful completion of all five courses with a 3.2 GPA will meet the requirements of admission into the core MBA program. Students who do not require foundation courses must enter the program fully admitted. Students Transferring from Another M.B.A. Program A student who is admitted who has attended an M.B.A. program at another institution must take at minimum the 30 credit hour core of which no more than 6 credit hours can be transferred in. Their graduate and undergraduate coursework may be used to waive the foundation courses. Students can be considered for foundation course waivers if they have taken specific undergraduate course work with a grade of B or better(B- does not count) within the past five years from an AACSB accredited business school. See the director for approval details. These are subject to final approval by the Graduate Committee and may require review of additonal materials.Postbaccalaureate Certificate in Accounting 163 Transfer Credit A total of 6 credit hours of graduate- level work may be transferred from other accredited institutions or other accredited programs at Indiana University. All course work must be preapproved by the Graduate/Undergraduate Faculty Committee, and students must obtain a grade of B or better to qualify for transfer. See the director of graduate studies for details. Grade of Incomplete A grade of Incomplete (I) may be given only when the work in the course is substantially completed and when the student's work is of passing quality. An Incomplete must be changed to a letter grade within one year from the date of its recording. The student must meet with the professor and complete all work required by him/her and submit it well in advance of the one-year deadline. Students who receive a grade of I are not to re-enroll in the same class. Independent Study Students are permitted to engage in up to 6 credit hours of approved Independent Study.

Students must submit the completed proposal form, approved by the sponsoring professor, to the director, by the date specified within the Schedule of Classes. Withdrawals Students are permitted to drop a class up to the Automatic Withdrawal deadline. Students may not withdraw from a class after the automatic withdrawal deadline except under extreme circumstances. If a student seeks to drop a class after the deadline, the student must submit a request explaining the extreme circumstances that support the withdrawal. A poor or failing grade is not a legitimate reason to request permission to withdraw after the deadline. The student request is submitted to the director, who will submit the request to the dean to approve or deny the request. Students in the Weekend M.B.A. program are not subject to published withdrawal deadlines. Please contact the Director for more information. Applying for Graduation Students will be able to apply for graduation through the IU Northwest School of Business and Economics website. Students must submit applications the semester prior to finishing their degree requirements so that the graduate director has time to audit student files. The Office of the Registrar requires a tentative list of graduates at the beginning of each semester. Students must file an application for graduation the semester before they expect to complete degree requirements. Failure to file this application will result in the student's name not appearing on the graduation list for the semester in which the course work is being completed. Degree Requirements Each M.B.A. candidate is required to complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in the M.B.A. core. For students who have no waivers from the foundation courses, a total of 45 credit hours will be required for completion of the M.B.A. degree. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0 = A) or higher in all work taken for graduate credit must beearned as a prerequisite for continuation in good standing and for graduation. During the first semester of enrollment in the M.B.A. program, every student will be required to prepare and file a program of study with the director of graduate studies in business. The program will provide the candidate with the opportunity to chart the time period during which the degree requirements will be met. All students must complete a minimum of the 30 credit hours in the M.B.A. core, of which no more than 6 credit hours are transferred from another institution, and meet additional requirements as stated upon admission. Students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA in all classes counted toward the M.B.A. degree. If a student repeated a course, both grades count in the degree GPA. Degree requirements must be completed within six years from the date of the first semester enrolled. Enrollment as a guest/non-degree/certificate student counts in the six years.

Students must have passed all parts of the Praxis Core Exam (reading, writing, and mathematics). The cutoff scores are available in the Office of Education Student Services Requests for exceptions are handled by the Admissions and Reinstatement Committee and should be addressed to the Dean of the School of Education. Student Teaching Program In the Student Teaching Program, the student assumes all the responsibility for teaching in an elementary, special education, or secondary classroom. Admission Requirements File an application for admission to the Student Teaching Program at least six calendar months before the beginning of the student teaching semester. (Deadlines are sent to students via university listserv) Complete at least 30 of the last 60 credit hours of academic work at IU Northwest, including the professional methods courses. Have at least a 2.50 cumulative grade point average with grades of C or higher in all required cognate and education courses. Be at least a first-semester senior. Normally, this will mean that the student has satisfactorily completed at least 86 credit hours of academic work. In the case of Elementary Education majors, complete required work in the areas of language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. In the case of SH/JH /MS education majors, complete at least 85 percent of the major teaching area requirements and 75 percent of the minor teaching area requirements. Complete all required professional methods courses within three years prior to enrolling in student teaching. Pass the prestudent teaching portfolio check. Pass the all examinations required for teacher licensing by the Indiana Department of Education. If an interview is requested by the cooperating institution, the student must participate in an interview with a representative of the institute or agency in which the student teaching will be completed and obtain a favorable recommendation. Students are discouraged from taking additional academic work during the same semester of enrollment in student teaching. The Director of Student Teaching and Field Experiences shall be the sole judge as to whether the student has met168Policies & Procedures the requirements for admission to, and continuing in, the Student Teaching Program. Completion of the Student Teaching Program and Application for a Teaching License Obtain a satisfactory recommendation from the Director of Student Teaching and Field Experiences The student will be eligible for a teaching license when the baccalaureate degree has been granted, all required Indiana Core and Pedagogy exams have been passed, an extended criminal background check shows no negative activity, and fees and licensing requirements by the Indiana Department of Education have been paid and/or satisfied. Policies & Procedures Undergraduate Admission Admission to the School of Education expires upon receipt of a degree, upon completion of special admission work, or when no work has been completed on this campus in a period of one calendar year. Students must then reapply for admission to the school. Admission and Reinstatement Appeals A student whose enrollment was terminated by the SOE may petition for reinstatement to the Education Admission and Reinstatement Committee. Credit Transfer Policy for Baccalaureate Degrees Undergraduate students wishing to transfer from other institutions should first call or write the admissions office at IU Northwest for information concerning admission and transfer of credit. Even though credit hours are transferred through the admissions office, they may or may not be applicable to degree programs in the SOE. The SOE determines the acceptance of transferred credit. Two major concerns underlie this policy: program integrity and fairness. The SOE ensures program integrity through counseling and mentoring by faculty. Fairness is ensured through collaborative planning by the student and his/her faculty mentor. Credit transfer is administered by the IU Northwest admissions office and the academic advisor of the SOE with the advice of appropriate faculty, including the student's faculty advisor. Formal appeals of decisions and the consideration of requests for exceptions to existing policy are provided for by a standing committee of the faculty of the SOE. Credit transfers for a course must not be confused with performance criteria for a degree, certificate, or license. Most programs of the SOE require performance criteria that are evidenced by portfolio artifacts. Course completion or credit transfer does not, by itself, constitute meeting performance criteria. While it may be possible to include work done apart from courses taken at IU Northwest within a required portfolio, performance criteria required for degrees, certificates, or licenses awarded by the SOE must be demonstrated after acceptance into the school. Academic work from a regionally accredited college or university that is certified by the state of Indiana, or a body of similar stature, to offer teacher education and for which a student grade is at or above the level of C, maybe transferred for credit but will be transferred for program requirements subject to the following conditions. Undergraduate or graduate students who have successfully completed any course at any other Indiana University campus that is part of a program at IU Northwest will receive full credit for that course. Products or performances that are required for any academic objective at IU Northwest must however still be demonstrated. Assistance toward meeting performance criteria at IU Northwest is provided, in part, through enrolling and completing credit courses. A student who has transferred such course credit will be given assistance as may be needed toward meeting performance criteria by being allowed to attend the course at IU Northwest without having to re-enroll or pay tuition for it. Similar arrangements may be possible for other transfer students. These will be considered on a case-by- case basis. The last 30 credit hours of any undergraduate degree program to be awarded by IU Northwest must be completed after being admitted to the SOE at IU Northwest. Acceptance into a degree, license, or program must be accompanied with an approved program of studies that has been validated by appropriate faculty and certification advisors within the SOE at IU Northwest. Electives Free electives for Senior High/Junior High/Middle School majors are those courses applied toward the required credit hour total, but not applied to the area of general education, subject major, or subject minor. Courses numbered 100 or higher may be used as free electives. No College of Arts and Sciences courses with a J prefix and no courses without a departmental prefix may be used as electives. Field Experiences When applying for admission to an undergraduate education program, students should know that each semester of the education sequence has a field experience course. Good Standing To maintain good standing within the SOE, undergraduate students must keep a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.5. Students whose GPA falls below 2.5 will be placed on probation. Students whose GPA remains below 2.5 a second semester will be placed on strict academic probation. Students on strict academic probation whose GPA does not rise above 2.5 will be dismissed from the SOE. Semester Load A full-time undergraduate student is expected to carry 12-17 credit hours of academic work per semester. If students have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least B (3.0) in all work taken at Indiana University, they may receive permission from the SOE Dean or Director of Education Student Services to carry 18 credit hours or more in a semester. Education students are discouraged from enrolling in more than 6 credit hours of academic work during Summer Sessions. It is recommended thatTeacher Education Requirements 169 a person who is employed full time take no more than 6 credit hours of academic work. Bachelor of Science in Education Degree Requirements Regular matriculation requirements of the university. A cumulative grade point average of at least 2.5. Successful completion of 35 credit hours of junior- and senior-level courses (courses numbered higher than 299). Successful completion of at least 30 of the last 60 credit hours of academic work, including the teaching methods courses, in residence at IU Northwest preceding admission to student teaching. Successful completion of at least 120 credit hours of appropriately distributed academic credit hours within seven calendar years of the intended date of receipt of the degree. Any work completed seven or more calendar years prior to that date will be subject to review to determine its acceptability toward the degree. Methods courses three or more calendar years old and student teaching two or more years old will also be subject to review. Successful completion of all required courses and a grade of C or better in all education courses and all teaching content area courses. Successful completion of all program checkpoint and portfolio requirements. Demonstration of specific knowledge, performances, and dispositions as required by the Indiana Department of Education. Application for Degree When students register at IU Northwest the last time before completing the requirements for a degree in the School of Education, they should file an application for the degree with the Office of Education Student Services. Students completing work for degrees in the SOE in absentia must notify the same office at least one semester prior to the time when the degree is to be granted.

Admission Admission to Graduate Study Students interested in graduate study should obtain the application materials from the Office of Education Student Services. All official transcripts required for application purposes must be sent directly from the originating institution to the Office of Education Student Services. Indiana University students need not provide a transcript. Admission to all graduate licensure programs also require the passing of specific Indiana Department of Education licensing exams. See the Office of Education Student Services for the names and code numbers of the required exams in specific areas of study. Foreign students and students with non\u2014U.S. institutional degrees must contact the Office of Admissions at Indiana University Northwest.Students may be able to transfer some courses taken at other campuses or universities. The school transfer policy appears earlier in this bulletin. Admission to the School of Education expires upon receipt of a degree, the completion of special admission work, or when no work has been completed on this campus in a period of seven calendar years. Students must then reapply for admission. Admission to graduate study does not necessarily imply admission to a degree program. If a student is admitted to a degree program, this will be specifically indicated in those courses required for the degree. Requirements To be admitted into the program for the Master of Science degree in Elementary or Secondary, or Educational Leadership at Indiana University Northwest, the candidate must successfully meet multiple criteria for demonstrating preparedness for study. While candidates may enroll in graduate-level education courses before being formally admitted into the master's program, no more than 12 such credit hours of appropriate graduate course work may be applied to the master's degree program. Candidates for admission to the master's degrees in education must: Have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.50 on a 4.0 scale and provide transcripts to that affect. Hold a valid teacher's license. Submit two letters of reference from K-12 school officials. Semester Load Full-time work generally consists of 8 credit hours each semester.

Good Standing Graduate students not accepted into graduate-level programs must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5, while those who are working toward a license or master's degree must maintain at least a 3.0 (B) cumulative grade point average in those graduate courses leading to the license or degree. No course with a grade of C- or lower may be used for meeting the requirements of a new license, license addition, or a master's degree. Probation Students who do not maintain good standing are placed on strict academic probation and remain on probation until their grade point average returns to the good standing level. Students on probation when they complete program or degree requirements will not be recommended for that program or degree. If students fail to make progress in the removal of academic deficiencies during the following semester, their eligibility to enroll in any additional course work through the School of Education shall be dismissed. If dismissed, the students are placed on the all-university checklist. They are then not eligible to enroll in courses through the School of Education.176Licensing Licensing Completion of requirements for any master's degrees does not necessarily imply that students have met requirements for state licensing. If students want both the degree and licensing, they should contact the graduate advisor to have an appropriate program of study prepared. Credit Transfer Policies Credit transfer is administered by the graduate advisor with the advice of appropriate faculty, including the student's faculty advisor. Formal appeals of decisions and the consideration of requests for exceptions to existing policy are provided for by a standing committee of the faculty of the SOE. Credit transfers for a course must not be confused with performance criteria for a degree, certificate, license or addition. Most programs of the SOE require performance criteria that are evidenced by a portfolio. Course completion or credit transfer does not, by itself, constitute meeting performance criteria. Performance criteria (portfolio artifacts) required for certificates, licenses or additions must be demonstrated after acceptance into the school. Academic work from a regionally accredited college or university for which a student grade is at or above the level of C may be transferred for credit but will be transferred for program requirements subject to the following conditions. Undergraduate or graduate students who have successfully completed any course at any other Indiana University campus that is part of a program at IUN will receive full credit for that course. Products or performances that are required for any academic objective at IUN must however still be demonstrated. Assistance toward meeting performance criteria at IUN is provided, in part, through enrolling and completing credit courses. A student who has transferred such course credit will be given assistance as may be needed toward meeting performance criteria by being allowed to attend the course at IUN without having to re-enroll or pay tuition for it. Similar arrangements may be possible for other transfer students. These will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Except as noted below, two-thirds of the credits for any graduate degree, license or certificate program but including all related student teaching or other required practicums must be completed after being formally admitted to that program within the SOE at IUN. Graduate students in good standing from another IU campus who have been formally admitted to a degree, license or certificate program that is also available at IUN may transfer in all but one-fourth of the same or similar program credit requirements at IUN before being awarded the degree, license or certificate. However, the transferred credit may not include student teaching or other required practicum, and performance criteria required at IUN must still be demonstrated. Acceptance into a degree, license, or addition program must be accompanied with an approved program of studies that has been validated by appropriate faculty and certification advisors within the SOE at IUN. Guest students, or students who are seeking personal, short-term objectives such as licenserenewal or self-development, are not normally affected by transfer of credit issues at IUN. The Student Admission and Reinstatement Committee of the SOE will consider any such cases on a case-by- case basis. However, the transferability of any IUN course or other experience to a program at another institution, within or outside of the Indiana University School of Education, is entirely the responsibility of the guest or short-term student. Exit Requirements An application for a graduate degree should be completed and filed in the Office of Education Student Services one semester before the degree is to be granted. Application forms are available from that office. Candidates for the Master of Science degree in Elementary, Secondary or Educational Leadership education must satisfactorily complete a portfolio consisting of at least one artifact for each of the program outcomes. The student must have been admitted unconditionally to the master's degree program, or, if allowed to enter conditionally, must have removed the conditions satisfactorily. The student must complete a minimum of 33 credit hours of graduate courses that are appropriate to the particular master's degree program. All work to be applied toward the degree must be completed within six calendar years from the date when the grade is received in the first course that is to be used toward the degree. Credit acquired in courses taken by correspondence will not apply toward degree requirements unless approved by the Director of Education Student Services and the student's graduate advisor. The student must have a cumulative grade point average of at least a 3.0 in those courses required for the degree.
