The motivation behind the Ubuntu culture in Africa... An Anthropologist proposed a game to the African tribal children... He placed a basket of sweets near a tree and made the children stand 100 metres away. He then announced that whoever reaches first would get all the sweets in the basket. When he said 'ready steady go!', do you know what the children did? They all held each other's hands, ran together towards the tree, divided the sweets equally among themselves, ate the sweets and enjoyed it. When the Anthropologist asked them why they did so, they answered, \"Ubuntu\". \"Ubuntu\" in their language means, \"I am because we are\". A strong message for all generations. The protection and promotion of children's rights cannot be achieved in isolation, they depend on a series of stakeholders.

Field visit at Residence Barkly 360Annual Report 2017 - 20181011 2017 20181213 Ombudsperson for ChildrenThe annual period from July 2017 to June 2018 had been an incredibly busy one for the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO). There had been numerous handling of complaints, own-motion inquiries, meetings and workshops of different nature involving both children and adults, sensitisation programmes, media interviews, participation at international conferences and trainings, and last but not the least, several initiatives related to children's rights and the forthcoming Children's Bill. In the performance of my duties, I, the Ombudsperson for Children (OC), made it a high priority to network with different stakeholders. Working in isolation is a mistake not to be made by any human rights institution. Thus, to promote and protect children's rights, it is sine qua non to seek the support of a maximum of citizens and stakeholders both at national and international levels. I would like to acknowledge the precious support that this Office has had from the 'Association des Ombudsmans et M\u00e9diateurs de la M\u00e9diateurs Africains' (AOMA), two international organisations that have greatly contributed to the efficiency and improvement of our office's work. A core function of the OCO is to conduct investigations on matters involving children upon receipt of complaints or on my own motion. Just like a blood sample can allow a medical expert to analyse and diagnose deficiencies or diseases in a human body, the individual complaints that we daily receive at the OCO are often representative of wider systemic shortcomings. In other words, issues identified at the micro-level usually reflect issues that are often present at a macro-level. To be able to efficiently resolve problems faced by a single child, I often have to recommend and advocate for changes at the macro-level of service providers and decision makers. My role as the OC is primarily to positively influence policies and programmes concerning children's rights. This aspect of my work is stipulated in section 6(c) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, as \"in carrying out the duties of his office, the OC shall advise public bodies and other institutions responsible for providing care and other services to children on the protection of the rights of children\". The OCA 2003 defines 'public body' as (a) a Ministry or Government Department; (b) a local authority; (c) a statutory corporation; (d) any other company, partnership or other entity of which Government is, by the holding of shares or some other financial input, or in any other manner, in a position to influence the policy or decision of such body. I am mandated to make recommendations to improve the lives of children in the Republic of Mauritius. However, I have noticed with deep concern that, even if our investigations are carried out scientifically and the recommendations made are supported by evidence, there are still some private and public bodies that would either ignore or question them. This is indeed unfortunate because children are deeply affected when there is no motivation to improve the quality of services offered to them. Annual Report 2017 - 201814I would like to remind every citizen of our country that the OCO was set up in 2003 by the Republic of Mauritius to ensure that children's rights are respected in our country. Although the OC has no legal power to enforce her recommendations, she plays the role of a 'watchdog' in all child-related domains. She uses 'smart power' as a tool to ensure that the rights of children are protected and to forcefully condemn the violation of their rights. I wish to draw attention to paragraph 81 of the Concluding Observations and Recommendations of the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) adopted at its 60th Ordinary Session in May 2017 1 which stated that, \"In spite the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children, it is noted in the Report that its recommendations are not implemented, in addition to a lack of awareness on the Office\". In this regard, the Commission (ACHPR, 2017) recommended to \"establish measures to raise awareness on the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children, in addition to enacting legal requirement to ensure implementation of its recommendations\". Moreover, it is important to note that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (2006) 2 stated in paragraph 17 of its Concluding Observations for the Republic of Mauritius that: The Committee recommends that the State party ensure that adequate human and financial resources be allocated to the Ombudsperson for Children's Office. The Committee also recommends that the State party strengthen the OCO by allowing it to recruit qualified and trained staff. It further recommends that the OCO be systematically included in the review of any laws and policies pertaining to children. This year, my team of investigators and I paid particular attention to children in especially challenging circumstances which include amongst others children deprived of a family, victims of different forms of abuse, children of incarcerated mothers, pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers, children with disabilities, street children, children in conflict with the law and those deprived of decent housing facilities. We bring to you in the present Annual Report 2017-2018 a breadth of issues in relation to these varied groups of children, an overview of our investigation processes, our findings and analyses based on local realities and international standards, and, most importantly, our recommendations on potential ways to improve the situation of these children at a systemic level. Twenty-eight years ago, world leaders had agreed \"to ameliorate the plight of millions of children who live under especially difficult circumstances\" (World Summit for Children, 1990) 3. The Republic of Mauritius was present at this important gathering which endorsed the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; United Nations [UN], 1989)4 and called for global 1 African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (2017).

This year, as we celebrate our 50th Anniversary of Independence, our children should remain our priority, and as a nation, we still have the duty to fulfil the commitment we took in 1990. As a ratifying country of the UNCRC, our Republic sends regular reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. However, it has not yet incorporated the provisions of this international law into our domestic legislation. The forthcoming Children's Bill is of utmost importance and we hope that it will favour a rights-based approach to the development and protection of children. I advocate that our country initiates a review of existing scattered laws on children. We should not adopt a 'piecemeal' approach to the amendments of these laws. This is because a sectoral law reform would be limited in scope, which means that many other rights might be neglected with this approach. In short, we need a comprehensive and consolidated Children's Bill in line with the provisions of the UNCRC. To support this process, I am pleased to announce that the current Annual Report 2017-2018 consists of a piece of work that enlists a maximum of local child-related laws which correspond to each of the 40 articles of the UNCRC (refer to section 1.12). NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS TO MAKE THIS CONVENTION PART OF OUR LOCAL LEGISLATION. Mrs. Rita Venkatasawmy O S K Ombudsperson for Children Republic of MauritiusAnnual Report 2017-2018Annual Report 2017 20181819 Ombudsperson for Children The importance of a Children's Bill in the Republic of Mauritius: IntroductionAnnual Report 2017 - 2018201.1 Introduction Childhood in the Republic of Mauritius in the 1960s was obviously very different to the one we are experiencing today. With independence came new challenges in building a democracy that is safe and responsive to the complex needs of every child in our country. In the context of a rapidly evolving society, policies and laws that apply to children cannot be made without consulting a host of stakeholders including adult citizens, child specialists from governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), legal representatives and children themselves. There is no doubt that the Mauritian society deeply values the wellbeing of children and young people. According to an African report (Bequele, 2008) 5, Mauritius scored the highest on a child-friendliness index among all African Governments. I, the Ombudsperson for Children, believe that the country is ready to welcome a new child- specific law. This new Children's Bill should replace all outdated pieces of legislation concerning children in our country. One of my main mandates is to promote the country's compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; United Nations, 1989) 6, which was ratified by our country in July 1990. Along with the need to frame this legislation within our socio-economic and cultural landscape, I attribute high importance to the incorporation of the provisions of the CRC in this long-awaited Bill. I would also like to advance that the thorough revision of this draft Bill would necessitate a public participatory approach. According to the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003 (see Appendix A), I have the duty to: make proposals to the Minister on legislation, policies and practices regarding services to, or the rights of, children (section 6(a)); and advise the Minister on the establishment of mechanisms to afford children the ability to express themselves freely, according to their age and maturity, especially on all matters concerning their individual or collective rights (section 6(k)). In this context, I have written this three-part chapter to, firstly, discuss the importance of a law specific to children in our Republic and the need to implement the recommendations made by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in the review of the draft Children's Bill. Secondly, I illustrate a revision mechanism that can include the public, most importantly children themselves, in reviewing this Bill. Thirdly, I present a compilation of a maximum of our existing local child laws that correspond to each of the 40 articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Additionally, in the spirit of contributing to a participatory approach in the review of the draft Children's Bill, my office took several initiatives and organised activities. These included submissions on recommendations on the Children's Bill to the Minister of Gender Equality, 5 Bequele, A. (2008).

Geneva: Author. 21 Ombudsperson for ChildrenChild Development and Family Welfare, residential workshops with children and carers from different residential care institutions, consultative meetings with vulnerable children and sensitisation workshops with civil society organisations in Mauritius and Rodrigues. These activities are illustrated in chapter 9 of this report. Furthermore, I would like to highlight that our country has the privilege of having the Law Reform Commission (LRC), an independent statutory body set up by Parliament under Act No. 26 of 2005. Two of the LRC's missions are to reform and develop laws in Mauritius, and to advise the Attorney General on finding ways of making laws understandable and accessible. The LRC has published many good quality papers including some specific ones on children's matters, for instance, the 2007 report (together with a draft bill) on \"Relationship of Children with Grand Parents and other Persons under the Code Civil Mauricien\" 7 and the 2016 review paper on \"Criminal Protection of Children's Rights\"8. The latter document provided a framework on comparing our criminal legislations regarding children with those of other countries and also included law reform recommendations as shown in Appendix B. These guidelines could be very useful when reviewing the Children's Bill. Referring to the several powers conferred to the LRC 9, the Commission can among others conduct public hearings, seek comments from the public on its proposals, and consult any person or class of persons; and request information from any Government department, any organization or person in relation to the review, reform or development of any aspect of the law of Mauritius. Initiating a national public consultation process for revising the draft Children's Bill will undoubtedly require a host of expertise, experience and skills, especially in the fields of child welfare and rights and on the technical aspects of drafting bills. Owing to our functions and powers, I believe that relevant Ministries, the Commission of Child Development and Others in Rodrigues, the LRC and my office could collaborate very closely in mobilising and enabling the necessary human, material and financial resources to assess, plan, implement and evaluate this law reform initiative. 7 Law Reform Commission (2007).

They bring about a sense of discipline, control and uniformity to ways of living among people. Without laws, everyone would do as he/she wishes. This could lead to confusion, anger and riots because people would make their own rules and laws, without respecting one another. Anyone would be at liberty to interfere with the freedoms of another person. Ultimately, this can result into destruction of humanity and natural resources in societies. Hence, laws provide for accepted norms of conduct for a society. They state guidelines to peace, fairness and respect in any society. Laws which are in line with human rights instruments are important to allow human beings to have an identity and exercise rights; for example, the right to work, the right to education and the right to health. Without rights being enacted, individuals would merely exist. They would not be able to have a sense of use or to employ their skills towards the improvement of society. It has to be understood that humans are the resource of any society and it is through them that a society is able to progress. Without laws providing for rights, people would not be empowered to contribute towards the society they live in. Thus, these laws ensure the survival and betterment of societies. 1.3 Importance of a legal framework to protect children's rights in Mauritius The Republic of Mauritius is a democratic, sovereign and independent State as provided by section 1 of the Constitution of Mauritius 1968 which is the primary supreme law of our country. The Constitution enables the provision of fundamental constitutional rights in its sections 3-16 afforded to all Mauritian citizens, including children as full individuals with rights and responsibilities. Along with the Constitution, our Republic has enacted various legislations pertaining directly and indirectly to the protection of children's rights, namely, the Mauritian Civil Code, the Mauritian Penal Code, the Juvenile Offenders Act 1935, the Child Protection Act 1994 and the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003 amongst others. However, with emerging new social problems, children are becoming more vulnerable. It was clearly stated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child (United Nations, 1959) that a child \"by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth\" . Children can easily become victims to social ills such as poverty, drugs and family breakdown amongst others. Dominant adults can abuse them in various ways, for example, physically, mentally and emotionally. Children must be protected from all forms of social problems like prostitution, mendicity, ill-treatment and abandonment. A sound legal framework for children is sine qua non to ensuring their development and protection. We need to help children not to become prey to offenders or offenders themselves. Children also merit rights, facilities and services to grow healthily, mentally, physically and psychologically. Rights to life, health care, education, leisure, information and so on, should be provided to them so that they can feel empowered. 25 Ombudsperson for Children1.4 International framework for the protection of children's rights The Republic of Mauritius has signed and ratified a number of international conventions and protocols which are legally-binding agreements. We are therefore committed to follow international norms and laws so as to keep intact diplomatic relations and to strengthen our law and order systems. In relation to children's rights, our country has signed the following international conventions, some of which are specific to children's rights, while others include components of children's rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 10 which provides for fundamental human rights like right to life, right to freedom of expression and right to freedom of religion and conscience. These rights target all individuals and it has to be highlighted that individuals include children as well. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 11 which provides for rights like right to liberty and security and right to protection from inhuman and degrading punishment. Again, it is noted that these rights apply to children too. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction12 which has as objectives \"to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State; and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in other Contracting States.\"13 The Convention on the Rights of the Child , ratified by the Republic of Mauritius in 1990, is a treaty specific to children's right. It sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 14. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography15. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities16. The Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour17 which provides for protection from slavery and child labour. The African (Banjul) Charter on Human and People's Rights18 provides for fundamental rights like rights to dignity, health and education. These rights aim at the general African population including children. 10 Proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in their 183rd plenary meeting on 10 December 1948 11 Acceded by Mauritius on 12.12.1973 12 Acceded by Mauritius on 01.06.1993 13 Article 1 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (1980) 14 Signed in November 2001 and ratified in February 2009 15 Signed in November 2001 and ratified in June 2011 16 Ratified in January 2010 17 Ratified in May 2000 18 Ratified in March 2003Annual Report 2017 - 201826 The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child19 which provides for fundamental rights of the African child while catering for specific groups like refugees, children with disabilities and juveniles. Following the signature and ratification of all these treaties, the Government of the Republic of Mauritius, as a duty bearer, has taken up the commitment to protect and empower all children by enacting a legal framework that integrates these international principles and provisions. 1.5 A note on domestication of public international laws Even if our country has a legal framework for children's rights, many of the above-mentioned conventions, especially the Convention on the Rights of the Child, has not been domesticated yet. Our child-specific policies and laws are not necessarily consistent with what is required by these international documents. This is because the Republic of Mauritius is a dualist country, that is, any public international law that we have signed and ratified does not automatically enter into force in our domestic law. For this to happen, the international treaty has to be enacted through Mauritian legislation in Parliament so that it bears the force of a law. This process is explained in the next subsection. 1.6 How a Bill becomes an Act of Parliament in the Republic of Mauritius? On 12 April 2018, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office organised a sensitisation workshop on children's rights for civil society organisations in the context of the forthcoming Children's Bill. On this occasion, we received the visit of Mrs. Maya Hanoomanjee, Speaker of the National Assembly, who delivered a presentation on how a Bill becomes an Act of Parliament in our Republic. Her valuable and elaborate explanations are presented as follows: 19 Ratified in February 199227 Ombudsperson for ChildrenExplanations extracted from the Speech entitled 'How a Bill becomes an Act of Parliament' of Mrs. Maya Hanoomanjee, Speaker of the National Assembly 1) What is a Bill? A Bill is a draft legislative proposal which, when passed gives legal effect to a policy decision (Public Bill) or to the promotion of some particular interest of a person, association or body corporate (Private Bill). It is usually the result of protracted discussions among stakeholders. Depending on the subject matter, discussions may be passionate and may address many sensitive issues. For a Bill to become an Act, it has to be introduced in the National Assembly, which is the Legislative body. Once introduced, it has to go through certain stages before it is enacted, that is, before it becomes law. 2) Steps to be followed for a Bill to be made into an Act For the purpose of this speech, we shall deal exclusively with Public Bills. All Public Bills originate from Government (Ministries). Step 1: At the level of the Ministry The Minister responsible for the ministry who wishes to bring a Bill in the House will have consultation with technical experts and other relevant stakeholders to seek their views and hold discussions on the Bill, namely on its bearing on society. In other words, it is important to assess how the Bill will affect the individual in different aspects of his life, whether it will bring about the intended effects, or whether it will cure any mischief. Once consensus has been reached, the Bill will be sent to the State Law Office (SLO) for legal vetting and drafting. Note: The SLO is the Office responsible for giving legal advice to Government. Step 2: At the State Law Office One of the first considerations for the SLO is to examine whether the proposed Bill passes the test of constitutionality. In other words, it must be ascertained that the Bill or part thereof, does not violate any provision of the Constitution. It is a basic tenet that any law should conform to the Constitution which is our supreme law. Besides the constitutionality test, other features of the Bill are also examined - for example, the powers given to the Minister, its incidence on other existing laws which, if any, would also require amendments as well. In short, a Bill should not be looked at in isolation. It forms part of the might of the law which regulates society. Step 3: Bill returned to the Ministry The draft Bill is then sent back to the Ministry for its reaction. There may be as many exchanges between the Ministry and the SLO as may be necessary before finalisation. When all the legal issues have been cleared, the Minister brings the Bill to the Cabinet.Annual Report 2017 - 201828Step 4: Bill sent to the Cabinet The Minister will now seek the approval of the Cabinet. He does so by presenting a Cabinet Paper in which he traces the history of the Bill and sets out its main features. It may happen that the proposed Bill has implications on other matters falling within the responsibility of other ministries. For example, a proposed Bill on the subject of Education by the Minister of Education may have a bearing on Finance, or on a matter pertaining to Culture. In that case, both the Minister responsible for Finance and the Minister responsible for Culture will manifest a particular interest in the Bill. They will surely seek clarifications from the Minister of Education. They may also not agree with certain issues. In that case, the Minister of Education will have to consider their comments and suggestions on the proposed Bill and come back to Cabinet to obtain its approval. Cabinet will give its green light for the Bill to be introduced in the National Assembly only when all these issues have been cleared. After approval of Cabinet, the Bill will be forwarded to the National Assembly to be placed on the Order Paper (i.e. the agenda of business). Step 5: In the National Assembly In the National Assembly, the stages through which Bills pass generally are ' First Reading ', 'Second Reading ', 'Committee Stage', and finally ' Third Reading '. Administratively, the first step is for the Bill to be registered in the Official Register of the National Assembly. Once this is done, the Bill has to be published in the official gazette known as the Government Gazette. The gazette is the official journal in which all legal documents or other matters having a legal implication are published. The purpose of the publication of the Bill in the gazette is for the information of the general public of the decision of the government to present the Bill in question. Publication of the Bill also provides an opportunity to the public to react and make comments on the Bill. i) First Reading: After the expiry of a delay of 15 days from the publication in the gazette, the Bill is introduced in the House. This is done by way of a motion made by the appropriate Minister in the following terms - \"Mr/Madam Speaker, I move that the ......................... Bill be read the First Time.\" The motion needs to be seconded. There is no debate at this stage. Hence the First Reading. ii) Second Reading: The next step is the Second Reading of the Bill, which takes place not less than 7 days after the First Reading. At the Second Reading stage, there is general debate on the Bill. Here the general principles of the Bill and its provisions are debated. The details are not discussed further than is necessary to explain its principles.29 Ombudsperson for Children The Minister piloting the Bill will open up the debate by presenting to the House the main arguments in its favour. For instance, on a Bill with the subject of Labour Law, the Minister will, for example, give reasons as to how the enactment of this law will, amongst others, improve the lot of the workers. The opposition spokesman will sometimes attempt to demonstrate that the workers will be worse off if the Bill becomes law, but he may also suggest on how to improve the Bill. In other words, the House will debate on policy issues, generally related to the 'pros' and 'cons' of the Bill to try to convince the House on the benefits of the Bill and to strive to expose the flaws of the Bill respectively. For members who wish to express their views, both from the Government and from the Opposition or independent members, they will be called upon by the Speaker to address the House. When all the members would have finished with their interventions, the Minister will sum up the debates and move that the Bill be read the Second Time. The Speaker will put the question to the House that the Bill be read a Second Time. That would bring a close to the Second Reading stage. The House will then proceed with the next stage, which is the Committee Stage. iii) Committee Stage: As we have seen earlier, Members have so far limited their discussions to the general principles of the Bill and its provisions. For example, on a Bill for the compulsory inclusion of sports activities in the school curriculum, debates may be centred on the benefits or otherwise of such a measure. Members won't debate, for example, on the availability or quality/quantity of pitches. These are what could be described as technicalities which are reserved for discussion in details at Committee stage. The House will at this stage resolve into a Committee of the House. The Speaker does not chair the Committee as Speaker, but as Chairperson. Sometimes, the Deputy Speaker is also called upon to chair the Committee as Chairperson. The proceedings in Committee Stage are less formal. The Chairperson will go through each clause of the Bill and entertain any queries, if any, from members. Members will be free to express their views on each clause and propose amendments if necessary. It may happen that after discussions the Minister responsible for the Bill is convinced of the necessity of bringing some amendments to one or several clauses. In such a case, the mover of the amendment will propose a motion for the amendment which will be debated and put to vote. If agreed, the clause will be amended accordingly. The debates at the Committee Stage are not subject to the strict rules of the House compared to when in plenary. After the Bill has been examined and all the queries and reservations cleared, it is sent back to the House for the Third Reading. iv) Third Reading: After the Bill has gone through the Committee stage, the House will conclude in what is called the Third Reading. Usually, once examination of the Bill is concluded at Committee Stage, the Minister will move that the Bill be read the third time and passed.Annual Report 2017 - 201830 In general, the motion for the third reading is, only with very rare exceptions, carried. The exceptional occasions are that a member may, before the vote on third reading is taken, move for certain amendments of the Bill, in which case the member who wants to bring these amendments may move that the Bill be recommitted to the Committee. At the conclusion of the proceedings of the Committee on the recommittal of the Bill, the Minister in charge of the Bill may move for the third reading. Once the Bill has passed the Third Reading stage, it has to be assented to by the President. 3) Assent by the President Our Parliament consists of the President and a National Assembly. Section 46 of the Constitution provides that, \"The power of Parliament to make laws shall be exercisable by Bills passed by the Assembly and assented to by the President.\" In other words, once the Bill has been voted by the National Assembly, it is forwarded to the President for his/her assent. The President has only two alternatives. He either assents to the Bill or he withholds his assent. In general, the President gives his/her assent. Cases of withholding of assent are unusual. It is also to be noted that there are certain instances where the President has no power to withhold his assent, as stipulated in subsections 46(2)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Constitution. If ever the President decides to withhold his assent, he has to convey his decision to the Assembly within a certain delay (21 days) requesting it to reconsider the Bill. He should also propose any amendment which he considers necessary. The Assembly shall reconsider the Bill and may either - i) bring appropriate amendments as requested by the President; or ii) may not consider the President's proposal. In either case, the Assembly shall submit the Bill anew to the President. At this stage, the President is bound to signify his assent. It may happen (indeed it has happened) that the President refuses to assent when the Bill is resubmitted to him/her. In that case, he/she has no alternative but to resign. 4) Coming into force of the law The Act, which has now become law, comes into operation on the day of its publication in the Government Gazette. However, there are exceptions as follows - i) under certain conditions, an Act can be made to come into force with retrospective effect; or ii) an Act can be made to come into force at a future date by Proclamation. In both cases, the commencement date will be explicitly mentioned in the Bill in a \"Commencement Clause\".31 Ombudsperson for Children1.7 Concluding Observations by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child The Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare (MGECDFW) is drafting the Children's Bill. When reviewing this draft Bill, I encourage the MGECDFW to give special attention to the Concluding Observations made by international experts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. This Committee issued three reports for Mauritius at different points in time as enlisted below: \u0083Concluding observations on the initial periodic report (1996) 20 ; \u0083Concluding observations on the second periodic report (2006)21 ; and \u0083Concluding observations on the combined third to fifth periodic reports (2015)22 . The experts on the Committee made specific recommendations regarding certain issues, which need to be taken into consideration when reviewing the draft Children's Bill. These are listed below: 1.7.1 Legislation In all the periodic reports (1996, 2006, 2015), the Committee urged the Republic of Mauritius to incorporate the CRC into Mauritian legislation: \u0083 The Committee is concerned that the Convention is not an integral part of the national legislation and that national law and regulations are not fully consistent with the principles and provisions of the Convention (1996, paragraph 10). \u0083The Committee recommends that the State party strengthens its efforts to continue reviewing its legislation with the aim of ensuring full compliance with the principles and provisions of the Convention. Furthermore, the Committee encourages the State party to consider enacting a comprehensive Children's Act to consolidate the various pieces of legislation covering all aspects of child rights (2006, paragraph 11). \u0083 The Committee recommends that the State party take measures to ensure the incorporation of all the provisions of the Convention into the domestic legal order so that they can be fully implemented (2015, paragraph 8). \u0083 The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation (CRC/C/MUS/CO/2, para. 11) that the State party expedite revision of its legislation with the aim of ensuring full compliance with the principles and provisions of the Convention and uniform application of the legislation on children's rights in all parts of the State party (2015, paragraph 10). 20 Committee on the Rights of the Child (1996). Concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child: Mauritius. Geneva: United Nations. 21 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2006). Concluding observations: Mauritius. Geneva: United Nations. 22 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2015). Concluding observations on the combined third to fifth periodic reports of Mauritius. Geneva: United Nations.Annual Report 2017 - 2018321.7.2 General principles of the CRC The Committee expressed concern in 1996 regarding general principles of the CRC which were not enshrined in current laws: \u0083The State party has not yet taken fully into account in its legislation and policies the general principles of the Convention: non-discrimination (art. 2), the best interests of the child (art. 3) and respect for the views of the child (art. 12) (1996, paragraph 13). The Committee made the following recommendations in relation to this matter: \u0083 The Committee recommends that the principle of the best interests of the child enshrined in article 3 be systematically implemented in judicial and administrative decisions as well as in programmes, projects and services with regard to children in various situations (2006, paragraph 30). \u0083 In light of article 12 of the Convention, the Committee recommends that the State party continue and strengthen its actions to promote the rights of the child to express his/her views fully in all matters affecting him/her, including within the school, in the media, the courts, administrative bodies and in society in general (2006, paragraph 32). \u0083 The Committee recommends that the State party take all necessary measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination , including by incorporating a general prohibition on direct and indirect discrimination in a children's act (2015, paragraph 28). \u0083 In the light of its general comment No. 14 (2013) on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration , the Committee recommends that the State party ensure that this right is appropriately integrated and consistently applied in all legislative, administrative and judicial proceedings and decisions as well as in all policies, programmes and projects that are relevant to and have an impact on children. In this regard, the State party is encouraged to elaborate the right of the best interests of the child in a comprehensive manner in a children's act , and to develop procedures and criteria to provide guidance to all relevant persons in authority for determining the best interests of the child in every area and for giving it due weight as a primary consideration (2015, paragraph 30). \u0083 In the light of its general comment No. 12 (2009) on the right of the child to be heard, the Committee recommends that the State party take measures to ensure the effective implementation of legislation recognizing the right of the child to be heard in relevant court and administrative proceedings, in particular on the custody of children, including by establishing systems and/or procedures for social workers and courts to comply with the principle (2015, paragraph 32(a)). 1.7.3 Rehabilitation of victims The Committee raised the need for Mauritius to invest in the quality therapeutic rehabilitation of children victim of different forms of abuse:33 Ombudsperson for Children \u0083 The Committee also recommends that the Penal Code be amended in the light of the Convention. Further measures should be taken with a view to ensuring the physical and psychological recovery and rehabilitation of the victims of abuse, neglect, ill-treatment, violence or exploitation, in accordance with article 39 of the Convention (1996, paragraph 31). 1.7.4 Right to privacy The Committee drew attention to the fact that, in some cases, the identity of children who have been victims of abuse or in conflict with the law is not respected by the media: \u0083 The Committee recommends that the State party take all necessary legislative measures to fully protect the right of the child to privacy and to support the initiatives of the Ombudsperson for Children in this domain, including the proposals of drafting a Code of Ethics (2006, paragraph 36). \u0083 The Committee recommends that the State party ensure that the child victim's privacy is protected in legal proceedings (2006, paragraph 48(b)). \u0083 The Committee recommends that the State party take further legislative and policy measures to protect effectively the right of the child to privacy , including by encouraging the media to expeditiously adopt a code of ethics and conduct training on the Convention for those working in and with the media (2015, paragraph 36). 1.7.5 Prohibition of corporal punishment The Committee urged for stronger legislations to prevent ill-treatment and corporal punishment towards children in multiple settings: \u0083 In the light of articles 19, 34 and 35 of the Convention, the Committee encourages the State party to take all appropriate measures to prevent and combat ill-treatment of children, including child abuse within the family, corporal punishment, child labour and the sexual exploitation of children, including victims of sexual tourism (1996, paragraph 31). \u0083 The Committee reiterates its previous concluding observations (CRC/C/15/Add.64, para. 31) and urges the State party to prohibit through legislation and other measures corporal punishment of children in the family, in schools, in penal institutions and in alternative care settings (2006, paragraph 38). \u0083 The Committee urges the State party to ensure that its legislation, including a children's act, explicitly prohibits corporal punishment in all settings. The Committee also urges the State party to promote positive, non-violent and participatory forms of child-rearing and discipline. The State party is further encouraged to establish a clear reporting system for incidents of corporal punishment, notably in school s (2015, paragraph 38).Annual Report 2017 - 2018341.7.6 Public participation/Revision of the draft Children's Bill The Committee highlighted the need to involve the public and children in the process of drafting legislations that matter to them. Please also refer to Part B of this chapter for more information on a process of public and child participation for the review of the draft Children's Bill. \u0083 The Committee encourages the State party to urgently adopt a comprehensive children's act in order to consolidate the legislation covering all aspects of children's rights, and to ensure the active involvement of children and organizations working on child rights in the drafting process for the act (2015, paragraph 10). 1.7.7 Coordinating body \u0083 The Committee urges the State party to establish or designate an effective coordination body, such as through a children's act , at a high inter-ministerial level, with a clear mandate and sufficient authority to coordinate all activities relating to the implementation of the Convention at the cross-sectoral, national, regional and local levels. The State party should ensure that the said coordinating body is provided with the necessary human, technical and financial resources to function effectively (2015, paragraph 14). 1.7.8 Minimum age of marriage \u0083The Committee urges the State party to ensure that the minimum age of marriage, set at 18 years, is strictly enforced, in line with the State party's obligations under the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (2015, paragraph 26). It is important to emphasise here that the Republic of Mauritius has been repeatedly advised on similar issues. In this context, it is essential that the forthcoming Children's Bill covers all aspects of the CRC so as to provide for better and expansive rights of children. 35 Ombudsperson for Children Part B: The importance of public participation in drafting of the Children's BillAnnual Report 2017 - 2018361.8 Rationale for public participation in developing the draft Bill Public participation within legislative review and reform gives the possibility to citizens to influence the development of laws which affect them. Participatory approaches are known to create an atmosphere of open dialogue and collaboration among different parties who contribute their own resources in view of building a stronger democracy (OSEC, 2010) 23. Within a human rights-based approach, rights and responsibilities need to be co-created by all duty bearers and rights holders including vulnerable groups of children. A thorough and cost-effective public consultation process can substantially improve the revision of a bill mainly in terms of its appropriateness to its target population. The collation of multiple local and international perspectives from child and adult participants can create a sense of ownership to the formulation of the legislation and responsibility in its implementation. This process may also potentially save time and resources in drafting and tabling the Bill in Parliament. Some African countries such as Namibia and South Africa have conducted extensive public consultation processes in revising their child legislations. I believe that the country can learn from their approaches and implement a similar initiative within our local context. In the following section, I outline some key ideas on how to coordinate public participation in the potential review of the Draft Children's Bill in the Republic of Mauritius. For further reference, a summary of the main steps undertaken by the Namibian Government in the successful public revision of their draft Child Care and Protection Bill (Ministry of Gender Research, Equality and Child Welfare (MGRECW et al., 2009) 24 can be consulted. The main report was a 256-page detailed document (MGRECW et al., 2010)25, which could serve as a guide to governments who may wish to adapt this process to their respective countries. 1.9 Some key considerations in reforming the Mauritian Draft Children's Bill through public participation 1.9.1 Scope The consultation process would cover Mauritius (split into a set number of regions), Rodrigues and Agalega. Meetings and consultation activities would be organised at both regional and national levels. Multiple stakeholders including Ministries, NGOs, private institutions, school communities, child specialist groups, international guests, the judiciary and members of the 23 Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (2010).

Funding for such an initiative could be fully or partly requested from different national and international partners working in the field of child welfare such as the MGECDFM, the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Institutional Reforms and the United Nations Children's Fund among others. 1.9.2 Time frame The Namibian's consultation process, which included project planning, consultation with the public and incorporation of their input into a revised version of the Bill, was conducted over a period of 12 months (MGRECW et al., 2010). Owing to the extensive geographical area of Namibia, this length of time was required to undertake the different regional consultations. In the context of the Republic of Mauritius, I believe that a period of 2-3 months could suit the scope of such a consultation process within all local regions. 1.9.3 Human Resources A Steering Committee or Working Group responsible in planning, guiding, supervising and assessing the consultations can be set up. This group may consist of governmental representatives from all relevant ministries, non-governmental professionals in the field of child welfare, other child specialists, scholars and legal advisors, as well as adult and child members of the public. The members could meet on a weekly or fortnightly basis over the term of the project. 1.9.4 Developing materials Materials such as a summary of the draft Bill, factsheets on topics covered by the Bill, booklets, leaflets, written feedback and, interim and final reports among others are likely to be produced during the consultation process. It will be very important that these are understandable to the lay person and presented in a user-friendly and easy-to-read format. Materials intended for children must be simple, colourful and stimulating. Key documents may also be presented in accessible formats (e.g. audio, large font, sign language, Braille, etc.) and in different languages (English, French and Mauritian Creole) to overcome disability and linguistic barriers. 1.9.5 Engaging the media It is key that the media is kept engaged throughout this process as a collaborator, a resource and a platform for exchange of information and feedback. To encourage wide public involvement, the messages have to be interesting and relevant to people across ages and walks of life. A media liaison person can be appointed to coordinate all channels of communication during the consultation process. Journalists have to be briefed on the rationale of this initiative. They Annual Report 2017 - 201838also have to be provided with up-to-date material to keep the public informed of the project's progress. It will be to the benefit of this process to use various communication methods, for instance: Articles and inserts of factsheets about the Bill in national newspapers and magazines; Radio and television programmes; Free of charge text messages; Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter; Electronic mail; Electronic newsletters; A dedicated website on the consultation process and regular updates on partners' websites such as Ministries, NGOs and universities; Telephone or fax; and Post. This multi-communication approach can allow for under-represented groups of children and adults and those living in deprived regions to also access information and participate in the consultation. 1.9.6 Consulting with children Child participation will be an essential ingredient in this law reform, as supported by article 12(1) of the CRC (UN, 1989): States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. We have to ensure that the design and implementation of children's consultations move beyond tokenism, that is, only a symbolic presence of children with limited or no opportunities to formulate their opinions (Steinitz, 2009) 26. The process has to be sensitively planned to include children from all regions of our country and to take into account periods that they may be less able to engage such as during holidays or exam times. The Namibian Government recommended small regional consultations with children rather than those on a national scale (MGRECW et al., 2010). A group of young leaders could be trained to facilitate children's consultations and feedback to the main Working Group. The consultations have to be creative and lively to encourage children to express themselves freely in a safe and respectful environment. Their participation needs to be voluntary and informed. Their input has to be valued through giving them feedback on the outcomes of their contribution. 26 Steinitz, L.Y . (2009). Guidelines for Promoting Child Participation. Namibia: Family Health International. Retrieved 19 January 2018 from www.lac.org.na/projects/grap/Pdf/CCPA-GuidelinesforChildParticipation.pdf39 Ombudsperson for Children1.9.7 Consulting with adults In the review of the draft Bill, adult stakeholders could be engaged within regional and national workshops to discuss and revise different themes of the legislation including foster care, adoption and protection among others. Regional workshops could involve community and local representatives of different organisations and citizens working with and for children. The national workshop could additionally invite international guests and experts to contribute their know-how and experiences. Elected child representatives from regional consultations could also be included in this process. Workshops of a more technical nature must also be organised, which may include legal representatives, government officials, child specialists and scholars among others. This team could work together in drawing key elements of public input from the regional and national workshops and incorporating these in a formal language in a revised version of the draft Bill. These meetings could also be used to identify topics that are missing in the Bill and to compare it with child-specific legislations of other countries with similar socio-economic profiles. 1.9.8 Budgeting for contingency opportunities When undertaking such an initiative, it is advisable to allow for a contingency sum to cater for unplanned activities, for example, additional technical training for members of the Working Group and unanticipated participation at local and international events relevant to the revision of the draft Bill. 1.10 Concluding thoughts I believe that enabling such a law reform process can become a blueprint and an asset to the country in reviewing other current and future bills and laws. Many service evaluation and research opportunities for students, scholars and practitioners can also emerge from this public consultation. This could help us learn further on the pros and cons of this process and improve its mechanisms. The Namibian's public consultation process was considered to be a best practice model in the African region (MGRECW et al., 2010). I think that adapting their model to our local context could be a starting point to this proposed law reform initiative.Annual Report 2017 - 20184041 Ombudsperson for Children Part C: The laws of the Republic of Mauritius and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the ChildAnnual Report 2017 - 2018421.11 Child legislation of the Republic of Mauritius and the UNCRC: An introduction According to section 5 of the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, one of my main roles as the Ombudsperson for Children is to \"promote compliance with the Convention\". To draft and propose a new piece of legislation for the promotion and protection of children's rights in the Republic of Mauritius, it is important to take stock of existing laws and how they relate to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; UN, 1989). Within this spirit and in the context of the forthcoming Children's Bill, my office prepared a compilation of a maximum of Mauritian child laws that could be retrieved from local sources and categorised them under each one of the 40 articles of the UNCRC (as shown in the next section). This exercise carried out by my team of investigators can enable all child rights activists to understand the urgency of having a consolidated and comprehensive Children's Bill and to be in a better position to promote children's rights. It can also allow policy decision makers to assume their responsibilities in a more informed way. Last but not the least, I would like to emphasise that we have the appropriate resources in the Republic of Mauritius to conceptualise the Children's Bill. Civil society organisations must be provided with appropriate training to contribute to the Bill. The expertise of the State Law Office and the Law Reform Commission must be solicited to ensure that the Bill is reviewed in a systematic way and is understandable and accessible. The Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare must ensure that all stakeholders work together on this Bill in the best interests of the children of our Republic. Some key points to remember in relation to the review of the forthcoming Children's Bill \u0083How are things currently: 1. Laws concerning children are scattered throughout the legislation in the Republic of Mauritius. 2. The country has yet to incorporate the UNCRC in its entirety into national law. 3. The Constitution of Mauritius, specific Codes and Acts outline the different rights of children in the Republic of Mauritius, even though the UNCRC is not domesticated in local legislation. 4. Since the country's ratification of the UNCRC in July 1990, the legislature has aimed at respecting certain articles of this Convention through various local legislative reforms. This however does not mean that we are fully compliant with the UNCRC. 5. Successive governments have expressed their determination to domesticate the UNCRC to better protect children's rights.43 Ombudsperson for Children \u0083What should we avoid: 1. We should not use a 'piecemeal approach' to law reform in child-related matters, which tends to focus on specific areas or categories of children and fails to include all children's rights. 2. Participation of a critical mass of members of civil society organisations and public bodies would not in itself allow for the proper conceptualisation of the Children's Bill. If the participants do not have a prior sound knowledge of children's rights from a United Nations' perspective and of all local laws related to children, their inputs would be limited and ineffective. \u0083What should we hope for in the review of the forthcoming Children's Bill: 1. A comprehensive and consolidated Children's Bill will make children's rights a reality in the Republic of Mauritius. 2. The forthcoming Bill should incorporate the entire UNCRC. 3. Contributors to the Children's Bill must be provided with a prior working knowledge on child rights and legislation before their inputs are solicited. This process should be adapted to the specific learning needs of the contributors such as through child-friendly and accessible information and materials. 4. An important part of the Bill must deal with matters that need to be implemented on a practical level, which means that clear regulations will be required to implement the Act. 5. The Bill must deal with principles that are fundamental to the manner in which children are treated and protected. 6. The domestication of this Convention in local legislation will, among others, ensure that concrete actions are taken when children's rights are violated; increase accountability by creating legal liability for public authorities on the way they deal with children and handle children's matters; raise awareness of children's rights; and promote child participation.Annual Report 2017 - 2018441.12 Compilation of existing child-related local laws in correspondence with the articles of the UNCRC Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child \u0083Definition of a Child For the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. \u0083Mauritian laws related to Article 1 1.

SECOND SCHEDULE (sections 21, 24, 25) CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BROADCASTING SERVICES Section 1. Preamble The fundamental principle to be upheld is that the freedom of all broadcasting licensees is indivisible from, and subject to, the same restraints as those relevant to the individual person, and is founded on the individual's right to be informed and to freely receive and disseminate opinions. Section 2. General Broadcasting licensees shall - (a) not broadcast any material which is indecent, obscene or offensive to public morals or offensive to the religious convictions or feelings of any section of the population or likely to prejudice the safety of the State or the public order or relations between sections of the population; (b) not, without due care and sensitivity, present material which depicts or relates to brutality, violence, atrocities, drug abuse and obscenity; and (c) exercise due care and responsibility in the presentation of programmes where a large number of children are likely to be part of the audience. Annual Report 2017 - 2018122 Section 3. News (1) Broadcasting licensees shall report news truthfully, accurately and objectively. (2) News shall be presented in the correct context and in a balanced manner, without intentional or negligent departure from the facts, whether by - (a) distortion, exaggeration or misrepresentation; (b) material omission; or (c) summarisation. (3) Only that which may reasonably be true, having due regard to the source of the news, may be presented as fact, and such facts shall be broadcast fairly with due regard to context and importance. Where a report is not based on fact or is founded on opinion, supposition, rumors or allegations, it shall be presented in such manner as to indicate clearly that such is the case. (4) Where there is reason to doubt the correctness of a report and it is practicable to verify the correctness thereof, it shall be verified. Where such verification is not practicable, that fact shall be mentioned in the report. (5) Where it subsequently appears that a broadcast report was incorrect in a material respect, it shall be rectified forthwith, without reservation or delay. The rectification shall be presented with such a degree of prominence and timing as may be adequate and fair so as to readily attract attention. (6) Reports, photograph or video material relating to matters involving indecency or obscenity shall be presented with due sensitivity, due regard being had to the prevailing moral climate. In particular, broadcasting licensees shall avoid the broadcasting of obscene and lascivious matter. (7) The identity of rape victims and other victims of sexual violence shall not be divulged in any broadcast without the prior consent of the victim concerned.123 Ombudsperson for ChildrenArticle 18 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child \u0083Parental responsibilities 1. States Parties shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child. The best interests of the child will be their basic concern. 2. For the purpose of guaranteeing and promoting the rights set forth in the present Convention, States Parties shall render appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities and shall ensure the development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of children. 3. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that children of working parents have the right to benefit from child-care services and facilities for which they are eligible. \u0083Mauritian laws related to Article 18 1.

States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a refugee in accordance with applicable international or domestic law and procedures shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied by his or her parents or by any other person, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of applicable rights set forth in the present Convention and in other international human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the said States are Parties. 2. For this purpose, States Parties shall provide, as they consider appropriate, co-operation in any efforts by the United Nations and other competent intergovernmental organizations or non-governmental organizations co-operating with the United Nations to protect and assist such a child and to trace the parents or other members of the family of any refugee child in order to obtain information necessary for reunification with his or her family. In cases where no parents or other members of the family can be found, the child shall be accorded the same protection as any other child permanently or temporarily deprived of his or her family environment for any reason, as set forth in the present Convention. \u0083 Mauritian laws related to Article 22 No local legislation related to refugees in the Republic of Mauritius In the case MAHMOTAKY M.A. v. THE SECRETARY FOR HOME AFFAIRS & ORS 2003 SCJ 238 , the following observations were made: It is true that the then Colony of Mauritius succeeded to the Convention relating to the status of Refugees by reason of the fact that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland became a signatory of the said Convention on 28 July 1951, which was ratified on 11 March 1954 and extended to the Colony of Mauritius, as per the Notification of Territorial Application made by the United Kingdom on 25 October 1956 according to Article 40 of the Convention. As can be further gathered from the affidavit [...], Ambassador posted at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Regional Co-operation, in a letter dated 12 March 1968 addressed to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the then Prime Minister acknowledged that many treaty rights and obligations of the United Kingdom were succeeded by Mauritius upon independence by virtue of the customary international law, so that Mauritius succeeded to the 1951 Convention, as was also explained in the case of Danche v The Commissioner of Police & ors [2002 SCJ 171] in the context relating to all treaties, multilateral or bilateral. It is important to note that the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees covered only those persons who had become refugees as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951, which does not apply to the applicant. The Protocol relating to the status of Refugees Annual Report 2017 - 2018168 of 31 January 1967 redefined the term \"refugee\" thus removing the restriction concerning events occurring only prior to 1 January 1951. However, that Protocol came into force on 4 October 1967 and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland adhered to it on 4 September 1968, that is, after Mauritius had become independent. As affirmed [...] Mauritius is not a party to the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967. Further, there is no domestic law in Mauritius on which the applicant can rely to claim the status of refugee. In fact, the applicant has been refused entry under section 13 of the Immigration Act and it appears from the affidavits filed that the procedure under that section has been followed.169 Ombudsperson for ChildrenArticle 23 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child \u0083 Children with disabilities 1.

Statutory authorities, journalists, other professionals and the civil society have since then been trying to unpack the phenomenon of teenage pregnancy and parenthood. These events have also urged us to identify and reflect on several areas that require improvements in our country to prevent minors from engaging in sexual activity, falling pregnant or getting \"married\". Several other issues such as child sexual abuse, teen dating and cohabitation (or \"concubinage\") between either two minors or an adult and a minor have also been brought to light. While some of these teenage pregnancies catch media attention, we can certainly argue that there are currently many more cases in the country that are not reported to authorities. I, the Ombudsperson for Children, am mandated to provide recommendations on areas of concern in order to ensure the promotion of the rights and welfare of children of the Republic of Mauritius, especially those finding themselves in vulnerable situations. Pregnant adolescents and teenage parents, especially mothers, undoubtedly comprise one such vulnerable group of children who merit special consideration from the relevant stakeholders. It is important to explore the complex interplay of personal, physical and psychosocial factors that make young Mauritians more vulnerable to the societal challenges of teenage pregnancy and parenthood. In this context, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office conducted inquiries on this particular matter from a child rights perspective. A major initiative was the release of a Press Communiqu\u00e9 on 25 June 2018 to invite interested citizens to come forward with their inputs regarding teenage pregnancy and parenthood and other related issues. A copy of the Communiqu\u00e9 is provided in section 2.3 of the current chapter and a summary of responses received are outlined in subsection 2.4.3. In the present chapter, I start by providing an overview of three selected cases of teenage pregnancy in Mauritius. Based on issues identified through these cases, I then present my findings in relation to international and local provisions on teenage pregnancy in order to understand this phenomenon in Mauritius. Finally, I propose some recommendations. It is important to note that the first two selected cases have been reported but not investigated by my office. This is because they are involved in judicial proceedings and, according to the section 7(4) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, I am not allowed to \"investigate any case which is pending before any Court\". The third one was investigated upon receipt of a complaint made to my office which was not being dealt by Court.Annual Report 2017 - 20182322.2 An o verview of three selected cases of teenage pregnancy 2.2.1 \"Married\" and pregnant at 13 years old Ms. A27, a 13-year-old girl, was illegally married to a 19-year-old young man named Mr. B and was pregnant. Ms. A's parents reported that they had opposed this marriage, but they gave in to their daughter's threats of harming herself if they did not agree. Ms. A and Mr. B were \"married\" during a family ceremony, after which Ms. A left school and lived at her husband's place. Ms. A was three months pregnant when she faced a sudden death in the bathroom at her husband's home. Her family suspected that she was a victim of domestic violence, an allegation denied by Mr. B's family. The autopsy concluded that Ms. A had died of a severe asthma crisis. Nevertheless, Mr. B was arrested by the police based on section 14 of the Child Protection Act 1994 for having caused a child to be sexually abused. Mr. B stipulated that he did not know that marriage and sexual intercourse with a minor under 16 years old were against local laws. This case certainly raised attention on several issues such as the definition of a child in our country, the minimum age of marriage, child marriage, parental authority, the compulsory age for education, teenage pregnancy and a lack of knowledge and understanding of sexual offences in the Republic of Mauritius. 2.2.2 The case of physical and sexual abuse against a 13-year-old pregnant adolescent girl Ms. X, a 13-year-old girl, who stopped school at Grade 8, has been dating her 19-year-old boyfriend, Mr. Y , since a couple of years. Although this is unlawful, Mr. Y caused Ms. X to engage in sexual activity with him. This resulted in Ms. X falling pregnant at 13 years old. Following an argument, Mr. Y physically abused Ms. X by slapping her several times. Ms. X reported her pregnancy and physical abuse to her mother who informed the police immediately. Mr. Y was arrested for having had sexual intercourse with a minor under 16 years as per subsection 249(4) of the Criminal Code Act 1838 and for causing a child to be sexually abused under section 14 of the Child Protection Act 1994. Ms. X, who was pregnant of 7 months, was kept under observation at a local hospital. Mr. Y was released on bail while awaiting trial. Despite her mother's and the police's prohibitions, Ms. X remained insistent on wanting to meet Mr. Y . In the best interests of Ms. X, an Emergency Protection Order was issued by the Court and the concerned statutory authority transferred her to a place of safety on the day of her discharge from hospital. Following reassessment of her family's circumstances, needs and safety, a decision will be made by the relevant authorities on whether she can be reunited with her family and, if so, under which conditions. 27 All names in section 2.2 have been replaced with arbitrary alphabets to protect the individuals' identities.233 Ombudsperson for ChildrenThis particular case also brought up issues such as the compulsory age for education, a lack of understanding of sexual offences against minors under 16 years, teenage pregnancy, parental authority and challenges in child protection. 2.2.3 The case of declaring the forthcoming baby of a 16-year-old girl Ms. V, a 16-year-old adolescent girl, is four months pregnant with Mr. W, her same-aged boyfriend. This has been a matter of dispute and stress between the two families. Ms. V's parents initially wanted to settle the matter through marriage, otherwise they would lodge a complaint against the boy. It was reported that Ms. V and Mr. W did not wish to get married presently. Allegedly being pressured by Ms. V's father and unsure about who should declare the forthcoming baby, Mr. W's mother registered a complaint at the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO). She reported that Ms. V's father claimed that he will declare his grandchild. The case was reported to the concerned authority. Ms. V contacted the investigator of the OCO claiming that particular adults from that authority were trying to convince her into getting married to her boyfriend to resolve the conflict. Reports on this case were requested from the concerned authority. Both families and minors were convened to the OCO in order to work on lawful solutions collaboratively. This case explored several questions such as: When declaring a baby at the Civil Status Office, what document is required as proof of paternity? Are birth notifications issued by ALL hospitals and private clinics to certify a child's birth? How is paternity acknowledged by the authorities? Can a minor declare his or her baby? When a minor declares a baby, is there any notification to the CDU or the police? Are Civil Status Officers sensitised on matters related to teenage pregnancy? Can grandparents declare their grandchildren? Can situations where 16/17-year-old minors are dating and engaging in sexual activity be referred to as 'abuse'? Can a case be lodged against the boy or the girl? In the end, Ms. V's father did not lodge a complaint against Mr. W. Within 45 days post-birth, Ms. V declared the baby alone using her surname. One month later, Mr. W called at the Civil Status Office to acknowledge the baby. 2.3 Investigations conducted by the OCO on teenage pregnancy and associated issues Several investigation techniques were used to understand the phenomenon of teenage pregnancy and parenthood in order to build a picture of its current situation in Mauritius. These included: Searching for international and local literature on this topic; Conducting interviews with the Registrar of the Civil Status Office and relevant local Annual Report 2017 - 2018234organisations such as 'Mouvement d' Aide \u00e0 la Maternit\u00e9' (MAM), Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association (MFPWA) and Action Familiale (AF) to determine the extent of the problem and to take cognizance of the services offered to pregnant adolescents and teenage mothers in Mauritius; Consulting relevant press articles; Analysing cases of teenage pregnancy referred to the OCO; and Releasing a national Press Communiqu\u00e9 (see below) to invite inputs from interested citizens on the matter of teenage pregnancy and parenthood, and other related issues. All the relevant information gathered have been synthesised in section 2.4 of the present chapter.235 Ombudsperson for ChildrenREPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS Communiqu\u00e9 from Ombudsperson for Children's Office The saddening death of a 13-year-old girl child in Goodlands who was pregnant and \"married\", has undoubtedly stirred reflections on several issues regarding children such as teenage pregnancy, child marriage, child sexual abuse, teen dating and cohabitation (\"concubinage\") between either two minors or an adult and a minor. I, the Ombudsperson for Children, would like to draw the attention of all Mauritian citizens on the fact that it is the prime duty of families to protect children from all forms of abuse. Moreover, as recommended by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, Mauritian laws should be amended to define a child as a person under the age of 18 and to prohibit marriages under this age. It is important to hear the voice of Mauritian people on these issues. In this context, I invite interested citizens including children, to provide their inputs in one of the following ways: \u0083 By calling in person at the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO), 1st Floor, NPF Building, Rue des Artistes, Beau-Bassin , between 10 am and 3 pm from Monday 25 June 2018 to Friday 06 July 2018. \u0083 By phoning us on (230) 454-3010 and 464 4380 (Monday to Friday between 9 am and 3.30 pm) \u0083 By emailing us on ombudschild@govmu.org This will enable me to propose meaningful recommendations to the relevant authorities on these matters. I rely on your participation and I thank you in anticipation. Rita Venkatasawmy (Mrs) O S K Ombudsperson for Children Annual Report 2017 - 20182362.4 Findings 2.4.1 Some international literature on teenage pregnancy and early marriage There is no standard international definition of 'adolescence', but it is commonly attributed to the age period from 10 to 19 years. In its General Comment No.4, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003) 28 described 'adolescence' and its developmental and health implications in the following words: [A] period characterized by rapid physical, cognitive and social changes, including sexual and reproductive maturation ; the gradual building up of the capacity to assume adult behaviours and roles involving new responsibilities requiring new knowledge and skills. While adolescents are in general a healthy population group, adolescence also poses new challenges to health and development owing to their relative vulnerability and pressure from society, including peers, to adopt risky health behaviour. These challenges include developing an individual identity and dealing with one's sexuality . The World Health Organisation (WHO; 2018) 29 outlined that around 16 million girls aged 15 to 19 years and 2.5 million girls under 16 years give birth annually, especially in developing regions such as several parts of Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Historically, and still in some cultures, teenage pregnancy and motherhood have been generally accepted. However, these have been challenged fairly recently with worldwide mindset shifts on, for example, women empowerment and gender equality, and with the international recognition of girls' rights to education and a high standard of health. Several potential determinant factors of teenage pregnancy have been suggested by Simigiu (2012) 30, for instance, being sexually active at an early post-pubertal age along with poor sexual education; being children of single parents who have more permissive sexual attitudes; experiencing traumatic events at a young age, especially those involving sexual abuse; being a preteenager living with adolescents who are sexually active or with a pregnant sister; having difficult relationships with one's parents; being part of cultures that are more tolerant of early pregnancy; and living in a society with high unemployment rates. 28 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003).

Paper presented at the International Conference of Scientific Paper, Afases 2012, Brasov, Romania.237 Ombudsperson for ChildrenNowadays, pregnancy in adolescence and mothering as a teenager are known to have adverse consequences on the young girl's and their baby's medical health, mental health, education and social opportunities. According to Simigiu (2012), some examples of consequences of teenage parenthood were suggested as follows: Teenage mothers experience longer period of loneliness, educational sacrifice, low employment opportunities and smaller income than those of non-adolescent mothers; Babies born to teenage mothers are more likely to experience medical complications such as being premature or weighing less at birth; Less than one on five teenage mothers marry the father of their child; Teenage fathers earn a lower income and engage in more delinquent behaviours than non-adolescent fathers; There is significant financial burden on the extended family and on the society through public assistance to cater for the needs of the teenage mother and her child. The WHO (2018) highlighted that complications during pregnancy and childbirth are considered to be the leading cause of death for 15 to 19-year-old girls worldwide. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (2003) also expressed concerns in its General Comment No. 4 that \"early marriage and pregnancy are significant factors in health problems related to sexual and reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS\" (article 20) and they urged countries to ensure that adolescent girls are sensitised about these dangers and have \"access to health services that are sensitive to their rights and particular needs\" (article 31). 2.4.2 Local provisions on issues related to teenage pregnancy and motherhood 2.4.2.1) Statistics on teenage pregnancy and motherhood in the Republic of Mauritius The OCO retrieved statistics on teenage pregnancy and motherhood from several locally published sources as shown below: i) The 2011 Housing and Population Census Analysis Report (Statistics Mauritius, 2015): According to Statistics Mauritius (2015)31 , the teenage fertility rate for the Republic of Mauritius among young women aged 15 to 19 years old was around 32 births per 1,000 in the year 2011 compared to 39 births per 1000 in the year 2000. The rate is more elevated than those for some developed countries such as Germany (i.e. 5 births per 1000) and Australia (i.e. 13 births per 1000), and lower than those for African countries such as South Africa (i.e. 53 births per 1000) and Kenya (i.e. 95 births per 1000). In the island of Rodrigues, the teenage fertility rate among young women aged 15-19 years during the period from 2000 to 2011 was on average 65 births per 1000 women. 31 Statistics Mauritius (2015). 2011 Housing and Population Census Analysis Report, Volume VIII - Nuptiality, fertility and Childlessness.

During the celebration of the World Population Day 2015 (Government Information Service, 2015)33, the Minister of Health and Quality of Life, had highlighted that the reported Mauritian figure for the year 2014 (i.e. 12.1 per cent) had increased by 1.2 per cent from that obtained in the year 2000 (i.e. 10.9 per cent). He also advanced that the situation must be tackled from a medico-social perspective. iii) Health Statistics Report (MHQL, 2016)34 : From the year 2010 to 2016, there has been a gradual decrease in the number of live births registered among mothers aged between 10 and less than 20 years in Mauritius from 1,530 to 1,036. iv) Figures requested by OCO from the Civil Status Office: The number of birth registrations at the Civil Status Office from 2013 to 2017, where at least one of the parents (either the mother or the father) is a minor aged less than 18 years was 2316. v) Figures from the Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association (MFPWA) as published in a local newspaper (Sunday Times, 2018 ) 35: From January to March 2018, 35 young pregnant teens were sexually abused, with the majority of victims being between 12 and 15 years old. From January to March 2016, there were 45 cases of teenage pregnancy among 96 girls who had been sexually abused. In 2017, 208 cases of teenage pregnancies have been registered against 147 in 2015. The President of MFPWA concluded that, \"The situation is worsening over the years. We have alarming figures facing us. It is time to act\". 2.4.2.2) Relevant local legislation and policies This present subsection summarises the different local legislation and policies that are linked to the several issues raised in the three selected case studies as well as to the responses received from the various stakeholders who participated in the OCO's inquiries: i) Who is a 'child' in the Republic of Mauritius? Across different laws concerning children in the Republic of Mauritius, there are confusions as to the definition of the 'child'.

Retrieved 04 August 2018 from www.sundaytimesmauritius.com/teenage-pregnancy-a-growing-concern/ 239 Ombudsperson for Childrenchild as \"any unmarried person under the age of 18\". The Employment Rights Act 2008 refers to the child as \"a person under the age of 16\". In contrast, the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003 defines the child as \"a person under the age of 18\", which is based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child's (CRC; United Nations, 1989)36 definition. In the CPA 1994's definition of the child, the term 'unmarried' has long stirred debates within the regional and international community, as discussed next. ii) The minimum age of marriage The 'Code Civil Mauricien' stipulates that no one can marry before the age of 18 years in the Republic of Mauritius (article 144). However, a clause exists within this law whereby a minor who is below the age of 18 years but over 16 years old can get married with the consent of his father and mother or the one who detains parental authority (article 145). This consent should be expressed in the presence of a Civil Status Officer, a notary, or the person authorised to conduct the marriage. It is worthy to note that, in the 1970s and early 1980s, the 'Muvman Liberasyon Fam', a local women's movement, had been very active on the field to advocate for a two-pronged change in the Civil Code: firstly, the age of marriage should be raised to 18 years, and secondly, in exceptional cases of earlier marriage, a Court Order should be required along with parental permission. Following these years of activism, the age of marriage was raised to 18 in the series of 1980 to 1981 amendments of the Civil Code. However, on 10 April 1984, there was a unanimous vote in Parliament to lower the minimum age of marriage to 16 years old, which has been maintained since that time. Within the regional community, Mauritius is the ONLY country that has NOT signed the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development (Gender Links Johannesburg, 2017) 37. This protocol (SADC, 2008)38 aims to \"provide for the empowerment of women, eliminate discrimination and achieve gender equality by encouraging and harmonising the development and implementation of gender responsive legislation, policies and programmes and projects\". In its article 8 on 'marriage and family rights', this document proposed that: (2) Legislation on marriage shall ensure that: (a) No person under the age of 18 shall marry unless otherwise specified by law, which takes into account the best interests and the welfare of the child; (b) Every marriage takes place with the free and full consent of both parties; (c) Every marriage, including civil, religious, traditional or customary, is registered in accordance with national laws; 36 United Nations (1989).

In 2016, Mauritius advanced its reason for not signing this protocol as not agreeing to the above-stated article 8(2)(a), which was \"against certain religious practices in Mauritius\" (Gender Links Johannesburg, 2017). Paradoxically, in 1992, our country had ratified the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (African Commission on Human and People's Rights [ACHPR], 1990) 39 , whereby it committed to uphold all the Charter's provisions, including article 21(2) which states that: Child marriage and the betrothal40 of girls and boys shall be prohibited and effective action, including legislation, shall be taken to specify the minimum age of marriage to be 18 years and make registration of all marriages in an official registry compulsory. However, since Mauritius is a dualist country, any ratified public international laws will not apply until they are domesticated or incorporated within local legislation through Parliament. The international community has recognised that ending child marriage, that is before the child's 18 th birthday, is key to achieving at least 8 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, including no poverty, zero hunger, quality education, gender equality and decent work and economic growth (Girls Not Brides, 2018)41. In this spirit, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (2015)42 expressed its concerns regarding Mauritius's minimum age of marriage and made recommendations as follows: 25. The Committee is concerned that, while the age of marriage is set at 18 years (art. 144 of the Civil Code), exceptions to the minimum age of marriage are possible and extensively granted, as is shown by the high number of underage marriages in the State party. The Committee is also concerned that the Child Protection Act defines a child as any unmarried person under the age of 18. 26. The Committee urges the State party to ensure that the minimum age of marriage, set at 18 years, is strictly enforced, in line with the State party's obligations under the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. The Committee recommends that the State party carry out comprehensive awareness-raising programmes on the negative consequences of child marriage, targeting in particular parents, teachers and community leaders. 39 African Commission on Human and People's Rights (1990).

Concluding observations on the combined third to fifth periodic reports of Mauritius . Geneva: United Nations.241 Ombudsperson for Childreniii) Sexual offences against a minor under 16 years The Child Protection Act 1994 provides in section 14 on 'sexual offences' that: (1) Any person who causes, incites or allows any child - (a) to be sexually abused by him or by another person; (b) to have access to a brothel; (c) to engage in prostitution, shall commit an offence. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a child shall be deemed to be sexually abused where he has taken part whether as a willing or unwilling participant or observer in any act which is sexual in nature for the purposes of - (a) another person's gratification; (b) any activity of pornographic, obscene or indecent nature; (c) any other kind of exploitation by any person. In addition, the Criminal Code Act 1838 states in its subsection 249(4) that \"any person who has sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 16 or a mentally handicapped person, even with his consent, shall be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years\". However, the Act also provides in subsection 249(7) that \"it shall be a sufficient defence to any prosecution...that the person charged had reasonable cause to believe that the child was above the age of...16\". iv) Compulsory education until 16 years According to subsection 37(2) of the Education Act 1957, \"it shall be compulsory for every child to attend school up to the end of the academic year in the course of which he attains the age of 16\". Pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers often leave school early and this may feed into vicious cycles of poverty and unemployment. When they do so while being under 16 years old, this is considered as a law violation. It is important that parents or other responsible parties of these pregnant girls and teenage mothers ensure that they are supported to reintegrate school. The Nine Year Continuous Basic Education strategy of the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (2016) 43 was also implemented with the aims of increasing the number of children completing the first nine years of quality basic education and encouraging the completion of the secondary education cycle. The following is an extract of a letter received by the Ombudsperson for Children in 2017 from the Rector of Le Chou College, Rodrigues, who highlighted pertinent issues linked to teenage pregnancy and motherhood, especially the need to ensure that stakeholders do not lose sight 43 Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (2016). Inspiring every child. Mauritius: Open University of Mauritius.Annual Report 2017 - 2018242of the newborn's rights when planning and providing support and intervention to the young mother. Extract from a letter addressed to the Ombudsperson for Children from Mr R. Bhowany, Rector of Le Chou College, Rodrigues \"The Constitution of the Republic of Mauritius guarantees the right to education to all citizens irrespective of gender. It is a known fact that teenage pregnancies disrupt and disturb girls' education alarmingly. Generally speaking, whether or not to keep young girls during their pregnancy at school is a debatable issue. However, the rights of the baby are neglected. The government has no clear policies on how pregnancy in schools can be handled or on assisting girls who want to come back to school after delivery. The law provides 'protection' for the mother-to-be while at the same time remaining discriminatory towards the baby. What does happen in certain situations is that the mother rushes back to school only after one week's delivery. We are fully aware that working mothers are given fourteen weeks maternity leave. The \"student mother\" cannot afford to take such a long leave as they are conscious that missing classes will have dreadful repercussions on their SC and HSC examination preparation. They opt to come back to school at the expense of their and their babies' health and wellbeing. Furthermore, they know that the government will not pay their examination fees if they do not satisfy 90% attendance. Very often the baby is left to the care of the grandmother. We all know that a newborn's upbringing and breastfeeding is the responsibility of the mother, especially in its early days. It is high time that the government come up with a new policy concerning teenage pregnancies at schools to protect both mother-to-be and child in particular. The Head of School has to be provided with a clear protocol to deal with pregnancy when it occurs. The significant gaps in addressing issues of pregnancies in schools can be filled up in the following ways: 1. Teenage mothers should be given the same rights as adult mothers. 2. Expecting mothers should be advised to take one academic year off for regular prenatal and antenatal care to maintain good health. 3. They should be taught that what they eat and drink go into the umbilical cord and to the baby. The baby should have a good start in life. 4. Breastfeeding is another sure way to get the baby off the best start. 5. School re-admission should be mandatory.\"243 Ombudsperson for Childrenv) Teenage parenthood in the context of current local birth registration laws and procedures This section looks at the importance for any child to receive an identity at birth and the local current provisions for a child to be legally registered. I then discuss this information and their implications in the context of teenage parenthood in the Republic of Mauritius. The importance of receiving an identity: Whether born to a teenage mother or not, it is a fundamental right according to article 7(1) of the CRC (UN, 1989) that the child \"shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents\". This international provision had been reinforced by the Human Rights Committee's (1989) 44 General Comment No. 17 which stated that: (...) In the Committee's opinion, this provision should be interpreted as being closely linked to the provision concerning the right to special measures of protection and it is designed to promote recognition of the child's legal personality. Providing for the right to have a name is of special importance in the case of children born out of wedlock. The main purpose of the obligation to register children after birth is to reduce the danger of abduction, sale of or traffic in children, or of other types of treatment that are incompatible with the enjoyment of the rights provided for in the Covenant. Reports by States parties should indicate in detail the measures that ensure the immediate registration of children born in their territory. The fulfilment of this right plays a crucial role in the identity formation and personality development of the child, as well as, in the respect of the other rights of the child, such as his/ her rights to a family, to quality health and to adequate housing among others. Unregistered or inappropriately registered children are likely to be less visible, and sometimes less valued. These children often belong to groups who suffer from other forms of discrimination. Local legislation on birth registration: According to section 12 of the Civil Status Act 1982, a birth should be registered within 45 days post-birth at the Civil Status Office of the locality within the district in which the birth took place or in which the parents resided at the time of birth. Beyond this delay, the parent will need an authorisation from the Registrar of Civil Status to perform the registration. For children not registered within 3 months, the parent will have to apply for a declaration of birth before the Magistrate of the district where the birth took place. A declaration of birth consists of recording several vital information that need to be provided by the parent or informant as per section 13 of the Civil Status Act 1982, which include date, time and place of the birth; the sex and names of the child; the names and addresses of the informant; the names, nationality, profession and address of each parent; the national identity card number of each parent; and any other particulars as 44 Human Rights Committee (1989). CCPR General Comment No. 17: Article 24 (Rights of the child). Geneva: Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.Annual Report 2017 - 2018244may be required. The birth declaration will be made in one entry when the mother is married to the father of the child. Where one parent is not married to the other parent of the child, the entry can still be made if the parent appears before the Civil Status Officer and signs the entry, or appoints an agent to do so on his or her behalf. Procedures of the Civil Status Division (CSD) in the Republic of Mauritius: The CSD is the body that manages the procedures for the registration of births, deaths, marriages and for other matters relating to the civil status of persons of our country. Although this is not mentioned in the Civil Status Act 1982, in addition to the above-listed birth registration particulars, an attestation of birth issued by the hospital or clinic authorities is requested for formalities at the CSD. The CSD explained to the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) that this attestation of birth from public hospitals and private clinics differs in format. While the attestation from public hospitals tends to be more detailed, that of certain clinics can be very brief, mentioning only the name of the mother. The OCO also understood from the information given by Officers of the CSD that if parents are civilly married, the presence of only one parent suffice for the declaration of a child. If the parents are not civilly married, both parents are required to be present to declare their child. If the child is declared by only one parent of a non-married couple, the child will bear the surname of that parent. Interestingly, there is no time limit assigned to the father to acknowledge his child and, if he does so, this will be mentioned in the child's birth records. Given that the delay for birth registration is 45 days, it is worth highlighting that there are particular scenarios where the CSD proceeds with the declaration of a child: The attestation of birth mentions only the name of the mother. Only the father calls at the Civil Status Office stating that the mother is indisposed. In cases of births at home, the only required document is a written proof from a witness. In cases of child abandonment, the hospital/the State declares the child with only a first name. If the mother and father declare their ward separately at two different intervals, the child bears only the name of the mother. No witness is required at the time of birth registration. The above scenarios may create a leeway to child trafficking in a Mauritian context, especially when adoption procedures are not very well established in the country. There is also the risk of paternity fraud, whereby a mother can name a man to be the father of the child despite knowing that he is not the biological father. There have been cases lodged at the OCO in the past where individuals have declared children who are not theirs. Implications for teenage parents: The OCO was informed that Civil Status Officers are authorised to proceed with birth registration even if the parents are minors below 16 years old. However, the teenage parent(s) should be accompanied by their responsible 245 Ombudsperson for Childrenparties at the time of registration. If a potential case of sexual abuse or exploitation is suspected during registration, the CSD currently does not have any protocol in place to alert the concerned authorities. It is commonly known that different kinds of situations may arise when minors become parents, for instance: The girl may be coerced by her parents into lodging a case against her boyfriend. Parents may force the minors to get married against their will. Parents might even declare their ward as 'beyond control' and the latter might be committed to the Rehabilitation Youth Centre (RYC) by the Court. The teen mother and her baby could suddenly find themselves living in the RYC for an undefined period. There are minors who wish to give their child for adoption. Unfortunately, the absence of an appropriate legal and administrative structure complicates adoption matters in Mauritius. If the minors neglected their baby, the latter could be removed from their care by the Child Development Unit and placed with other family members, in foster care or at a residential care institution. In some countries of the world, a concept known as close in age exemptions are used with regards to the age of consent (Age Of Consent, 2018) 45. This exemption allows for a maximum age difference (e.g. four years) between two individuals, with at least one of them being below the age of consent, to engage in consensual sexual activity, and it prevents these individuals from facing extreme prosecution. Mauritius has no such exemption in its legislation. This can mean that two young people who are significantly close in age to each other, where at least one of them is below the age of consent (i.e. 16 years), and who willingly engage in sexual intercourse could be prosecuted for statutory rape under the Criminal Code Act 1838, although this is rare. In reference to the case of Ms. V and Mr W. provided in subsection 2.2.3 of this chapter, the parents of Ms. V were initially claiming that they would declare their daughter's child. According to local legislation and procedures, this would have been against the law in that Ms. V's parents would have made a false statement during birth registration by declaring themselves as the biological parents of this child. In the end, Ms. V lawfully declared her child alone, in the presence of her parents, and Mr. W acknowledged the baby one month later. Furthermore, Mr. V and Mr W. were both 16 years old, therefore at the legal age of consent in the Republic of Mauritius. Teenage pregnancy is not always the result of sexual abuse, it can be the result of sexual intercourse between two dating and legally consenting adolescents. 2.4.2.3) Local organisations working in the field of teenage pregnancy and motherhood Finding out that she is pregnant can be alarming for a teenager and her partner as well as both their families. They may feel scared and uncertain about how to handle the situation or which 45 Age Of Consent (2018). Close in Age Exemptions / Romeo and Juliet Laws.

Often, teenage pregnancies are viewed in a negative light within the society and, as a result, families may experience shame and disrepute. It is important to be aware that there are organisations in Mauritius that can educate and support teenagers and their families through this challenge, namely, Mouvement d' Aide \u00e0 la Maternit\u00e9 (MAM); Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association (MFPWA); and Action Familiale (AF). More information on each of these organisations are provided in the following Tables 1-3. Table 1.

Mission The prevention and alleviation of teenage pregnancy distress Main activities 1. Accompany teenage pregnant mothers: MAM's supportive action prepares young pregnant girls and women into motherhood with a positive mindset. In-house sessions animated by two midwives of the MAM's team are held at the Centre pour la Vie. Instead of being idle during their pregnancy, participants learn about self-care, health, hygiene, delivery, childcare and breastfeeding. MAM believes that babies raised in a positive atmosphere are given the best chances to live a happy life. 2. Empower young mothers with a diploma in child care: Owing to early pregnancy, some teenage girls have done little schooling and do not have adequate qualifications. Burdened with a child, they do not have much opportunity to learn skills and find jobs that will help them become financially autonomous. Proper training in childcare helps them become better mothers, and provides them with the possibility of finding a job. MAM has for the last seven years been holding weekly courses with qualified educators from La Cr\u00e8che de Bethlehem and they trained around 150 mothers to obtain their diploma in childcare. 3. Educate teenagers to a positive attitude towards sexuality: Sessions are held in villages with the teens, both boys and girls, on the theme 'Pran letan pou kontan'. The objectives of the workshops are to (i) speak about sexuality in a healthy and positive way; (ii) provide information on problems entailed by early pregnancies; (iii) foster respect of life and encouraging responsible sexual behaviour; (iv) to develop awareness of risks and diseases associated with irresponsible sexual behaviour. Parents are also invited to join the sessions to encourage open dialogue within the family. Another programme entitled 'Maman Soleil' promotes happy families by strengthening family ties, encouraging and facilitating dialogue among members of the family and better communication.247 Ombudsperson for ChildrenTable 2.

The MFPWA has a commitment to serving all segments of the population. The Officers of the Association supported by volunteers and a team of trained teachers implement sex education in schools and parenting education sessions to sensitise them on their roles and responsibilities and the challenges affecting the youth. The Association provides sexual education to about 15,000 in and out of school students yearly to bring behaviour change and make them responsible citizens as well as protect themselves from unwanted teenage pregnancies and unprotected sex, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, drug addiction and negative peer influence. The programmes target vulnerable groups mainly youth and adolescents. MFPWA undertakes information, education, communication and behaviour change programme. The Association has put in place condom distribution machines around the island but not properly serviced by partners who have taken over. They intend to introduce a modern youth friendly services to attend to the needs of the adolescents but due to logistical constraints they are not able to implement the project at a large scale.

Main activities Since 1965, Action Familiale has been delivering life skills-based family life/sexual education to end of primary and secondary school pupils in Mauritius and Rodrigues. This programme, delivered in a series of 4 to 6Annual Report 2017 - 2018248talks, goes far beyond providing information, but aims at the integral human development of young people. Action Familiale's educators are welcome in all the schools they visit whether state, private or confessional (Christian and non-Christian) schools. Since 2003, more than 65,000 educational pamphlets providing information and promoting behavior change have been distributed. In order to increase the number of young people reached, especially in this era of AIDS pandemic, Action Familiale has since 2008 been organising training workshops for school teachers willing to pass on family life education to the pupils of their school. 2.4.3 Summary of responses to the OCO's Press Communiqu\u00e9 The Press Communiqu\u00e9 elicited a very good response rate from numerous children, adults and civil society organisations who came in person, phoned the office or emailed their inputs to the Ombudsperson for Children's Office between Monday 25 June 2018 to Friday 06 July 2018. We had in total 110 different respondents over the 10 days, with on average 10 different inputs per day. There was a general emphasis on the body and mind of a teenage girl not being ready to take the full responsibility of another child. Some people also advocated for the need to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18 years and discouraging cohabitation between minors or a minor and an adult.

To marry younger, it was necessary to get a Court Order, not only parental permission. So, it had become an acquired right for women not to be married off before the age of majority. However, the minimum marriage age was again lowered to 16 years in Parliament on 10 April 1984. [Back in the 1980s], if a young woman [was] raped, her family [would] make her marry the rapist to \"save the honour of the family\".Annual Report 2017 - 20182522.5 Recommendations The following are recommendations of the Ombudsperson for Children with regards to teenage pregnancy and parenthood in the Republic of Mauritius: i) Comprehensive assessment is sine qua non to intervention: Several contextual factors should be considered when assessing any case of teenage pregnancy and motherhood. These may include teen dating, precocious sexuality, sexual abuse, adolescent's health and education, poverty, family adversity, promiscuity, other precarious living conditions, socio-cultural beliefs and attitudes, and prevalent legislative frameworks. This will enable concerned parties to provide more targeted and personalised interventions in response to the identified needs of the pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers. ii) Child marriage is not an option: It is unacceptable to coerce a child into marriage as a way to 'resolve' a teenage pregnancy situation. This mentality has to be challenged within the society through awareness campaigns, dissemination of research evidence and appropriate law reforms. Many adolescents are not prepared to live as a couple or to take up parental responsibilities. This may also result into the newborns facing difficult beginnings such as maltreatment or being removed from their parent's care. iii) Increase the minimum age of marriage to 18 years: As recommended by both regional and international committees (refer to subsection 2.4.2.2(ii)) and as advocated by many local citizens and organisations (refer to subsection 2.4.3), Mauritian legislation should be amended to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18 years, especially within the forthcoming Children's Bill. Our Republic should also sign and ratify the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development (ACHPR, 1990). iv) Compulsory education for all until the age of 16: Teenage pregnancy is often linked to high dropout rates from school. Teenage mothers attain low educational level which inevitably impacts on the socio-economic aspect of their family. It must be ensured that the right to education of pregnant girls and adolescent mothers under 16 years old are promoted and these young people should be supported to attend school as far as possible until the age of 16. Schools should be sensitised to become more compassionate and accepting environments for these young girls. By fear of 'bad influence' or 'disrepute', some schools might become a source of discrimination by not allowing these girls to come to school or sending them home due to their pregnancy. When resuming school following child birth, the concerned authorities and school communities should work together to enable the mothers to fulfil their right to education along with upholding the rights of their newborn to good nutrition (e.g. through breastfeeding), love and care among others. Psychological support would be necessary for both the mother and her child. A gap year from school, the use of outreach tutoring or distance education facilities for teenage mothers could also be considered within future educational reforms.253 Ombudsperson for Childrenv) Sexual education should be normalised: Sexuality at a young age should not be trivialised since it has a tremendous impact on the lives of the adolescents mainly in terms of their emotional, mental and physical health, education and their quality of life in general. With this line of thought, sexual education should be comprehensive and holistic, and carried out in an age-appropriate manner within schools and families. It is not enough for sexual education programs to include discussions on abstinence and contraception to help young people avoid unintended pregnancy or disease. Comprehensive sexual health education must go beyond these initiatives. It must provide young people with honest, age-appropriate information and healthy choice-making skills necessary to help them take responsibility for their health and overall well-being. vi) Parental controls on access to adult material on the media: Media has a massive influence on the sexuality of adolescents. Nowadays, through computers, tablets, smart phones and internet television sets, adolescents have easier, and sometimes unrestricted, internet access to explicit sexual content, sexual violence and even pornographic material. Exposure to these inappropriate visual contents largely affects the teenagers' perception of and attitudes towards sexuality. Parents should be educated on exercising their authority and placing appropriate controls on the use of these electronic devices and the internet. Open dialogues on sexuality between parents and their young person remain an important way of preventing secretive online behaviour and early sexual activity. vii) Reinforcing the family structure: Some research suggest that teenage pregnancy and parenthood might have an intergenerational component, whereby some pregnant teenagers and adolescent mothers may originate from families where a lack of family planning, early parenthood, single parenting and/or absence of a father figure may have been present across generations. This can indicate that well-functioning family environments can play a key role in preventing these early adverse circumstances in the life of young teenagers. The relevant State and non-State actors should ensure that educational and skills-based strategies to reinforce the family structure are continuously developed and improved. viii) Child protection: If, for any reasons, it is assessed by authorities that the teenage mother will not be able to take adequate care of her child or keep the latter safe, authorities have to first prioritise a kinship care approach, whereby the responsibility of the child might be transferred to eligible close family members until circumstances change for the biological mother. Formal foster care might be the second point of call and residential care should remain a last resort. ix) A better system for adoption: Some teenage mothers might wish to give their babies away for adoption. In addition, teenage mothers' children who are in alternative care can be declared as adoptable if this is in their best interests. It is therefore necessary to Annual Report 2017 - 2018254ensure that local adoption procedures are less complicated and more comprehensive to avoid any delays in providing a family to these children. x) A whistleblowing procedure for the Civil Status Division: The Civil Status Division must be provided with an established protocol on alerting authorities regarding any suspected cases of sexual abuse during birth registrations from adolescent girls. For instance, an adolescent girl who appears dishevelled and is unaccompanied by her parents for a birth registration might be grounds for suspicion. Another example of potential concern could be a middle-aged adult man registering as the father of the baby of a 13-year old adolescent mother. xi) Law reform on the 'attestation of birth' document: The Civil Status Act 1982 should be amended to provide that all hospitals and private clinics issue a standardised 'attestation of birth' with all the required information and that parents should produce this document at the time of registration of birth at a Civil Status Office. xii) Networking among relevant stakeholders: All relevant State and non-State actors such as MAM, MFPWA and AF should continue working together to conjoin their experience and expertise in the field of teenage pregnancy and motherhood. These organisations should be empowered with more financial support and human resources to enable the implementation of larger-scale sensitisation, education and skills-based programmes for adolescents and young mothers.255 Ombudsperson for Children CHILD SEXUAL ABUSECHAPTER 3:Annual Report 2017 - 2018256 Consultative meetings on child sexual abuse entitled \"A safer childhood: A milestone for Mauritian independence\"257 Ombudsperson for Children3.1 Introduction In the context of the Republic of Mauritius's 50th anniversary of independence this year, I invited various high-level representatives from public, parastatal and private sectors and the civil society to renew their commitment in helping the country become a haven free from Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). Three consultative meetings were held at the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) with the main aim of improving networking relationships among relevant stakeholders in the fight against CSA. The sections in the present chapter constitute a summary of the key highlights of this initiative. There is no doubt that children are the foundation and future of any society. Adults owe them their innocence and children deserve their trust. Authorities in Mauritius estimate that a minimum of one child per day becomes victim to CSA and it is likely that cases are under- reported. Combatting CSA should be on the agenda of all responsible societies worldwide and this is reinforced by article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; United Nations [UN], 1989) 46 , which states that: State Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, States Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent: (a) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity;(b) The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices; (c) The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials. In relation to the above article, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (2011) 47 stated in paragraph 65 of its Concluding Observations on the Republic of Mauritius that: In light of Article 34 and other related articles of the Convention, the Committee recommends that the State Party further strengthen the implementation of policies and programmes for the prevention, recovery and reintegration of child victims in accordance with the Declaration and Agenda for Action and the Global Commitment adopted at the 1996 and 2001 World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. I noted that there are certain shortcomings at an organisational level in the following areas related to the protection of CSA victims: 1. an insufficient collaboration and consultation among important stakeholders working on the prevention of CSA and the rehabilitation of victims; 2. a lack of technical knowledge among stakeholders on the impact of sexual abuse on children, their families and the society; and 46 United Nations (1989).

Geneva: United Nations.Annual Report 2017 - 20182583. the fact that existing rehabilitation programmes are not necessarily based on robust local and international evidence. As a country that has ratified the UNCRC in 1990, we have to uphold our commitment to the provisions of this international law within our policies, legislation and practices in all areas concerning children, including CSA. Building a safer childhood is all stakeholders' responsibility, including children themselves, and we believe that it is important to reflect this in the conceptualisation of the upcoming Children's Bill. 3.2 Overview of the consultation process I chaired consultations with different stakeholders both in Mauritius and Rodrigues on the following dates: Mauritius: February 14, 21 and 28. Rodrigues: April 3 and 4. The main objectives were to: 1. improve partnership and networking among all the relevant stakeholders in the area of CSA; 2. learn from one another's experience and improve interventions with victims or potential victims of CSA; and 3. propose recommendations collaboratively formulated by participants to the relevant authorities. From impressions and feedback gathered, the meetings allowed the participants to come together and discuss pressing issues concerning CSA. The Key Performance Indicators were three-pronged: 1. Successful networking amongst stakeholders. 2. Attendance to at least one of the scheduled meetings. 3. Constructive and active participation through \"prises de parole\", presentations, etc. We noted: 1. An exchange of contact details and, in the realisation of common interests, the reinforcement of relationships amongst stakeholders; 2. A healthy and regular attendance of nearly 70 stakeholders across Mauritius and Rodrigues, as shown in Appendix C; 3. Five presentations (one video, three PowerPoint and one oral) by representatives from the OCO, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP), Pedostop, the Child 259 Ombudsperson for ChildrenDevelopment Unit (CDU) and the Law Reform Commission (LRC) respectively, along with numerous interventions by almost all participants in the meetings. The main areas of discussion are summarised in section 3.3 of the present chapter. During the final consultative meetings, each participant was asked to provide specific recommendations \"to improve the lives of children who are sexually abused or at risk of being sexually abused\". The exercise consisted of short essay-type questions as follows: Question 1: What needs to be done to promote collaboration among stakeholders working on the prevention of Child Sexual Abuse and rehabilitation of victims? Question 2: How to improve the legal framework to better protect the rights of victims of sexual abuse? Question 3: How to decrease the occurrence of Child Sexual Abuse in the Republic of Mauritius? Question 4: How to rehabilitate victims of Child Sexual Abuse effectively? An open discussion then followed regarding the above questions. This process allowed the OCO to gather potential solutions on CSA prevention and rehabilitation of victims, which are thematised and presented in section 3.4 of the current chapter. It is important to add that participants were also invited to join a sub-committee at the OCO for the purpose of contributing to the validation of the present chapter before publication. In this context, six stakeholders along with four OCO's investigators, as enlisted in Appendix D, attended two further meetings which I chaired on 16 April 2018 and 07 June 2018 respectively. 3.3 Summary of main issues discussed across meetings 3.3.1 Understanding CSA All stakeholders agreed to the definition of CSA as formulated by the World Health Organisation (WHO; 1999, pp.15-16) 48 : Child sexual abuse is the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person. This may include but is not limited to: \u2014 the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity; \u2014 the exploitative use of a child in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices; \u2014 the exploitative use of children in pornographic performance and materials. 48 World Health Organisation (1999). Report on the Consultation on Child Abuse Prevention. Geneva: Author.Annual Report 2017 - 2018260CSA may include touching or non-touching activity. It does not only involve 'sexual harm', but it can also consist of other forms of harm such as physical, emotional or moral injury, neglect, or impairment of health or development. CSA can be split into two categories, namely 'horizontal abuse' among people of similar statuses such as siblings and peers, and 'vertical abuse' when the victim has a subordinate relationship to the perpetrator. It is well known that CSA is most commonly inflicted by someone in the family such as a parent or sibling, and/or someone who is trusted by the child, his/her family and relatives. Perpetrators can use several grooming tactics to silence their victims (e.g. being kind to victims and their families, providing special gifts and privileges to the victims, bullying, etc). In the Republic of Mauritius, according to section 13 of the Child Protection Act 1994, \"any person who ill-treats a child or otherwise exposes a child to harm shall commit an offence\". Regarding sexual offences, section 14 of the same Act provides that: (1) Any person who causes, incites or allows any child - (a) to be sexually abused by him or by another person; (b) to have access to a brothel; (c) to engage in prostitution, shall commit an offence. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a child shall be deemed to be sexually abused where he has taken part whether as a willing or unwilling participant or observer in any act which is sexual in nature for the purposes of - (a) another person's gratification; (b) any activity of pornographic, obscene or indecent nature; (c) any other kind of exploitation by any person. A child often may not be able to disclose whether he/she has been sexually abused by another child or adult, largely owing to the coercive and secretive nature of the abuse, an intense fear of shame and disbelief, their lack of developmental maturity to understand this traumatic situation, and at times love for the abuser. There are also a number of high-risk environments where children may be easily targeted for grooming, and sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse, for instance, in deprived and secluded regions, in violence-prone and promiscuous areas, in the tourist industry, and on social media and chat rooms on the internet. CSA is known to have damaging short-term and long-term outcomes on the physical, emotional, psychological and social functioning of a child, for example, low self-esteem, feeling worthless, mental health problems, drug and alcohol issues, teenage pregnancy, homelessness and at times continuity of abuse towards others. It is important that communities and professionals involved with children and their families are trained to identify the signs of CSA and alert the authorities as early as possible.261 Ombudsperson for ChildrenFigure 1 below provides some (but is not limited to) examples of potential signs that can indicate that a child might be a victim of CSA. These signs often present in different combinations and not in an isolated manner. Figure 1. Examples of possible signs indicative of CSA 3.3.2 Child protection services in the Republic of Mauritius Many discussions during the consultative meetings revolved around the existing local child protective systems that deal with cases of CSA. Currently, these are handled by the CDU, the police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) through two referral pathways differentiated by the type of perpetrator (family or non-family member). Both pathways involve similar processes such as filing the child's statement, doing a medical examination, carrying out individual and/or joint interviews as appropriate, sharing of information between the police and the CDU, referring cases to the ODPP for prosecution, and producing the appropriate psychosocial reports and rehabilitation plans. Referrals are obtained from several sources including statutory authorities, non-state actors, community-based organisations, schools and the public. During the consultative meetings at the OCO, the CDU representative reported receiving on average 6,000 new child abuse cases annually with approximately 15,000 open cases running throughout the year. They operate a hotline number (113) through which they receive anonymous referrals on alleged abuse cases against children. Table 4 below shows the overall number of child abuse cases that had been reported yearly at the CDU from January 2015 to April 2018 as well as the number and proportion of these cases that have been registered as CSA. Annual Report 2017 - 2018262Table 4. Number of child abuse and CSA cases reported at the CDU Year Overall number of child abuse cases reportedNumber and proportion of reported CSA cases only 2015 6035 (7.1%) 2018 (Jan-April) 1789 102 (5.7%) The Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare currently has in place 'Community Child Watch Committees' operating in different regions of Mauritius which provide for surveillance of children exposed to any form of violence at local levels. There is also a Drop-In Centre for the rehabilitation of child victims of commercial sexual exploitation, which is managed by the Mauritius Family Planning and Welfare Association. Nevertheless, several structural problems regarding the protection of victims of CSA in our Republic were raised by participants in the meetings, as outlined below: 1. Understaffing issues in CDU outstations which result in high caseloads for officers and affect the quality of service delivery - CSA victims do not receive adequate individualised attention and follow-up; 2. Crowding in government-run places of safety when children are removed from their families through an Emergency Protection Order - this is not an appropriate circumstance for the rehabilitation of CSA victims; 3. Limited capacity in NGO-run residential care institutions for the long-term placement of children who have been victims of CSA; 4. Lack of background information on victims of CSA which may lead to inappropriate or inadequate interventions by caregivers or other professionals working with them; 5. Unavailability of child-friendly spaces for taking statements of CSA victims in police stations; 6. Lack of training among police officers on how to engage CSA victims in a safe conversation to obtain their statements about the abuse; 7. Lack of highly specialised social workers and mental health professionals who can work with CSA victims; 8. No current provision in child legislation that mandates professionals such as psychologists, social workers or other qualified child welfare specialists to report cases of sexual abuse - as of now, only medical, para-medical and school staff have a duty to report (section 11 of the Child Protection Act 1994); 9. Inadequate protection of the identity of CSA victims from the media in some cases; and 10. Lack of screening for a history of CSA among children and young people in conflict with the law, among others.263 Ombudsperson for Children3.3.3 The local justice system in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse During the consultation, the representative of the ODPP highlighted some statistics which indicated that, similar to global trends, more child sexual abuse (CSA) offences are committed against girls than boys in Mauritius 49. For instance, in 2016, 282 girls were reported to be victim to at least one form of sexual abuse upon minor (e.g. rape, sexual intercourse, attempt upon chastity, sexual harassment, etc) compared to 16 boys in the same period. Every year, the CDU refers about 300-400 CSA cases to the ODPP for further investigation. It is often observed that many cases remain unresolved for long periods of time. This may have a detrimental impact on the mental health, relationships, social life and access to educational and career opportunities of the victims. At the ODPP , while some of these cases go through Court processes, a good proportion of them are dropped at some point. One of the main reasons cases are sometimes dropped is because 'the child is not speaking'. Different possible explanations were advanced by participants to make sense of this situation, which included among others: 1. the court waiting areas and atmosphere not being child-friendly; 2. a lack of child victim or witness support; 3. cross-examinations being at times intimidating; 4. the child's privacy not sufficiently protected; 5. delays in medically examining the child to collect evidence; 6. absence of specialist/forensic interviewers trained in child psychological and legal matters; 7. inadequate fast-track procedures for CSA cases; 8. too much reliance on children's verbal communication on abuse events and not sufficient consideration to non-verbal communication (e.g. drawings, body posture, eye contact, etc.); 9. possible re-traumatisation of the child by expecting him/her to constantly retell the abuse events with different professionals at different times, which may result in the child withdrawing or refusing to speak; and 10. a lack of alternatives to hearing the child's statement in Court such as through video-recording. Lengthy court proceedings and the above-listed shortcomings can lead to secondary victimisation of children, their families and all those assisting the victim. All stakeholders have the duty to increase efforts, improve archaic systems and innovate their practices in the fight against CSA. Section 3.4 below provides numerous recommendations that emerged from the consultations with our group of participants who work in various fields of expertise. 49 Source: Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (2018). Child Sexual Abuse seen from a psycho-socio-legal perspective. Mauritius: ODPP . (Powerpoint Presentation by Mrs Johan Moutou-Leckning, Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions on 21 February 2018 at the Ombudsperson for Children's Office).Annual Report 2017 - 20182643.4 Summary of gathered recommendations The answers to the short essay-type questions cited in section 3.2 of this chapter have been synthesised under various themes as follows: 3.4.1 Promoting collaboration among stakeholders in the prevention of child sexual abuse and the rehabilitation of victims Several recommendations fell under the banner of creating and improving facilities for stakeholders to work better together. For instance, it was mentioned that: 1. All first responders combatting CSA should be operating under the same roof. A single centre could be created that acts as a \"one-stop shop\" for victims of CSA. In other words, in the event of abuse, victims would head to that centre where they would: i. file a declaration/statement in front of a special police officer and a CDU officer; ii. undergo a medical examination (check-up and forensic); iii. be interviewed by a police officer and a CDU officer in the presence of a social worker and a psychologist; and iv. be provided with food and shelter as appropriate. 2. This \"one-stop shop\" would also consist of a multi-disciplinary team of qualified professionals, such as clinical psychologists, social workers, lawyers and specialised police officers, who would provide immediate protection as well as medical, psychological and social assistance as long as necessary to the child victim and his/her family. This team would also intervene in cases where children might be at risk of being sexually abused. 3. Child-friendly spaces should be made available in any building that can welcome children in the mishap of abuse or in any other adverse event (e.g. non-governmental organisations, police stations, courthouses, community welfare centres, municipal/ district councils, health centres/hospitals, etc). The personnel can then refer the victim and his/her family to the \"one-stop shop\". 4. Legal assistance should invariably be provided to all victims of CSA and their responsible parties from the very beginning. 5. Training facilities and sessions should be conducted with stakeholders and their representatives on collaboration, abuse-detection and abuse-prevention, while underlining the contact information of relevant authorities. These sessions could also help every stakeholder in understanding the difficulties encountered by one another and discussing possible ways of conjoining efforts to overcome these obstacles. 6. A register with a list of professionals dealing with child sexual abuse cases (e.g. therapist, social workers, clinical psychologists, educators and other stakeholders) should be created to enable sharing of practices and expertise.265 Ombudsperson for Children7. At least one officer/individual from every concerned organisation - public, private or civil society - should be designated to be part of a committee specially dedicated to CSA under the aegis of the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare, which would meet regularly to share information and actively combat CSA. 8. Technology and communication facilities should be employed to reinforce networking among relevant stakeholders, for instance, through phone calls, emailing, audio/video conferences, social media, website or other e-platforms. 9. Multi-stakeholder case conferences, comprising of legal advisors, clinical psychologists, social workers, medical professionals, school managers or teachers, and relevant State representatives, should be organised regularly for complicated CSA cases. These conferences should aim at ensuring proper and timely interventions and harmonising an effective course of actions. 10. The standardised protocol for CSA cases used by the State should be continually reviewed to improve working relationships among the different stakeholders and to adapt with the evolving realities in Mauritius and Rodrigues. Other themes that were salient in the recommendations were awareness at all levels of society and research: 1. Multiple awareness campaigns about CSA should be geared towards children, parents, the civil society, government officers and law enforcers. 2. State and non-State actors should educate the population on preventive measures regarding CSA. 3. Information should be shared ethically and confidentially among all relevant stakeholders. 4. Regular meetings and workshops about CSA could enable stakeholders to continually share their expertise and mutually improve their knowledge and skills. 5. Victims of CSA should be followed up over time with their informed consent so as to check in on their wellbeing and to assess for any difficulties that might be affecting their overall functioning and health. They also should have the choice of withdrawing their consent at any point in time. 3.4.2 Improving the legal framework to better protect the rights of victims of sexual abuse Numerous recommendations were received about the nature of legal proceedings with regards to children, namely: 1. Video recordings of children's declaration/statement should be admissible in Court. 2. Within a child-friendly space at the police station or at the specialised \"one-stop shop\" for CSA victims and families (as recommended in subsection 3.4.1), the police officer and Annual Report 2017 - 2018266a qualified professional such as a Clinical/Forensic Psychologist could video-record the child's statement. The concerned stakeholders could then view and evaluate the video and submit a report for court procedures. 3. Following the report of the abuse, the child and the family should be entitled to: i. psychological support; ii. free medical and legal assistance; and iii. the services of a lawyer pro bono . 4. Cases of CSA in the court of law should fit within a defined time-frame that should not exceed, for example, 2-3 years. This could prevent the occurrence of 'withdrawals' of cases from the victim and family. 5. Medical/forensic examinations of the child should be undertaken as soon as an alleged case of CSA is reported. 6. A pre-defined referral, assessment and intervention protocol in cases of CSA should be followed by all concerned institutions. 7. The types of sexual offences within our legislation should be better defined. 8. Ratified conventions such as the UNCRC should be domesticated in the relevant local laws of Mauritius. 9. Legal officials should undergo a training programme on CSA to better serve victims and prosecute perpetrators. 10. The police should be adequately trained on forensic interviewing techniques with children. Inappropriate and humiliating questions by police interviewers should be condemned. 11. The law, namely the Child Protection Act 1994 and the Allied Health Professionals Council Act 2017, should be amended so that professionals trained in child mental health and social welfare, including clinical psychologists and social workers, must report on cases of abuse without any fear of being prosecuted for breach of confidentiality. Genuine reporters and witnesses should also be protected by the law. 12. Disclosure of information to the media on cases of CSA should be restricted. No mudslinging of persons involved and no sensationalism of information should be allowed. 13. A Children's Court with a panel of lawyers, clinical psychologists, sociologists, medical officers and family support officers among others dedicated to cases involving children should be established. This court should be able to: i. fast-track delicate cases involving CSA to establish evidence such as the DNA report from the Forensic Science Laboratory in a timely manner; ii. provide emotional support and psychologically prepare child victims and witnesses for court processes; iii. provide child-friendly activities in the court premises as well as assistance to children with disabilities;267 Ombudsperson for Childreniv. ensure that there is no direct contact between child victim/witness and the alleged perpetrator at any point in the judicial process; and v. provide safeguards to protect the privacy and identity of child victims and witnesses. The representative of the Law Reform Commission (LRC), an independent statutory body mandated to reform and to develop laws in Mauritius, also brought forward in his presentation at the OCO several recommendations regarding CSA based on a review paper published in 2016 50. Recommendations relevant to sexual offences from this paper can be found in Appendix B. 3.4.3 Decreasing the occurrence of child sexual abuse in the Republic of Mauritius There were many recommendations regarding perpetrators: 1. Perpetrators who have been convicted of CSA and who are at-risk of re-offending with minors should figure in a barred list of people who cannot work with children and young people. Similar to the UK, an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check could be requested by employers who recruit individuals to work with children and young people. 2. Perpetrators could be monitored and supervised to prevent relapse after their conviction. 3. Intensified \"sting operations\" should be carried out in a stealthily and unsuspecting manner to effectively arrest perpetrators and procurers, or \"pimps\", involved in child sex tourism. 4. The alleged abuser should be removed from the immediate environment of the child. If this person is provided with bail, this should be to the condition that he/she has no contact with the child. Several recommendations recognised the need for the rehabilitation of perpetrators: 1. Rehabilitation programmes for perpetrators need to be built in consultation with clinical psychologists, medical officers, social workers, lawyers and specialised educators. 2. Rehabilitation programmes should stretch across several years to ensure the holistic follow-up of perpetrators - continuous rehabilitative support and constant evaluation of treatment for better results. 3. Psychological rehabilitation should become a legal requirement for released sexual offenders to prevent relapse and repeated offences Most importantly, the participants emphasised on Governmental, societal and policy actions that might help deter CSA: 1. The family structure should be consolidated and necessary tools should be provided to parents, immediate relatives and peers to sensitise children about abuse. Much can be 50 Law Reform Commission (2016). Review Paper: Criminal Protection of Children's Rights. Mauritius: Author.

Similar to the UK, a \"Children Safeguarding Network\" co-run by health, social and judiciary services should be created to inform, monitor, report and research on cases of CSA in the Republic of Mauritius. 3. Sexual education in schools should be implemented with professionals (psychologists, trained social workers, etc.) or with specially trained teachers - clear guidance will help children to become aware of looming dangers and empower them in such situations. A specialised and adapted curriculum should be implemented in accordance with children's age and level of comprehension. 4. Schools should get better at becoming a place where students feel more listened to, safer and increasingly supported. This could be done, for instance, through: i. establishing drop-in counselling and psychological services within schools; ii. training of teaching and non-teaching school staff on how to identify signs of CSA and how to alert authorities; iii. additional training for security guards and support staff on detecting and alerting on the presence of potential perpetrators within the school community and vicinity; iv. installing cameras in unsupervised areas to improve safety within the school premises; v. investigating irregular situations such as excessive lateness or absenteeism among particular students; and vi. reinforcing respect for school ethics and supervising staff to discourage potential inappropriate staff behaviours towards students. 5. Healthy leisure activities and facilities should be set up for children and young people across the Republic of Mauritius after school hours and during the week-ends, and to decrease the incidence of situations that may jeopardise their safety. 6. \"Parental Education Programmes\" and \"National Prevention Programmes\" should be developed to sensitise citizens about CSA and their role in its prevention. These programmes could include modules on: i. educating children on how to stay safe (good touch/bad touch) and recognising grooming tactics; ii. how all stakeholders, including children, can identify signs of CSA; iii. how to listen to children's report of abuse and how to become a whistle-blower and alert concerned authorities; iv. educating parents on how to inculcate values and positive discipline to their children and inform them of the dangers of exposing children to sexual acts/sexualised behaviours; and v. developing a societal culture free from sexual abuse.269 Ombudsperson for Children7. Better awareness of CSA and whistle-blowing procedures (e.g. anonymous calls to child protective services or police reports) among citizens could help with reporting cases that otherwise go unnoticed. 8. The media should be encouraged to broadcast child-friendly and age-appropriate videos or cartoons about CSA to enable children to understand this issue. 9. Policies and programmes for the prevention of CSA and the rehabilitation of victims or potential victims should be based on local and international evidence. It is highly indicated that local research studies should be carried out to understand the underlying factors (psychological, health, educational, environmental, economic and sociocultural) associated with CSA within the Republic of Mauritius. 3.4.4 Effectively rehabilitating victims of child sexual abuse Several proposals on the rehabilitation of victims of CSA were made mainly in relation to psychological support, education, logistics and social responsibility. Agglomerated under the psychological element of rehabilitation were the following: 1. Victims should undergo individual therapy with clinical psychologists and be supported to understand and overcome their trauma. Family therapy should also be provided to enable family members to support their child in a non-blaming way. It is important that CSA victims do feel neither like a burden to their family nor undeserving of their love and care. 2. Victims could also be referred to child-friendly support groups facilitated by a psychologist or therapist that could potentially help them feel understood by other people with similar experiences. 3. The holistic therapy and rehabilitation of victims should be handled by a multidisciplinary therapeutic team. One psychologist would not be enough. 4. The proposed \"one-stop shop\" centre (refer to subsection 3.4.1) should provide a host of therapies and rehabilitation programmes, personalised to the needs of the victim and his/her family. Home visitation programmes should also be made available for those who cannot travel to the centre. Under the banner of education and social responsibility, stakeholders suggested that: 1. Teachers, educators and school counsellors should be provided with tools to help victims manage their distress, and attention and memory difficulties which often stem from cases of CSA. 2. Children who have witnessed sexual abuse being committed on another child or an adult should also be provided with regular therapy to help them overcome their trauma.Annual Report 2017 - 20182703. If placed in alternative care, children should benefit from small \"family units\" to emulate a healthy environment that fosters and ensures their proper development. 4. Child victims of CSA should be entrusted to carers who have been trained in handling symptoms and consequences of trauma. 5. In places of safety or residential care institutions, CSA victims should not co-habit with children victim of other forms of abuse as their rehabilitation would not be the same. 6. CSA victims living in residential care institutions should not be deprived of their fundamental rights to education, religion, good nutrition, freedom of expression and so on. 7. Whenever this is in their best interests, children in alternative care should be reunited with their families. 8. Local rehabilitation programmes for CSA victims should be informed by local and international research on best practices. Finally, the logistical and legal aspect of rehabilitation was underlined and reiterated in recommendations: 1. Child-friendly spaces should be made available in buildings, especially those that welcome victims of CSA. 2. It would be important for the victim that the perpetrator is prosecuted by law - this might have a positive therapeutic impact on the victim. 3. Specialised and accredited NGOs working for the rehabilitation of victims should be allocated more funds, support and assistance to improve their practices. 4. There should be trained staff/carers working in residential care institutions to allow for proper individualised care and rehabilitation of child victims. 3.5 Conclusion I would like to thank all stakeholders who participated and contributed immensely in these consultative and sub-committee meetings. Their input created an enriching and empowering synergy that made it possible to critically reflect on the intricate issue of CSA. Several themes including the different aspects of CSA, the role of child protective services and the justice system in the fight against CSA, and the need to revise outdated child legislations were discussed. I believe that the wealth of recommendations which emerged from this consultation should be considered when formulating national policies and laws related to the prevention of CSA and the rehabilitation of victims. This initiative provided a platform for stakeholders to improve their networking relationships and learn from one another's experiences with the vision of building a safer childhood in our Republic. 271 Ombudsperson for Children CHILDREN WITH SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUESCHAPTER 4:Annual Report 2017 - 2018272 Setting up of a therapeutic residential mental healthcare facility for children and young people with severe mental health difficulties in Mauritius273 Ombudsperson for Children4.1 An import ant gap in children's mental healthcare During an official meeting on 26 December 2017 between the Minister of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare51, Mrs Roubina Jadoo-Jaunbocus, and I, we discussed important matters regarding the promotion and protection of the rights of children in Mauritius. We noted with concern that so far there existed no residential mental healthcare facility in Mauritius which could cater for the intensive therapy needs of children and young people with severe mental health conditions such as high levels of anxiety and panic attacks, phobias, depression, personality disorders, bipolar disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders and psychotic problems among others. The World Health Organisation's (2014) 52 defines mental health as \"a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.\" With regards to children's right to quality health including mental health, article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations, 1989) stipulates that: States Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. States Parties shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services. 4.2 Children and young people with severe mental health difficulties In Mauritius, children and young people with severe mental health problems are usually sent to general hospitals or to the Brown Sequard Hospital (BSH) for mainly outpatient and medical treatment. Those presenting high risk to themselves and/or others are often admitted to psychiatric beds and discharged back to the community after a stay in hospital. According to the data collected by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse (DMHSA; 2011) 53 of the World Health Organisation regarding Mauritius's profile on mental health, the country had a capacity of 28 beds reserved for children and young people in mental hospitals. However, there was no indication in the report on the profile of the children who would use these beds or their lengths of stay upon admission. The DMHSA (2011) also highlighted the lack of mental health policies, legislation and research in Mauritius which limits understanding on the gaps and areas of improvement in this sector. There are often no arrangements made for continuity of care where families can be empowered to support the treatment and recovery of their children at home. These families are themselves a highly vulnerable group and they may be subject to, for example, their own mental health 51 The Minister of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare will be referred to as the 'Minister' for the rest of the current chapter. 52 World Health Organisation (2014). Mental health: A state of well-being. Retrieved 03 January 2018 from www.who.int/features/ factfiles/mental_health/en/ 53 Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, World Health Organization (2011). Mental Health Atlas 2011. Geneva: WHO.Annual Report 2017 - 2018274problems, social and financial difficulties, domestic and community violence or even legal issues such as incarceration. Some of these children may also display behaviours which are in conflict with the law. In Mauritius, these children are usually sent to rehabilitation youth centres where psychological difficulties may go unassessed and untreated. In addition, there may be a considerable number of children and families who do not access necessary help due to a lack of awareness on mental health issues. Within a cultural context of taboo around mental health in Mauritius, these children may easily fall through the gaps and remain undiagnosed to the detriment of their own and families' growth and potential for the future. Within hospitalised and institutionalised environments, there might be little scope for intensive therapeutic input by trained mental health professionals. The lack of these resources may result in a 'revolving door' situation, whereby families with children and young people suffering from severe mental health and associated risk issues may heavily rely on recurrent hospital admissions to manage crises. Without intensive therapy in an environment that facilitates recovery, it might be very difficult to improve long-term psycho-social outcomes within this target group. 4.3 Proposal for a residential mental healthcare facility for these children In reference to the above context, the Minister believed that the country needed a service complementary to mainstream general and psychiatric hospitals and rehabilitation services, to cater for the specialised mental health needs of children and young people. We discussed that the setting up of a therapeutic residential mental healthcare facility for the assessment, treatment and recovery of these children's difficulties, and the empowerment of their parents or carers, are highly indicated in Mauritius. According to paragraph 6 of the Ombudsperson for Children's Act 2003, I have the duty to a) make proposals to the Minister on legislation, policies and practices regarding services to, or the rights of, children; b) advise the Minister on public and private residential placement facilities and shelters established for the benefit of children. In the following subsections, I discuss the potential components and operational procedures of such a facility including recommendations which could contribute to the setting up of such a project. 4.3.1 The beneficiaries The children and young people who would be referred to the therapeutic residential mental healthcare facility would be aged between 10 and 18 years old. They might present a range of 275 Ombudsperson for Childrenneurotic disorders (e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorders, acute or chronic anxiety, depression, various phobias, eating disorders, personality disorders or anger problems) and psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia or delusional disorders). The severity level of their mental health difficulties would be assessed as high, which would refer mainly to significant levels of difficulty for their families or carers to manage them within their homes and communities. They might also be presenting with risks to themselves, their families and/or communities such as self-harm and violence. The children would continue to benefit from other services, for instance, hospital appointments or visits from social workers, alongside their therapy package within the residential mental healthcare facility. 4.3.2 The infrastructure On 26 December 2017, the Minister and staff members of the Ombudsperson for Children's Office including me visited a building. We identified that the building and its premises had a lot of potential for refurbishment and development into a child-friendly therapeutic residential environment. Its strategic location near the sea would inevitably enhance the therapeutic experience of its beneficiaries. The current building is already equipped with dormitories. These could be adapted in a way that would be conducive and stimulating to the treatment and recovery of the beneficiaries. I recommended that each dormitory must not exceed a capacity of 5-8 children. Children with complex and severe mental health issues necessitate an environment where they can feel safe and stable, have individualised attention and develop therapeutic alliances with staff members. This can be possible within small therapeutic units. I also recommended that the dormitories must not be mixed-sex but separate residential units for boys and girls. Since mental health conditions are complex in nature, the placement of children within these units should be made with care, based on thorough psychiatric and psychological assessments as well as research evidence. Furthermore, the yard could be converted into a therapeutic garden including water fountains, trees, flowers and spacious green areas for multiple activities. Green spaces play a role in decreasing cognitive fatigue, promoting emotional recovery and reducing the impact of stressors on concentration, anxiety or mood (Branas et al., 2011) 54. The therapeutic context can undoubtedly enhance the physical, mental and emotional health of the children. I advised the Minister to hire the services of a Quantity Surveyor, an Architect, a Civil Engineer and an Interior Designer for the purpose of planning the setup of this residential mental healthcare facility. For a more cost-effective approach, I also recommended that a team of 54 Branas, C.C., Cheney, R.A., MacDonald, J.M., Tam, V.W., Jackson, T.D.& Ten Have, T.R. (2011). A Difference-in-Differences Analysis of Health, Safety, and Greening Vacant Urban Space. American Journal of Epidemiology, 174 (11), 1296-1306.Annual Report 2017 - 2018276professionals from the Ministry of Public Infrastructure and Land Transport could be solicited to conduct this piece of work. 4.3.3 Resources and service pathway Human resources: I suggest that this residential facility must consist of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) of qualified and trained mental health professionals as well as non-mental health professionals (MHP). The MDT should include Psychiatrists, Clinical Psychologists, Mental Health Nurses, Therapists, Social Workers, Qualified Animators, Carers, Administrators, Drivers, Gardeners, Cleaners and Cooks. The centre can also be open to volunteers who are assessed to be safe to work with vulnerable children in order to support the centre's activities and groups. Referral: Children and young people who meet the eligibility criteria of the residential facility can be either referred by their parent(s), guardian(s) or carer(s), their schools, community health centres, general hospitals, BSH, Social Workers, local authority, voluntary sector organisations or private bodies. Assessment: Upon referral, the MDT will conduct an in-depth assessment of the child with the family, the referrer and all relevant agencies to obtain a comprehensive picture of the difficulties, needs and strengths of the child and his/her family. If indicated, designated professionals could carry out preliminary home and school visits and observations to gather more information on the child's difficulties and situation. If the child is in crisis, he/she might be temporarily admitted to local hospitals or BSH until he/she is stable enough to complete the assessment. Treatment and recovery: Based on the outcome of the assessment and the formulation of the presenting difficulties, a personalised residential treatment package will be designed by the MDT with the child and the family. A range of interventions will be made available to the child according to his/her needs (see subsection 4.3.4). This centre will promote the active involvement of families, schools and communities to provide a wrap-around care approach to treatment. This could be facilitated through families, teachers and other stakeholders regularly visiting and working with the child to achieve their treatment goals. The facility will also work in close collaboration with local hospitals and voluntary sector organisations and access free recreational resources in the community to enhance the therapeutic experience and socialisation of the children. As goes the saying, \"it takes a village to raise a child\", the same can also apply to healing a child. With children suffering from severe mental health difficulties, a systemic therapeutic framework can provide better chances for improved outcomes, recovery and social reintegration. Discharge and relapse prevention: A mechanism needs to be put in place so that a rough timeframe for the treatment of the child can be estimated at the assessment stage, although 277 Ombudsperson for Childrenthis may vary based on the severity of his/her difficulties and social circumstances. Regular systemic reviews involving the MDT and the family, need to be organised. Plans and preparations for discharge, post-discharge, follow-up and relapse prevention must also be clearly elaborated during treatment. 4.3.4 Potential range of therapy services This residential mental healthcare facility could propose a range of psychological therapies, alternative therapies and psychiatric monitoring to cater for the severe and complex mental health needs of children and young people. For example (this list is not exhaustive): Individual psychological therapies: These could include among others cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural activation, narrative therapy and compassion-focused therapies. Brief descriptions of some of these therapies are provided in Appendix E. The child would be provided with the opportunity to engage and build a confidential and trustful therapeutic relationship with his/her Clinical Psychologist or Therapist to facilitate his/her understanding of his/her difficulties, treatment and recovery, and to motivate him/her to achieve his/her therapy goals. Systemic and family therapy: This form of therapy will be carried out primarily with the children and their parents or carers. The aim will be to identify and drive resources and strengths from the families and wider systems to enable positive changes in the treatment process. Group therapies: Facilitated by the MDT, group therapies can allow different children and young people with similar difficulties to come together and share their experiences in a safe way. Support groups: These groups could provide a space for the beneficiaries, the MDT, and volunteers to share information, experiences and activities associated with different themes on mental health awareness. This could be done using creative methods such as art, sculpture, story-telling and puppetry among others. Alternative therapies: The centre can propose a host of alternative therapies that are known to have a calming effect on the mind and body, for example, massage therapy, guided meditation, singing bowl therapy, dance, music, singing, drama and corporal expression. Empowerment and skills-based groups for parents and families: Groups and training workshops could be organised by the MDT for parents only, so that they could be educated about their children's mental health, share their experiences with other parents and learn skills to support their children during and after the latter's residential treatment. The therapeutic environment and surroundings: The location of the residential facility near the sea and the creation of a therapeutic garden for the beneficiaries will provide a powerfully healing context to facilitate treatment and recovery.Annual Report 2017 - 2018278 Psychiatric monitoring: As part of their treatment package, children and young people would receive psychiatric monitoring (e.g. medication reviews and physical and mental state examinations) by the Psychiatrists and/or Mental Health Nurses. A crisis management and resolution protocol should also be outlined to handle cases where a child requires an emergency admission to BSH or the local hospital. 4.4 The way forward I strongly believe that this project can bring a revolutionary approach to mental health in Mauritius for children and young people with severe mental health difficulties. I recommended to the Minister to elaborate a full project proposal at the level of her Ministry on the planning, setting up and implementation of this therapeutic residential mental healthcare facility for children. It would also be necessary to solicit the expertise and supervision of mental health specialists working at the Brown Sequard Hospital for the conceptualisation and success of this project. As it is stated in article 3 of the CRC (UN, 1989), States Parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities, particularly in the areas of safety, health, in the number and suitability of their staff, as well as competent supervision. Finally, the present chapter is an important call to the Republic of Mauritius to highlight the message that there is 'no health without mental health' . It is high time for our country to define and reinforce its policies, legislation and regulatory framework with regards to mental health. I think that the Allied Health Professionals Council Act 2017 is an important step in enabling the close monitoring of titles, qualifications and performance of local mental health professionals. I believe that quality service delivery will come through the teamwork of qualified, ethical and committed professionals.279 Ombudsperson for Children CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED MOTHERSCHAPTER 5:Annual Report 2017 - 20182805.1. Introduction In the Preamble of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations [UN], 1989), it is stated that \"in all countries in the world, there are children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such children need special treatment\". One of these at-risk children populations are children of incarcerated mothers. These mothers find themselves in prison for different types of offences including thefts, illegal drugs trafficking and homicides among others. Upon remand or conviction, it is likely that they might have left behind one or more children under the care of other family members or the State. Some of these mothers might still be lactating smaller children, while others might be pregnant and will be giving birth during their time in prison. In some cases, incarcerated mothers even live with their infants in specialised units within the prison. These circumstances inevitably impact on the growth and development of children of incarcerated mothers. According to an American study, the effects might vary depending on the child's age, the alternative care arrangements and the course of the mother's incarceration (Myers et al., 1999) 55. Children of incarcerated mothers are known to be at high risk of adverse outcomes such as disrupted physical, social, emotional or cognitive development, insecure attachments with significant others and peers, low educational achievement or school failures, poverty or eventual criminal activity and imprisonment (Myers et al., 1999; Poehlmann, 2003) 56. At an individual level, they are likely to suffer from fear, anxiety, depression, low self- esteem, concentration difficulties or even post-traumatic stress disorder. Some children might manifest their distress externally through anger, fighting, substance abuse or stealing among others. They might also face stigma and discrimination at school and within society at large on having an incarcerated parent. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC; African Union Commission, 1990)57 clearly advanced in its article 30 on 'children of imprisoned mothers' that: States Parties to the present Charter shall undertake to provide special treatment to expectant mothers and to mothers of infants and young children who have been accused or found guilty of infringing the penal law and shall in particular: a) ensure that a non-custodial sentence will always be first considered when sentencing such mothers; b) establish and promote measures alternative to institutional confinement for the treatment of such mothers; c) establish special alternative institutions for holding such mothers; d) ensure that a mother shall not be imprisoned with her child; e) the essential aim of the penitentiary system will be the reformation, the integration of the mother to the family and social rehabilitation. 55 Myers, B.J., Smarsh, T.M., Amlund-Hagen, K. & Kennon, S.

Ethiopia: Author.281 Ombudsperson for Children5.2 The local context The OCO was informed that as at 31 May 2018, there were around 115 incarcerated women in the different female penal institutions in Mauritius and Rodrigues, including 5 mothers living with their babies in a Mother and Child Unit 58. The Reform Institutions Act 1988 provides in its section 27(2) on the 'accommodation of detainees' that: The infant child of a female detainee may be received into an institution with his mother and may be supplied with clothing and necessaries at public expenses until - a) he attains the age of 5 years. b) arrangements for his proper care outside the institution are made whichever is the earlier. The Republic of Mauritius has signed and ratified the UNCRC and the ACRWC in 1990 and 1992 respectively. This conferred important responsibilities upon the Government to adhere to these international provisions. In 2015, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child 59 pointed out in their Concluding Observations on the Republic of Mauritius that Children under the age of 6 can live with their imprisoned mothers. However, it is concerned that the best interests of the child are not always taken into account, including when sentencing parents, that incarcerated parents are not guaranteed systematic contact with their children and the Child Development Unit, and that there is insufficient psychological treatment or social support to children of incarcerated parents who do not reside in institutional care. The Committee (2015) recommended that the best interests of the child be taken into account as a primary consideration when sentencing parents, avoiding, as far as possible, sentences for parents which lead to their being separated from their children. It also recommends that the State party give due consideration to the child's best interests when deciding whether the child should live with his or her incarcerated parent. In doing so, due consideration to the overall conditions of the prison context and the particular need for parent-child contact during early childhood should be taken into full account, with the option of judicial review. The Committee further recommends that the State party ensure that incarcerated parents are guaranteed systematic contact with their children and the Child Development Unit, including in cases of adoption , and that children of incarcerated parents who do not reside in institutional care are provided with sufficient psychological treatment and social support . There are very few local studies or reports available on the situation of children of incarcerated mothers in our country. As a way of partly addressing this gap and to determine whether the rights of these children are being duly respected and protected in line with the UNCRC 58 Information provided by Mrs. A. Jeetun, Prison Welfare Officer of the Women's Prison, Beau Bassin, on 19 June 2018. 59 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2015). Concluding observations on the combined third to fifth periodic reports of Mauritius. Geneva: United Nations.Annual Report 2017 - 2018282and the Committee's recommendation, I, the Ombudsperson for Children (OC), opened an own motion investigation as per section 7(1) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003. The present chapter outlines the objectives and method of the investigation, a summary of the findings and recommendations made. 5.3 Objectives of the investigation The two main objectives of the investigation were to assess the extent to which institutional support is adequate and effective for children of incarcerated mothers; and make recommendations related to safeguarding the rights of children whose mothers are incarcerated. 5.4 Method The investigation included several procedures namely surveys, focus group discussions, one-to-one interviews, studying local legislations and international documents and site visits. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the situation of children of incarcerated mothers, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) approached a varied range of relevant stakeholders as listed below: Incarcerated mothers whose children were living with them in prison; Incarcerated mothers whose children lived in the community; Children of incarcerated mothers living in detention centres; Children of incarcerated mothers living inside the prison; Children of incarcerated mothers living in the community; Foster parents catering for children of incarcerated mothers; Pre-primary educators who have taught children of incarcerated mothers; The Reintegration and Counselling Coordinator of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) 'Ki Nou Et\u00e9'; The Senior Social Security Officer of the Ministry of Social Security, National Solidarity and Environment and Sustainable Development; and The Director of the NGO 'Terre de Paix'. The investigators of the OCO and I enquired into the different perspectives of these individuals and groups of people. Interactive meetings were organised with the incarcerated mothers and their children (both those living inside and outside the prison), with the assistance of Mr Vijay Ramanjooloo, Clinical Psychologist. The participants were given the opportunity to voice on their difficulties and experiences.283 Ombudsperson for ChildrenIn addition, a focus group discussion was conducted with foster carers living with children of incarcerated mothers to discuss their situation. The OCO's team also spoke with two pre-primary educators regarding two children who lived in prison with their detained mothers to reflect on the children's right to education. The Senior Social Security Officer was consulted on the different legislation and provisions in place for children of incarcerated mothers in Mauritius. In addition, the NGO members were interviewed about their experience of working with these children through socio-educational projects and their thoughts on the strengths and gaps of the current system in catering for this target group. 5.5 Summary of findings 5.5.1 Children's voices The following are some quotes gathered in French and Mauritian Creole from children interviewed during the OCO's investigation, which illustrated their concerns and helplessness about their mothers' incarceration: \"Souvent je me kisannla mo mama ti la ek depi mo papa inn mor, mo santi mo detraver. Nou parce que tout le monde la maison chez moi. J'aimerai que ma m\u00e8re vienne \u00e0 la maison.\" \"Mo al get mo mama de fwa par semenn.

Summary of the OCO's findings with reference to the UNCRC CHILD'S RIGHT OCO'S FINDINGS UNCRC PROVISION 1. Right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents Only children less than 10 years old are allowed to have physical contact with their mothers in prison for a fixed duration of half an hour per visit. Children of 10 years and above were not allowed physical contact with their mothers which affected their emotional wellbeing. Only 15 minutes are allowed for communication through phone calls between mother and child. Children as well as their mothers reported that that they would like to be able to meet one another more often. Some children reported that they were unable to visit their mothers who were on remand because they had to attend school during weekdays.Article 9(3): States Parties shall respect the right of the child who is separated from one or both parents to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child's best interests. 2. Right to education Several children reported that they often skipped school out of fear of being asked questions about their mothers, or of being bullied and discriminated by others.Article 28(1)(e): [The State shall] take measures to encourage regular attendance at schools and the reduction of drop-out rates.Annual Report 2017 - 2018286CHILD'S RIGHT OCO'S FINDINGS UNCRC PROVISION 3. Right to non- discrimination Children faced discrimination and stigmatisation as a result of parental imprisonment. They suffered from trauma, fear, shame, guilt and low self-esteem. While some children became withdrawn, others became aggressive. Some children were affected by health problems and increasing school difficulties. A few children talked about being bullied at school due to the incarceration of their mothers. Teachers in school at times failed to intervene in cases of bullying among children leading to children losing trust in their institution. Children from certain ethnic groups perceived themselves as being doubly stigmatised because of their parent's imprisonment and their ethnicity.Article 2 (2) States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members. 4. Right to be heard When a parent was arrested, children whose lives were already chaotic often felt even more alienated by their circumstances and found it difficult to express their feelings to others. Usually, adults decided where the children would live without consulting them.Article 12(2): The child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law.287 Ombudsperson for ChildrenCHILD'S RIGHT OCO'S FINDINGS UNCRC PROVISION Some participants suggested that the judiciary should take more into account the effects that parental imprisonment might have on the children's welfare, development and longer-term outcomes. 5. Right to benefit from social security Some foster care parents complained that there was inadequate or even no social aid granted to children of incarcerated parents.Article 26(1): States parties shall recognize for every child the right to benefit from social security, including social insurance, and shall take the necessary measures to achieve the full realisation of this right in accordance with their national law. 6. Right to preserve their identity At times, the media stigmatised children by publicising the name of the mother, and therefore indirectly revealing children's identities.Article 8(1): States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful interference. 7. Right to special protection in the absence of parents When a child's single parent is incarcerated, the child is often placed in residential care institutions. Some children who were in residential care complained that they were not regularly brought to visit their incarcerated mother/ parent.Article 20(1): A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State.Annual Report 2017 - 2018288CHILD'S RIGHT OCO'S FINDINGS UNCRC PROVISION 8. Right to physical, mental and social development Children reported that they are psychologically affected by the incarceration of their mothers. They said that they are not visited by social workers who ask about their wellbeing.Article 27(1): States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. It came out from the OCO's findings that there are systemic shortcomings in various areas, such as irregular contact with their incarcerated parent(s), inadequate psychological and social support, and stigma and discrimination at school and in the society. These obviously impact on the children's overall stability and wellbeing. It is important that these issues are given due consideration by the State, non-State actors and all those involved, and that areas of improvement are collectively identified and tackled. 5.5.4 Good practices at the Women's Prison regarding children of incarcerated mothers Despite the difficulties reported by the participants in subsection 5.5.3, it was promising to note that several practices for the welfare of children living with their incarcerated mothers were already in place at the Women's Prison in Mauritius. Some of them are described below: Material resources: 1. The 'Mother and Child Unit' in the prison provides special amenities to incarcerated mothers and their babies. 2. Baby's toiletries (e.g. cots, blankets, clothing materials, nappies, feeding bottle, milk powder, cereals, fruits, toilet soaps, baby cream, baby oil and other sundries) are arranged for by the Prison's Administration. Identity of the child: The Prison Administration and Welfare Division facilitates the registration of the birth of the baby within the delay set by the Civil Status Office. Physical and mental health of the child: 1. Medical and paramedical services are accessible on a 24/7 basis. The children and the mothers are also visited by Specialist Doctors in prison. They may also be referred to the public hospital to receive treatment in the community. 2. The baby is sent for vaccination and follow-up to the community health centre of the locality. 3. Children living in prison are followed by the Prison's Psychologist on a regular basis. The Psychologist also visits the children at their pre-primary school to help with their social integration .289 Ombudsperson for Children Education: 1. At 3 months of age, the baby is admitted to a day care centre called 'Kids R Kids', which was opened jointly by the NGO 'Terre de Paix' and the Prison Authority. It is reported that qualified carers are employed to work with the babies. 2. Upon attaining the age of 3 years, the child is admitted to the Municipal Pre-Primary School in the vicinity. 3. An officer in civilian dress accompanies the child daily to and from the Pre-Primary school in a transport provided by the prison. Social activities: NGOs, religious bodies and other civil society organisations organise social activities for women detainees and their children during Mother's Day, International Women's Day and Christmas Celebrations. 5.6 Recommendations In light of the above findings, I recommend the setting up of a dedicated unit which would work with all the children of incarcerated mothers in the Republic of Mauritius. It could be managed by the Ministry or a non-governmental organisation, or even be co-run by both, and staffed with psychologists and other professionals. The objectives of this unit would be to: support the child through the judicial process of their parent; ensure quality contact between the parent and the child; and ensure that the rights of children of incarcerated parents are being duly respected. It is important that this unit operates as a new service. It should not duplicate the role of the Principal Prisons Welfare Officers and the Prison Psychologist. The unit should be specialised to work with children of incarcerated mothers/parents, both those living within the prison and in the community. The children would be supported from the point where their mother/parent is going through the judicial process, during the mother's/parent's incarceration and, in some cases, following the imprisonment period of the parent. The subsections below provide more detail on how the above-mentioned objectives could be achieved: 5.6.1 Support the child through the judicial process of their mother i. All children of the arrested parents would be referred to this dedicated unit for assessment and follow-up. ii. The social workers and the psychologists would ensure that the child is given comprehensible explanations on what is happening to the parent during the judicial process (arrest, pre-trial detention, trial and sentencing) and they would provide to the child the appropriate psychosocial support.Annual Report 2017 - 20182905.6.2 Ensure quality contact between the mother and the child i. The dedicated unit would be responsible to liaise with and sensitise prison officials on providing adequate access and quality time to the child when they visit their incarcerated mother (or parent). ii. The unit's staff could also sensitise and support prison authorities on how to improve the child-friendliness of their parent-child meeting spaces (e.g. through the inclusion of games and activities in the room and allowing privacy if it is safe to do so). iii. The unit could assess families who have difficulties bringing their children to visits (e.g. due to transport, accompaniment, cost or other difficulties) and collaboratively work on solutions with the families and the relevant authorities. iv. Apart from face-to-face visits, the communication of the incarcerated parents to their children could be facilitated by the social workers through letters, phone calls or other innovative ways of maintaining contact (e.g. having parents giving gifts or audio recordings to their children). This could help reduce the pain of separation and maintain relationships. v. The unit could assist incarcerated parents whose families are unable to visit or contact their children in other ways such as through the internet. vi. This unit could also organise day-long visits at the prison for children. The main purpose would be to maintain parent-child relationships during incarceration and to decrease the negative effects of parental separation and imprisonment on children. 5.6.3 Ensure that the rights of children of incarcerated mothers are being duly respected i. The life of children living in prison with their parent should be as similar as possible to how it would be in regular conditions. Their nutrition, education, play, relationships and other aspects of their lives should be taken into consideration. The dedicated unit's staff could ensure that these rights are being respected and that the appropriate facilities are being provided by prison authorities. ii. The clinical psychologists of the unit could sensitise managers and teachers of schools attended by children of incarcerated parents on the effects of parental imprisonment on the child's behaviours and academic achievement. School management should consider offering these children special support and remedial services as part of their educational plan. Scholarship schemes for children of incarcerated parents could also help in preventing them from dropping out of school. iii. During the incarceration of a parent, it is often the case that the other parent or another family member would be bearing additional responsibilities for the child. It would be important for the dedicated unit's staff to regularly assess and review the needs of these families to help them access the necessary support, such as special care allowances for low-income families and psychological help.291 Ombudsperson for Childreniv. Children of incarcerated mothers might not always have another parent or family member who could take care of them. In such cases, the child would potentially be placed in alternative care (e.g. foster care or residential care). The unit's staff would have to regularly review these care arrangements and support the child's transition and adaptation in their new environment. They would have to ensure that minimum disruption is caused to the child's education, health and social life and that siblings are kept within the same home as far as possible. Regular visits to the incarcerated parent should also be facilitated. 5.6.4 Additional recommendations In addition to the above-described dedicated unit for children of incarcerated mothers, I propose some more recommendations with regards to social aid, research, the judicial process, coordinated efforts between State and non-state actors and the media. i. Social aid It is important to ensure that children of incarcerated families benefit from social aid, special allowances and educational support. This could be one way of preventing the continuity of an intergenerational cycle of poverty or criminal involvement. ii. Research There should be in-depth local cross-sectional and longitudinal research on children of incarcerated parents. Research is necessary to come up with strategies that can cater for these children's and young people's social and emotional needs and that can support them to achieve their educational and life goals. iii. Considerations during the judicial process a) A full range of measures should be considered when dealing with offenders, including the use of restorative or transformative justice programmes both as a form of sentencing and as an alternative to traditional judicial process. b) The provisions of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (African Union Commission, 1990) regarding 'children of imprisoned mothers' should also apply and non-custodial sentence should be considered first when sentencing such mothers. c) In addition, sentencing decisions should take into account the effects of imprisonment on all aspects of children's lives, especially their welfare and the likelihood of future criminality. d) Principles of proportionality 60 and subsidiarity61 must prevail at every stage of the 60 Proportionality requires that action be no more than is needed to achieve the intended objective. This means that the need for action, and the costs and benefits that can be expected must be examined. 61 Subsidiarity is a principle which governs the choice of who should act, in situations where potentially more than one actor is able to act.

Coordinated efforts of the State and civil society to improve the situation of children of incarcerated parents a) The State and civil societies should implement a collaborative approach in order to substantially improve outcomes for children of incarcerated parents and their families and to help them grow into healthy and productive individuals. b) A number of therapy and educational programmes and services should be designed to promote the well-being of these children. c) Stigma surrounding the incarcerated parent, the child and the family should be acknowledged and addressed in any programme or service intended to engage with them. The wider public may also need to be sensitised on the issues related to children who have incarcerated parents and to be made aware of the fundamental rights and freedoms of these children on an equal basis with any other child. v. Media It is important that the media adopts a sensitive approach in how they portray news about parents who are in conflict with the law. The revelation of parents' or children's identities must be prevented under all circumstances. 5.7 Conclusion The rights of children of incarcerated parents should be protected as put forward by article 2(1) of the UNCRC: States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status. As discussed in the current chapter, parental incarceration affects children in multiple ways, and these children are known to be a vulnerable group who are at high risk of facing adverse physical, educational, psychological and social outcomes. Preventive strategies could help mitigate an intergenerational culture of criminal involvement, especially through the reinforcement of the family structure so as to foster an environment that can promote the growth and development of children to their full potential. Vulnerable families could be educated on the adverse effects of domestic violence, abuse, parental incarceration and substance abuse among others on the emotional wellbeing of their children. They have to receive adequate protection and assistance when necessary. Finally, they need to be sensitised on how to prevent these social problems from disrupting their family lives and on how to seek support as early as possible when issues arise.293 Ombudsperson for Children THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING FOR CHILDRENCHAPTER 6:Annual Report 2017 - 2018294 Poor Housing Conditions Impact on Children's Wellbeing: A Case Analysis on Asbestos and Deplorable Construction295 Ombudsperson for Children6.1 Introd uction The fundamental human right to adequate housing is commonly viewed as the \"right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity\" (UN, 2009)62. A good, warm and safe home is crucial to all aspects of children's well-being, yet a significant number of children in certain regions of the world, including parts of the Republic Mauritius, have to cope with waking up every day in dangerous and deplorable housing states. Research has shown that children's development, and current and future life chances can be largely affected by the quality of their housing. For example, in the United Kingdom, it is known that \"poor housing conditions increase the risk of severe ill-health or disability by up to 25 per cent during childhood and early adulthood\" (Shelter, 2006)63. The same report (Ibid., 2006) provided an overview of the several negative effects of low quality housing on children's physical health, mental health, education and opportunities in adulthood, which included respiratory problems, anxiety, depression, school absenteeism, homelessness, unemployment and an increased risk of offending behaviour among others (see Appendix F for more information). According to the Sustainable Development Goals, by 2030, the international community targets to \"reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions\" and to \"ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums\" (United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 2018) 64 . Our Republic is no exception and the State has the prime duty to address poor quality housing as a key component in tackling child poverty. In their Concluding Observations of the reports submitted by the Republic of Mauritius, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (200665, 201566) welcomed the continued efforts by the State party towards poverty alleviation, for instance, the provision of meals, free transport and education to children. The Committee (2006) however expressed concerns about the \"living conditions of vulnerable groups particularly with regards to access to adequate housing, education and health-care facilities\". They recommended that \"the State party strengthen its efforts to ensure that the needs of all children are met, in particular those from socially disadvantaged families and those living in remote areas, so that they do not live in poverty and their rights to adequate housing, education and health are respected\" (Ibid., 2006). In light of the above, it is urgent that the all relevant stakeholders undertake the necessary actions to improve housing conditions for the wellbeing of all children of our Republic. If the right to safe and decent housing is not respected, this will inevitably hinder children from 62 United Nations (2009). The Right to Adequate Housing: Factsheet No. 21 (Rev. 1).

This year, I investigated a case where the right to adequate housing of children had allegedly not been respected. The present chapter provides an overview of the complaint, the investigation process, a discussion of the identified issues and recommendations made based on the findings. 6.2 The complaint On 30 November 2017, a Joint Committee comprising of Civil Society and Local Inhabitants of Residence Richelieu, Ste Catherine, Residence European Development Community (EDC) Rose Belle and Residence Telfair made several written complaints to the OCO concerning the living conditions of children in Government-constructed housing. Among these grievances, one highlighted the presence of asbestos walls in many houses. Another one referred to deplorable housing made with blocks and slabs without the support of columns. In this context, I opened an investigation with the following objectives: 1. to understand the impact of housing conditions on children; 2. to report on any systemic failings or concerns that are identified; and 3. to make recommendations on how the situation could be improved. 6.3 The socio-historical climate of housing estates in Mauritius In 1960, many people had lost their homes during the passage of Cyclone 'Carol'. In response, the State's housing ministry had built 59 housing estates funded by the European Development Community (EDC), commonly known as \"Cit\u00e9 EDC\", in different regions of Mauritius. These houses, made of asbestos panels, were leased to those who could not afford housing. At that time, the dangers of asbestos to human health were not widely known. When this chemical hazard came to light over the years, EDC householders who could afford it rebuilt their houses with blocks and concrete. However, those who could not pay for replacement material, carried on living in asbestos houses. In the early 1990s, the State took the decision to give EDC/ex-CHA (Central Housing Authority) house leasers the option of buying the house and the land they live on. The Government then amended the State Lands Act 1856 to allow State land to be sold to EDC/ex-CHA house owners. Therefore, in all 59 EDC estates (Government Information Service [GIS], 2015) 67, asbestos house dwellers have either bought the house and land or are still leasing it. Furthermore, EDC householders who are not affected by asbestos deal with another major issue, that of deplorable housing. In 1982, the Government had built houses made of blocks and cement without the support of columns. Today, some families are still living in ruined houses, with pieces of concrete falling onto people's beds or in kitchen/dining areas. 67 Government Information Service (2015).

Maslow's well-known theory on the hierarchy of needs demonstrated just how crucial adequate housing is for children's safety and development. Housing is considered to fall under the categories of physiological and safety needs (Sutton, 2018) 68, as shown by the bottom two levels in Figure 2 below. This is because shelter is a basic requirement to enable people to fulfil other physiological needs such as hunger, thirst and sleep. Having a home and the necessary resources then can promote a sense of physical and emotional safety. As per Maslow's theory, people are motivated to fulfil the more basic needs before moving onto other more advanced needs. Thus, it makes sense that without decent housing, it is unlikely that children would be able to realise their rights to survival, health and education, and their needs to love, grow and develop in an atmosphere of moral and material security. Figure 2. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs 6.4.1.2) Asbestos and its dangers \"Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral substance that can be pulled into a fluffy consistency. Asbestos fibers are soft and flexible yet resistant to heat, electricity and chemical corrosion\" 68 Sutton, S. (2018). Housing and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Retrieved on 02 April 2018 from infogram.com/ housing-and-maslows- hierarchy-of-needs-1g57pr4qd19v201 2018298(Povtak, 2018)69. In the past, asbestos had been widely used as a chemical to strengthen construction material, but it had to be banned because it was found to be highly toxic and hazardous for health (Povtak, 2018). Unfortunately, old buildings still contain asbestos and its adverse effects continue to impact those who are exposed to this chemical. Asbestos fibres and dust are easy to inhale and swallow because they cannot be seen, smelled or tasted. Once deposited in the body, it never dissolves and this may cause several health disturbances. According to the World Health Organisation (2017) 70, \"all forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos, including chrysotile, causes cancer of the lung, larynx and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura. \" 6.4.1.3) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) In July 1990, the Republic of Mauritius had ratified the CRC (United Nations [UN], 1989) which meant that the Government bears the responsibility to ensure that the requirements of this international law are applied within our policies and practices. In line with article 27 of the CRC (UN, 1989), the State should ensure that every child in the country enjoys the right to a standard of living adequate for his/her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be taken to assist parents and other responsible parties in implementing this right for their children. If needed, they should be provided with material assistance and access to support programmes particularly with regards to nutrition, clothing and housing. 6.4.1.4) State Lands Act 1856 Section 5(3) of the State Lands Act 1856 states that: Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, where the owner of a house standing on a portion of State Land, which was built as part of a housing estate commonly known as an ex-CHA Housing Estate, is willing to buy the portion of land, the Minister may sell it to him by private contract at the price of 2,000 rupees. 6.4.1.5) National Plan on Asbestos (Ministry of Health and Quality of Life, 2002) 71 Chaired by the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, an inter-ministerial committee was set up in June 2001 to look into the health issues associated with asbestos in Mauritius. A National Action Plan on Asbestos (MHQL, 2002), commonly known as the \"Addison Report\", was produced. Some important measures were taken to prevent asbestos-related health dangers, for instance, the import and use of all types of asbestos fibres became 69 Povtak, T. (2018). What is Asbestos?

Within this Action Plan, although measures by the Ministry of Housing and Lands referred to safely disposing of asbestos wastes and reducing the risk of exposure in EDC housing estates, no clear actions were formulated at the time specific to the removal of asbestos panels from these houses (MHQL, 2002). 6.4.1.6) Report on the 'Health Dimension of Asbestos in Mauritius' (Sibartie, 2006) 72 Dr R. Sibartie published a report in 2006 on the 'Health Dimension of Asbestos in Mauritius', in his capacity as the Head of the Occupational Health Unit, Ministry of Health, and made the following recommendation: There are still many private buildings with asbestos materials. The asbestos panels in the Housing Estates will have to be replaced by Government. This will be a very costly project, but the health of the inhabitants should be a major concern for the Government. Identification of disposal site is another problem. The present cell for hazardous waste in the landfill site is reaching saturation point and the authorities will have to look for alternative sites. 6.4.1.7) Report of the Truth and Justice Commission (2011) 73 Regarding housing, the Truth and Justice Commission (2011) conducted a multi-disciplinary survey of an EDC estate in La Mivoie, Grande Riviere Noire, and they strongly recommended the removal and replacement of asbestos housing. The following is an extract from their report (Ibid., 2011, p.12): The Commission recognises that successive administrations have provided low-cost housing to those who need it most. However, it is clear that many of the citizens of Mauritius are living in degrading circumstances. Some well-intentioned schemes have failed and some families are living in overcrowded, unkempt housing, and many in absolute squalor. The Commission recommends that immediate plans be introduced to audit existing housing estates with a view to upgrading and, where necessary, to embarking on new decent (not low-cost) housing projects. Many housing estates have buildings constructed with asbestos, a toxic substance which is damaging to health. These houses should be pulled down on a phase to phase basis and other units constructed with proper material. Many housing estates, now known as residences, are devoid of kindergarten, playgrounds and some are without community centres. These shortcomings should be addressed. 72 Sibartie, R. (2006).

This Committee consisted of other Ministers namely that of health, environment, social integration and local government as well as representatives from the Parliament, public bodies, civil societies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and trade unions. Its aim was to come up with appropriate solutions for families living in EDC/Ex-CHA houses which still contain asbestos. The National Committee had announced a few measures as follows: The destruction of 18 unoccupied EDC houses containing asbestos. The provision of temporary accommodations and/or housing facilities to the residents of EDC houses by the Ministry of Housing and Lands and the Ministry of Social Integration and Economic Empowerment. The establishment of a time frame to closely monitor recommended actions. The disbursement of the appropriate funds by the Ministry of Finance for undertaking the removal of asbestos in EDC/Ex-CHA houses. 6.4.2 Meeting with the complainants On 11 January 2018, I chaired a meeting with representatives of the Joint Committee at my office. Their written complaints were discussed and the representatives emphasised the deplorable housing conditions that several children and families were living in. The complainants claimed they had identified that approximately 151 houses, in the 3 EDC housing estates, were made up of asbestos panels, while 16 non-asbestos houses in one particular locality were built with blocks and slabs without column support. The detailed figures are provided in Table 6 below. Table 6.

I was apprised that the CSR Foundation works with NGOs to undertake programmes and projects in ten priority areas of intervention, including Social Housing, for the benefit of individuals and families listed on the Social Register of Mauritius and other vulnerable groups. 301 Ombudsperson for ChildrenOn 15 February 2018, I convened representatives of the CSR Foundation to discuss the following queries: i) Does the National CSR Foundation adopt a human-rights based approach to funding projects for vulnerable children? ii) How does the Foundation promote transparency? iii) The right to adequate housing has particular significance for children. How many housing projects have been funded by the Foundation? iv) Does the Foundation intend to take into consideration the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child? 6.4.4 Field visits I delegated an investigator to carry out field observations in several houses at Ste Catherine, Richelieu, Telfair and Rose-Belle EDC, where she observed the condition of the buildings, and interviewed several residents including children. It is worth mentioning that two site visits were conducted in cyclonic conditions when a cyclone warning Class 2 was issued. 6.4.4.1) Meeting parents in their locality The investigator spoke with several parents. Many of them were appealing to the Government to accelerate their actions on eliminating asbestos housing from their localities in the best interests of their children. It was striking to hear one of them saying passionately (in Mauritian children's voices The investigator also met children who expressed their concerns on their conditions of living. The following photographs provide a pictorial overview of what the investigator saw during her visits and how children shared their experiences of living in these houses (see quotes in Mauritian Creole below the sa lakaz la!\" \"Partou ena dezord e trouv sa korek pou nik kapav fer res dan ros ti tonbe plafon lor mo fre.\" Annual Report 2017 - 20183046.5 Summary of findings The findings of this investigation are synthesised by the different areas of concern that emerged, namely housing conditions, health issues and education. 6.5.1 Housing conditions The housing systems in all the localities, especially Richelieu and Rose Belle EDC are not responsive at all to the basic requirements of a safe 'home' where children and their families could evolve decently. In Richelieu, the constructions are faulty, with blocks and concrete but without the support of columns. Some houses even appear on the verge of collapse. The houses look like 'sieves', with water seeping through the cracks and leaving families to remain in appalling wet conditions. With heavy rains, the leaky houses become even more uninhabitable. Babies and children living in these environments are constantly exposed to damp and mould, and they may face physical injury from pieces of concrete falling off. Slippery floors are a constant hazard. Electric installations are exposed to the water and residents face elevated risks of electrocution. Food and school books are recurrently damaged by water. Plywood furniture does not resist the water damage and have to be thrown away. People make use of big plastic dustbins to store their clothing to keep them from becoming wet. Many households place several types and dimensions of buckets and containers in different corners of the house to catch rain water on beds, chairs, the floor, and on top of electric appliances such as refrigerators, televisions and washing machines. The asbestos houses are made of asbestos panelling, that is, a two-layered sheeting used for roofing or siding of houses, one on the outside, and one on the inside, with an empty space between the two. This means that asbestos fibres from between these two panels can still float out of the empty space and get into the house. Additionally, in many of these houses, the asbestos panels have cracked, are partly broken and/or have become friable (or easily crumbled), thus exposing children and adult residents to even more health and life hazards. There are some occupants of asbestos houses who have had the means to replace asbestos panels with block and concrete material. A portion of these panels have been disposed of by local scavenging services. Some EDC inhabitants 305 Ombudsperson for Childrenhave noted that no special protective suits were worn by the workers. Some asbestos panels are still lying around in peoples' yards or in unused land on the estate. Other locals have constructed border walls adjacent to the streets with these panels where children usually play. This means that the inhabitants of all the EDC estates, including children, are exposed in different ways to asbestos contamination within the community. 6.5.2 Health issues Within such dangerous and poor housing conditions, it is not surprising that a lot of children experienced different health issues. Several children suffer from fever and chest- or lung-related problems. This is mainly due to the presence of asbestos within the houses, the lack of hygiene, the dampness in rooms and air pollution. Some people reported that they have been diagnosed with cancer as a result of being exposed to asbestos for long periods of time. Moreover, living in cold, damp housing can have an impact on children's mental health, increasing their chances of experiencing stress, anxiety and depression. In conditions of rainfall, the children often sleep on wet mattresses and this is commonly associated with allergies, skin problems and sleep difficulties. Whether they live in deplorable housing conditions or in houses made of asbestos panels, children are at high risk of having acute and chronic health issues. 6.5.3 Education Different areas of child development including children's capacity to learn and perform at school can be negatively affected by poor housing conditions. Children in inappropriate housing suffer from higher rates of poor health, both physical and psychological, and declines in life chances and educational achievement (Foster, 2015) 74. Children living in bad housing also may feel marginalised, discriminated or bullied at school. They may manifest the distress of their living environment at school in the form of different behaviours including withdrawal, verbal and physical aggression, defiance, lying, stealing among others. They often have to bear the label of 'zenfans cit\u00e9s' from their classmates, which can have a profound impact on their identity formation and self-confidence. 6.6 Analysis It is paradoxical that, while the need to improve social housing, including the dismantling of asbestos housing in pockets of poverty, appears in the priority areas of the 2016 Marshall Plan Against Poverty of Mauritius (Ramkhalawon, n.d.) 75, there does not seem to have been much concrete action in this regard. It is commonly read in the local press (e.g. Le Mauricien, 2015)76 74 Foster, D. (2015) How are children affected by poor housing? UK: The Guardian.

Labour and the Truth and Justice Commission. Retrieved on 02 April 2018 from www.lemauricien.com/article/ labour-and-truth-and-justice-commission/Annual Report 2017 - 2018306that the relevant authorities have so far provided little feedback on their asbestos removal projects and on the implementation of the recommendations made by the Truth and Justice Commission (2011). However, I wish to put on record the commitment of the Government to build more houses for people of lower income groups. These measures were announced in the Budget Speech of 2018-2019. 6.7 Recommendations In line with section 6(e) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, I recommend the following: 1. There is a need to ensure that every child in all housing estates enjoys the right to a standard of living adequate for his/her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development as stipulated in the CRC (UN, 1989). 2. Asbestos houses in all EDC estates across the country should be replaced with safe and sustainable houses that are affordable to residents who do not have the finances to build a house to live in. 3. Asbestos panels that are lying around or are being used unsafely in all EDC housing estates should be disposed of. 4. The existing faulty and dangerous houses in Richelieu should be urgently demolished and new houses rebuilt for the occupants while providing them with adequate temporary housing facilities. 5. The demolition and reconstruction of all faulty and hazardous houses in the other estates should be carried out while providing temporary shelters as proposed by the National Committee on Removal of Asbestos (GIS, 2015). 6. Houses should be built in ways that can withstand destructive climatic conditions. 7. Regular consultations should be held with NGOs, civil societies and the inhabitants who are affected by the problem of bad housing to provide them with timely feedback and collectively review the progress made. 8. In-depth research should be undertaken to assess the impact of bad housing on children in Mauritius. 6.8 Outcome and follow-up On 01 June 2018, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Housing and Lands wrote to me informing that owners of EDC/ex-CHA houses who either wish to upgrade or reconstruct their respective housing unit can benefit from the following facilities: i) assistance from the Ministry of Social Security, National Solidarity and Environment and Sustainable Development (Solid Waste Management Division) and the Ministry of Local Government and Outer Islands for removal and carting away of asbestos wastes;307 Ombudsperson for Childrenii) the owner may benefit from grant for the casting of roof slabs or for the purchase of building materials through NHDC Ltd, in cases of reconstruction of their housing units; iii) subsidised loan facilities from the Mauritius Housing Company Ltd; and iv) assistance from NEF for the construction of a housing unit as these occupiers are also owners of the plot of land on which stand their houses. 6.9 Conclusion As a Welfare State, it is crucial for our country to review the status, development and implementation of the Marshall Plan of Poverty in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (UNDP , 2018). We have to tackle the underlying issues of inadequate housing in a proactive way. The negative impact of bad housing on child development and the fulfilment of their rights is no secret. We, as a nation, have to ensure that the current and next generation of our child population have access to the necessary opportunities to achieve their full potential and become constructive and productive citizens.Annual Report 2017 - 2018308309 Ombudsperson for Children MATERNITY 7:Annual Report 2017 - 2018310 Maternity and breastfeeding: Advocating for better policies for mothers and their infants311 Ombudsperson for Children7.1 Listening to the concerns of Mauritian citizens This year, I have been receiving quite a few verbal and written grievances from mothers and fathers of infants, on the particular matters of maternity leave and breastfeeding. Many parents complained about issues such as: insufficient provisions in place to facilitate parents' choice of exclusively breastfeeding their infants for the first 6 months of life; a lack of clarity and coherence on how employers apply laws and recommendations of the Pay Research Bureau (PRB) with regards to maternity leave entitlements; and frustration on the lack of incorporation of international recommendations and research in our country's legal frameworks on maternal and infant health. This led me to investigate more on the local and international provisions related to the above concerns. According to section 6(a) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, I have the duty to \"make proposals to the Minister on legislation, policies and practices regarding services to, or the rights of, children\". Within the present chapter, I therefore address the subject of the international and local context on maternity and breastfeeding and I also provide some recommendations on possible ways of improving our domestic laws and policies with regards to mothers and infants. 7.2 The importance of breastfeeding In 2016, 5.6 million children worldwide under the age of 5 years lost their lives and 2.6 million of them died in the first month post-birth - the underlying contributing factor being malnutrition (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2017) 77. Many of these losses of infant life are also associated with poor feeding practices during the first 12 months. The first natural food for babies is breastmilk and it acts as a whole food providing for all the energetic and nutritional requirements in the first months of life (WHO, 2018a) 78. It has multiple benefits on contributing to the sound physical, cognitive and emotional development of infants and young children. Mothers who breastfeed are known to have a lower risk of ovarian and breast cancer which are two leading causes of death among women (WHO, 2018b) 79. Breastfeeding has also been recognised worldwide as one of the fundamental ways of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on nutrition, food security and poverty reduction for the year 2030 (World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, 2018) 80 . 77 World Health Organisation (2017).

Retrieved on 08 February 2018 from worldbreastfeedingweek.org/Annual Report 2017 - 20183127.3 What do es research evidence tell us about exclusive breastfeeding? WHO (2018c)81 defines exclusive breastfeeding as providing to infants \"no other food or drink, not even water, except breast milk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but [allowing] the infant to receive oral rehydration solutions, drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines)\" - a practice that they strongly recommend to all mothers. The WHO (2018a) also recommends that breastfeeding should continue for infants up to 2 years of age or beyond along with receiving adequate complementary foods. However, in an evaluation of 194 countries, only 40 per cent of infants under six months of age were being exclusively breastfed (Global Breastfeeding Collective [GBC], 2017a) 82. Owing to the several benefits of breast milk, the GBC has set the target of increasing worldwide the practice of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life to at least 60 per cent by 2030. According to a review conducted by the WHO's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, and Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development (2002)83, adopting a general policy on exclusively breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life presented no significant risk to infants' physical development. The researchers also found that this feeding practice significantly decreased the risk of one or more episodes of gastro-intestinal infection in infants. Nevertheless, they noted that this practice might be easier in contexts where sufficient nutritional and social support is provided to lactating mothers. They recognised that this recommendation may also depend on the mother's choice. 7.4 International provisions on maternity and breastfeeding Adopted in 2000 by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Maternity Protection Convention 84 was recommended to all Member States to ensure that the maternity rights of all \"employed women, including those in atypical forms of dependent work\" (article 2(1)) were respected. It was created as a safeguard to promoting equality for all women in the labour force and the health and safety of the mother and child. It provides a framework to developing the protection of maternity in national laws and practices. For example, the said convention brings attention to the following areas: Maternity leave\"On production of a medical certificate or other appropriate certification, as determined by national law and practice, stating the presumed date of childbirth, a woman to whom this Convention applies shall be entitled to a period of maternity leave of not less than 14 weeks.\" (article 4) 81 World Health Organisation (2018c).

These breaks or the reduction of daily hours of work shall be counted as working time and remunerated accordingly.\" (article 10(2)) Periodic review \"Each Member shall examine periodically, in consultation with the representative organizations of employers and workers, the appropriateness of extending the period of leave referred to in Article 4...\" (article 11) So far, 34 out of 195 countries in the world have ratified this Convention (ILO, 2017) 85. It is interesting to note the wide variation of paid maternity leave granted by these countries, starting with a minimum number of 14 weeks (e.g. Benin, Mali, Switzerland, etc.) as per the Convention up to 12 months in some States (e.g. Albania, Montenegro, etc.) and even 18 months for twins and subsequent children in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among the majority of countries that have not ratified the Convention, a considerable range in maternity leave is also present. For instance, the United Kingdom provides 39 weeks of paid maternity leave (GOV.UK, n.d.) 86. India has recently modified its Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill 2016 to increase its paid maternity leave allowance for the first two children from 12 weeks to 26 weeks (The Times of India, 2017)87. Another important international provision which was advanced in response to limiting the incidence of infant deaths and impaired development due to poor nutrition was the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (ICMBS; WHO, 1981) 88 . The aim of the ICMBS is to \"contribute to the provision of safe and adequate nutrition for infants, by the protection and promotion of breast-feeding, and by ensuring the proper use of breast-milk substitutes, when these are necessary, on the basis of adequate information and through appropriate marketing and distribution.\" The Global Breastfeeding Collective (GBC; 2017b) 89, which is an international strategy led by the United Nations Children's Fund and the WHO, also advocated for the full implementation of the ICMBS in all countries, along with other important recommendations as provided in Appendix G. 85 International Labour Organisation (2017).

The Republic of Mauritius has not ratified the Maternity Protection Convention 2000 as of yet (ILO, 2017)90, but they have expressed an intention to do so (2015)91. I believe this will be an important step for our country to better protect our lactating mothers and new-borns. Using this international framework to systematically review our legal provisions in relation to breastfeeding practices and the length of maternity leave, is necessary. All stakeholders have a duty to improve their understanding and interventions to ensure the highest attainable standard of health among this target group. It is important to point out that the Conventions on the Right of the Child (CRC; United Nations, 1989) 92, ratified by the Republic of Mauritius in 1990, provides in article 24 that State Parties shall: ensure appropriate pre-natal and post-natal health care for mothers; ensure that all segments of society, in particular parents and children, are informed, have access to education and are supported in the use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition, the advantages of breastfeeding, hygiene and environmental sanitation and the prevention of accidents; and take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children. A local study on breastfeeding practices in Mauritius (Ministry of Health and Quality of Life & Mauritius Institute of Health, 2017) 93 revealed interesting findings on a sample of 480 mothers of babies aged between 6 and 12 months. Of note, 98 per cent of the mothers declared to have breastfed their babies of which 76 per cent did so within the first hour following child birth; 60 per cent of the mothers were assisted to start breastfeeding; 39 per cent of the 480 babies were exclusively breastfed in the first four months of their lives and only 25 per cent were so during the first six months of life; Unemployed/job seeker mothers and housewives were significantly more likely to have exclusively breastfed their babies during the first four months of life than employed mothers, due to their availability and time; Around 56 per cent of babies aged between 6 and 12 months were no longer being breastfed at the time of data collection and 34 per cent of their mothers attributed the main reason to perceived insufficient breast milk, which is known to be a common misunderstanding; 90 International Labour Organisation (2017).

Report of study on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices of breastfeeding in the island of Mauritius. Mauritius: Author315 Ombudsperson for Children 77 per cent of the mothers reported having received information on breastfeeding. 96 per cent of them were informed on the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and 89 per cent were advised on the benefits of colostrum 94 ; 33 per cent of the mothers declared that facilities to breastfeed their babies do exist at their workplaces; and 68 per cent of the mothers considered breastfeeding in public places as normal. The report (Ibid., 2017) made several recommendations to sustain and improve breastfeeding practices in Mauritius which were related to capacity building and staff training, sensitising the population through the media, organising related outreach activities, meeting applicable international standards and establishing a child health information system. Another Mauritian study highlighted that 26.1 per cent of a sample of 500 surveyed mothers breastfed their children until two years of age and only 17.9 per cent of mothers had practised exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months (Motee et al., 2013) 95 . The average duration for exclusive breastfeeding within this particular sample was found to be 2.1 months, which was very low. Both these studies strongly indicate that there is a pressing need to encourage lactating mothers to exclusively breastfeed their infants to be able to attain the worldwide target of at least 60 per cent by 2030 (GBC, 2017a). 7.5.2 Maternity leave and benefits In 2015, paid maternity leave was extended from 12 weeks to 14 weeks by our country (Government of Mauritius, 2015)96 to match the international recommendation of the Maternity Protection Convention 2000. The Employment Rights Act (ERA) 2008 provides in section 30 on maternity benefits that: Notwithstanding any other enactment or Remuneration Regulations, a female worker who remains in continuous employment with the same employer for a period of 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the beginning of leave under this section shall, on production of a medical certificate, be entitled to 14 weeks' maternity leave on full pay to be taken either\u2014 (a) before confinement, provided that at least 7 weeks' maternity leave shall be taken immediately following the confinement; or(b) after confinement. 94 A sticky white or yellow fluid secreted by the breasts during the second half of pregnancy and for a few days after birth, before breast milk comes in.

Currently, female workers who have been in continuous employment for less than 12 months obtain the same amount of leave with no pay. However, it was announced in the Budget Speech of 2018-2019, that the ERA 2008 will be amended to provide remuneration during maternity leave for female workers employed less than 12 months (Jugnauth, 2018, p.56) 97. Within the ERA 2008, following maternity leave, workers are entitled to either two nursing breaks of half an hour or one break of an hour within working hours for the first six months after birth, or longer if medically advised. It is necessary to highlight that section 3 of the ERA 2008 explains that, with the exception of a few clauses, this law is not applicable to public officers, which includes section 30 on 'maternity benefits'. The conditions for service for workers in the public sector including the civil service, parastatal and other statutory bodies, and local authorities are reviewed by the Pay Research Bureau (PRB; n.d.) 98 under the aegis of the Prime Minister's Office. Regarding maternity leave, the latest PRB Report (2016)99 appreciated the increase in the number of weeks from 12 to 14 in an effort to meet international standards. The following is an extract of the recommendations made by the PRB (2016): Recommendation 1118.4.63 We recommend that: (i) A female officer should be eligible for 14 weeks' maternity leave in the event of a confinement. If the officer holds a substantive appointment or has completed one year's continuous service, the leave should be on full pay.(ii) Where the officer does not satisfy the criteria for leave on full pay, the maternity leave to be granted to her should be on no pay. Recommendation 12 18.4.64 We also recommend that: (i) maternity leave with full pay should be granted to officers for three confinements while in service and any leave required for subsequent confinements be reckoned against vacation leave or leave without pay, as appropriate; (ii) on giving birth to a stillborn child, the officer may either (a) take maternity leave out of her entitlement or (b) take sick leave in which case her entitlement of confinements would not be affected; (iii) for pre-natal treatment, an officer may take either sick/casual/annual or vacation leave; and (iv) prior to childbirth, an officer may take a maximum of four weeks of maternity leave. 18.4.65 The above provisions also apply to female officers who are employed on contract and who have served for a minimum period of 12 months (.) 97 Jugnauth, P .K.

Leave after Confinement 18.4.69 At present, female public officers may, subject to the exigencies of service, in the period of 12 months following the expiry of maternity leave, be granted in addition to vacation leave, either: (a) a maximum of nine months' leave without pay; or (b) six months' leave without pay followed by six months' leave on half pay computed on the basis of half the working time per day on half pay. 18.4.70 We recommend that the above provisions should prevail. Therefore, both the ERA 2008 and the PRB (2016) recommendations corroborate on the 14-week maternity leave provision. However, unlike the ERA 2008, the PRB (2016) recommendations do not refer to the provision of an hour-long daily nursing break to the female worker when they resume work following maternity leave. On the other hand, there is no specific provision in the ERA 2008 regarding maternity leave associated with the birth of twins or more children within one confinement. There is also no reference in this law to the number of confinements per female worker that are eligible to the 14-week paid maternity leave period. On balance, a 14-week maternity leave period and hour-long daily nursing breaks do not necessarily facilitate or guarantee the choice of mothers to exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of life (approx. 24-26 weeks). According to paragraph 18.4.69 of the PRB (2016) recommendations, female public officers who have used up their maternity leave and vacation leave and who wish to take further leave to take care of their babies must do so on leave without pay conditions. The post-birth period is known to incur significant costs to families for meeting their babies' needs. It is likely that leave with no pay may create financial insecurity during this time, especially within economically vulnerable households. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) regularly receives complaints on matters regarding maternity leave and breastfeeding, which are directly linked to the rights to survival, good nutrition, health and adequate care of the newborn child. In this regard, we have provided as follows two selected cases to illustrate the specific difficulties encountered by some parents. The cases have been anonymised to protect the individuals' identities.Annual Report 2017 - 2018318Two anonymised cases to illustrate difficulties with maternity leave and breastfeeding Case 1: Mr. C, a medical professional, and Mrs. D, an educator in a public school, are a married couple who recently had their second child. The couple wanted to exclusively breastfeed their second baby, just like they did for their first child. To be able to do so for their first child at the time, Mrs D. had used up her vacation leave followed by leave after confinement (leave without pay) on top of her 14-week paid maternity allowance. For her second child, Mrs. D's maternity leave ended half way through the summer school holidays. Since she was exclusively breastfeeding her baby, she was planning to request for vacation leave exceeding 19 days following the school holidays. This is stipulated as a special condition for educators in the clause 22.141(d)(iii) of the PRB Report (2016) which allows them to request for vacation leave exceeding 19 days during term time immediately after maternity leave entitlement. The couple therefore thought that it would be unwise for Mrs D. to apply for vacation leave during the summer holidays. Besides, they remembered that for their elder child, Mrs D's maternity leave also ended during a summer school holiday and she was granted vacation leave on resumption of duty on the next working day, which was the first day of the next school calendar. However, upon application to the concerned authority, Mrs. D was not granted vacation leave following her maternity leave entitlement for her second child. The concerned authority alleged that the phrase 'immediately after maternity leave' in the PRB (2016) clause meant the very next day. Mr C. and Mrs D. appealed this decision based on the PRB (2016) clause 18.4.69 which provides that within one year following maternity leave expiry, leave without pay can be requested after vacation leave has been depleted. Nearly five months following their second child's birth, Mrs D. had still not been provided with the requested leave without pay. The couple reported being frustrated on the fact that the same PRB regulations applied differently to their two children. They told us that, in such circumstances, it had been very hard to maintain exclusive breastfeeding for their second child. Owing to his medical background, Mr C. explained that the female breasts produce about 50 to 60 ml of milk each, which yield about 100 to 120 ml per feed. As the baby grows, the demand for milk increases and can be 180 to 220 ml per feed or even more depending on the weight of the child. He also said that it is difficult to extract breastmilk using pumps for feeding as the pumping effect the child has is very different from the machine. Nevertheless, Mr C. and Mrs D. had not given up. They solicited the help of other relevant stakeholders to influence the concerned authority's decision in favourably supporting working mothers like Mrs D. who wish to exclusively breastfeed their children.319 Ombudsperson for ChildrenCase 2: Mrs. E is a working mother of three children all aged under 5 years old, who had requested leave without pay for a period of one year from the concerned authority. Her youngest child is less than 2 years old, is still being breastfed and requires her special attention due to some health issues. Her husband does not have a fixed schedule of work, which decreases his availability in sharing the care and nursery/school runs of their children. Her in-laws occupy a business and she could not solicit their help for child care. Mrs. E finds it hard to cope with her work and family life demands. She has already exhausted all her local and sick leaves for the year. She feels she is not being able to give enough time to her children that she observes is having a negative impact on their behaviour. She reports feeling depressed. To her surprise, her leave request was rejected verbally by the concerned authority on the basis that there was a shortage of staff at her workplace. Five months later, she filed a second request, explaining how impossible the situation had become for her. Mrs. E also contested the grounds of staff shortage because she claimed that nearly 20 new employees were recruited at her workplace over the past year. Mrs. E is currently awaiting a response from the concerned authority on her new request and has informed other relevant stakeholders of her situation. 7.5.3 Where are we heading in the areas of maternity and breastfeeding? I would like to reiterate that the number of infant deaths worldwide in the first year of life mainly due to poor nutrition is alarming (WHO, 2017). We, as a nation, must leave no stone unturned to provide to every child the best start in life and to improve the quality of the mothering experience. In the context of the World Breastfeeding Week 2018, the Republic of Mauritius commemorated this event during a one-day workshop with non-governmental organisations on 07 August 2018. On this occasion, they emphasised on their commitment to promote breastfeeding as an important public health intervention and foundation of life (GIS, 2018) 100. It is important to acknowledge the ongoing efforts of authorities to sensitise the population on the multiple benefits of breastfeeding, to create breastfeeding corners in many health service points to ensure privacy and comfort to breastfeeding mothers, and to improve the monitoring of breastfeeding practices through the drafting of a breastfeeding action plan. According to Statistics Mauritius (2018)101, the country has seen a decrease in its fertility rate (i.e. the average number of live births per woman) from 2.03 in 1997 to 1.37 in 2016. We are also nationally experiencing the phenomenon of an ageing population. Along with encouraging couples to have more children, it will also be important to review relevant laws, regulations and conditions of service from a developmental perspective, so that parents 100 Government Information Service (2018).

Revise current legislations and provisions regarding maternity and breastfeeding with a potential view of increasing the length of paid maternity leave to at least 24-26 weeks to cover for the exclusive breastfeeding period of 6 months. 2. Allow for exclusive breastfeeding to be dependent on the context and choice of lactating mothers. 3. Meet international standards on maternal and infant health, for example, through the ratification of the Maternity Protection Convention 2000. 4. Continue to sensitise the population on child health, nutrition and the advantages of breastfeeding. 5. Invest more in improving local breastfeeding practices, and nursing support and counselling for mothers and infants. 6. In view of increasing the national fertility rate, reconsider the PRB's (2016) Recommendation 12 regarding the fact that 14-week paid maternity leave is only applicable to the first three confinements of the mother and that further confinements would require her to take maternity leave with no pay. I believe that, by reinforcing networking and concerted actions between State and non-State actors, we will better respond to the evolving needs of mothers and infants of our Republic, and ensure respect of their fundamental rights to life, protection and a high standard of health.321 Ombudsperson for Children HANDLING OF CASESCHAPTER 8:Annual Report 2017 - 2018322 Understanding the process of at the Ombudsperson for Children's Office323 Ombudsperson for Children8.1 Introduction This chapter summarises cases/complaints that were dealt with by the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) during the period July 2017 to June 2018. It outlines the approach that was used to look into the complaints and also includes appropriate recommendations. As stipulated in sections 6 and 7 of the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, investigations constitute one of my core functions as the Ombudsperson for Children (OC). I can initiate an investigation on my own motion and/or carry out an inquiry in response to complaints made by the public. At the OCO, 'smart power' is strategically employed to explore the movement of systemic change through an investigative process. 'Smart power' is a term coined by Joseph Nye which signifies a skilful combination of hard power and soft power (Wilson, 2008) 102. For instance, a single case can detect the gaps in any given system/mechanism; thereby extending the scope of our intervention from a micro to a macro level. The ultimate aim of investigative procedures is to make recommendations to relevant authorities in order to promote the best interests of children. In 2017-2018, an increase in the number and complexity of complaints has been observed. These could be potential outcomes of our office's increased sensitisation campaigns and proactive initiatives. More people are coming forward to denounce violations committed against children's rights. Other factors that have contributed to our visibility have been the support of the media, an enhanced networking with organisations dealing with children, an increased community support and regular field visits by our team of investigators. 8.2 Violation of children's rights and investigation procedures We investigate into cases where the rights of a child have been allegedly violated. Complaints at the OCO can be lodged when public or private organisations or any individual have faltered or failed in providing appropriate support to a child. The following are a few examples of cases which have been investigated at the OCO: alledged violation of the right to education of children with multiple disabilities; an authority failing to take actions to protect a child from abuse or neglect; rights and freedom of children at the level of teaching and learning are not being respected; potential abuse against children in CYC; impact of major infrastructural changes on children, among others. 102 Wilson, E.J. (2008). Hard power, soft power, smart power. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 616, 110-124.Annual Report 2017 - 20183248.2.1 Guiding principles for investigations Investigations are carried out in an independent and impartial manner; a non-discriminatory way; the best interests of the child; confidentiality and transparency; and consideration of the child's opinion according to his/her age and maturity. According to section 7(4) of the OCA 2003, we do not investigate into cases which are pending before Court. 8.2.2 Determining the scope of the investigation Any case begins with a preliminary investigation which determines whether a full investigation is warranted or whether the case can quickly be resolved. A full investigation consists of requesting case file records and documents from the Court, various Ministries and institutions dealing with children. The investigators conduct interviews with key people, carry out field visits and write reports. In certain cases, I carry out mediation, review the report of findings and align it with existing policies. I also submit special reports to authorities whenever necessary and make recommendations to appropriate bodies. 8.2.3 Monitoring and evaluation The follow up of complaints and that of the remedial actions undertaken form an integral component of my role as the OC. It is equally important for me to ensure that regular visits as well as spot checks are effected to residential care institutions and rehabilitation youth centres to assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitative services. Depending on the complexity of the complaint, I demand feedback from concerned parties on the progress of the remedial actions within a timeframe of one week to three months. 8.2.4 Training of investigators I recognise fully the pertinence of training for the investigators and the added value that capacity building would bring to the OCO. I, therefore, arrange both local and international training which undoubtedly improve their investigative skills.325 Ombudsperson for Children8.3 Cases handled by the OCO in 2017-2018 Table 7.

Some cases (approx. 9%) are still awaiting reports from various stakeholders and the remaining (approx. 1%) of cases are in progress. The OCO registers complaints from people and organisations from a vast range of backgrounds. The OCO also pursues own motion investigations based on identified areas of concern. Table 8 below provides a breakdown of these profiles for the reporting year 2017/2018. Table 8.

Table 10. Number of cases received at the OCO over the last two reporting years Reporting year 2016/2017 2017/2018 Number of cases received at the Ombudsperson for Children's Office346 465 Over the course of 2017/2018, the OCO carried out more than 135 field visits including about 60 visits to residential care institutions for investigation purposes. These enabled investigators to interact with children in their residential care and/or educational setting; quickly obtain information from children and relevant people; give advice, as necessary; and establish contact with headteachers, rectors, parents, carers and other professionals working with children and/or students, thereby improving their awareness of the role of the OCO. Examples of cases investigated during this reporting year are presented in the following pages to illustrate how investigation work is carried out by the OCO.327 Ombudsperson for ChildrenCase 1: Advocating for the right to education of children with multiple disabilities 1. Introduction Every child has a fundamental right to education without discrimination as stipulated by articles 28 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; United Nations [UN], 1989). The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD; UN, 2006) 103 also clearly advanced in its article 24 that persons, including children, with disabilities should be guaranteed access to \"an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live\". The Republic of Mauritius has ratified both of the above-named UN conventions and has committed itself to promote the rights of all Mauritian children with or without disabilities, including their right to education. The present case was referred to the OCO in 2017 regarding a potential violation of the right to education of some children with disabilities. This violation has been allegedly caused by two local branches of an international service club organisation which will be referred to as S1 and S2 in this case. The following sections consist of an overview of the complaint, the investigation procedures employed by the OCO, areas of concern identified and recommendations. 2. The complaint The children concerned attended a day care centre managed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Mauritius which caters for the treatment, education and rehabilitation of children and young people who have physical and intellectual disabilities, with a majority of them suffering from cerebral palsy. On 27 July 2017, the OCO received a written complaint from the NGO against S2. The NGO runs its services within a building situated on a land leased by S1 from the Government. The complaint was against S2 who was restricting the access of staff and students of the NGO to two rooms, namely the multipurpose/conference room and the staff toilet. For clarity, the timeline below provides a chronological sequence of events that led to the complaint: Year Events 1992 In 1992, S2 approached the NGO and proposed to build a centre adapted to the particular needs of its children. 2003 On 27 June 2003, S1 received a plot of land from the State for the sole purpose of \"setting up a multipurpose training and educational centre for physically and mentally handicapped children\". 2005 On 26 September 2005, S1 made an appeal to potential donors through a project written by S2 to raise funds for the construction of a day care centre for the physically and mentally challenged children of the NGO. 103 United Nations (2006). Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Geneva: Author.Annual Report 2017 - 2018328Year Events In the same year, the NGO contributed Rs 100,000, which was collected from a concert and Teledon, for the construction of the Day Care Centre. 2006 The Day Care Centre became functional in September 2006, consisting of a conference/multipurpose room, an office, a therapy room, four classrooms, a kitchen and two toilets. On 20 September 2006, a mutual agreement with specified terms and conditions regarding the use of the building were agreed and covenanted between S1 and the NGO, in the presence of S2. In this agreement, S1 allowed both S2 and the NGO to use the conference/ multipurpose room and the staff toilet as and when required for their activities. 2010 In 2010, there was an extension of the building to be used as an Occupational Therapy Department for the NGO. 2012 Photovoltaic cells were installed to generate electricity in 2012. 2015 A projector was sponsored by S2 in 2015. 2016 In 2016, each time the NGO had to use the multipurpose room and the staff toilet for the benefit of their children, they had to seek prior permission from S1 and S2. In 2016, the toilet was closed and the lock of the multipurpose room was changed without any prior notice from S1 and S2. According to them, these actions were taken due to the apparent 'misuse' of these rooms by the NGO. The said toilet contains the CEB meter and the internal alarm box is installed in the multipurpose room, which the NGO can no longer access due to the closures, thus giving rise to potential hazards. In spite of formal meetings among these parties and a petition being sent by the NGO, access to the two rooms was denied by S1 and S2. 2017-Present Access to the multipurpose room and staff's toilet are still being denied to the NGO. On 20 February 2017, the NGO served a \"mise en demeure\" to S1 putting an obligation to i. comply with the objects of the original lease agreement for which State assistance and public funds were obtained; ii. hand over copies of the keys of both the multipurpose/conference room and that of the toilet; and iii. not hinder the NGO from enjoying or putting to use the conference room and the toilet to all physically and mentally handicapped children of their day care centre. On 18 August 2017, S1 served a \"mise en demeure\" to the NGO to vacate part of the building within 6 months. This was due to having allegedly breached a clause of a proposed agreement dated 18 December 2007, which stipulated that the NGO shall have no right to make any renovation and/or alteration to the building without the express written consent of S1.329 Ombudsperson for ChildrenAccording to the NGO, it was important for children with severe disabilities to access the multipurpose room which provided a multi-sensorial environment that improve and maximise the well-being of children with multiple disabilities. Following the above course of events, the NGO reiterated its complaint to the OCO because it was highly concerned that the wellbeing of its beneficiaries would be compromised within a reduced availability of physical space and amenities. 3. International and local frameworks relevant to the complaint It is important to consider existing international and local provisions, legislation and policies which are applicable to the present complaint. The main frameworks are outlined as follows: Conventions on the Rights of the Child (CRC; UN, 1989): The complaint concerned violations of the UNCRC with respect to these children's rights pertaining to their disabilities (article 23), their best interests (article 3), their education (article 28) and their access to leisure (article 31). Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD; UN, 2006): Article 7 of the UNCRPD also states that: 1. States Parties shall take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children. 2. In all actions concerning children with disabilities, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. 3. States Parties shall ensure that children with disabilities have the right to express their views freely on all matters affecting them, their views being given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity, on an equal basis with other children, and to be provided with disability and age-appropriate assistance to realize that right. Article 24 of the UNCRPD regarding education is also of relevance to this case whereby States Parties shall ensure that: (c) Reasonable accommodation of the individual's requirements is provided; (d) Persons with disabilities receive the support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education; (e) Effective individualized support measures are provided in environments that maximize academic and social development, consistent with the goal of full inclusion. Education Act 1957: Pursuant to section 5A(2)(c) of the Education Act 1957, the National Curriculum Advisory Board advises on curriculum development for children with special needs and for remedial education. Creating positive improvements within the physical educational environment of children, young people and adults with disabilities are also an integral way of developing the curriculum. Annual Report 2017 - 2018330 Nine Year Schooling policy (Ministry of Education, Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research, 2016)104 : The policy document acknowledges that \"physical infrastructure is crucial\" (p.13) and that the \"learning environment must support the emotional, social and physical well-being of learners\" (p.13). 4. The investigation As per section 5(a) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, the OC \"shall ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children are given full consideration by public bodies, private authorities, individuals and association of individuals\". Therefore, I opened an investigation because I believed that from a child rights' perspective: a. the right to education of the children attending the day care centre was not given full consideration by S1 and S2; and b. the best interests of the children, as per article 3 of the UNCRC, were being overlooked when S1 asked the NGO to vacate part of the building by 28 February 2018. 4.1 Method 4.1.1) Field visit On 23 August 2017, two investigators conducted a site visit to the NGO's day care centre where they found that the multipurpose room was locked. It was noted that the multipurpose room had a large spacious area which could have been utilised for the benefit of the children. It was also observed that, due to a lack of space, many wheelchairs and games were carelessly left outdoor in the premises; and children had to stay in the same classroom for lunch, activities and singing time. 4.1.2) Convocation On 24 August 2017, I convened the Presidents of S1 and S2. After listening to their versions of the events, I reminded them that the purpose of the State land lease was \"solely for the setting up of a multipurpose training and educational centre for physically and mentally handicapped children\". 4.1.3) Mediation On 16 December 2017, I carried out mediation between the NGO and S1/S2. The President of the NGO, while acknowledging that the NGO had got this building following the intervention of S2, she argued that the NGO was in fact the beneficial owner 105 and had the right to the entire 104 Ministry of Education, Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (2016).

Retrieved on 05 May 2018 from ministry-education.govmu.org/English/educationsector/nys/Documents/NYCBE%20Booklet.pdf 105 A beneficial owner is a person who enjoys the benefits of ownership (e.g. use of the property) even though title to some form of property is in another name. Source: www.investopedia.com/terms/b/ beneficialowner.asp331 Ombudsperson for Childrenpremises. On the other hand, S2 stated that other children and adults made use of the multi- purpose room and the toilets during the weekends. I informed both parties that children with disabilities CANNOT fight their own battle. They CANNOT advocate for their rights themselves. I pointed out that within conflictual situations between two adult parties often the welfare of children is overlooked. I advised both parties to resolve the matter amicably in the best interests of the children. 4.2 Areas of concern 4.2.1) Anomalies regarding documents furnished for the investigation The State Land Lease (27 June 2003): On 27 June 2003, S1 was given on lease a piece of land valid for about 19 years by the concerned Ministry \"to be used solely for the setting up [of] a multipurpose training and educational centre for physically and mentally handicapped children\". Therefore, it can be argued that S1 may have already breached this agreement by allowing their members and those of S2 to use part of the building (i.e. the multipurpose room and the staff toilet) for meetings and activities other than the initial purpose of the lease. If the lease agreement was adhered to, the ONLY user(s) of the premises should have been the NGO and/or other authorised organisation(s) who are involved in the operation of the training and educational centre for children with physical and mental disabilities. According to the same lease, \"the lessor may cancel the lease \"de plein droit\" and without payment of any compensation if... the lessee fails to comply with any of his other obligations or conditions of the lease\". If it is found that the S1 has actually breached this lease condition, the necessary actions should be taken by the Government. The mutually signed agreement between S1 and the NGO (20 September 2006): This agreement specifying terms and conditions between S1 and the NGO about the use of the building was signed in the presence of S2. Although S2 seemed to be acting as a witness in this process, it is clear within these terms of agreement that S1 also conferred to S2 supervision responsibilities, and the rights to use the premises and to authorise its use. For instance, the S2 is part of the Joint Operations Committee which would supervise the activities of the NGO and the use and occupation of the premises. S1 and S2 reserved the fourth classroom for their sole use. They also reserved rights to make use of the premises as and when required for their activities or meetings. In addition, it was agreed that members of S1 and/or S2 would have free access as and when required to the conference room, toilets and kitchen and that the NGO shall raise no objection to this. S1 and/or S2 may also authorise the use of the conference room to any other organisation upon prior notice to the NGO. This particular agreement raises two important concerns: i. The use of the premises for reasons other than the original purpose of the State land lease (e.g. for S1's or S2's activities/meetings or unspecified activities) can be considered as a breach. Annual Report 2017 - 2018332ii. If S1 was the State land lease holder, all executive and regulatory responsibilities should have lain upon them. For this mutual agreement, S2 signed as a witness, therefore a separate entity from S1. However, the fact that S2 was also given supervisory, usage and authorisation rights with regards to the premises was incomprehensible. In a meeting with the OC on 23 August 2017, S1 and S2 explained that they had more or less the same members. This may actually be revealing a potential conflict of interest because these two parties signed as separate entities on the mutual agreement. The proposed agreement between S1 and the NGO (18 December 2007): The documents furnished to the OCO included a proposed but unsigned agreement between S1 and the NGO. Therefore, all the terms and conditions of this document could not be considered as valid because they have never been mutually signed by both parties. The \"mise en demeure\" served by S1 upon the NGO (18 August 2017): The averments made by S1 against the NGO in this legal document was based on the proposed but unsigned agreement (18 December 2007) between the two parties. This in itself can potentially invalidate this \"mise en demeure\" . Furthermore, both the mutually signed (20 September 2006) and unsigned (18 December 2007) agreements between S1 and the NGO authorised the NGO to occupy the multipurpose/conference room and the staff toilet free of charge, and as and when required, during school terms as defined by the Ministry of Education. In contrast, S1's \"mise en demeure\" (18 August 2017) referred differently to the use of rooms as \"authorisation to occupy part of the aforesaid building (save and except the conference room and toilet), free of charge during the school term time as defined by the Ministry of Education\". It is surprising that S1 quoted an exception that never figured in writing in any of their prior agreements. Difference between the NGO's and S1's \"mises en demeure\" : In the \"mise en demeure\" that the NGO served to S1 (20 February 2017), the main issue brought up was access restrictions imposed by S1 to the multipurpose room and one toilet. However, S1's \"mise en demeure\" served upon the NGO on 18 August 2017 concerned another matter, that of alleged alterations of the premises apparently made without consent from S1. S1 indicated this as a breach of terms, which resulted in a six-month notice to vacate part of the building containing the multipurpose room and one toilet by 28 February 2018. Nevertheless, according to both the signed (20 September 2006) and unsigned agreements (18 December 2007), the breach of any terms or conditions should result in a notice to vacate the \"premises\", therefore as a whole and not part of the building. Again, this shows an inconsistency in the application of terms and conditions by S1. This may also indicate potential vested interests among the members of S1 and/or S2 in securing the conference/multipurpose room and the staff toilet for their activities. 4.2.2) Deprivation of children's rights From a child rights perspective, access restrictions to the multipurpose room and staff toilet are having considerable effects on several rights of the children with disabilities of the NGO, as described below:333 Ombudsperson for Children Right to education and best interests of the child: Children with disabilities have special needs and require wider space to support their development at different levels. The multipurpose room is the only room which has a large space area as compared to the rest of the classrooms at the Day Care Centre. The closure of the multipurpose room has a significant impact on the performance of the children as this is withholding the space and adaptations that they required to meet their needs for a quality education. Right to good quality school infrastructure: It has been observed that, due to lack of space, several school equipment like wheelchairs and educational equipment are left outside the classrooms exposed to sun and rain. This shows disrespect towards children with disabilities in that efforts are not being made to improve their physical environment for more efficient use of pedagogical materials. Right to leisure and play: Children with disabilities have the right to leisure and play. However, the frequency of social gatherings, birthday celebrations and leisure activities significantly decreased due to a lack of space at the centre. Previously, these gatherings took place in the multipurpose room. Right to health: With the multipurpose room being locked, children are more likely to be in the open areas of the premises during breaks and lunch. Therefore, they are more exposed to environmental conditions (such as wind, heat, dust in the air, etc) which can put their health at stake. Right to social integration and socialisation: With no access to the multipurpose room, the NGO is having difficulties to provide the support needed for the social integration of the beneficiaries. As children do not have a proper place to interact with their friends, it becomes challenging for them to develop social skills and meaningful relationships. It is also commonly known that poor socialisation can result in behaviour problems such as social withdrawal, inability to interpret social cues and low frustration tolerance among others. 5. Recommendations I recommended in this particular case that 1. the Ministry of Housing and Lands looks into this matter urgently and give due consideration to the best interests of the children of the NGO so that their rights are safeguarded; 2. S1 becomes well versed on child rights matters so they could inform their decisions and actions in light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989) and existing child-related local legislation; and 3. State and non-State actors should collaboratively carry out continuous awareness campaigns on disability so as to educate the public on the value of recognising the rights and fundamental freedoms of children with disabilities on an equal basis with any other human being. Annual Report 2017 - 2018334Case 2: Positive discrimination regarding a child with visual impairment 1. Introduction Following an article published in a local weekly newspaper about Child PD106 who has a visual impairment and who was denied the school of her choice, I opened an investigation on my own motion, as provided by the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003107. She was not given an offer of admission to the State Secondary School (SSS)108 of her choice which led my office to enquire on the matter from a rights-based perspective. Child PD, a 13-year-old girl, successfully completed Grade 6 with a Primary School Achievement Certificate (PSAC), scoring grade aggregate 11. The father, Mr DD, was restricted from the choice of Secondary School for his daughter due to the latter being overaged. He expressed his disapproval of alternative offers to private colleges and requested a transfer of his child to her first-choice school from the concerned authority. It is crucial to begin by highlighting that Mauritius has ratified in 2011 the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD; United Nations [UN], 2006) 109. We therefore have the prime duty to uphold all the fundamental rights of persons with disabilities, including children. In addition, an important provision of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC; UN, 1989), that the Republic of Mauritius ratified in 1990, is the right to education of every child 110 irrespective of their differences. Along the same line, article 24(1) of the CRPD (UN, 2006) recognises \"the right of persons with disabilities to education without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity [...]\". Also, article 24(2) of the same Convention stipulates that \"States Parties shall ensure that (b) persons with disabilities can access an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education [...]\". Owing to the country's commitment to these international Conventions, the relevant stakeholders had the obligation to unite all the necessary conditions to give Child PD adequate access to education on an equitable basis with other students. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in the report submitted by the Republic of Mauritius (2012) 111 on the implementation of the UN CRPD, article 24.2 regarding a legislative framework for the education of persons with disabilities, explained the conditions in which neither a person nor a student can be discriminated by an educational institution. Paradoxically, the same report then brought forward in article 24.3 a clause of the Equal Opportunities Act 2008 which stated that 106 Only initials have been used for individuals' names to protect their privacy. 107 Article 6 of the OCA 2003: In carrying out the duties of his office, the Ombudsperson for Children shall - (f) initiate an investigation whenever the Ombudsperson for Children considers that there is, has been or is likely to be a violation of the rights of the child. 108 The full name of the State Secondary School has been concealed for privacy and referred to as 'SSS' throughout the case study. 109 United Nations (2006). Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. Geneva: Author. 110 Article 23(3) of the CRC (UN, 1989): \"[...] ensure that the disabled child has effective access to and receives education, training, health care services, rehabilitation services, preparation for employment and recreation opportunities in a manner conducive to the child's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development, including his or her cultural and spiritual development.\" 111 Republic of Mauritius (2012). Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: Initial report submitted by States parties under Article 35 of the Covenant. Mauritius: Author.335 Ombudsperson for Childrenan educational institution may discriminate against a person on the basis of impairment where (a) in order to participate or continue to participate in, or to derive or continue to derive substantial benefit from the educational programme of the institution, (i) the person requires or would require special services or facilities; and (ii) it is not reasonable in the circumstances for those special services or facilities to be provided. (section 17(3)) I am of the view that a 21st-century Mauritius cannot include a discriminatory clause or exception in any legal document, especially in a situation involving education, disability and children. A discriminatory law cannot be used to deny a child access to an educational institution of her choice. I also note that \"special services or facilities\" are undefined and vague which puts in jeopardy the application of essential rights in the context of a social model of disability. The objectives of my investigation were to determine the following: 1) Why was the State not allocating the first choice SSS to Child PD? 2) Why were Mr DD and Child PD refusing the alternatives to the SSS? 3) What could we recommend in view of resolving the matter in accordance with the CRC (UN, 1989), the CRPD (UN, 2006) and the Constitution? 2. Case study 2.1 Profile of the child Child PD is blind since birth and resides with her father. Child PD's mother had passed away when she was 10 years old. She started her primary schooling in a specialised school for children with visual impairment and was later transferred to a special class in a public school. Despite having issues with the educational material in Grade 6 - most books were not transcribed in Braille - Child PD managed to achieve grade aggregate 11 at the PSAC. It was her wish to pursue her secondary-level studies at the SSS of her choice, which is close to her residence. In a meeting with Child PD at the OCO, she stated in Mauritian Creole that: Mo anvi al dan sa lekol la. Mo ti al dan enn lekol pre ar sa lekol la. Mo santi ki mo pou bien dan lekol [SSS]. Before delving into this matter from a rights-based perspective, it is important to understand the nature and ramifications of Child PD's total visual impairment, as well as to define relevant parameters that need to be considered in this case. 2.2 Relevant concepts 2.2.1) Disability According to article 1 of the CRPD (UN, 2006), \"persons with disabilities are those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others\".Annual Report 2017 - 2018336It is important to note the social implication of this definition - contrary to the medical model of disability (Disability Nottinghamshire, 2018)112 , which \"looks at what is 'wrong' with a person and not what the person needs\". The UN's definition of disability invites States Parties not only to reassess the physical environment in which a person with disabilities navigates every day, but also to calibrate human interactions such that every member of the community can better accommodate all other individuals of the population into a functional social dynamic. The International Paralympic Committee (2012) 113 stated that \"[...] the Convention seeks to alter social attitudes by ensuring that governments, individuals and organisations recognise that we have the same human rights and fundamental freedoms as all other persons.\" 2.2.2) Visual impairment and blindness There are several strata of visual acuity, from normal vision to total lack of light perception. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO; 2017) 114 , out of 253 million people that live with visual impairment, 36 million are blind. WHO posits that visual impairment encompasses both \"low vision\" and blindness. While visual impairment is medically measurable (WHO, n.d.)115, the condition of \"no light perception\" or blindness is a result of a social construct, as explained by late Dr Kenneth Jernigan (2005)116, President of the National Federation of the Blind. In his opinion, \"blindness can best be defined not physically or medically but functionally or sociologically\". The consideration of a person living with blindness goes beyond the legal framework and that of conventions. In fact, it touches the realm of empathy, where we are brought to feel and understand at a deeper level the living conditions of the person in question. When the comprehension settles in that Child PD's intellectual and physical abilities are not diminished due to her blindness, we begin to realise that it is our obligation to ensure that the environment does not hinder the fulfilment of her rights. 2.2.3) Positive discrimination Positive discrimination is defined by the Oxford Dictionary (2018) 117 as \"the practice or policy of favouring individuals belonging to groups known to have been discriminated against previously\". This may involve \"special measures [that] aim to foster greater equality by supporting [these] groups of people [...] so they can have similar access to opportunities as others in the community\" (Australian Human Rights Commission, n.d.)118. 112 Disability Nottinghamshire (2018).

Positive Discrimination. Retrieved on 21 February 2018 from www.humanrights.gov.au/quick- guide/12078337 Ombudsperson for ChildrenI believe that it is worth to consider integrating positive discrimination in Child PD's case, therefore favourably allowing her to go to the SSS of her choice, irrespective of her PSAC grade. This will not be a first case of positive discrimination in Mauritius based on disability. Another young woman with visual impairment was denied admission to a local university's law degree course due to not meeting the entry criteria on the basis of her A-level results. Her case was reconsidered and she was admitted to the law degree course irrespective of these results. This institutional flexibility or positive discrimination became a turning point in her education and career pathway. After completing her law degree, she served as a Legal Research Officer in the Court and a prosecution service. She is now completing her postgraduate degree through distance learning. Similar to this young woman, Child PD can also be given the opportunity to achieve her educational goals in the school of her choice with the support of all agencies involved. I believe we need to overcome institutional barriers and uphold Child PD's motivation and trust in an inclusive education system. 2.2.4) Equality and equity As illustrated in Figure 3 by artist Angus Maguire 119, there is a stark difference between \"equality\" and \"equity\", despite similar etymologies. Equity builds upon the elements of empathy and justice within a system dictated by equality. By considering the initial dispositions or needs of each group or individual in society, more is given to some while less is given to others such that the playing field is levelled for everyone. In the context of education, the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI; 2010) 120 advanced that \"equity requires securing children's rights to education, and their rights within and through education to realize their potential and aspirations. It also requires implementing and institutionalising arrangements that help ensure all children can achieve these aims\". It becomes clear then that arrangements need to be made to accommodate every student, living with an impairment or not, in the mainstream educational system, as echoed in section 3.3 of a report on special education needs and inclusive education published in 2006 by the then Ministry of Education and Human Resources (MEHR)121. However, it seems that this 119 Interaction Institute for Social Change | Artist: Angus Maguire (interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/), adapted from the original image by Craig Froehle (medium.com/@CRA1G/the-evolution-of-an-accidental-meme-ddc4e139e0e4) 120 United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (2010).

Equality and equityAnnual Report 2017 - 2018338document (MEHR, 2006) has used the severity of disability as a factor to determine access of children with disabilities to mainstream education using a three-pronged approach as follows: Approach 1: Mainstream Integration - Children with disabilities will be given access to regular mainstream schools of their region. Upon parental choice and proper assessment and referral, children with mild or moderate intellectual or sensorial disability can be placed with the regular classroom with additional input of a consultancy support service and ancillary staff or support teacher who will provide assistance to the classroom teacher. Approach 2: Integrated Classrooms/Units in mainstream - Children who have more severe disabilities will be given access to education in specialised educational settings either in public schools or other schools through a special education class or resource room or through a special education unit operating full-time in the mainstream school premises. Approach 3: Special Education Needs (SEN) or specialised schools - Following proper professional assessment, children who cannot be integrated in the mainstream because of their specific educational needs will attend SEN schools. Such schools will be twinned with a mainstream school in the locality for joint activities.\" Nevertheless, it must be remembered that the severity of disability depends as much on the environment in which the person finds themselves as the nature of the disability. Therefore, the relevant stakeholders need to make provisions to minimise environmental conditions that emphasise a person's disability. The CRC (UN, 1989) states in article 3 that \"in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration\". Further, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (2013) 122 described, regarding the best interest principle that the right to non-discrimination is not a passive obligation, prohibiting all forms of discrimination in the enjoyment of rights under the Convention, but also requires appropriate proactive measures taken by the State to ensure effective equal opportunities for all children to enjoy the rights under the Convention. This may require positive measures aimed at redressing a situation of real inequality. (paragraph 41) 2.2.5) Age relaxation Another concept that I would like to mention is 'age relaxation' for children with disabilities, that can be considered as not applying unfair age limits on these children's access to education and other opportunities. In India, for example, children with disabilities can enjoy this relaxation at all stages of education until they are 18 years old and institutions involved with this target group have to adopt regulations for relaxation of rules as quoted below (Mohit, 2007) 123: State Governments/UT Administrations/other implementing agencies should also frame regulations for relaxation of rules relating to admissions, minimum or maximum age limit 122 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2013).

Provisions for admission of older learners with disabilities than the normal eligibility (up to 8-9 years instead of 6 years with upper limit till 18 years) is essential. Although the Constitution of Mauritius does not currently include any clause on age relaxation for the right to education of children with disabilities, I believe it remains a relevant and important consideration when resolving ethical dilemmas in cases involving these children. 2.3 Investigating into the decision-making process of allocating the SSS to Child PD In the current section, I discussed the concerns and documentation collated by the OCO's team from different parties on Child PD's case. I firstly focussed on the provisions made by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (MEHRTESR) and some reasons they advanced with regards to Child PD's non-allocation to the SSS of her choice. I then looked at potential explanations as to why Child PD and her father were refusing the alternatives to the SSS. I then provided some recommendations. 2.3.1) What were the provisions of the State in fulfilling the right to education of Child PD and why was the State not allocating to her the SSS of her choice? 2.3.1.1 Material support and care The MEHRTESR has shown commitment to provide the necessary material and human resources to support Child PD within her educational environment. Several pieces of adapted equipment and school material, along with a support assistant and reimbursement of travel expenses from the MEHRTESR, as well as a monthly financial grant through an Award Scheme would be provided to her, regardless of her choice of school. Additionally, a non-governmental organisation committed to provide her with resources such as a Bookshare membership, a talking MP3 player, a talking calculator and Braille courses and assistive computer training. Since material support and care is secured irrespective of the school, one logistical hurdle was removed from the equation in Child PD's case. 2.3.1.2 Criteria for admission to regional secondary schools According to the MEHRTESR's (2016) 124 policy document on nine-year schooling, the criteria for admission to regional Secondary Schools is based on a) parental choice, b) grade aggregate at the PSAC and c) proximity of residence to the Secondary School. Let us examine each of those in Child PD's situation: a) Parental choice In a letter addressed to the MEHRTESR, the father clearly stated that his choice of Secondary School was that of the SSS, which he claimed is very close to his residence. 124 Ministry of Education, Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research (2016). Inspiring every child: Nine Year Schooling. Republic of Mauritius: Open University. Retrieved on 21 February 2018 from ministry-education.govmu.org/English/educationsector/nys/ Documents/NYCBE%20Booklet.pdfAnnual Report 2017 - 2018340b) Grade aggregate at the PSAC i. The introduction of regionalisation of admission to Secondary Schools is supposed to create a context of mixed abilities in Grade 7. It seems that a priority list is used to assign secondary school to students. As quoted several times from different conventions, laws and policies in the current case study, it is clear that no child should be discriminated against on any basis in the context of inclusive access to education. ii. It is understood that a student's \"grade aggregate\" is not the sole factor considered to determine admission into a Secondary School. However, in a letter communicated to the OCO from the MEHRTESR, it was stated that \"all pupils admitted to [SSS] had grade aggregate 4\" and argued that the other schools proposed to Child PD and her father, which they rejected, \"corresponded better to her level of attainment\" (i.e. grade aggregate 11). From these statements, it seemed that undue weight might have been given to the PSAC result of the child and there appeared to be segregation based on grade aggregates in admission among some schools. Within an inclusive education system, this must not be the case and it will be discriminatory if this one criterion overshadows parental choice and proximity of residence. In such situations, the relevant authorities have the responsibility to correct discriminatory conditions and take \"proactive measures [...] to ensure effective equal opportunities for all children to enjoy the rights under the [CRC]\" (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2013). In the spirit of equity and relaxation of institutional rules to favour the right to education of Child PD at the school of her choice, her grade aggregate must not be viewed in isolation or in comparison with pupils with better grades, but rather evaluated in the context of her visual impairment, and the adequacy and quality of Braille material and support provided until Grade 6 and while she was taking her PSAC exams. c) Proximity of residence to the secondary school According to the same above-mentioned letter from the MEHRTESR, the alternative colleges being offered to Child PD were situated in the locality of her residence. It is to be noted that there was no mention in the letter about the SSS of her choice not falling within the geographical zone of her residence, which meant that this admission criteria would have been fulfilled in Child PD's case. 2.3.2) Why were Child PD and her father refusing the alternatives to the SSS? a) From the reports of the OCO's investigators, the alternative private colleges were all further from the child's residence than the SSS. b) The \"parental choice\" was based on the proximity of residence, as mentioned above in subsection 2.3.1.2(a). c) Child PD was a student of a primary public school which is across the street from the SSS of her choice. The Rector of the SSS and Child PD are acquainted with each other, according to her statement when she visited the OCO. She expressed to an investigator that she would be well taken care of at the SSS. 341 Ombudsperson for Childrend) From field visits accomplished by the OCO's investigators, we had gathered the following information from the different colleges: i. The SSS - The management of the SSS was keen on welcoming Child PD to their school, provided that she was assisted by a carer, that adequate equipment was provided and that the teachers and staff were trained to support her. This is the closest school to Child PD's place of residence. ii. Alternative Private College 1 - The management of this school explained that they were not equipped to properly accommodate a blind child - the teachers were not trained, and the school was uncertain about the logistics of having a carer accompany the child in class. Furthermore, the school required a written commitment from the SEN unit of the MEHRTESR to provide continuous support to her school, financial or otherwise. This school is situated in a remote location where public transport services are sparse. iii. Alternative Private College 2 - The management at this college understands and supports children with disability and makes provision for them at their school. He agreed to the request of the child to learn Hindi language at the school. This school is situated in a remote area that is not easily accessible, except by school bus. iv. Alternative Private College 3 - The management had no objection to integrating Child PD to their school, but asked questions about the logistics of having a carer who would accompany her in school and during recess. This school is the furthest from Child PD's home. 3. Findings and recommendations It is important to read the current section in a holistic sense since every recommendation sprouts from the background information held in the previous sections of this case report. 1. The MEHRTESR has recognised Child PD's right to education by providing several facilities and solutions (reasonable accommodation) to improve her access to school, namely: a) a special class in her primary public school; b) a commitment to provide the necessary material and human resources to support Child PD within her educational environment; c) a support assistant; and d) reimbursement of travel expenses. 2. It is important to note here that, although providing reasonable accommodation to meet the needs of a child with disability is necessary, more aspects should be considered to prevent discrimination when decisions are being made regarding the child. In Child PD's case: a) According to the OCO's analysis in subsection 2.3.1.2(b) of the current case study, Child PD had been subject to discrimination when undue weight seemed to have been given to her PSAC result which was the main contributing factor to her declined admission to the SSS of her choice.Annual Report 2017 - 2018342b) In addition, counting Child PD as an 'overaged' student appeared to have limited her opportunity to be allocated her first-choice school, where seats were already filled up at the time of processing her admission. I would like to reiterate the concept of age relaxation (refer to subsection 2.2.5 in the current case report), whereby the right to education of a child with a disability should not be discriminated against based on age limits. c) The voice of Child PD is also an important determinant which cannot go unheard. She expressed her wish to study at the SSS (refer to subsection 2.1 of the case study). She is the only one who can fully understand her own situation of blindness. She is familiar with the surroundings of the SSS since her primary school was across the road. Child PD trusted that she would be well taken care of at the SSS (refer to subsection 2.3.2(c)). 3. Our investigation therefore brought attention to a set of rights that require special consideration by the relevant duty bearers 125 which include actors from the public, private and parastatal sectors. These are provided in Table 11 below to remind all relevant stakeholders of their responsibilities: Table 11. List of rights in the UNCRC and UNCRPD that require special consideration in Child PD's case Name of convention Article number (title)Quotes Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations, 1989)2 (Non-discrimination)1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability , birth or other status. 2. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members. 125 According to the UN, duty bearers are \"those actors who have a particular obligation or responsibility to respect, promote and realise human rights and to abstain from human rights violations. The term is most commonly used to refer to State actors, but non-State actors can also be considered duty-bearers [...] Depending on the context, individuals (e.g. parents), local organisations, private companies, aid donors and international institutions can also be duty-bearers\".343 Ombudsperson for Children3.1 (Best interests of the child)1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. 12.1 (Respect for the views of the child)1. States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. 23.3 (Children with disabilities)3. Recognizing the special needs of a disabled child, assistance extended in accordance with paragraph 2 of the present article shall be provided free of charge, whenever possible, taking into account the financial resources of the parents or others caring for the child, and shall be designed to ensure that the disabled child has effective access to and receives education, training, health care services, rehabilitation services, preparation for employment and recreation opportunities in a manner conducive to the child's achieving the fullest possible social integration and individual development, including his or her cultural and spiritual development. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2006)24 (Education) 1. States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. With a view to realizing this right without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, States Parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning directed to: (a) The full development of human potential and sense of dignity and self-worth, and the strengthening of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and human diversity; (b) The development by persons with disabilities of their personality, talents and creativity, as well as their mental and physical abilities, to their fullest potential;Annual Report 2017 - 2018344Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2006)24 (Education) (c) Enabling persons with disabilities to participate effectively in a free society. 2. In realizing this right, States Parties shall ensure that:(a) Persons with disabilities are not excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability , and that children with disabilities are not excluded from free and compulsory primary education, or from secondary education, on the basis of disability; (b) Persons with disabilities can access an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live; (c) Reasonable accommodation of the individual's requirements is provided; (d) Persons with disabilities receive the support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education; (e) Effective individualized support measures are provided in environments that maximize academic and social development, consistent with the goal of full inclusion. 3. States Parties shall enable persons with disabilities to learn life and social development skills to facilitate their full and equal participation in education and as members of the community. To this end, States Parties shall take appropriate measures, including: (a) Facilitating the learning of Braille, alternative script, augmentative and alternative modes, means and formats of communication and orientation and mobility skills, and facilitating peer support and mentoring; (b) Facilitating the learning of sign language and the promotion of the linguistic identity of the deaf community;345 Ombudsperson for ChildrenConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2006)24 (Education) (c) Ensuring that the education of persons, and in particular children, who are blind, deaf or deafblind, is delivered in the most appropriate languages and modes and means of communication for the individual, and in environments which maximize academic and social development. 4. In order to help ensure the realization of this right, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to employ teachers, including teachers with disabilities, who are qualified in sign language and/or Braille, and to train professionals and staff who work at all levels of education. Such training shall incorporate disability awareness and the use of appropriate augmentative and alternative modes, means and formats of communication, educational techniques and materials to support persons with disabilities. 5. States Parties shall ensure that persons with disabilities are able to access general tertiary education, vocational training, adult education and lifelong learning without discrimination and on an equal basis with others. To this end, States Parties shall ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided to persons with disabilities. 4. Conclusion About 5-6 weeks following Mr DD's request to transfer Child PD to the SSS of her choice, the MEHRTESR allocated to her a seat at the SSS with all the necessary resources in place. Child PD's and her father's motivation and trust in an inclusive education system were preserved. This was the result of a fruitful collaboration among all the relevant stakeholders including the MEHRTESR and the Ombudsperson for Children's Office towards finding solutions with the best interests of Child PD at heart. This case has allowed us to become more cognisant of the rights of persons with disabilities; the vocabulary used to address and discuss issues relating to persons with disabilities; and the stereotypes and prejudices at play in attitudes towards persons with disabilities. It was also identified that section 17(3) of the Equal Opportunities Act 2008 should be repealed due to its discriminatory and archaic nature. In the context of celebrating 50 years of Independence, Mauritius ought to set the tone as an avant-garde nation, one that respects international Conventions that have been signed and ratified, and one that is open to principles of equity, positive discrimination and relaxation of rules when appropriate. I would like to thank the local press for having highlighted Child PD's situation and drawn attention to it. Social media and Facebook played a positive role in raising awareness about an issue that is directly concerned with the fundamental right to education in the UNCRC and UNCRPD. Let us all remember that, despite being devoid of sight, people living with blindness navigate by relying on how they feel the world that surrounds them. The MEHRTESR is praiseworthy for the favourable decision they took in Child PD's case. Annual Report 2017 - 2018346Case 3: Kreol language in the education system 1. The complaint The Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) received a complaint from 'Ledikasyon Pu Travayer' (LPT), a registered organisation, founded in 1977, which promotes and defends mother tongue-based multi-lingual education. It also operates educational and literacy services for adults. The LPT requested the OCO to consider opening an inquiry on the question of potential harm being done to children by the 'continued suppression of the mother tongue in the local education system'. According to the LPT, this is a violation of the rights and freedoms of children, especially at the level of teaching and learning. Given the nature of the complaint, I opened an investigation as per sections 6(g) and (j) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, which stipulates that the Ombudsperson shall \"investigate cases relating to the situation of children in the family, in schools and in all other institutions, including private or public bodies\" and \"investigate complaints made by a child, or any other person, in relation to the rights of any child\" respectively. 2. The investigation The objectives of this investigation were to: a) review the local and international literature related to the use of the mother tongue as medium of instruction in our local educational system; and b) make recommendations based on our findings. During our investigation, we carried out literature searches and interviewed different groups of people including members of the LPT as well as children, parents and teachers in some primary schools in Mauritius. We have had enriching encounters with our participants who expressed their views on the use of the mother tongue in the education system based on their experiences, roles and beliefs. 3. Findings 3.1 A historical overview on languages in the Republic of Mauritius The Republic of Mauritius (n.d.)126 was a British colony from 1810 to before gaining independence in March 1968. When the British took over from the French in 1810, there were no major changes in the life, customs and traditions of the French colonists and other people living on the island. According to Napal (1962) 127, a bilingual capitulation treaty laid down the 126 Republic of Mauritius (n.d.) Explore Mauritius: History. Retrieved on 28 July 2018 from www.govmu.org/English/ExploreMauritius/ Pages/History.aspx 127 Napal, D. (1962). Les constitutions de Ombudsperson for Childrenconditions necessary for the French language to continue to be used on the island even under the British rule. From 1847, the use of English was made compulsory in the Higher Courts only and was used mainly for administrative purpose (Stein, 1997) 128. After Mauritius gained its independence, English continued to be used mostly in formal contexts. Article 49 of the Constitution of the Republic of Mauritius stipulates that, \"The official language of the Assembly shall be English but any member may address the chair in French\". The Government Portal of the Republic of Mauritius (n.d.) 129 describes the languages of the island as such: \"English is the official language. French is extensively used and Creole is widely spoken. Asian languages also form part of the linguistic mosaic.\" According to estimates in 2011 about spoken languages in the Republic of Mauritius, it was indicated that 86.5 per cent of Mauritians primarily used Kreol (i.e. Mauritian Creole), 5.3 per cent Bhojpuri, 4.1 per cent French and less than 1 per cent English (Central Intelligence Agency, 2018) 130. Kreol is predominantly used in private and informal contexts. On the contrary, English is used mostly in formal situations such as within the domains of administration, teaching and sometimes the media. 3.2 Medium of instruction in the local education system The medium of instruction refers to the language used by someone to impart knowledge. In the education system, it is the language used by a teacher to teach the school curriculum. Section 43 of the Education Regulations on 'Medium of instruction and teaching of languages' (Republic of Mauritius, 1957) 131 stated that: 1) In the lower classes of Government and aided primary schools up to and including Standard III, any one language may be employed as the language of instruction, being a language which in the opinion of the Minister is most suitable for the pupils. 2) In Standards IV, V, and VI of the Government and aided primary schools the medium of instruction shall be English, and conversation between teacher and pupils shall be carried on in English; provided that lessons in any other language taught in the school shall be carried on through the medium of that instruction. 3) The Minister may make provision for the teaching of languages other than English which are current in Mauritius, and for their study in any Government and aided primary school, and may require an Education Authority to make arrangements for such teaching in any of the primary schools under its control. According to Stein (1997), subsection 43(1) of the Education Regulations 1957 (as cited above) stemmed at a time when children who were entering school knew neither English nor French, 128 Stein, P . (1997). The English Language in Mauritius: Past and Present. English World-Wide , 18(1), 65-89. 129 Republic of Mauritius (n.d.) Explore Mauritius: Language.

Republic of Mauritius: The Government Printer.Annual Report 2017 - 2018348but they spoke either Kreol or Bhojpuri. As from Grade 4 onwards, English was officialised as the medium of instruction. It is important to note that these regulations have been established about 60 years ago when Mauritius was still under British rule and that, similar to many other sections of these Regulations, the above-quoted section has not been subject to any changes since. When children enter primary school at the age of 5 or 6 years, all textbooks except for French, Kreol, Bhojpuri and Oriental languages, are in English. For example, Mathematics, Science and Geography are in English. The OCO's investigation has shown that many teachers have recourse to Kreol or French as an oral medium of instruction to facilitate the children's understanding of different English-based subjects. This might be mainly because, even now, most children entering school speak in Kreol. However, course works for these subjects are expected to be written in English. In their analysis regarding the school system of Mauritius, Meade and his colleagues (1961) 132 wrote the following: We do not believe that we exaggerate when we say that the greatest handicap to successful education in Mauritius is that imposed by the multiplicity of language in use. The same conclusion was made by Ramdoyal (1977, p.139)133 in The Development of Education in Mauritius: Starting three (which includes English, French and Oriental) foreign languages at the same time at age five places an enormous burden on the child. For many children this has led to poor standards in oracy and to functional illiteracy in English. Furthermore, Ledikasyon Pu Travayer (LPT) carried out a 4-day public hearing in October 2009 where a wide range of witnesses gave testimonies in front of an International Panel. They reported that their main findings were: 1) Rate of failure after nine years of schooling is inexplicably high and functional literacy rate is alarmingly low. 2) Alongside academic failure, there are closely related problems like high rate of absenteeism, high drop-out rates and a lack of interest and motivation as well as an absence of creativity. 3) The language policy which is at the core of the education system fails to develop children's full potential in terms of their cognitive, emotional, psychological and social growth. 4) The Prevoc-Bureau de l'Education Catholique (BEC) representative implemented a language policy of using the mother tongue as medium of instruction and they had had positive results. 132 Meade, J.E. & Others. (1961). The Economic and Social Structure of Mauritius: Volume 48. London: Routledge. 133 Ramdoyal, R.D. Institute of Education.349 Ombudsperson for ChildrenGiven above-mentioned points, it can be argued that the Mauritian language policy in education requires more specificity and refinement. Most children and their parents do not speak either English or French at home. The fact that children are taught literacy and numeracy in languages that are not their mother tongue can explain the high level of absenteeism, high percentage of illiteracy and the number of failures at the end of the primary education level. It is important to highlight here that, in 2012, Kreol was introduced as an optional language in Grade I, which is a big step taken by the State to introduce the mother tongue in the school curriculum. Kreol is however not used as the written medium for 'content subjects' such as History, Geography and Science, which are mainly in English. Besides, English and French remain compulsory at school and are the core languages for national examinations from Grade I onwards. This can mean that, especially for children in lower Grades, there is a need to keep the level of the subject contents low enough to match the emerging proficiency level of the students in a second language. 3.3 Attitudes towards the use of Kreol in the local education system During the OCO's investigation, several teachers and parents provided their views on the use of mother tongue, specifically Kreol, in the local education system. The findings are summarised as follows: 1) Some teachers reported using Kreol in the classrooms to facilitate the understanding of students especially for subjects like Mathematics, History and Geography. Other teachers told us that they tried to limit the use of Kreol because they perceived it to be of little utility to students since examinations have to be taken in English and French. 2) A large majority of parents were against the use of mother tongue in the classroom stating that it acts as a boundary for their children to do well in English- and French-based examinations. 3) Some parents who were in favour of Kreol at primary level were mainly the ones who identified themselves as illiterate in English and French. They reported being better able to help their children with their homework in Kreol. Furthermore, over the last 40 years, different survey studies have attempted to understand the attitudes of Mauritians towards the use of Kreol in schools as a medium of instruction. Mixed findings against and for the use of Kreol have been observed across studies. For instance, a Mauritian study advanced that, out of its 79 participants, 33 per cent were in favour of the introduction of Kreol in school, 56 per cent opposed it and 11 per cent had no opinion (Rajah-Carrim, 2007) 134. Another later study used an online survey to gather Mauritian people's opinions on introducing Kreol in primary level education (Miller, 2015)135. Out of 134 Rajah-Carrim, A. (2007). Mauritian Creole and language attitudes in the education system of multiethnic and multilingual Mauritius. Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 28 (1), 51-71. 135 Miller, A. (2015). Kreol in Mauritian Schools: Mother Tongue Language Education and Public Opinion. Unpublished bachelor's thesis, Department of Linguistics, Yale University. Retrieved on 28 July 2018 from ling.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/AllisonMillerSeniorEssay.pdfAnnual Report 2017 - 201835061 participants, 36 per cent agreed, 52 per cent disagreed and 11 per cent had no opinion. These two studies revealed an unfavourable public opinion on the use of Kreol as a medium of instruction in primary schools among more than half of their samples. On the contrary, surveys conducted by a professional social research firm based in France called SOFRES suggested more favourable opinions among Mauritians in relation to the use of Kreol in education. The first survey was carried out in 1977, where 60 per cent of participants were for the use of Kreol in schools and only 35 per cent were against. At the time, the question in the survey did not differentiate between Kreol as a subject and as a medium of instruction. A second survey commissioned by LPT was carried out in 2009 with a sample of about 600 Mauritians aged 18 years and above. These participants were specifically asked about the use of Kreol as a formal medium to teach subjects such as Science. Sixty-seven per cent voted for this idea and only a minority of 27 per cent were against. The LPT (2009) 136 also highlighted from the results of the 2009 survey that: 87 per cent of people did not even know that there is a standardised orthography for Kreol language called \"Grafi Larmoni\"; 80 per cent of people had no idea that the pre-vocational schools have had an experience with the Kreol language, let alone that this was successful; 93 per cent of people did not know that the University of Mauritius has had a Course in and on Kreol; and 90 per cent of people did not know that there are Kreol language dictionaries. I believe that these findings indicate the need to carry out more extensive and evidence-based local campaigns to inform the population on the historical evolution of Kreol from a dialect to a formal language and, where appropriate, challenge educational myths about its use as a medium of instruction. 3.4 International recommendations relevant to the use of mother tongue in our local education system Following the signature and ratification in 1990 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations, 1989), the Republic of Mauritius has taken the responsibility to implement the provisions of this international law. Article 29(1)(c) of the said convention states that: State Parties agree that the education of the child shall be directed to...the development of respect for the child's parents, his or her own cultural identity, language and values, for the national values of the country in which the child is living, the country from which he or she may originate, and for civilizations different from his or her own (.) 136 Ledikasyon Pu Travayer (Ed.)

In this regard the Committee (2006, paragraph 61(b)) recommended to \"develop a policy regarding the use of Creole in the Early Childhood Development (ECD) stage and at primary levels\". In their next report on Mauritius, the Committee (2015)138 reiterated its concern that \"schools are not adequately provided with educational materials in Creole, which remains an optional language, thereby limiting access to education for Creole-speaking children and resulting in high dropout rates for them, which amount to 20 per cent in primary education.\" The Committee (2015) recommended the State to: Take measures to improve the accessibility and quality of education, including by limiting the impact of the language of instruction on access to education and on school completion and dropout rates, in particular for Creole-speaking children, children in street situations and those that are deprived of their family environment, through the use of Creole at the early childhood development stage and at the primary and secondary school levels; and provide high-quality training for teachers, with particular emphasis on rural areas. 3.5 Some international evidence on the benefits of using the mother tongue in learning Mother tongue refers to the language a person learns from birth. It is not only the first language that one learns as a baby, but it is also the first language with which a person develops his or her ability to master its linguistic and communicative aspects (Nordquist, 2018) 139. Many research studies point to the association between the use of the mother tongue for teaching and learning, especially in the early years, and the quality of education. In relation to vernacular languages 140, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 1953, p.11)141 advanced that: It is axiomatic that the best medium for teaching a child is his mother tongue. Psychologically, it is the system of meaningful signs that in his mind works automatically for expression and understanding...Educationally, he learns more quickly through it than through an unfamiliar linguistic medium. 137 Committee on the Rights of the Child (2006).

Moreover, a comprehensive review paper (Dutcher, 1997)143 on the use of first and second languages in education examined the experience of Pacific Island countries like Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Vanatua and Western Samoa, where there are numerous mother tongues and the language of instruction at school is different from the mother tongues. Dutcher (1997, p.36) reported on the importance of the mother tongue in education in the following words: The most important conclusion from the research and experience reviewed in this paper is that when learning is the goal, including that of learning a second language, the child's first language (i.e. his or her mother tongue) should be used as the medium of instruction in the early years of schooling...The first language is essential for the initial teaching of reading, and for comprehension of subject matter. It is the necessary foundation for the cognitive development upon which acquisition of the second language is based. 4. Recommendation Given its colonial history, language in the Republic of Mauritius has its own specificity. Using more than one language in daily life is the normal practice for an average Mauritian. A large majority of Mauritians speak in Kreol. Languages like French and English are utilised mainly in formal contexts. Language plays an important role not only in communication, but also in the transfer of knowledge. Language and education are therefore closely linked. Education is a fundamental human right and it is the basis to acquire knowledge to promote an individual's mental, social and intellectual development. There is a growing body of evidence which links poor performance and total exclusion from education to the fact that the language used to teach at school is not the same as the language used at home. Sometimes, low performance in a subject could be more due to a lack of mastery of the child in a second language rather than their actual cognitive ability. Paradoxically, some students might outperform their classmates just by being good at memorising facts than by actually understanding the subject matter in a second language. In order to achieve high rates of literacy and language acquisition among a majority of students, relevant State and non-state actors could develop effective language policies in education, which takes into consideration the specific learning needs of children in relation to the language/s they use at home and at school. 142 UNESCO (2003).

Retrieved on 28 July 2018 from documents.worldbank.org/curated/ en/131161468770987263/pdf/multi-page.pdf353 Ombudsperson for ChildrenWithin the Mauritian context, I believe that the programme model of mother tongue-based bi/multilingual education (Ball, 2011)144 could be of relevance. This approach mainly involves the following two aspects: 1. The first language or mother tongue (e.g. Kreol) is used as the primary medium of instruction for the whole of primary school, while a second (or additional) language (e.g. English and/or French) is introduced as a subject of study in itself to prepare students for eventual transition to some academic subjects in the second (or additional) language. 2. After the second (or additional) language has been introduced, all chosen languages are media of instruction. Instruction in the mother tongue is maintained, often as a subject of study, to ensure ongoing support for children to become academically proficient in their first language. It is to be noted that the introduction of the second (or additional) language does not displace the mother tongue. This model might raise questions such as to what extent should the mother tongue be used as a medium of instruction, at which point would children be expected to begin learning a second (or additional) language, and when should children receive academic instruction in that second (or additional) language (Ball, 2011). Robust local research on these questions may help in elucidating the most suitable way forward to improve the educational experience of the children of the Republic of Mauritius. Finally, there is enough international evidence to suggest that a strong foundation in the mother tongue can help children develop appropriate cognitive and reasoning skills and strong literacy abilities from an early age, which can then be transferrable to learning additional languages. For instance, the use of Kreol as medium of instruction in primary education in the Republic of Mauritius can facilitate the acquisition of the English and French languages and enhance our children's overall linguistic and academic performance. 144 Ball, J.

The complaint John145, a 15-year-old boy, reported to his teachers at school that he was being physically and verbally abused by his father. His mother passed away some years ago and he had been living with his father since. The Rector of that school decided to take action, as per section 11 of the Child Protection Act 1994 on the 'Duty to report': Notwithstanding any other enactment, where a person exercising any medical or paramedical profession or a member of the staff of a school has reason to suspect that a child he is examining or who is frequenting the school, as the case may be, has been ill- treated, neglected, abandoned or otherwise exposed to harm, he shall immediately notify the Permanent Secretary. He referred the alleged case through a letter to the Child Development Unit (CDU) of the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare. In his letter, the Rector had requested the officers of the CDU to contact him before proceeding with the case since the matter was sensitive and John feared the aftermath. Nearly two months after the referral, John's father contacted the Rector asking for the release of his son from school to attend a convocation by the CDU. When the minor learnt this, he was afraid to go home because he did not want his father to know that he disclosed about the physical abuse. The Rector contacted the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) for advice because he did not know how to proceed. 2. The investigation 2.1 Rationale of the investigation As per section 5(a) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act (OCA) 2003, I, the Ombudsperson for Children, has to \"ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children are given full consideration by public bodies, private authorities, individuals and associations of individuals\". The OCA 2003 also provides me with the power to investigate into complaints made by any person or body who considers that an act done or omitted to be done or any decision made by any public or private authority have resulted in a violation of the rights of a child. I initiated an investigation based on section 6(f) of the OCA 2003 because I considered that, in this case, \"there is, has been or is likely to be, a violation of the rights of a child\". In the Rector's complaint about John's case, three potential violations caught my attention: 1. The CDU appeared to have failed to intervene promptly when an alleged case of physical and verbal abuse on a child was reported to them; 145 'John' is a pseudonym used to protect the identity of the child.355 Ombudsperson for Children2. When the CDU intervened, the father (the alleged perpetrator) was asked to bring his son (the victim) to the CDU; and 3. This situation seemed to have caused the minor to experience high anxiety levels and trauma, and he did not want to go home. 2.2 Conducting the investigation The OCO's investigation involved three phases. Firstly, bearing in mind the sensitive nature of the case, I decided to \"act as a mediator to resolve any dispute relating to the rights of the child\" , as per section 7(3)(a) of the OCA 2003. I convened the child and the father separately. A teacher of the school brought John to the OCO. John stated that when he told the teachers about the physical abuse, he did not really want to leave his father because he loves him. However, since his father was now aware that the CDU knew about the violence, he reported that he was afraid to go home and that he would instead prefer to go to a relative's place. One of John's relatives came to the OCO and took the minor to her place after I briefed her. The father was summoned to the OCO on the same day and I told him about the complaint against him. At first, he denied everything, but eventually admitted to slap his son when he gets angry and frustrated. I told him to let John live at a relative's place as a temporary measure. He was very reluctant at the beginning, but he ultimately agreed when I explained to him that, if this was not done, the CDU could take his children away. Secondly, regarding the complaint against the CDU, I convened the Officers who were involved in the case. They reported that they were overloaded with cases and there was a shortage of staff. I explained to them that, when dealing with cases of child abuse, there should be prompt investigation and proper follow up. I also deplored the fact that the CDU convened the alleged perpetrator together with the child victim. Thirdly, I initiated a case conference at my office. The people present were an investigator of the OCO, the Head of the CDU, Officers of the CDU involved in the case and the Rector of John's school. The case was discussed in details from multiple perspectives and it was concluded that: 1. The CDU will take over the case. 2. The Officers and the Psychologist of the CDU will talk with the perpetrator and the children separately. 3. The father and all his children require regular counselling and intensive therapy. 4. The best interests of the minors should be taken into consideration in any decision regarding them. 3. The outcome John and his father had separate sessions with the Officers and the Psychologist of the CDU. The father admitted to slapping the minors. He was proposed psychotherapy and parental counselling sessions, which he accepted. When assessed as safe to do so, John was returned to his father's place. A follow up with the John's school teachers revealed that he is faring well. Annual Report 2017 - 2018356Case 5: Potential abuse against inmates of the Correctional Youth Centre (Boys) 1. The alleged incident In April 2018, two inmates of the Correctional Youth Centre (CYC) for Boys were allegedly stripped naked and locked in solitary confinement. The matter was raised in the National Assembly by a member of parliament to whom an officer had furnished pictures of the incident. According to press articles reporting on the parliamentary statements published in a daily newspaper, it was stated that the two minors were forced to take off their clothes and to sleep naked in their respective cells. It was also said that they did not have any clothes with them and they were not provided with bed sheets to cover their mattresses. 2. The investigation In line with section 7(1) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, I opened an investigation on my own motion. Two investigators of the Ombudsperson for Children's Office (OCO) carried out a site visit to the CYC to enquire on the matter. They interviewed the Superintendent of Prisons responsible for the CYC, the Prison Welfare Officer and the two concerned minors. They gathered the following information: The investigators were informed that the two minors have mental health problems. Minor A (17 years) has a history of using synthetic drugs. He suffers from withdrawal symptoms. He laughs for no reason and speaks incoherently. He could not provide a sensible reply to the investigators. From the few words he said, it could be deduced that he has a sexualised behaviour. The staff reported that he usually strips naked when he feels hot. Minor B (15 years) tried to commit suicide some time back before this incident. He attempted to hang himself with his clothes. He was stopped by the prison officers present on that day and was admitted to the Brown Sequard Hospital (BSH). Minor B stated that, when he came back from BSH, he started to sleep naked on his bed. Minor B reported that a Prison Officer had asked him to remove his clothes, to lie on the bed and to wave at him. The latter then took a photograph of him naked. To prevent Minor B from attempting suicide again, he was provided with a T-shirt and his underwear only. There were no instructions given to keep Minor B naked in his cell. The National Preventive Mechanism Division of the National Human Rights Commission also enquired on this case. They shared a copy of their report with me. Many of our findings were similar, especially regarding the deplorable living conditions at the CYC. I have already elaborated on this aspect in a chapter on children living in detention centres in my office's Annual Report 2015-2016 (OCO, 2016, pp.119-129) 146. 146 Ombudsperson for Children's Office (2016). Annual Report 2015-2016. Mauritius: Author. Retrieved on 30 July 2018 from oco.govmu. org/English/Documents/Annual%20Reports/Ombudsperson_Annual_report.pdf357 Ombudsperson for ChildrenFurthermore, I carried out two visits to the CYC accompanied by the OCO's investigators. I met the Commissioner of Prisons and discussed the matter with him. Several inmates were also interviewed. They denied the allegations that the prison officers acted violently against Minors A and B. However, they said that they did not approve that an officer took pictures of the two minors naked. 3. The outcome Following the investigation, a report was submitted to the Honourable Prime Minister, the member of Parliament who raised the issue and other stakeholders directly related with the case. I expressed my deep concern about the distressing living conditions of children who are in conflict with the law, especially those who are detained in correctional youth centres. I also stated that I share the concerns of other relevant stakeholders such as the National Human Rights Commission, with whom my office works closely. I drew attention to the fact that, in the OCO's Annual Report 2015-2016, I presented a thorough assessment and discussion of our observations regarding children in conflict with the law based on national and international perspectives. I also made recommendations to the relevant ministries and stakeholders. For the present case, I expressed my preoccupations on the fact that an officer took indecent photographs of two inmates and distributed it to another person. I highlighted that the Child Protection Act 1994 clearly stipulates in section 15(1) that: Any person who -(a) takes or permits to be taken or to make, any indecent photograph or pseudo- photograph of a child; (b) distributes or shows such indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph; (c) has in his possession such indecent photograph or pseudo-photographs, with a view to it being distributed or shown by himself or any other person ; or (d) publishes or causes to be published any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that the advertiser distributes or shows such indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph, or intends to do so, shall commit an offence. I considered that, even if the officer at the CYC might have taken this indecent photograph for whistleblowing about potential abuse against the children, the primary intention of the officer cannot be determined until a full investigation by the relevant authorities is carried out. However, the fact that the officer took the photographs and distributed them is already an offence according to sections 15(1)(a) and (b) of the aforementioned act. I also informed the Honourable Prime Minister and the other persons concerned with this case about the outcome of my investigation. I wrote that, according to the information gathered Annual Report 2017 - 2018358from other inmates, the two minors have often been observed to remove their clothes on their own volition. I explained that the need for nudity can sometimes be attributed to highly sexualised behaviours, which can themselves originate from difficult childhood experiences and deep-seated mental health issues. These psychological difficulties are rarely assessed and addressed among children in conflict with the law at the CYC. Moreover, I stressed that children at the CYC must receive intensive therapy as part of a holistic and individualised rehabilitation plan. The archaic system of detention should be reviewed. I recommended that the State should work in collaboration with non-governmental organisations such as Open Mind, which are specialised in the domain of mental health and rehabilitation of children and young people. 4. Post-reporting follow-up Several follow-up visits to the CYC were carried out after producing the report. I organised a one-day workshop with some representatives of Prison Officers working at the CYC to help them reflect on the way that our children who are in conflict with the law and deprived of their liberty are being rehabilitated. They were invited to ponder on the following: Their description of the CYC. Their dream for a better CYC. How can they contribute to make this dream a reality? How would they feel if their child was sent to the CYC? I then organised a second workshop, but this time for both officers and children. The aim was to provide the opportunity to children to express themselves and for the officers to develop empathy towards the inmates. Illustrations of these workshops are provided in chapter 9 of the current Annual Report. To conclude, I reiterate the recommendation made in my office's Annual Report 2015-2016 (OCO, 2016, pp.137-140), which regards moving from the present repressive approach to a more restorative solution for the rehabilitation of children and young people in conflict with the law. I suggest that this could be done through the establishment of small therapeutic units, which can narrow the current gap in providing individualised treatment and intensive therapy to these children. 359 Ombudsperson for ChildrenCase 6: The impact of major infrastructural changes on children 1. Background The 'Metro Express' is a major project being carried out, which aims at modernising and redefining the public transport system in Mauritius. It will bring infrastructural changes in the landscape of the country and, at the same time, it can improve the quality of life of all citizens, including children. However, the beginnings of the project gave rise to some street protests by inhabitants at Residence Barkly, Beau Bassin. The inhabitants were protesting against the partial demolition of their houses or walls to make way for the metro line. It should be noted that the demolition of the houses was made in the presence of armed Special Mobile Force (SMF) Officers and Police Officers. 2. The complaint Three mothers accompanied by a social worker complained to me that they do not know where they will go to live with the construction of a rail track for the metro just in front of their houses. They stated that the authorities informed them that the street in front of their houses will be converted into a rail track. The mothers believed that these works will affect the health and everyday life of their children. They felt that their children's security was at stake for reasons such as: The construction works were being carried out just a few metres from their houses and children could be exposed to potential hazards and get hurt. Their yards would be ending directly on the rail track, which can be dangerous for children playing in that area, or this can even give way to intruders entering their premises. 3. The investigation 3.1 Rationale of the investigation I opened an investigation pursuant to section 5(a) of the Ombudsperson for Children Act 2003, which states that I shall \"ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children are given full consideration by public bodies, private authorities, individuals and associations of individuals\" , and section 6(f) of the same Act, which reads that I \"shall investigate complaints made by a child, or any other person, in relation to the rights of any child\".Annual Report 2017 - 20183603.2 Conducting the investigation 3.2.1) Field visit Figure 4. Field visit at Residence Barkly I carried out a field visit with two investigators at Residence Barkly to get a better understanding of the problem. We met the three complainants and gathered the following information: Four families and 13 children were concerned with the complaint. With the 'Metro Express' Project, they reported that their front gate would be pulled down and that part of their front yard would be excavated to give way to the bus lane parallel to the metro line. In one house, seven stairs of their staircase would be pulled down. The problem with these families was that they did not build their front walls and gates as per building regulations. They were illegally occupying around four feet of State land in front of their houses. Therefore, the parts that would be pulled down are on State-owned land. The families added that the security of their children would be at stake because the bus lane would be located very close to their houses. The four families advanced that they were not invited to any consultation with authorities prior to the pulling down of part of their premises. All of them reported that no information was given to them on steps which will be taken by the authorities to compensate them for the disruptions in their daily life. Children reported being affected in their schooling. One child who will be taking part in the School Certificate Examination next October reported that the demolition work and the related incidents disturbed him in his studies. 361 Ombudsperson for Children3.2.2) Listening to children's voices I invited the 13 children concerned to my office to listen to their grievances. Mr Bawamia, Investigator, and a Psychologist were also present. After a brief introduction, the OC invited the children to express themselves on the situation. Some of their main statements in Mauritian Creole were: \"Leker ti pe The children were given a sheet of paper and were requested to express themselves about what they saw or felt through a drawing. Some of the drawings are presented below along with the explanations given by the children. \"Ti ena bokou lapolis, lapolis kraz nou lakaz.\" The children appeared to have suffered trauma from these incidents. Many of them saw the demolition works on their way back home from school. They were surprised to see so many policemen and armed SMF officers. They witnessed their parents being bullied by these officers. As a result, they seemed to have developed a negative perception of the police force - that of a repressive body which does a lot of harm to people like threatening and pulling Annual Report 2017 - 2018362down their houses. They expressed being very angry towards the police. Mr Bawamia and the Psychologist had to explain to them in a child-friendly manner the importance of the police in ensuring people's security and maintaining law and order in the society. Many children also showed sympathy for their friends whose walls and houses have been demolished. They were also concerned about losing their playgrounds. 3.3 Analysis It is suggested that some articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations, 1989), as described below, were potentially not considered while designing the 'Metro Express' Project and when deciding the actions taken to clear the way for the metro line. Article 3(1): \"In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\" I believe that the use of force by the authorities against parents in the presence of their children was not in the best interests of the children. The witnessing of these events can have lifelong negative consequences on their mental states and behaviours. Other non-violent methods such as dialogue and mediation could have been used instead. Article 12: \"States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law.\" According to the information gathered by my office, at no time were these children given the opportunity to express themselves freely before the implementation of this major infrastructural project which would certainly impact on their future both in the short and long term. Article 17: \"States parties...shall ensure that the child has access to information...\" However, in this case, the children were not informed and psychologically prepared beforehand about what will happen to their houses and playgrounds among others. Consequently, they experienced anxiety and fear, as expressed in their drawings. Article 19(1): \"States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence...\"363 Ombudsperson for Children The presence of armed police and SMF officers, army vehicles and bulldozers surely affected the children's mental well-being. The fact that they saw their parents being bullied by these officers also affected them psychologically. Their drawings clearly depicted their troubled state of mind. I am in favour of participatory democracy when national projects of such a scale is concerned. I believe that, if there had been public consultations, including consultations with children, before the start of the project, these incidents could have been avoided. Spreading well- defined and adapted information on the advantages of this modern means of transport and the benefits of being future users of the metro to a maximum of inhabitants, especially those who live in the surrounding areas of the rail track, could have lessened their anxiety on the impact of this project on them. With regards to children, activities could have been organised at the school level to help them understand this new transport system in their country. 4. The outcome I contacted the authorities concerned and was informed that an infrastructure for leisure and sports for children and young people of the locality will be considered in the implementation of the 'Metro Express' Project. It is important to note that the families of Residence Barkly are not against the introduction of the metro as a means of transport. It seemed that there was a lack of communication between the authorities and the inhabitants in this case. They rather wanted to be heard by the authorities. They had to be reassured of the security of their children. It is important that all relevant stakeholders collaborate to listen to the concerns of the population, psychologically prepare them to major infrastructural changes and to ensure that the rights of children are respected.

Mo Day 20 November 2017The United Nations Universal Children's Day, which was established in 1954, is celebrated on November 20 each year to promote togetherness internationally and awareness amongst children worldwide. November 20 is also the date when the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. The Ombudsperson for Children strongly believes that the Universal Children's Day is one that holds major significance - it should be actively celebrated, and children ought to be put to the forefront. For the year 2017, the OC marked the Universal Children's Day with three main activities, namely: i) a sensitisation poster in 5-Plus newspaper; ii) a sensitisation letter on the Rights of the Child addressed to the public and private bodies; and iii) a bus outing on the theme \"Mieux conna\u00eetre ses droits en se promenant dans le Bus de l' Amiti\u00e9\" with 15 young ambassadors of the OC and 14 children from Residence Barkly. The ambassadors of the OC were students from SSS, \u00c9b\u00e8ne SSS and Raynal The OCO conceptualised a sensitisation poster which illustrated the stakeholders that are involved in the protection of children's rights. The poster was published in 5-Plus Newspaper on 19 November 2017. It underscored the collective effort and collaboration that are required from both the public and private bodies as well as citizens in order to protect the rights of children. The OC also prepared and designed a sensitisation letter with the aim of raising awareness of child rights within both the public and private sectors. \"Individually, we are one drop.

Am\u00e9liorer to Children's FOR CHILDREN'S OFFICE Annual Report 2017 - 2018412 Adults' views gathered during different consultations Sex Education The Children's Bill should make it mandatory that sex education is included in the curriculum as from primary school and taught on a regular basis so that children understand the consequences of choosing to be sexually active at an early age. Handling of sexual assault cases involving children by the mediaThe act of broadcasting personal information of a child victim should be criminalised with fines or even imprisonment. Strict limits should be drawn for the media. Rehabilitation of children in conflict with the law Children should not be subject to any form of abusive punishment, corporal or otherwise only rehabilitation should be encouraged, especially by legislators. The latter should adopt a child-friendly approach, having the best interest of the child at heart when devising legislative measures. The only aim of the RYC or CYC must be to reintegrate the children in society as a relatively balanced individual. Being the future of the country, children should be provided with support and skills to make them responsible citizens. Juvenile justice system Legislators must create a Juvenile Justice System in parallel to the existing Criminal Justice System but reserve it for cases involving children. The new system would be more adapted to children in the sense that it would not only involve the judiciary, but also psychologists, psychiatrists and any other stakeholders that would allow the judiciary to come to a decision in a fair manner. Video recordings of children's declarations/ statements should be admissible in court. Age of criminal responsibility The age of criminal responsibility should not be set at an early age as children may not be mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions. It is proposed that the age of criminal responsibility should not be set below 14 years.Activities related to the Children's Bill413 Ombudsperson for ChildrenChildren and adults' views isi, enn kout laba, mo gagn ner.

It shall be punished by penal servitude for a term not exceeding thirty years when it was committed by a legitimate, natural or adoptive ascendant or by any other person having authority from law or of fact over the victim or when it was committed by a person abusing the authority conferred by his position (new section 250 B (1) and (2)); *Sexual acts committed without violence, constraint, threat or surprise on a minor aged over sixteen and not emancipated by marriage shall be punished by penal servitude for a term not exceeding twenty years where they are committed by a legitimate, natural or adoptive ascendant or by any other person having authority from law or of fact over the victim or where they are committed by a person abusing the authority conferred by his functions (new section 250 B (3)); *Taking, recording or transmitting a picture or representation of a minor with a view to circulating it, where that image or representation has a pornographic character, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and a fine not exceeding 75,000 Rupees. When the image or representation involves a minor under sixteen, acts would be punishable even if they were not committed in view of the dissemination of this image or representation (new section 250 C)); and *When the minor is a victim, it constitutes, in respect of certain offences, an aggravating circumstance: procuring prostitutes (new S. 253), sexual harassment (new S. 254), moral harassment (new section 255), exploitation of begging (new S. 196), manslaughter (new S.223(1)), torture and acts of barbarity (new section 223 A), acts of violence (new S. 228), rape (new section 250 (2)). 159. Some further changes can be envisaged, and the comparative analysis which has been made can be of some inspiration, such as: Making bullying at school an offence, as is provided by section 89 of the UK Education and Inspections Act 2006; Making \"hazing\" (\"bizutage\") a crime, as it is in France (article 225-16-2 of the French Penal Code);Annual Report 2017 - 2018458 Creating a new offence of causing or allowing the death of a child, as is the case under the UK Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004; *Making provision so that persons who commit sex offences against children abroad can face prosecution in Mauritius, even if that offence is not illegal in the foreign country in which it was committed, as it is the case with the UK Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and section 144A of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961; Making it a crime, as is provided by section 219 of the Canadian Criminal Code, to fail to seek medical assistance for a child; Making it a crime for someone to cause the death of any child that has not become a human being in such a manner that he would have been guilty of murder if the child had become a human being [Presently, according to French doctrine and jurisprudence (Crim. 25 juin 2002112), there cannot be voluntary or involuntary homicide on a child not yet born. This is not the case in New Zealand (section 182 (1) of the Crimes Act, regarding the \"Killing unborn child\")]; *Making sexual grooming an offence, as is the case in South Africa (S. 18 (1) Criminal Law (sexual offences and related matters) amendment Act); *Making it an offence to compel or cause a child to witness a sexual offence (S. 21 (1) Criminal Law (sexual offences and related matters) amendment Act - South Africa); Affording greater protection to children with disabilities, as is required by article 23 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; and Making it an offence for a person who has care and control of a child to leave a child unattended and unsupervised either in a motor vehicle, as is the case in New South Wales (S231 Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998).459 Ombudsperson for ChildrenAppendix C: List of attendees at the OCO's consultative meetings In Mauritius: S/N Name Designation Organisation 1.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT works with our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. CBT therapists understand that by changing the way we think and act in the here-and-now, we can affect the way we feel. CBT can also be applied longitudinally to explore the origin of beliefs, rules and assumptions which shape an individual's world-view: this knowledge can then be used to drive change in the present. 2. Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT): CFT involves the use of approaches intended to bolster self-compassion. It is an effective treatment for shame and self-criticism. 3. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): EMDR is a therapeutic approach developed by Francine Shapiro. Originally EMDR was used for processing traumatic memories in PTSD, and this is the application for which is supported by most evidence. There is increasing evidence that it can also be applied helpfully in other conditions where intrusive memories are problematic. 4. Behavioural activation: It is an effective treatment for overcoming depression by increasing one's level of activity. There is evidence to suggest that the more people do, and the more pleasant activities they get involved in, the better they feel. This treatment will consist of helping patients schedule and undertake activities, work through challenging activities and build their motivation and a sense of mastery in their lives. 5. Narrative therapy: This form of therapy places people as experts in their own lives and views problems as separate from individuals. It is a way of helping patients reconstruct the stories of their lives in a respectful and non-blaming manner by acknowledging their difficulties along with emphasising their skills, abilities, beliefs and values. This can support patients to minimise the influence of problems in their lives. Sources: Psychology Tools (2018).

Bad housing is linked to debilitating and even fatal, illnesses and accidents. 1. Children in overcrowded housing are up to 10 times more likely to contract meningitis than children in general. Meningitis can be life threatening. Long-term effects of the disease include deafness, blindness and behavioural problems. 2. There is a direct link between childhood tuberculosis (TB) and overcrowding. TB can lead to serious medical problems and is sometimes fatal. 3. Children living in overcrowded and unfit conditions are more likely to experience respiratory problems such as coughing and asthmatic wheezing. For many children this means losing sleep, restricted physical activity, and missing school. 4. Overcrowded conditions have been linked to slow growth in childhood, which is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in later life. 5. Almost half of all childhood accidents are associated with physical conditions in the home. Families living in properties that are in poor physical condition are more likely to experience a domestic fire. On mental health Homeless children are three to four times more likely to have mental health problems than other children. Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression have also been linked to overcrowded and unfit housing. On education Bad housing affects children's ability to learn at school and study at home. 1. Homeless children are two to three times more likely to be absent from school than other children due to the disruption caused by moving into and between temporary accommodation. 2. Children in unfit and overcrowded homes miss school more frequently due to illnesses and infections.465 Ombudsperson for Children3. Overcrowding is linked to delayed cognitive development, and homelessness to delayed development in communication skills. 4. Homeless children are more likely to have behavioural problems such as aggression, hyperactivity and impulsivity, factors that compromise academic achievement and relationships with peers and teachers. It is unsurprising that homeless children have lower levels of academic achievement that cannot be explained by differences in their levels of ability. On opportunities in adulthood The lower educational attainment and health problems associated with bad housing in childhood impact on opportunities in adulthood. 1. Long-term health problems and low educational attainment increase the likelihood of unemployment or working in low-paid jobs. 2. Opportunities for leisure and recreation are undermined by low income and health problems. 3. The behavioural problems associated with bad housing in childhood can manifest themselves in later offending behaviour. In one study, nearly half of young people who had offended had experienced homelessness. Annual Report 2017 - 2018466Appendix G: Recommendations made by the Global Breastfeeding Collective (2017) Led by UNICEF and WHO, the Global Breastfeeding Collective calls for the immediate scaling up of financing and implementation of policies, programs, and interventions to better enable mothers to give their children the strongest start to life. Specifically, the Global Breastfeeding Collective calls on country governments, donors, and development partners to: 1. Increase funding to raise breastfeeding rates from birth through two years. At least $5.7 billion in additional funding is required by 2025 to ensure that 50 percent of the world's children are exclusively breastfed. 2. Fully implement the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and relevant World Health Assembly resolutions through strong legal measures that are enforced and independently monitored by organizations free from conflicts of interest. 3. Enact paid family leave and workplace breastfeeding policies , building on the International Labour Organization's maternity protection guidelines as a minimum requirement, including provisions for the informal sector. 4. Implement the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding 147 in maternity facilities, including providing breastmilk for sick and vulnerable new-borns. 5. Improve access to skilled breastfeeding counselling as part of comprehensive breastfeeding policies and programs in health facilities. 6. Strengthen links between health facilities and communities, and encourage community networks that protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. 7. Strengthen monitoring systems that track the progress of policies, programs, and funding towards achieving both national and global breastfeeding targets. 147 Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding: Every facility providing maternity services and care for new-born infants should: 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within half an hour of birth. 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed, and how to maintain lactation even if they should be separated from their infants. 6. Give new-born infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practise rooming-in - that is, allow mothers and infants to remain together - 24 hours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no artificial teats or pacifiers (also called dummies or soothers) to breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic.
