The crystal stone sounds quite groovy, but it's actually just an inorganic salt called potassium alum. What is potassium alum? Potassium alum, also known as potash alum, is a substance made from a type of natural inorganic salt that has many uses. It is commonly used to purify water, make leather, and even in baking powder. Potassium alum is also found in some deodorants and aftershave treatments because of its antiseptic properties. It is considered safe by the FDA and has been used for centuries all over the world. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_alum) What is a Crystal Deodorant Stone? A crystal deodorant stone is a solid, mineral-based product that is used as an alternative to traditional deodorants. It is made from a natural mineral called potassium alum or ammonium alum. This mineral has natural antibacterial properties that can help to kill odor-causing bacteria on the skin. It doesn't look like the picture below, but thought it was a kind of nice image to go with the mystery that sometimes surrounds these kinds of crystal deodorants. How Does a Crystal Deodorant Stone Work? When you use a crystal deodorant stone, you wet it with water and then apply it to your underarms. The moisture from the water activates the mineral salts in the stone, creating a thin layer of salt on the skin's surface. This salt layer helps to inhibit the growth of odor-causing bacteria, which is what leads to body odor. I have used these stones on a few occasions and found that they perform fairly well for a short period of time. I was never quite sure though that I got enough of the product on as it is really like rubbing a smooth stone on your pit and doesn't have the feedback of a traditional deodorant. Benefits of Using a Crystal Deodorant Stone There are several benefits to using a crystal deodorant stone, including: 1. All-Natural Ingredients One of the main benefits of using a crystal deodorant stone is that it is made from all-natural ingredients. This means that it is free from harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin. Gaia Guy did have a baking soda based natural deodorant before and may launch that again in the future. However, since creating what seems to be [a natural deodorant that actually works](https://www.gaiaguy.com/products/natural-herbal-deodorant-powder-reduce-sweating-and-eliminate-body-odor-underarm-and-foot-deodorizer-talc-free-plastic-free-zero-waste-deodorant) this is the focus for our small [online plastic-free shop](https://www.gaiaguy.com/). 2. Long-Lasting Protection Again this may depend on many factors. The climate you live in and how active you are. However, crystal deodorant stones generally provide long-lasting protection against body odor. Personally, I have found that Gaia Guy's powder version of a crystal deodorant stone does provide all day protection against body odor and just a fingertip size of powder is all that is needed. 3. Cost-Effective Crystal deodorant stones are often more cost-effective than traditional deodorants. While the initial cost of the stone may be higher, it can last for several months, making it a more economical choice in the long run. As mentioned above you really just need a fingertip sized amount of Gaia Guy's natural deodorant so even if you happen to spill a bit here and there it is still very cost effective. We are sure to fill the glass jar as full as we can so be mindful when opening it, but don't sweat it too much. Is that a pun? 4. Environmentally Friendly (sometimes) Crystal deodorant stones are also environmentally friendly. They are typically sold in [plastic-free packaging](https://www.gaiaguy.com/collections/all/zero-waste), and since they are made from natural mineral salts, they don't contribute to environmental pollution. Most of the ones on amazon do come with plastic package so stay clear of those. Gaia Guy opted for a reusable glass jar. It can be recycled and of course reused over and over again. How to Use a Crystal Deodorant Stone Using a crystal deodorant stone is easy. Here's how to do it: - Wet the stone with water. - Apply it to your underarms. - Rinse the stone with water and let it dry. Potential Drawbacks While crystal deodorant stones are generally safe and effective, there are some potential drawbacks to consider. 1. Some People May Be Allergic Some people may be allergic to the mineral salts in crystal deodorant stones. If you experience any itching, redness, or irritation after using a crystal deodorant stone, you should stop using it immediately. 2. Doesn't Work for Everyone Crystal deodorant stones may not work for everyone. Some people may find that they need to reapply the stone throughout the day to control body odor. You may find that there is also an [armpit detox period time](https://www.gaiaguy.com/blogs/news/why-natural-deodorant-doesnt-work-for-me-is-there-a-solution). 3. Doesn't Stop Sweating As Well As Aluminum Antiperspirants Crystal deodorant stones are not antiperspirants at least in the eyes of the FDA. Potassium alum can help to reduce body odor by inhibiting the growth of bacteria responsible for causing it. However, the US FDA no longer recognizes it as a wetness reducer, so it may not be as effective in reducing sweating as some other antiperspirants. Nonetheless, it is still commonly used as a deodorant in many countries. They won't stop you from sweating, but they will help to control body odor. Gaia Guy's deodorant powder does contain other herbs that have properties that do help to reduce sweating and reducing body odor. Crystal Deodorant Stones: Why Gaia Guy's Version Stands Out While many brands offer crystal deodorant stones, Gaia Guy's version stands out for its unique blend of natural herbs and its powder form. Gaia Guy's crystal deodorant powder contains the same natural mineral salts found in traditional crystal deodorant stones, but it also includes a blend of herbs like rosemary, frankincense, betle leaf, and clove leaf. These herbs not only provide a pleasant scent but also have natural antibacterial properties that help to further combat body odor. One of the benefits of Gaia Guy's crystal deodorant powder is its convenient powder form. Unlike traditional crystal deodorant stones, which can leave you wondering if you've put any on at all.
