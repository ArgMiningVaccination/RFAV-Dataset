Meet the Staff Alaina Gallegos Facilitator OHI community member since 2015 \"I found a true calling working at OHI after an unfulfilling career in International Development and Public Health. When you change your diet, your mind, and align with spirit, transformation truly takes place. It is an honor to hold space for our guests who are courageous enough to do the work it takes to heal and become whole again. This is so much more than just a job; it is a life purpose.\" Jennifer Inman Facilitator OHI community member since 2019 \"Life is happening in and around us and god is in everything, therefore healing potential is everywhere. Our awareness of this gets so obscured through our routines, distractions and stresses resulting in imbalance and dis-ease. But our bodies are marvelous machines that are constantly repairing themselves; and given an optimal environment, they do this with ease. OHI is a sacred place for people to reconnect to their awareness of the miracle of life through powerful food and faith; and healing is rapid. Working here and witnessing miraculous transformations day after day is medicine for me as well as for all the friends who come here and power up.\" Grace Wong Facilitator OHI community member since 2013 \"I feel honored to be a part of the OHI community...extending support and encouragement to our guests who begin to transform their health and well-being the moment they arrive here. So much of it has to do with the power of community. It's true that we can do more than we think we can by doing it together. Fellow guests seem to bond quickly...encouraging and inspiring each other. This truly is a blessed place to work!\" Carla Boeck Facilitator OHI community member since 2015 \"Working at OHI has opened my eyes more to the wholeness of healing beyond just a clean diet. I have met some incredible people since working here and love knowing that all of our team's efforts help heal our guests. Even after receiving my bachelor's degree in Food and Nutrition, I've gained so much knowledge here at OHI about how a raw diet heals the mind, body and spirit.\" Guillermo Romero Director of Guest Services OHI community member since 2013 \"When I first started working at OHI, I didn't realize what I truly signed up for. It didn't take long for me to see the significant difference that OHI makes in peoples' lives. I see that now and want to be a part of it. The connection between the guests and the staff is like a family. I'm so blessed to be part of this wonderful atmosphere. To work here is very fulfilling and rewarding.\" Eryn Shropshire Kitchen Manager OHI community member since 2016 \"There are so many things I love about working at OHI. Personally, I love developing a unique connection with each guest to make sure they have the best experience at OHI. Our OHI family strives to exceed guest expectations on all levels and that resonates with my spirit. Being of service to our guests, experiencing their transformations every week, while creating whole and delicious food. I couldn't have asked for anything more rewarding.\" OHI San Diego Campus 6970 Central Avenue Lemon Grove, CA 91945 [(800) 588-0809](tel:800-588-0809) Our 6 acre campus is nestled in a residential neighborhood in Lemon Grove, CA - a nearby suburb of San Diego.
