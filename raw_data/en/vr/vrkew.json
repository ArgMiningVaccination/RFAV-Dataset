Its resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs and ability to spread and resist decontamination in healthcare settings make it especially dangerous. We screened 1,990 clinically approved and late-stage investigational compounds for the potential to be repurposed as antifungal drugs targeting C. auris and narrowed our focus to five Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds with inhibitory concentrations under 10 \u00b5M for C. auris and significantly lower toxicity to three human cell lines. These compounds, some of which had been previously identified in independent screens, include three dihalogenated 8-hydroxyquinolines: broxyquinoline, chloroxine, and clioquinol. A subsequent structure-activity study 32 quinoline derivatives found that 8-hydroxyquinolines, especially those dihalogenated at the C5 and C7 positions, were the most effective inhibitors of C. auris. To pursue these compounds further, we exposed C. auris to clioquinol in an extended experimental evolution study and found that C. auris developed only twofold to fivefold resistance to the compound. DNA sequencing of resistant strains and subsequent verification by directed mutation in naive strains revealed that resistance was due to mutations in the transcriptional regulator CAP1 (causing upregulation of the drug transporter MDR1) and in the drug transporter CDR1. These mutations had only modest effects on resistance to traditional antifungal agents, and the CDR1 mutation rendered C. auris more susceptible to posaconazole. This observation raises the possibility that a combination treatment involving an 8-hydroxyquinoline and posaconazole might prevent C. auris from developing resistance to this established antifungal agent. IMPORTANCE The rapidly emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris represents a growing threat to hospitalized patients, in part due to frequent resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs. We identify a class of compounds, the dihalogenated 8-hydroxyquinolines, with broad fungistatic ability against a diverse collection of 13 strains of C. auris. Although this compound has been identified in previous screens, we extended the analysis by showing that C. auris developed only modest twofold to fivefold increases in resistance to this class of compounds despite long-term exposure; a noticeable difference from the 30- to 500-fold increases in resistance reported for similar studies with commonly used antifungal drugs. We also identify the mutations underlying the resistance. These results suggest that the dihalogenated 8-hydroxyquinolines are working inside the fungal cell and should be developed further to combat C. auris and other fungal pathogens. Lohse and colleagues characterize a class of compounds that inhibit the fungal pathogen C. auris. Unlike many other antifungal drugs, C. auris does not readily develop resistance to a diversity of microbes that can shape host ecology and diversity by providing essential biological and adaptive services. For most insect groups, the evolutionary implications of host-microbe interactions remain poorly understood. Geographically discrete areas with high biodiversity offer powerful, simplified model systems to better understand insect-microbe interactions. Hawaii boasts a diverse endemic insect fauna (~6000 species) characterized by spectacular adaptive radiations. Despite this, little is known about the role of bacteria in shaping this diversity. To address this knowledge gap, we inaugurate the Native Hawaiian Insect Microbiome Initiative (NHIMI). The NHIMI is an effort intended to develop a framework for informing evolutionary and biological studies in Hawaii. To initiate this effort, we have sequenced the bacterial microbiomes of thirteen species representing iconic, endemic Hawaiian insect groups. Our results show that native Hawaiian insects associate with a diversity of bacteria that exhibit a wide phylogenetic breadth. Several groups show predictable associations with obligate microbes that permit diet specialization. Others exhibit unique ecological transitions that are correlated with shifts in their microbiomes (e.g., transition to carrion feeding from plant-feeding in Nysius wekiuicola). Finally, some groups, such as the Hawaiian Drosophila, have relatively diverse microbiomes with a conserved core of bacterial taxa across multiple species and islands.Hawaiian insectsWolbachiainsect-microbe interactionsmicrobial ecologymicrobiomesymbiosisapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/50q4856tarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6fz2v7rr2023-09-10T00:38:12Zqt6fz2v7rrA Monte Carlo has long been a challenging task in generalizability theory. This is a serious practical problem because generalizability coefficients are often computed from designs where some facets have small sample sizes, and researchers have little guide regarding the trustworthiness of the coefficients. As generalizability theory can be framed to a linear mixed-effect model (LMM), bootstrap and simulation techniques from LMM paradigm can be used to construct the confidence intervals. The purpose of this research is to examine four different LMM-based methods for computing the confidence intervals that have been proposed and to determine their accuracy under six simulated conditions based on the type of test scores (normal, dichotomous, and polytomous data) and data measurement design (p\u00d7i\u00d7r and p\u00d7 [i:r]). A bootstrap technique called parametric methods with spherical random effects consistently produced more accurate confidence intervals than the three other LMM-based methods. Furthermore, the selected technique was compared with model-based approach to investigate the performance at the levels of variance components via the second simulation study, where the numbers of examines, raters, and items were varied. We conclude with the recommendation generalizability coefficients, the confidence interval should accompany the point of science and developing predictive models to capture its evolution are instrumental for the design of policies that can improve the scientific enterprise-for example, through enhanced career paths for scientists, better performance evaluation for organizations hosting research, discovery of novel effective funding vehicles, and even identification of promising regions along the scientific frontier. The science of science uses large-scale data on the production of science to search for universal and domain-specific patterns. Here, we review recent developments in this transdisciplinary field.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/51s2h05karticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4tp260g92023-09-09T21:02:04Zqt4tp260g9Quantifying the negative impact of brain drain on the integration of European science.Doria Arrieta, OmarPammolli, FabioPetersen, Alexander2017-04-01The 2004/2007 European Union (EU) enlargement by 12 member states offers a unique opportunity to quantify the impact of EU efforts to expand and integrate the scientific competitiveness of the European Research Area (ERA). We apply two causal estimation schemes to cross-border collaboration data extracted from millions of academic publications from 1996 to 2012, which are disaggregated across 14 subject areas and 32 European countries. Our results illustrate the unintended consequences following the 2004/2007 enlargement, namely, its negative impact on cross-border collaboration in science. First, we use the synthetic control method to show that levels of European cross-border collaboration would have been higher without EU enlargement, despite the 2004/2007 EU entrants gaining access to EU resources incentivizing cross-border integration. Second, we implement a difference-in-difference panel regression, incorporating official intra-European high-skilled mobility statistics, to identify migration imbalance-principally from entrant to incumbent EU member states-as a major factor underlying the divergence in cross-border integration between Western and Eastern Europe. These results challenge central tenets underlying ERA integration policies that unifying labor markets will increase the international competitiveness of the ERA, thereby calling attention to the need for effective home-return incentives and rhythms. A protein fold switch joins the circadian oscillator to the relentless cycles of day and night, because they evolved timekeeping systems called circadian clocks, which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. The clock of cyanobacteria is driven by a three-protein oscillator composed of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation. We show that KaiB flips between two distinct three-dimensional folds, and its rare transition to an active state provides a time delay that is required to match the timing of the oscillator to that of Earths rotation. Once KaiB switches folds, it binds phosphorylated KaiC and captures KaiA, which initiates a phase transition of the circadian cycle, and it regulates components of the clock-output pathway, which provides the link that joins the timekeeping and signaling functions of the oscillator.Bacterial ProteinsCircadian RhythmCircadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and ProteinsPhosphorylationProtein FoldingProtein StructureSecondarySynechococcusapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1d4712bbarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9j34c10c2023-09-09T15:52:25Zqt9j34c10cIdentification and characterization among the most important classes of gene regulatory proteins, controlling changes in transcription that underlie many aspects of biology. In this work, we identify a transcriptional regulator from the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans that binds DNA specifically but has no detectable homology with any previously described DNA- or RNA-binding protein. This protein, named White-Opaque Regulator 3 (Wor3), regulates white-opaque switching, the ability of C. albicans to switch between two heritable cell types. We demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of WOR3 results in mass conversion of white cells to opaque cells and that deletion of WOR3 affects the stability of opaque cells at physiological temperatures. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation of Wor3 and gene expression profiling of a wor3 deletion mutant strain indicate that Wor3 is highly integrated into the previously described circuit regulating white-opaque switching and that it controls a subset of the opaque transcriptional program. We show by biochemical, genetic, and microfluidic experiments that Wor3 binds directly to DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and we identify the set of cis-regulatory sequences recognized by Wor3. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that the Wor3 family arose more recently in evolutionary time than most previously described DNA-binding domains; it is restricted to a small number of fungi that include the major fungal pathogens of humans. These observations show that new families of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins may be restricted to small clades and suggest that current annotations--which rely on deep conservation--underestimate the fraction of two phenotypic cell types, termed white and opaque. Both cell types are heritable for many generations, and the switch between the two types occurs epigenetically, that is, without a change in the primary DNA sequence of the genome. Previous work identified six key transcriptional and Ahr1. work, we describe the structure of the transcriptional network that specifies the white and opaque cell types and governs the ability to switch between them. In particular, we use a combination of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, gene expression profiling, and microfluidics-based DNA binding experiments to determine the direct and indirect regulatory interactions that form the switch network. The six regulators are arranged together in a complex, interlocking network with many seemingly redundant and overlapping connections. We propose that the structure (or topology) of this network is responsible for the epigenetic maintenance of the white and opaque states, the switching between them, and the specialized properties of each state.Candida albicansChromatin ImmunoprecipitationDNAFungalEpigenesisGeneticGene Expression ProfilingGene Regulatory NetworksHumansMicrofluidicsModelsBiologicalPhenotypeProtein Bindingapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9740z2v9articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt07d0087x2023-09-06T14:39:10Zqt07d0087xMeasurement of the differential tt\u00af production cross section as a function of the jet mass and extraction of the top quark mass in hadronic measurement of the distribution in hadronic decays of Lorentz-boosted top quarks is presented. The measurement is performed in the lepton + jets channel of top quark pair production (tt\u00af) events, where the lepton is an electron or muon. The products of the hadronic top quark decay are reconstructed using a single large-radius jet with transverse momentum greater than 400GeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138fb-1. The differential tt\u00af production cross section as a function of the jet mass is unfolded to the particle level and is used to extract the top quark mass. The jet mass scale is calibrated using the hadronic W boson decay within the large-radius jet. The uncertainties in the modelling of the final state radiation are reduced by studying angular correlations in the jet substructure. These developments lead to a significant increase in precision, and a top quark mass of 173.06\u00b10.84GeV.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/07d0087xarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt87d8v7gj2023-09-04T01:49:46Zqt87d8v7gjA Historical Atlas of TibetRyavec, Karl2015-01-01Maps only from \"A Historical Atlas of Tibet\".

The observable, derived from angular measurements of the leptons and highly correlated with pT(), is used to probe the low-pT() region in a complementary way. Dilepton masses up to 1TeV are investigated. Additionally, a measurement is performed requiring at least one jet in the final state. To benefit from partial cancellation of the systematic uncertainty, the ratios of the differential cross sections for various m ranges to those in the Z mass peak interval are presented. The collected data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.3fb-1 of proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV.

Like most biological assays, the whole mount zebrafish ABS is still largely conducted manually through labor intensive and time-consuming steps which affect both consistency and throughput of the assay. In this work, we develop a milli fluidic device that can automatically trap and immobilize the fixed chorion-less zebrafish embryos for the whole mount ABS. With just a single loading step, the zebrafish embryos can be trapped by the milli fluidic device through a chaotic hydrodynamic trapping process. Moreover, a consistent body orientation (i.e., head point inward) for the trapped zebrafish embryos can be achieved without additional orientation adjustment device. Furthermore, we employed a consumer-grade SLA 3D printer assisted method for device prototyping which is ideal for labs with limited budgets. Notably, the milli fluidic device has enabled the optimization and successful implementation of whole mount zebrafish Caspase-3 ABS. We demonstrated our device can accelerate the overall procedure by reducing at least 50% of washing time in the standard well-plate-based manual procedure. Also, the consistency is improved, and manual steps are reduced using the milli fluidic device. This work fills the gap in the milli fluidic application for whole mount zebrafish immunohistochemistry. We hope the device can be accepted by the zebrafish community and be used for other types of whole mount zebrafish ABS procedures or expanded to more complicated in situ hybridization (ISH) procedure.3D printingMilli fluidicWhole mount University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6v10j634articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt524911zk2023-09-01T22:55:36Zqt524911zkMeasurements of the Higgs boson production cross section and couplings in the W boson pair decay channel sections of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons are measured in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV. The analysis targets Higgs bosons produced via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and in association with a W or Z boson. Candidate events are required to have at least two charged leptons and moderate missing transverse momentum, targeting events with at least one leptonically decaying W boson originating from the Higgs boson. Results are presented in the form of inclusive and differential cross sections in the simplified template cross section framework, as well as couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons and fermions.

We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess performance of a modified finger tapping task in which participants performed synchronized or syncopated tapping relative to a metronomic tone. Both versions of the tapping task included a pacing phase (tapping with the tone) followed by a continuation phase (tapping without the tone). Both behavioral and brain-based findings revealed two distinct timing mechanisms underlying the two forms of tapping. Here we investigate the impact of an additional-and extremely subtle-manipulation of the studys experimental design. We measured responses in 23 healthy adults as they performed the two versions of the finger-tapping tasks either blocked by tapping type or alternating from one to the other type during the course of the experiment. As in our previous study, behavioral tapping indices and cortical hemodynamics were monitored, allowing us to compare results across the two study designs. Consistent with previous findings, results reflected distinct, context-dependent parameters of the tapping. Moreover, our results demonstrated a significant impact of study design on rhythmic entrainment in the presence/absence of auditory stimuli. Tapping accuracy and hemodynamic responsivity collectively indicate that the block design context is preferable for studying action-based timing behavior.AdultHumansFingersHemodynamicsPsychomotor Performanceapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University Otodus megalodon, and its close phylogenetic relatives remains enigmatic. A central question persists regarding the thermophysiological origins of these large predatory sharks through geologic time, including whether O. megalodon was ectothermic or endothermic (including regional endothermy), and whether its thermophysiology could help to explain the iconic sharks gigantism and eventual demise during the Pliocene. To address these uncertainties, we present unique geochemical evidence for thermoregulation in O. megalodon from both clumped isotope paleothermometry and phosphate oxygen isotopes. Our results show that O. megalodon had an overall warmer body temperature compared with its ambient environment and other coexisting shark species, providing quantitative and experimental support for recent biophysical modeling studies that suggest endothermy was one of the key drivers for gigantism in O. megalodon and other lamniform sharks. The gigantic body size with high metabolic costs of having high body temperatures may have contributed to the vulnerability of Otodus species to extinction when compared to other sympatric sharks that survived the Pliocene RegulationBody Sizeapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, the Effect of Refugees on Civil Conflict: A Global Subnational AnalysisZHOU, YANG-YANGSHAVER, ANDREW2021-11-01A large literature suggests that the presence of refugees is associated with greater risk of conflict. We argue that the positive effects of hosting refugees on local conditions have been overlooked. Using global data from 1990 to 2018 on locations of refugee communities and civil conflict at the subnational level, we find no evidence that hosting refugees increases the likelihood of new conflict, prolongs existing conflict, or raises the number of violent events or casualties. Furthermore, we explore conditions where provinces are likely to experience substantively large decreases in conflict risk due to increased development. Analysis examining nighttime lights as a measure of development, coupled with expert interviews, support our claim. To address the possibility of selection bias, we use placebo tests and matching. Our research challenges assertions that refugees are security risks. Instead, we show that in many cases, hosting refugees can encourage local development and even conflict reduction.PeaceJustice and Strong Institutionsrefugeesmigrationconflictsubnationalroad networksGISPolitical SciencePolitical Science & Public of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8h09c2sbarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2fz6c9sv2023-08-30T19:00:25Zqt2fz6c9svMultimodality matters in numerical communicationWinter, BodoMarghetis, Tyler2023-01-01Modern society depends on numerical information, which must be communicated accurately and effectively. Numerical communication is accomplished in different modalities-speech, writing, sign, gesture, graphs, and in naturally occurring settings it almost always involves more than one modality at once. Yet the modalities of numerical communication are often studied in isolation. Here we argue that, to understand and improve numerical communication, we must take seriously this multimodality. We first discuss each modality on its own terms, identifying their commonalities and differences. We then argue that numerical communication is shaped critically by interactions among modalities. We boil down these interactions to four types: one modality can amplify the message of another; it can direct attention to content from another modality (e.g., using a gesture to guide attention to a relevant aspect of a graph); it can explain another modality (e.g., verbally explaining the meaning of an axis in a graph); and it can reinterpret a modality (e.g., framing an upwards-oriented trend as a bad outcome). We conclude by discussing how a focus on multimodality raises entirely new research questions about numerical communication.numerical cognitionnumerical communicationmultimodalitydata visualizationgraphsgesturequantifiersPsychologyCognitive Sciencesapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2fz6c9svpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8ps5m7cs2023-08-30T17:25:08Zqt8ps5m7csUsing social media data and machine learning to map recreational servicesNyelele, CharityKeske, CatherineChung, Min GonGuo, HanEgoh, Benis N2023-10-01Crowdsourced geotagged social media data and machine learning approaches have emerged as promising tools for mapping ecosystem services, especially cultural ecosystem services that are difficult to assess. Here, we use recreation to show how social media data, machine learning, and spatial analysis techniques can improve our understanding of human-nature interactions and the mapping of recreational ecosystem services. We extracted 80,500 photographs taken in non-urban areas of the Tahoe Central Sierra Initiative project area in California between 2005 and 2019 that were posted to the photo sharing application Flickr and used these as a proxy for recreational visits to the area. Automated image content analysis was used to identify the objects and concepts in the photographs and uncover the types of nature experiences that are important to visitors. Additionally, variable importance, a Random Forest machine learning technique, was used to examine the environmental and landscape variables that drive recreation in the area and to create a classification model that predicts the recreation potential of the entire area based on important variables. The automated image content analysis identified 1,239 unique labels linked to recreation, with mountains, hills, and rocks being the most prominent features (22%). Our Random Forest model indicates that vegetation cover, land cover, elevation, smoke days, and landscape features are major drivers of recreation in the area and are of interest to visitors in the area. The model predicted that 25.9% of the area has the potential to support recreational visits. Most of these recreation potential areas are in protected areas (77.8%), predominantly in conifer forests (66%) and within national forest boundaries, especially the Tahoe National Forest area (37.6%). These results show that recreational ecosystem services vary across landscapes and illustrate the need for improved mapping approaches to determine the provision of ecosystem services in different places. The analysis provides novel insights into the various ways social media data and machine learning techniques can be powerful components of ecosystem service research and how they hold great potential for monitoring and informing management interventions on ecosystem service provision, especially in places with limited traditional onsite visitation data.Life on LandChemical SciencesEnvironmental SciencesBiological in a sound stream has been integral to music identity. We attempt to expand music's definition, by demonstrating that the neural code for musicality is independent of pitch encoding. That is, pitchless sound streams can still induce music-like perception and a neurophysiological hierarchy similar to pitched melodies. Previous work reported that neural processing of sounds with no-pitch, fixed-pitch, and irregular-pitch (melodic) patterns, exhibits a right-lateralized hierarchical shift, with pitchless sounds favorably processed in Heschl's gyrus (HG), ascending laterally to nonprimary auditory areas for fixed-pitch and even more laterally for melodic patterns. The objective of this EEG study was to assess whether sound encoding maintains a similar hierarchical profile when musical perception is driven by timbre irregularities in the absence of pitch changes. Individuals listened to repetitions of three musical and three nonmusical sound-streams. The nonmusical streams were comprised of seven 200-ms segments of white, pink, or brown noise, separated by silent gaps. Musical streams were created similarly, but with all three noise types combined in a unique order within each stream to induce timbre variations and music-like perception. Subjects classified the sound streams as musical or nonmusical. Musical processing exhibited right dominant power enhancement, followed by a lateralized increase in phase-locking and spectral power. The phase-locking was stronger in musicians than in nonmusicians. The lateralization of activity suggests higher-level auditory processing. Our findings validate the existence of a hierarchical shift, traditionally observed with pitched-melodic perception, underscoring that musicality can be achieved with timbre irregularities alone.NEW & NOTEWORTHY EEG induced by streams of pitchless noise segments varying in timbre were classified as music-like and exhibited a right-lateralized hierarchy in processing similar to pitched melodic processing. This study provides evidence that the neural-code of musicality is independent of pitch encoding.

Though notable advances to understand its invasion success have been made during the past decade, especially with then newer molecular tools, the conclusions reached remain to be confirmed with more advanced genomic analyses and especially using more samples from larger geographical regions across the native range. Furthermore, although H. axyridis is one of the best studied invasive insect species with respect to life history traits (often comparing invasive and native populations), the traits responsible for its colonization success in non-native areas warrant more research. RESULTS: Our analyses of genome-wide nuclear population structure indicated that an eastern Chinese population could be the source of all non-native populations and revealed several putatively adaptive candidate genomic loci involved in body color variation, visual perception, and hemolymph synthesis. Our estimates of evolutionary history indicate (1) asymmetric migration with varying population sizes across its native and non-native range, (2) a recent admixture between eastern Chinese and American populations in Europe, (3) signatures of a large progressive, historical bottleneck in the common ancestors of both populations and smaller effective sizes of the non-native population, and (4) the southwest origin and subsequent dispersal routes within its native range in China. In addition, we found that while two mitochondrial haplotypes-Hap1 and Hap2 were dominant in the native range, Hap1 was the only dominant haplotype in the non-native range. Our laboratory observations in both China and USA found statistical yet slight differences between Hap1 and Hap2 in some of life history traits. CONCLUSIONS: Our study on H. axyridis provides new insights into its invasion processes into other major continents from its native Asian range, reconstructs a geographic range evolution across its native region China, and tentatively suggests that its invasiveness may differ between Dinocampus coccinellae reveals extensive duplications, accelerated evolution, and Coccinellidae), with thelytokous parthenogeny as its primary mode of reproduction.

We also present a first-pass ab initio and a reference-based genome annotation and resolve timings of divergence and evolution of (1) solitary behavior vs eusociality, (2) arrhenotokous vs thelytokous parthenogenesis, and (3) rates of gene loss and gain among Hymenopteran lineages. Our study finds (1) at least 2 independent origins of eusociality and solitary behavior among Hymenoptera, (2) 2 independent origins of thelytokous parthenogenesis from ancestral arrhenotoky, and (3) accelerated rates of gene duplications, loss, and gain along the lineages leading to D. coccinellae.

Increased genetic drift, high mutation rates, and relaxed selection associated with host control of key cellular functions all likely contribute to genome decay. Phylogenetic comparisons have revealed massive variation in endosymbiont evolutionary rate, but such methods make it difficult to partition the effects of mutation versus selection. For example, the ancestor of Auchenorrhynchan insects contained two obligate endosymbionts, Sulcia and a betaproteobacterium (BetaSymb; called Nasuia in leafhoppers) that exhibit divergent rates of sequence evolution and different propensities for loss and replacement in the ensuing 300 Ma. Here, we use the auchenorrhynchan leafhopper Macrosteles sp. nr. severini, which retains both of the ancestral endosymbionts, to test the hypothesis that differences in evolutionary rate are driven by differential mutagenesis. We used a high-fidelity technique known as duplex sequencing to measure and compare low-frequency variants in each endosymbiont. Our direct detection of de novode novo mutations reveals that the rapidly evolving endosymbiont (Nasuia) has a much higher frequency of single-nucleotide variants than the more stable endosymbiont (Sulcia) and a mutation spectrum that is potentially even more AT-biased than implied by the 83.1% AT content of its genome. We show that indels are common in both endosymbionts but differ substantially in length and distribution around repetitive regions. Our results suggest that differences in long-term rates of sequence evolution in Sulcia versus BetaSymb, and perhaps the contrasting degrees of stability of their relationships with the host, are driven by differences in mutagenesis.deletionextinctiongenome decayinsertionmutation spectravariantAnimalsBacteriaBetaproteobacteriaEvolutionMolecularGenomeBacterialHemipteraInsectaMutationPhylogenySymbiosisapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/26711602articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8769v3vq2023-08-30T04:41:55Zqt8769v3vqModern metal-catalyzed BehnoushGholamhosseyni, MaralLarijani, BagherMahdavi, Mohammad2022-06-22Coumarin is an important pharmaceutical structural motif, abundantly found in numerous commonly used drugs.

Northern US Rockies forests dominated early increases in wildfire activity, and still contributed 50% of the increase in large fires over the last decade. However, the percentage growth in wildfire activity in Pacific northwestern and southwestern US forests has rapidly increased over the last two decades. Wildfire numbers and burned area are also increasing in non-forest vegetation types. Wildfire activity appears strongly associated with warming and earlier spring snowmelt. Analysis of the drivers of forest wildfire sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring demonstrates that forests at elevations where the historical mean snow-free season ranged between two and four months, with relatively high cumulative warm-season actual evapotranspiration, have been most affected. Increases in large wildfires associated with earlier spring snowmelt scale exponentially with changes in moisture deficit, and moisture deficit changes can explain most of the spatial variability in forest wildfire regime response to the timing of spring.This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.FiresForestsSeasonsTime FactorsTreesUnited SciencesEvolutionary Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, Physicochemical Changes of Carbonate Surfaces from SmartWater (Diluted Seawater) Flooding Processes for Improved Oil RecoveryChen, DongjinCadirov, the past few decades, field- and laboratory-scale studies have shown enhancements in oil recovery when reservoirs, which contain high-salinity formation water (FW), are waterflooded with modified-salinity salt water (widely referred to as the low-salinity, dilution, or SmartWater effect for improved oil recovery). In this study, we investigated the time dependence of the physicochemical processes that occur during diluted seawater (i.e., SmartWater) waterflooding processes of specific relevance to carbonate oil reservoirs. We measured the changes to oil/water/rock wettability, surface roughness, and surface chemical composition during SmartWater flooding using 10-fold-diluted seawater under mimicked oil reservoir conditions with calcite and carbonate reservoir rocks. Distinct effects due to SmartWater flooding were observed and found to occur on two different timescales: (1) a rapid (<15 min) increase in the colloidal electrostatic double-layer repulsion between the rock and oil across the SmartWater, leading to a decreased oil/water/rock adhesion energy and thus increased water wetness and (2) slower (>12 h to complete) physicochemical changes of the calcite and carbonate reservoir rock surfaces, including surface roughening via the dissolution of rock and the reprecipitation of dissolved carbonate species after exchanging key ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, CO32-, and SO42- in carbonates) with those in the flooding SmartWater. Our experiments using crude oil from a carbonate reservoir reveal that these reservoir rock surfaces are covered with organic-ionic preadsorbed films (ad-layers), which the SmartWater removes (detaches) as flakes. Removal of the organic-ionic ad-layers by SmartWater flooding enhances oil release from the surfaces, which was found to be critical to increasing the water wetness and significantly improving oil removal from carbonates. Additionally, the increase in water wetness is further enhanced by roughening of the rock surfaces, which decreases the effective contact (interaction) area between the oil and rock interfaces. Furthermore, we found that the rate of these slower physicochemical changes to the carbonate rock surfaces increases with increasing temperature (at least up to an experimental temperature of 75 \u00b0C). Our results suggest that the effectiveness of improved oil recovery from SmartWater flooding depends strongly on the formation of the organic-ionic ad-layers. In oil reservoirs where the ad-layer is fully developed and robust, injecting SmartWater would lead to significant removal of the ad-layer and improved oil recovery.Chemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/55v0s7brarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt71t4r3th2023-08-29T21:11:26Zqt71t4r3thCooperative KaiA-KaiB-KaiC Interactions Affect three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. Together, they generate an of KaiB sequesters KaiA in a far away from the A-loops, thereby inducing KaiC dephosphorylation. The switch from KaiC phosphorylation to dephosphorylation is initiated by the formation of the KaiB-KaiC complex, which occurs upon phosphorylation of the S431 residues of KaiC. We show here that formation of the KaiB-KaiC complex is promoted by KaiA, suggesting cooperativity in the initiation of the dephosphorylation complex. In the KaiA-KaiB interaction, one monomeric subunit of KaiB likely binds to one face of a KaiA dimer, leaving the other face unoccupied. We also show that the A-loops of KaiC exist in a dynamic equilibrium between KaiA-accessible exposed and KaiA-inaccessible buried positions. Phosphorylation at the S431 residues of KaiC shift the A-loops toward the buried position, thereby weakening the KaiA-KaiC interaction, which is expected to be an additional mechanism promoting formation of the KaiABC complex. We also show that KaiB and the clock-output protein SasA compete for overlapping binding sites, which include the B-loops on the CI ring of KaiC. KaiA strongly shifts the competition in KaiB's favor. Thus, in addition to stimulating KaiC phosphorylation, it is likely that KaiA plays roles in switching KaiC from phosphorylation to dephosphorylation, as well as regulating clock output.1.1 Normal biological development and functioningUnderpinning researchGeneric health relevanceAmino Acid University of of Covert SignalingSmaldino, Paul EFlamson, Thomas JMcElreath, Richard2018-01-01Human sociality depends upon the benefits of mutual aid and extensive communication. However, diverse norms and preferences complicate mutual aid, and ambiguity in meaning hinders communication. Here we demonstrate that these two problems can work together to enhance cooperation through the strategic use of deliberately ambiguous signals: covert signaling. Covert signaling is the transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling, such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics. We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess when a covert signaling strategy will evolve, as well as how receiver attitudes coevolve with covert signals. Covert signaling plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar group members when possible and to get along with dissimilar ones when necessary. This mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation, humor, social identity, political psychology, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.Biological EvolutionCommunicationComputer SecurityCooperative BehaviorEmotionsHumansInterpersonal RelationsModelsTheoreticalPerceptionSocial Valence, and Affective Arousal with Momentary Cortisol Dusti RReichenberger, JuliaSmyth, Joshua ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology and ambulatory cortisol during daily life is still rare, as is careful testing of the within-person associations between stress, affect, and cortisol.

Each assessment included reports of perceived stress and affect (used to construct indicators of affective valence and arousal), followed by a saliva sample (from which cortisol was assessed). Multi-level models were used to examine the momentary associations between perceived stress, affective valence, affective arousal, and cortisol.ResultsMoments characterized by higher perceived stress were associated with higher cortisol (p = .036). Affective valence covaried with cortisol (p = .003) such that more positive valence was associated with lower cortisol and more negative valence with higher cortisol. Momentary affective arousal was not related to cortisol (p = .131). When all predictors were tested in the same model, only valence remained a significant predictor of cortisol (p = .047).ConclusionMomentary perceived stress and affective valence, but not affective arousal, were associated with naturalistic cortisol. Cortisol was more robustly associated with affective valence than perceived stress or affective arousal. These findings extend our understanding of how moments of stress and particular characteristics of affective states (i.e., valence but not arousal) may \"get under the skin\" in daily life.Mental HealthBehavioral Social Behavioral and ScienceClinical ResearchAdultAffectArousalEcological momentary assessmentMedical enormous interest due to their potential to deliver precision filtration of species with performance that can challenge current desalination membrane platforms.

Here, we report composite laminate multilayer MoS2 membranes with stacked heterodimensional one- to nanosheets and nanodisks. These membranes have a multimodal porous network structure with tunable surface charge, pore size, and interlayer spacing. In forward osmosis, our membranes reject more than 99% of salts at high salinities and, in reverse osmosis, small-molecule organic dyes and salts are efficiently filtered.

One of the main advantages of the approach is the flexibility and simplicity of working directly in real space where the different fields are discretized on a grid, combined with competitive numerical performance and great potential for parallelization. These properties constitute a great advantage at the time of implementing and testing new physical models. Based on our experience with the Octopus code, in this article we discuss how the real-space approach has allowed for the recent development of new ideas for the simulation of electronic systems. Among these applications are approaches to calculate response properties, modeling of photoemission, optimal control of quantum systems, simulation of plasmonic systems, and the exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for low-dimensionality systems.physics.chem-phcond-mat.otherphysics.comp-phChemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6kj1g5qkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9rw6f4ch2023-08-29T18:40:46Zqt9rw6f4chDairy Manure Co-composting with Wood Biochar Plays a Critical source of anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions, and in intensive dairy systems, manure management can contribute half of livestock CH4. Recent policies such as California's short-lived climate pollutant reduction law (SB 1383) and the Global Methane Pledge call for cuts to livestock CH4 by 2030. However, investments in CH4 reduction strategies are primarily aimed at liquid dairy manure, whereas stockpiled solids remain a large source of CH4. Here, we measure the CH4 and net greenhouse gas reduction potential of dairy manure biochar-composting, a novel manure management strategy, through a composting experiment and life-cycle analysis. We found that biochar-composting reduces CH4 by 79%, compared to composting without biochar. In addition to reducing CH4 during composting, we show that the added climate benefit from biochar production and application contributes to a substantially reduced life-cycle global warming potential for biochar-composting: -535 compared to for and 102 kg CO2e Mg-1 for stockpiling. If biochar-composting replaces manure stockpiling and complements anaerobic digestion, California could meet SB 1383 with 132 less digesters.

High-throughput DNA sequencing has enabled genome-scale surveys of structural variation. However, the short reads produced by these technologies limit the study of complex variants, particularly those involving repetitive regions. Recent 'third-generation' sequencing technologies provide single-molecule templates and longer sequencing reads, but at the cost of higher per-nucleotide error rates.ResultsWe present MultiBreak-SV, an algorithm to detect structural variants (SVs) from single molecule sequencing data, paired read sequencing data, or a combination of sequencing data from different platforms. We demonstrate that combining low-coverage third-generation data from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) with high-coverage paired read data is advantageous on simulated chromosomes. We apply MultiBreak-SV to PacBio data from four human fosmids and show that it detects known SVs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we perform a whole-genome analysis on PacBio data from a complete hydatidiform mole cell line and predict 1002 high-probability SVs, over half of which are confirmed by Illumina-based assembly.GeneticsHuman Genome2.1 of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/81z5h6sparticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6v28v82x2023-08-29T18:11:42Zqt6v28v82xEcological Divergence, Adaptive Diversification, and the Evolution of Social Signaling Traits: An Empirical Study in Arid Australian Lizards.Edwards, Danielle LMelville, JaneJoseph, LeoKeogh, J Scott2015-12-01Species diversification often results from divergent evolution of ecological or social signaling traits. Theoretically, a combination of the two may promote speciation, however, empirical examples studying how social signal and ecological divergence might be involved in diversification are rare in general and typically do not consider range overlap as a contributing factor. We show that ecologically distinct lineages within the Australian sand dragon species complex (including Ctenophorus maculatus, Ctenophorus fordi, and Ctenophorus femoralis) have diversified recently, diverging in ecologically relevant and social signaling phenotypic traits as arid habitats expanded and differentiated. Diversification has resulted in repeated and independent invasion of distinct habitat types, driving convergent evolution of similar phenotypes. Our results suggest that parapatry facilitates diversification in visual signals through reinforcement as a hybridization-avoidance mechanism. We show that particularly striking variation in visual social signaling traits is better explained by the extent of lineage parapatry relative to ecological or phylogenetic divergence, suggesting that these traits reinforce divergence among lineages initiated by ecologically adaptive evolution. This study provides a rare empirical example of a repeated, intricate relationship between ecological and social signal evolution during diversification driven by ecological divergence and the evolution of new habitats, thereby supporting emergent theories regarding the importance of both ecological and social trait evolution throughout speciation.AnimalsAustraliaBiological EvolutionDNAMitochondrialEcosystemGenetic SpeciationLizardsPhenotypePhylogenySpecies SpecificityagamidaridificationCtenophorusdiversificationecological Acute Inebriation to Presynaptic Changes and the Development of Alcohol Tolerance, and Gregory neuroadaptive changes in behavior that favor increased intake. Ethanol-induced alterations in gene expression, through epigenetic and other means, are likely to change cellular and neural circuit function. Ethanol markedly changes histone acetylation, and the sirtuin Sir2/SIRT1 that deacetylates histones and transcription factors is essential for the rewarding effects of long-term drug use. The molecular transformations leading from short-term to long-term ethanol responses mostly remain to be discovered. We find that Sir2 in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila promotes short-term ethanol-induced behavioral plasticity by allowing changes in the expression of presynaptic molecules. Acute inebriation strongly reduces Sir2 levels and increases histone H3 acetylation in the brain. Flies lacking Sir2 globally, in the adult nervous system, or specifically in the mushroom body /-lobes show reduced ethanol sensitivity and tolerance. Sir2-dependent ethanol reward is also localized to the mushroom bodies, and Sir2 mutants prefer ethanol even without a priming ethanol pre-exposure. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that specific presynaptic molecules, including the synaptic vesicle pool regulator Synapsin, depend on Sir2 to be regulated by ethanol. Synapsin is required for ethanol sensitivity and tolerance. We propose that the regulation of Sir2/SIRT1 by acute inebriation forms part of a transcriptional program in mushroom body neurons to alter presynaptic properties and neural responses to favor the development of ethanol tolerance, preference, and reward.Significance statementWe identify a mechanism by which acute ethanol inebriation leads to changes in nervous system function that may be an important basis for increasing ethanol intake and addiction liability. The findings are significant because they identify ethanol-driven transcriptional events that target presynaptic properties and direct behavioral plasticity. They also demonstrate that multiple forms of ethanol behavioral plasticity that are relevant to alcoholism are initiated by a shared mechanism. Finally, they link these events to the Drosophila brain region that associates context with innate approach and avoidance responses to code for reward and other higher-order behavior, similar in aspects to the role of the vertebrate mesolimbic system.AlcoholismAlcohol Use and HealthBrain Social ScienceUnderpinning research1.1 Normal biological Neurosurgeryapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6kv5z0kxarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt53b3c65r2023-08-29T18:06:40Zqt53b3c65rRisk of Reverse Seroconversion of Hepatitis B lymphoma (CD20 NHL), especially for those seropositive to the antibody of core antigen (anti-HBc). Clinical hepatitis usually develops after reverse seroconversion of HBsAg (HBV-RS), indicated by the reappearance of HBsAg in serum. Because of the relatively high prevalence of anti-HBc seropositivity in unvaccinated HBsAg-seronegative adults in an HBV hyperendemic area, we aimed to investigate additional factors influencing the development of rituximab-associated HBV-RS.Between January 2000 and December 2010, unvaccinated HBsAg-seronegative adults with CD20 NHL who had received rituximab-containing therapy but not anti-HBV agents were enrolled. Patients with and without HBV-RS were compared in terms of clinical factors and treatments including the number of cycles of rituximab therapy, and transplantation. Competing risk regression was used to identify the factors associated with HBV-RS.For the 482 patients enrolled, the serological status of anti-HBc was available in 75.9%, with a seropositivity rate of 86.6%. At the last follow-up, a total of 33 received more cycles (6) and prolonged durations of rituximab therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The overall survival was not different between patients with and those without HBV-RS. At the time of HBV-RS, a total of 25 (78.1%) patients had hepatitis flare, especially when HBV-RS appeared during/after induction therapy (100%, 10 of 10). Three (9.1%) patients had fulminant hepatitis, resulting in death in 1 (3%) patient. A higher rituximab cycle intensity was associated with a higher rate of hepatitis flare at the time of HBV-RS. When death in the absence of HBV-RS was considered as the competing risk, the univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that several factors were independently associated with the development of HBV-RS, including anti-HCV seronegativity, histological subtype of posttransplant rituximab therapy, and succeeding hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.The findings of our study identify additional factors influencing the development of rituximab-associated HBV-RS in HBsAg-seronegative adults with JSmall, Amanda KGerin, William2017-04-01Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) has long been recognized by researchers as the gold standard of blood pressure (BP) measurement. Researchers and clinicians typically rely on the mean measure of ABP; however, there is considerable variability in the beat-to-beat BP. Although often ignored, this variability has been found to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual review of ABP variability (ABPV) focusing on the following: associations between ABPV and health, whether ABPV is reliable, how to calculate ABPV, predictors of ABPV, and treatments for ABPV. Two future directions are discussed involving better understanding ABPV by momentary assessments and improving knowledge of the underlying physiology that explains ABPV. The results of this review suggest that the unique characteristics of ABPV provide insight into the role of BP variability in hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular illness.CardiovascularHypertensionGood Health and Well BeingBlood PressureBlood Hydrogenation and Deuteriation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Water as the Stoichiometric H or D Atom DonorCummings, Steven PLe, Thanh-NgocFernandez, Gilberto EQuiambao, Lorenzo GStokes, Benjamin J2016-05-18There are few examples of catalytic transfer hydrogenations of simple alkenes and alkynes that use water as a stoichiometric H or D atom donor. We have found that diboron reagents efficiently mediate the transfer of H or D atoms from water directly onto unsaturated C-C bonds using a palladium catalyst. This reaction is conducted on a broad variety of alkenes and alkynes at ambient temperature, and boric acid is the sole byproduct. Mechanistic experiments suggest that this reaction is made possible by a hydrogen atom transfer from water that generates a Pd-hydride intermediate. Importantly, complete deuterium incorporation from stoichiometric D2O has also been achieved.Chemical SciencesGeneral Chemistryapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University Demands Impact 3-Year-Olds' Performance in a Spontaneous-Response Task: New Evidence for the Account of Early False-Belief UnderstandingScott, Rose MRoby, ErinSenju, Atsushi2015-01-01Prior to age four, in non-elicited-response false-belief tasks but fail elicited-response false-belief tasks. To explain this discrepancy, the processing-load account argues that the capacity to represent beliefs emerges in infancy, as indicated by early success on non-elicited-response tasks, but that children's ability to demonstrate this capacity depends on the processing demands of the task and children's processing skills. When processing demands exceed young children's processing abilities, such as in standard elicited-response tasks, children fail despite their capacity to represent beliefs. Support for this account comes from recent evidence that reducing processing demands improves young children's performance: when demands are sufficiently reduced, 2.5-year-olds succeed in elicited-response tasks. Here we sought complementary evidence for the processing-load account by examining whether increasing processing demands impeded children's performance in a non-elicited-response task. 3-year-olds were tested in a preferential-looking task in which they heard a change-of-location false-belief story accompanied by a picture book; across children, we manipulated the amount of linguistic ambiguity in the story. The final page of the book showed two images: one that was consistent with the main character's false belief and one that was consistent with reality. When the story was relatively unambiguous, children looked reliably longer at the false-belief-consistent image, successfully demonstrating their false-belief understanding. When the story was ambiguous, however, this undermined children's performance: looking times to the belief-consistent image were correlated with verbal ability, and only children with verbal skills in the upper quartile of the sample demonstrated a significant preference for the belief-consistent image. These results support the processing-load account by demonstrating that regardless of whether a task involves an elicited response, children's performance depends on the processing demands of the task and their processing skills. These findings also have implications for alternative, deflationary accounts of early Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3gn1r3dwarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1995r5fh2023-08-29T17:56:18Zqt1995r5fhSimulating the Interacting Effects of Intraspecific Variation, Disturbance, and Competition on Climate-Driven Range Shifts in TreesMoran, Emily VOrmond, Rhys AGomory, Dusan2015-01-01Climate change is expected to favor shifts in plant distributions; some such shifts are already being observed along elevation gradients. However, the rate of such shifts may be limited by their ability to reach newly suitable areas and by competition from resident species. The degree of local adaptation and genetic variation may also play a role in the interaction between migrants and residents by affecting relative fitness. We used a simulation model to explore the interacting effects of dispersal, fecundity, disturbance, and genetic variation on range-edge dynamics between a pair of demographically similar tree species. Ideal climate for an individual is determined by genotype. The simulated landscape undergoes an 80-year period of climate change in which climate bands shift upslope; subsequently, climate is held constant for 300 years. The presence of a high-elevation competitor caused a significant lag in the range shift of the low-elevation species relative to competition-free scenarios. Increases in fecundity and dispersal distance both helped to speed up the replacement of the high-elevation species by the low-elevation species at their range boundary. While some disturbance scenarios facilitated this transition, frequent canopy disturbance inhibited colonization by removing reproductive adults and led to range contractions in both species. Differences between dispersal scenarios were more pronounced when disturbance was frequent (15 vs. 25 year return interval) and dispersal was limited. When the high-elevation species lacked genetic variation, its range was more-easily invaded by the low-elevation species, while a similar lack of variation in the low-elevation species inhibited colonization-but only when this lack of variation decreased the fitness of the affected species near the range boundary. Our model results support the importance of measuring and including dispersal/fecundity, disturbance type and frequency, and genetic variation when assessing the potential for range shifts and species vulnerability to climate change.Climate ActionClimateClimate ChangeEcosystemGenetic VariationModelsTheoreticalPlant DispersalTreesGeneral Science & TechnologypubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1995r5fharticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1589p8m72023-08-29T17:39:22Zqt1589p8m7Quantifying the impact of weak, strong, and super ties in scientific careersPetersen, Alexander Michael2015-08-25Scientists are frequently faced with the important decision to start or terminate a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations, as early career researchers are pursuers, whereas senior researchers are typically attractors, of new collaborative opportunities. Focusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed 473 collaboration profiles using an egocentric perspective that accounts for researcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of topics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and efficiency. From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the frequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie strength, showing that collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high turnover rates. We use analytic extreme value thresholds to identify a new class of indispensable super ties, the strongest of which commonly exhibit >50% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and reward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group experience. We find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity and a 17% citation increase per publication, thus identifying these partnerships--the analog of life partners--as a major factor in science career development.Career ChoiceDecision MakingHumansSciencecomputational social sciencecooperationteam sciencecareer evaluationbibliometricsphysics.soc-phcs.DLphysics.data-anstat.APpubliceScholarship, concentration, medium osmolality and oocyte storage on artificial fertilisation conditions in Limnodynastes tasmaniensis (Myobatrachidae).

At baseline, participants completed performance-based measures of EF. HbA1c was collected from assay kits.ResultsGrowth curve models revealed significant declines in disclosure to fathers and mothers' and fathers' knowledge of diabetes activities; no changes were found in mothers' or fathers' acceptance nor disclosure to mothers. Multilevel models indicated significant between-person effects for nearly all aspects of parental involvement with more acceptance, knowledge, and disclosure associated with better HbA1c and adherence. Within-person effects for disclosure to fathers, and mothers' and fathers' knowledge indicated that in years when emerging adults perceived higher amounts of these types of involvement (compared with their own average), HbA1c was lower. Within-person effects were found for acceptance to mothers, disclosure to mothers and fathers, and mothers' diabetes knowledge for adherence. Disclosure to fathers and mothers' knowledge of diabetes activities were especially beneficial for HbA1c for those with poorer EF performance.ConclusionsParental involvement in diabetes management remains important during the high-risk time of emerging adulthood, especially for those with poorer profiles of CdS have been measured for the longitudinal optical phonon in two sizes of CdS quantum dots and in CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots. In pure CdS, the resonance Raman cross section for the fundamental transition is sharply peaked around the lowest-energy excitonic transition and becomes weaker with higher-energy excitation even though the absorbance continues to increase to higher energies. This effect, also observed in earlier studies of CdSe quantum dots, is attributed largely to interferences among multiple excitonic transitions contributing to the resonance Raman polarizability. No variation in exciton-phonon coupling strength with exciton energy is required to explain the decrease in the ratio of the Raman cross section to absorption cross section at shorter wavelengths. In core/shell structures, the CdSe phonons are relatively strong when exciting on resonance with the lower excitonic transitions, in which the hole is largely localized to the CdSe core, but become nearly undetectable at excitation wavelengths >0.6 eV above the lowest exciton, where both electrons and holes are largely localized in the CdS shell. The CdS phonon Raman cross section exhibits a maximum 0.6-0.7 eV above the lowest exciton and then decreases at higher energies for the same reasons as in pure CdS.Affordable and Clean EnergyPhysical SciencesChemical SciencesEngineeringChemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9ms7827sarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4vs4419m2023-08-29T16:30:40Zqt4vs4419mDo metaphors in emotional and cognitive factorsLandau, Mark JArndt, JamieCameron, Linda D2018-01-01Health communicators publicize messages that use metaphors to compare abstract health-related concepts to concrete concepts in other domains. Such messages aim to change health attitudes and behavior, but do they work? According to Conceptual Metaphor Theory, metaphors can shape thought by transferring personalized knowledge of a concrete concept to understand and relate to an abstraction, despite their superficial differences. The authors extend this claim to specify emotional and cognitive factors potentially moderating the productivity (and counter-productivity) of metaphoric health messages. A source resonance hypothesis predicts that when a message frames a health risk metaphorically in terms of a concrete hazard (versus literally), individual differences in fear surrounding that particular hazard will differentially predict risk-related worry and thus prevention intentions. A metaphoric fit hypothesis predicts that a risk metaphor will be more persuasive when the recommended prevention response is itself framed metaphorically as addressing the concrete hazard (versus literally). These hypotheses were supported in three experiments conducted with online, undergraduate, and community samples (N = 539). With skin cancer as a case study, the studies tested the impact of messages framing sun exposure and sun-safe practices with or without metaphors of enemy combat. Findings illuminate how, when, and for whom metaphoric messages are persuasive, with theoretical and practical implications for health communication and metaphoric construal.PreventionMind and BodyBasic Behavioral spectroscopic and photophysical similarities and differences between charge trapping by surface ligands on CdSe quantum dots and charge delocalization into the shell in excited CdSe core/shell nanocrystals are discussed. Optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies are used to study small CdSe quantum dots coated with organic ligands that accept electrons (methyl viologen) or holes (phenothiazine, 4-methylbenzenethiol), as well as with semiconductor shells that delocalize electrons (CdS) or holes (CdTe). The organic ligands have only a small effect on the optical absorption spectrum and contribute negligibly to the resonance Raman spectra, indicating little participation of ligand orbitals in the initial excitation. The semiconductor shells more strongly red-shift the absorption spectrum by delocalizing the electron and/or hole into the shell, and vibrations of the shell appear in the resonance Raman spectrum, showing that the shell is involved in the vertical excitation. The qualitative differences between ligand and semiconductor shells are discussed in terms of the energetics and coupling strengths.Physical SciencesChemical Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1sp137x1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3nh556h92023-08-29T15:52:46Zqt3nh556h9Widespread regeneration failure in forests of Greater Yellowstone under scenarios of future climate and fireRammer, WernerBraziunas, Rupert2021-09-01Changing climate and disturbance regimes are increasingly challenging the resilience of forest ecosystems around the globe. A powerful indicator for the loss of resilience is regeneration failure, that is, the inability of the prevailing tree species to regenerate after disturbance. Regeneration failure can result from the interplay among disturbance changes (e.g., larger and more frequent fires), altered climate conditions (e.g., increased drought), and functional traits (e.g., method of seed dispersal). This complexity makes projections of regeneration failure challenging. Here we applied a novel simulation approach assimilating data-driven fire projections with vegetation responses from process modeling by means of deep neural networks. We (i) quantified the future probability of regeneration failure; (ii) identified spatial hotspots of regeneration failure; and (iii) assessed how current forest types differ in their ability to regenerate under future climate and fire. We focused on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2.9 \u00d7 106 ha of forest) in the Rocky Mountains of the USA, which has experienced large wildfires in the past and is expected to undergo drastic changes in climate and fire in the future. We simulated four climate scenarios until 2100 at a fine spatial grain (100 m). Both wildfire activity and unstocked forest area increased substantially throughout the 21st century in all simulated scenarios. By 2100, between 28% and 59% of the forested area failed to regenerate, indicating considerable loss of resilience. Areas disproportionally at risk occurred where fires are not constrained by topography and in valleys aligned with predominant winds. High-elevation forest types not adapted to fire (i.e., Picea engelmannii-Abies lasiocarpa as well as non-serotinous Pinus contorta var. latifolia forests) were especially vulnerable to regeneration failure. We conclude that changing climate and fire could exceed the resilience of forests in a substantial portion of Greater Yellowstone, with profound implications for carbon, biodiversity, and recreation.Regenerative MedicineClimate ActionClimateClimate SciencesEcologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Adult VocalizationsAbney, Drew HWarlaumont, Anne SOller, D KimbroughWallot, SebastianKello, Christopher T2017-07-01The study of vocal coordination between infants and adults has led to important insights into the development of social, cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities. We used an automatic system to identify vocalizations produced by infants and adults over the course of the day for fifteen infants studied longitudinally during the first two years of life. We measured three different types of vocal coordination: coincidence-based, rate-based, and cluster-based. Coincidence-based and rate-based coordination are established measures in the developmental literature. Cluster-based coordination is new and measures the strength of matching in the degree to which vocalization events occur in hierarchically nested clusters. We investigated whether various coordination patterns differ as a function of vocalization type, whether different coordination patterns provide unique information about the dynamics of vocal interaction, and how the various coordination patterns each relate to infant age. All vocal coordination patterns displayed greater coordination for infant speech-related vocalizations, adults adapted the hierarchical clustering of their vocalizations to match that of infants, and each of the three coordination patterns had unique associations with infant age. Altogether, our results indicate that vocal coordination between infants and adults is multifaceted, suggesting a complex relationship between vocal coordination and the development of vocal communication.Behavioral and Social ScienceBasic Behavioral and Social SciencePediatriccoordination Density and Viscosity Prediction for Hydrocarbons: Learning and Molecular Dynamics SimulationsPanwar, PawanYang, QuanpengMartini, Ashlie2023-08-15Machine learning-based predictive models allow rapid and reliable prediction of material properties and facilitate innovative materials design. Base oils used in the formulation of lubricant products are complex hydrocarbons of varying sizes and structure. This study developed Gaussian process regression-based models to accurately predict the temperature-dependent density and dynamic viscosity of 305 complex hydrocarbons. In our approach, strongly correlated/collinear predictors were trimmed, important predictors were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization and prior domain knowledge, hyperparameters were systematically optimized by Bayesian optimization, and the models were interpreted. The approach provided versatile and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models with relatively simple predictors for determining the dynamic viscosity and density of complex hydrocarbons at any temperature. In addition, we developed molecular dynamics simulation-based descriptors and evaluated the feasibility and versatility of dynamic descriptors from simulations for predicting the material properties. It was found that the models developed using a comparably smaller pool of dynamic descriptors performed similarly in predicting density and viscosity to models based on many more static descriptors. The best models were shown to predict density and dynamic viscosity with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 99.6% and 97.7%, respectively, for all data sets, including a test data set of 45 molecules. Finally, partial dependency plots (PDPs), individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) values, and trimmed model R2 values were used to identify the most important static and dynamic predictors of the density and viscosity.Medicinal and Biomolecular #AllLivesMatterPowell, DSmaldino, Paul marked with the #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter hashtags, as well as how the presence or absence of those hashtags changed the meaning and subsequent interpretation of tweets in U.S. participants. We found a strong effect of partisanship on perceptions of the tweets, such that participants on the political left were more likely to view #AllLivesMatter tweets as racist and offensive, while participants on the political right were more likely to view #BlackLivesMatter tweets as racist and offensive. Moreover, we found that political identity explained evaluation results far better than other measured demographics. Additionally, to assess the influence of hashtags themselves, we removed them from tweets in which they originally appeared and added them to selected neutral tweets. Our results have implications for our understanding of how social identity, and particularly political identity, shapes how individuals perceive and engage with the world.HumansSocial MediaUnited StatesPoliticsRacismGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2wp893qwarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9cv7n7gk2023-08-29T14:31:00Zqt9cv7n7gkCounty-Level Segregation and Racial Disparities in COVID-19 OutcomesTrounstine, JessicaGoldman-Mellor, Sidra2023-04-01ContextSegregation has been linked to unequal life chances. Individuals from marginalized communities experience more crime, higher levels of poverty, poorer health, and less civic engagement. In addition, segregated metropolitan regions have been found to display inequality in access to basic services. This article builds on these findings by linking segregation to infection and deaths from COVID-19.MethodsUsing census data matched to COVID infection and death statistics at the county level, this article offers a theoretical basis for the researchers' choice of segregation measures and predictions for different racial groups. It analyzes the relationship between two dimensions of segregation-racial isolation and racial unevenness-and COVID outcomes for different racial and ethnic groups.FindingsIn counties where Black and Latino residents lived in more racially isolated neighborhoods, they were much more likely to contract COVID-19. This pattern was exacerbated in counties with a high proportion of frontline workers. In addition, racial segregation increased COVID-19 death rates for Black, Latino, and white residents.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that devastating outcomes of the coronavirus pandemic were linked to a long history of racial marginalization and entrenched discrimination produced by structural inequalities embedded in our geographies.

In cancer, aberrant histone methylation can facilitate oncogenic and tumor suppression programs by modulating gene expression. Histone remodelers such as lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases are seemingly opposite or contrary forces but may be part of an interconnected network complementing each other. We identify several layers of molecular communication where epigenetic master regulators engage in crosstalk between tumor metabolism and histone remodeling. Epigenetic master regulators have the ability to cooperate with members of the transcriptional machinery, DNA methyltransferases, as well as other histone modifiers. High-throughput sequencing and omics data in combination with cancer systems biology analysis have the power to prioritize regulatory events epigenome-wide.Human hybrid molecular imaging modality that combines the merits of both x-ray imaging (high resolution) and optical imaging (high sensitivity). In this study, we have evaluated the sensitivity of XLCT with phantom experiments by scanning targets of different phosphor concentrations at different depths. We found that XLCT is capable of imaging targets of very low concentrations (27.6 M or 0.01 mg/mL) at significant depths, such as 21 mm. Our results demonstrate that there is little variation in the reconstructed target size with a maximum target size error of 4.35% for different imaging depths for XLCT. We have, we believe for the first time, compared the sensitivity of XLCT with that of traditional computed tomography (CT) for phosphor targets. We found that XLCT's use of x-ray-induced photons provides much higher measurement sensitivity and contrast compared to CT, which provides image contrast solely based on x-ray attenuation.BioengineeringBiomedical ImagingOptical PhysicsElectrical and Electronic EngineeringMechanical EngineeringOpticsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, account for 40% of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). As 20 to 50% of hospitalized patients receive catheters, CAUTIs are one of the most common HAIs, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Candida albicans is the second most common CAUTI uropathogen, yet relative to its bacterial counterparts, little is known about how fungal CAUTIs are established. Here, we show that the catheterized bladder environment induces Efg1- and fibrinogen (Fg)-dependent biofilm formation that results in CAUTI. In addition, we identify the adhesin Als1 as the critical fungal factor for C. albicans Fg-urine biofilm formation. Furthermore, we show that in the catheterized bladder, a dynamic and open system, both filamentation and attachment are required, but each by themselves are not sufficient for infection. Our study unveils the mechanisms required for fungal CAUTI establishment, which may aid in the development of future therapies to prevent these infections.Infectious DiseasesUrologic Diseases2.1 Biological and University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rg635c1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4948q7mv2023-08-29T13:50:06Zqt4948q7mvAddTag, a two-step approach with supporting software package that editing is a powerful tool for genetic engineering, however, targeting constraints limit which loci are editable with this method. Since the length of a DNA sequence impacts the likelihood it overlaps a unique target site, precision editing of small genomic features with CRISPR/Cas remains an obstacle. We introduce a two-step genome editing strategy that virtually eliminates CRISPR/Cas targeting constraints and facilitates precision genome editing of elements as short as a single base-pair at virtually any locus in any organism that supports CRISPR/Cas-induced genome editing. Our two-step approach first replaces the locus of interest with an \"AddTag\" sequence, which is subsequently replaced with any engineered sequence, and thus circumvents the need for direct overlap with a unique CRISPR/Cas target site. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by editing transcription factor binding sites within Candida albicans that could not be targeted directly using the traditional gene-editing approach. We also demonstrate the utility of the AddTag approach for combinatorial genome editing and gene complementation analysis, and we present a software package that automates the design of AddTag editing.GeneticsHuman by sea star wasting disease and rapid genetic change in a keystone species, Pisaster ochraceusSchiebelhut, Lauren MPuritz, Jonathan BDawson, Michael N2018-07-03Standing genetic variation enables or restricts a population's capacity to respond to changing conditions, including the extreme disturbances expected to increase in frequency and intensity with continuing anthropogenic climate change. However, we know little about how populations might respond to extreme events with rapid genetic shifts, or how population dynamics may influence and be influenced by population genomic change. We use a range-wide epizootic, sea star wasting disease, that onset in mid-2013 and caused mass mortality in Pisaster ochraceus to explore how a keystone marine species responded to an extreme perturbation. We integrated field surveys with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data to (i) describe the population dynamics of mortality and recovery, and (ii) compare allele frequencies in mature P. ochraceus before the disease outbreak with allele frequencies in adults and new juveniles after the outbreak, to identify whether selection may have occurred. We found P. ochraceus suffered 81% mortality in the study region between 2012 and 2015, and experienced a concurrent 74-fold increase in recruitment beginning in late 2013. Comparison of pre- and postoutbreak adults revealed significant allele frequency changes at three loci, which showed consistent changes across the large majority of locations. Allele frequency shifts in juvenile P. ochraceus (spawned from premortality adults) were consistent with those seen in adult survivors. Such parallel shifts suggest detectable signals of selection and highlight the potential for persistence of this change in subsequent generations, which may influence the resilience of this keystone species to future parallel -diversity but contrasting -diversity patterns in a marine natural experimentRapacciuolo, GiovanniBeman, J MichaelSchiebelhut, Lauren MDawson, Michael N2019-10-09Documenting ecological patterns across spatially, temporally and taxonomically diverse ecological communities is necessary for a general understanding of the processes shaping biodiversity. A major gap in our understanding remains the comparison of diversity patterns across a broad spectrum of evolutionarily and functionally diverse organisms, particularly in the marine realm. Here, we aim to narrow this gap by comparing the diversity patterns of free-living microbes and macro-invertebrates across a natural experiment provided by the marine lakes of Palau: geographically discrete and environmentally heterogeneous bodies of seawater with comparable geological and climatic history, and a similar regional species pool. We find contrasting patterns of -diversity but remarkably similar patterns of -diversity between microbial and macro-invertebrate communities among lakes. Pairwise dissimilarities in community composition among lakes are positively correlated between microbes and macro-invertebrates, and influenced to a similar degree by marked gradients in oxygen concentration and salinity. Our findings indicate that a shared spatio-temporal and environmental context may result in parallel patterns of -diversity in microbes and macro-invertebrates, in spite of key trait differences between these organisms. This raises the possibility that parallel processes also influence transitions among regional biota across the tree of life, at least in the marine realm.AnimalsAquatic OrganismsBiodiversityBiological EvolutionBiotaEcologyEcosystemInvertebratesLakesSalinitySeawaterbiogeographymacroecologycommunity assemblymicrobesmacro-organismsBiological SciencesAgricultural and Veterinary SciencesMedical and Health University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/833871knarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt49x3x7mh2023-08-29T13:23:23Zqt49x3x7mhMechanistic insight into deep holes from interband generated from localized surface plasmon resonance is of widespread interest in the photocatalysis of metallic nanoparticles. However, hot holes, especially generated from interband transitions, have not been fully explored for photocatalysis yet. In this study, a photocatalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using mesoporous Pd nanoparticle photocatalyst served as a model to study the role of hot holes. Quantum yields of the photocatalysts increase under shorter wavelength excitations and correlate to \"deeper\" energy of the holes from the Fermi level. This work suggests that deeper holes in the d-band catalyze the oxidative addition of aryl halide at the nanoparticles' surface to form R-PdII-X complex, thus accelerating the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle. The hot electrons do not play a decisive role. In the future, catalytic mechanisms induced by deep holes should deserve as much attention as the well-known hot electron transfer mechanism.NanotechnologyBioengineeringCatalysisChemistryMaterials scienceapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/49x3x7mharticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2952d1bx2023-08-29T13:15:57Zqt2952d1bxReal-time large fluctuations in cognitive workload over seconds timescales that can lead to sub-optimal performance, ranging from overload to neglect. Adaptive automation could potentially address this issue, but to do so it needs to be aware of real-time changes in operators' spare cognitive capacity, so it can provide help in times of peak demand and take advantage of troughs to elicit operator engagement. However, it is unclear whether rapid changes in task demands are reflected in similarly rapid fluctuations in spare capacity, and if so what aspects of responses to those demands are predictive of the current level of spare capacity. We used the ISO standard detection response task (DRT) to measure cognitive workload approximately every 4 s in a demanding task requiring monitoring and refueling of a fleet of simulated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We showed that the DRT provided a valid measure that can detect differences in workload due to changes in the number of UAVs. We used cross-validation to assess whether measures related to task performance immediately preceding the DRT could predict detection performance as a proxy for cognitive workload. Although the simple occurrence of task events had weak predictive ability, composite measures that tapped operators' situational awareness with respect to fuel levels were much more effective. We conclude that cognitive workload does vary rapidly as a function of recent task events, and that real-time predictive models of operators' cognitive workload provide a potential avenue for automation to adapt without an ongoing need for intrusive workload measurements.Advance DirectivesAutomationAwarenessHumansTask Performance and and regulation of in human genome contains vast genetic diversity as naturally occurring coding variants, yet the impact of these variants on protein function and physiology is poorly understood. RGS14 is a multifunctional signaling protein that suppresses synaptic plasticity in dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons. RGS14 also is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, suggesting that balanced nuclear import/export and dendritic spine localization are essential for RGS14 functions. We identified genetic variants L505R (LR) and R507Q (RQ) located within the nuclear export sequence (NES) of human RGS14. Here we report that RGS14 encoding LR or RQ profoundly impacts protein functions in hippocampal neurons. RGS14 membrane localization is regulated by binding Gi-GDP, whereas RGS14 nuclear export is regulated by Exportin 1 (XPO1). Remarkably, LR and to and nucleocytoplasmic and capacity to inhibit LTP. Variant LR accumulates irreversibly in the nucleus, preventing RGS14 binding to Gi1, localization to dendritic spines, and inhibitory actions on LTP induction, while variant RQ exhibits a mixed phenotype. When introduced into mice by CRISPR/Cas9, RGS14-LR protein expression was detected predominantly in the nuclei of neurons within hippocampus, central amygdala, piriform cortex, and striatum, brain regions associated with learning and synaptic plasticity. Whereas mice completely lacking RGS14 exhibit enhanced spatial learning, mice carrying variant LR exhibit normal spatial learning, suggesting that RGS14 may have distinct functions in the nucleus independent from those in dendrites and spines. These findings show that naturally occurring genetic variants can profoundly alter normal protein function, impacting physiology in unexpected ways.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceNeurosciencesBehavioral and Social ScienceGenetics2.1 Biological and SciencesBiochemistry & Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7xb4h01spublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5mq1p1jz2023-08-29T11:58:06Zqt5mq1p1jzOptimizing spatial distribution DConklin, C2021-08-01Common methods for spatial distribution, such as hydrologic response units, are subjective, time-consuming, and fail to capture the full range of basin attributes. Recent advances in statistical-learning techniques allow for new approaches to this problem. We propose the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for spatial distribution of hydrologic models. GMMs objectively select the set of modeling locations that best represent the distribution of watershed features relevant to the hydrologic cycle. We demonstrate this method in two hydrologically distinct headwater catchments of the Sierra Nevada and show that it meets or exceeds the performance of traditionally distributed models for multiple metrics across the water balance at a fraction of the time cost. Finally, we use univariate GMMs to identify the most-important drivers of hydrologic processes in a basin. The GMM method allows for more robust, objective, and repeatable models, which are critical for advancing hydrologic research and operational decision making.Physically based chemical speciation adsorbed iron( iii ) on oxidized Valerie JForman, Henry JayO'Day, Peggy A2019-03-20Carbonaceous nanomaterials represent a significant portion of ultra-fine airborne particulate matter, and iron is the most abundant transition metal in air particles. Owing to their high surface area and atmospheric oxidation, carbon nanoparticles (CNP) are enriched with surface carbonyl functional groups and act as a host for metals and small molecules. Using a synthetic model, concentration-dependent changes in the chemical speciation of iron adsorbed on oxidized carbon surfaces were investigated by a combination of X-ray and electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods. Carbon K-edge absorption spectra demonstrated that the CNP surface was enriched with carboxylic acid groups after chemical oxidation but that microporosity was unchanged. Oxidized CNP showed a high affinity for sorption of Fe(iii) from solution (75-95% uptake) and spectroscopic measurements confirmed a 3+ oxidation state of Fe on CNP irrespective of surface loading. The bonding of adsorbed Fe(iii) at variable loadings was determined by iron K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. At low loadings (3 and 10 mol Fe m-2 CNP), mononuclear Fe was octahedrally coordinated to oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups. As Fe surface coverage increased (21 and 31 mol Fe m-2 CNP), Fe-Fe backscatters were observed at (oxy)hydroxide particle formation on CNP. Electron-donating surface carboxylate groups coordinated and stabilized Fe(iii). Saturation of high-affinity sites may have promoted hydroxide particle nucleation at higher loading, demonstrating that the chemical form of reactive metal ions may change with surface concentration and degree of CNP surface oxidation. Model systems such as those discussed here, with controlled surface properties and known chemical speciation of adsorbed metals, are needed to establish structure-activity models for toxicity assessments of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0kb5h464articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6p78s6kh2023-08-29T11:02:13Zqt6p78s6khEditorial: Everyday Beliefs About Emotion: Their Role in Subjective Experience, Emotion as an Interpersonal Process, and Emotion TheoryGonzalez, Manuel Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6p78s6khpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3fp4d80z2023-08-29T09:54:29Zqt3fp4d80zGenome-wide genetic variation coupled with demographic and ecological niche modeling of the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes) reveal patterns of deep divergence and widespread Holocene expansion across northern CaliforniaBoria, Robert ABrown, Sarah KMatocq, Marjorie DBlois, Jessica L2021-03-01Understanding how species have responded to past climate change may help refine projections of how species and biotic communities will respond to future change. Here, we integrate estimates of genome-wide genetic variation with demographic and niche modeling to investigate the historical biogeography of an important ecological engineer: the dusky-footed woodrat, Neotoma fuscipes. We use RADseq to generate a genome-wide dataset for 71 individuals from across the geographic distribution of the species in California. We estimate population structure using several model-based methods and infer the demographic history of regional populations using a site frequency spectrum-based approach. Additionally, we use ecological niche modeling to infer current and past (Last Glacial Maximum) environmental suitability across the species' distribution. Finally, we estimate the directionality and possible spatial origins of regional population expansions. Our analyses indicate this species is subdivided into three regionally distinct populations, with the deepest divergence occurring ~1.7 million years ago across the modern-day San Francisco-Bay Delta region; a common biogeographic barrier for the flora and fauna of California. Our models of environmental suitability through time coincide with our estimates of population expansion, with relative long-term stability in the southern portion of the range, and more recent expansion into the northern end of the range. Our study illustrates how the integration of genome-wide data with spatial and demographic modeling can reveal the timing and spatial extent of historic events that determine patterns of biotic diversity and may help predict biotic response to future change.Life on LandAnimalsDemographyEcosystemGenetic VariationHumansPhylogenySigmodontinaeEvolutionary BiologyGeneticsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3fp4d80zarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt23w0q2cb2023-08-29T09:29:26Zqt23w0q2cbVariability of Organophosphorous Pesticide Metabolite Levels in Spot and 24-hr Urine Samples Collected from Young Children during 1 metabolites in spot urine samples are frequently used to characterize children's exposures to organophosphorous (OP) pesticides. However, variable exposure and short biological half-lives of OP pesticides could result in highly variable measurements, leading to exposure misclassification.ObjectiveWe examined within- and between-child variability in DAP metabolites in urine samples collected during 1 week.MethodsWe collected spot urine samples over 7 consecutive days from 25 children (3-6 years of age). On two of the days, we collected 24-hr voids. We assessed the reproducibility of urinary DAP metabolite concentrations and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of spot urine samples as predictors of high (top 20%) or elevated (top DAP metabolite concentrations.ResultsWithin-child variance exceeded between-child variance by a factor of two to eight, depending on metabolite grouping. Although total DAP concentrations in single spot urine samples were moderately to strongly associated with concentrations in same-day 24-hr samples (r 0.6-0.8, p < 0.01), concentrations in spot samples collected > 1 day apart and in 24-hr samples collected 3 days apart were weakly correlated (r -0.21 to 0.38). Single spot samples predicted high (top 20%) and elevated (top 40%) full-week average total DAP excretion with only moderate sensitivity ( 0.52 and 0.67, but relatively high specificity ( high variability DAP metabolite concentrations suggests that single-day urine samples provide only a brief snapshot of exposure.

Evidence that vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time points to the need for COVID-19 booster vaccines, and maximum compliance is required to maintain population-level immunity. Little is known of the correlates of intentions to receive booster vaccines among previously vaccinated individuals. The present study applied an integrated model to examine effects of beliefs from multiple social cognition theories alongside sets of generalized, stable beliefs on individuals' booster vaccine intentions. US residents (N = 479) recruited from an online survey panel completed measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and risk perceptions), generalized beliefs (vaccine hesitancy, political orientation, and free will beliefs), and COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Social cognition constructs were related to booster vaccine intentions, with attitude and subjective norms exhibiting the largest effects. Effects of vaccine hesitancy, political orientation, and free will beliefs on intentions were mediated by the social cognition constructs, and only vaccine hesitancy had a small residual effect on intentions. Findings provide preliminary evidence that contributes to an evidence base of potential targets for intervention messages aimed at promoting booster vaccine intentions.PreventionImmunizationVaccine RelatedClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social Science3.4 VaccinesPrevention of disease of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1833h446articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6dm7q7g82023-08-29T08:01:14Zqt6dm7q7g8Modality use in joint attention between hearing parents and deaf childrenDepowski, NicoleAbaya, HomerOghalai, JohnBortfeld, Heather2015-01-01The present study examined differences in modality use during episodes of joint attention between hearing parent-hearing child dyads and hearing parent-deaf child dyads. Hearing children were age-matched to deaf children. Dyads were video recorded in a free play session with analyses focused on uni- and multimodality use during joint attention episodes. Results revealed that adults in hearing parent-deaf child dyads spent a significantly greater proportion of time interacting with their children using multiple communicative modalities than adults in hearing parent-hearing child dyads, who tended to use the auditory modality (e.g., oral language) most often. While these findings demonstrate that hearing parents accommodate their children's hearing status, we observed greater overall time spent in joint attention in hearing parent-hearing child dyads than hearing parent-deaf child dyads. Our results point to important avenues for future research on how parents can better accommodate their child's hearing status through the use Our experimental and computational investigations suggest that dispersive interactions between the indole and styrene preorganize substrates such that 6-membered ring formation is preferred, apparently via concerted protonation and C-C bond formation. When dispersion is attenuated (by a substituent or heteroatom), regioselectivity erodes and competing oligomerization predominates for cis substrates.

Over the last decade, compelling genetic evidence has accumulated for multiple independent evolutionary lineages, spurring the need for taxonomic revision. On the island of Santa Cruz there is currently a single named species, C. porteri. Recent genetic and morphological studies have shown that, within this taxon, there are two evolutionarily and spatially distinct lineages on the western and eastern sectors of the island, known as the Reserva and Cerro Fatal populations, respectively. Analyses of DNA from natural populations and museum specimens, including the type specimen for C. porteri, confirm the genetic distinctiveness of these two lineages and support elevation of the Cerro Fatal tortoises to the rank of species. In this paper, we identify DNA characters that define this new species, and infer evolutionary relationships relative to other species of Galapagos other-focused resiliency: Plausible mechanisms linking early family adversity to health problems in college womenColeman, Sulamunn RMZawadzki, Matthew JHeron, Kristin EVartanian, study examined whether self-focused and other-focused resiliency help explain how early family adversity relates to perceived stress, subjective health, and health behaviors in college women.ParticipantsFemale students (N = 795) participated between October 2009 and May 2010.MethodsParticipants completed self-report measures of early family adversity, self-focused (self-esteem, personal growth initiative) and other-focused (perceived social support, gratitude) resiliency, stress, subjective health, and health behaviors.ResultsUsing structural equation modeling, self-focused resiliency associated with less stress, better subjective health, more sleep, less smoking, and less weekend alcohol consumption. Other-focused resiliency associated with more exercise, greater stress, and more weekend alcohol consumption. Early family adversity was indirectly related to all health outcomes, except smoking, via self-focused and other-focused resiliency.ConclusionsSelf-focused and other-focused resiliency represent plausible mechanisms through which early family adversity relates to stress and health in college women.

Results suggested that cultural orientations were primarily associated with parents' self-reported expressivity (rather than observed emotional expression), such that higher American orientations were generally associated with higher expressivity. Although parents' self-reported expressivity was only related to their own reports of children's regulation, parents' observed emotional expression was related to both parents' and teachers' reports of children's regulation. These results suggest that self-reported expressivity and observed emotional expression reflect different constructs and have differential relations to parents' cultural orientations and children's regulation.PediatricBehavioral and Social albicans most common fungal pathogens of humans. Prior work introduced the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea as a new model system to study the host response to fungal infection at the organismal level. In the current study, we analyzed host-pathogen changes that occurred in situ during early infection with C. albicans. We found that the transcription factor Bcr1 and its downstream adhesin Als3 are required for C. albicans to adhere to and colonize the planarian epithelial surface, and that adherence of C. albicans triggers a multi-system host response that is mediated by the Dectin signaling pathway. This infection response is characterized by two peaks of stem cell divisions and transcriptional changes in differentiated tissues including the nervous and the excretory systems. This response bears some resemblance to a wound-like response to physical injury; however, it takes place without visible tissue damage and it engages a distinct set of progenitor cells. Overall, we identified two C. albicans proteins that mediate epithelial infection of planarians and a comprehensive host response facilitated by diverse tissues to effectively clear the infection.Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-HumanInfectious DiseasesStem Cell Research2.1 Biological and most common fungal pathogens of humans.

However, such tests may overlook or misidentify the impact of candidate factors on genetic structure, especially when connectivity patterns differ between past and present populations because of shifting environmental conditions over time. Here we account for the underlying demographic component of population connectivity associated with a temporarily dynamic landscape in tests of the factors structuring population genetic variation in an Australian lizard, Lerista lineopunctulata, from 24 nuclear loci. Correlative tests did not support significant effect from factors associated with a static contemporary landscape. However, spatially explicit demographic modeling of genetic differentiation shows that changes in environmental conditions (as estimated from paleoclimatic data) and corresponding distributional shifts from the past to present landscape significantly structures genetic variation. Results from model-based inference (i.e., from an integrative modeling approach that generates spatially explicit expectations that are tested with approximate Bayesian computation) contrasts with those from correlative analyses, highlighting the importance of expanding the landscape genetic perspective to tests the links between pattern and process, revealing how factors shape patterns of genetic variation within species.Human and niche divergence within threatened Gal\u00e1pagos giant southern Isabela IslandEdwards, DLGarrick, RCTapia, WCaccone, Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoises are an icon for both human-mediated biodiversity losses and conservation management successes, populations of two species on southern Isabela Island (Chelonoidis guntheri, and C. vicina) remain threatened by hunting and persistence of feral animals. Conservation management of these tortoises has been hampered by lack of clarity regarding their taxonomy, ecological and morphological diversity, and the spatial distribution of evolutionarily significant units that may exist. Analyses of 16 microsatellite loci did not group samples according to current taxonomy. Instead, three (rather than two) genetic clusters were revealed. We show that the three regions of southern Isabela associated with these genetic clusters are significantly different in their ecological niches, which could suggest that ecological divergence may have shaped patterns of genetic differentiation in these tortoises. Furthermore, results suggest limited recent gene flow among sampled localities and between each of the three regions associated with genetic clusters. We discuss the need for further research on the ecological factors shaping the genetic and morphological diversity of southern Isabela tortoises. We suggest that current strategies whereby populations are managed separately are warranted pending further study, but due to mixed ancestry we recommend that Cerro Paloma tortoises be excluded from Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5w53g5k8articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2cn7m10v2023-08-29T07:01:32Zqt2cn7m10vMorphological differentiation correlates with ecological but not with genetic divergence in a Gehyra geckoSISTROM, MEDWARDS, DLDONNELLAN, SHUTCHINSON, M2012-04-01Body size affects life history, the ecological niche of an organism and its interactions with other organisms. Resultantly, marked differences in body size between related organisms are often an indication of a species boundary. This is particularly evident in the Gehyra variegata species complex of geckos, which displays differential body sizes between genetically divergent species, but high levels of intraspecific morphological conservatism. We report on a Gehyra population that displays extraordinary body size differentiation in comparison with other G. variegata species. We used morphological and environmental data to show this population is phenotypically and ecologically distinct from its parapatric congener Gehyra lazelli that morphology correlated. Contrastingly, mtDNA analysis indicates paraphyly between the two groups, and allele frequencies at six microsatellite loci show no population structure concordant with morpho-/ecotype. These results suggest either ecological speciation or environmentally induced phenotypic polymorphism, ISOLATION BY ENVIRONMENT OR DISTANCE: WHICH PATTERN OF GENE FLOW IS MOST COMMON?Sexton, Jason PHangartner, Sandra BHoffmann, Ary A2014-01-01Gene flow among populations can enhance local adaptation if it introduces new genetic variants available for selection, but strong gene flow can also stall adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes. These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow patterns may align with geographic distance (IBD--isolation by distance), whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic \"gene-swamping\" scenario. Here we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of IBD in 20.0%, IBE in 37.1%, and both patterns in 37.1%. In addition, 10.0% of studies exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3% showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow. It also precludes gene swamping as a widespread phenomenon. Implications for evolutionary processes and management under rapidly changing environments (e.g., climate change) are discussed.GeneticsAnimalsClimate ChangeEnvironmentEvolutionMolecularGene fluctuations shape the phylogeography of a mesic directdeveloping frog from the southwestern Australian hotspotEdwards, Danielle LRoberts, J DaleKeogh, J Scott2008-10-01To assess phylogeographic pattern throughout the range of Metacrinia nichollsi in order to develop specific biogeographical hypotheses for the wet forests of south-western Australia. This was carried out by contrasting a direct-developing frog species, M. nichollsi, that breeds independently of free surface water with conventional, aquatic breeders and highly specialized direct developers. Wet forests of the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot - an area of high species richness and endemism for myobatrachid frogs and many other faunal groups. We compiled an extensive phylogeographic data set from field-collected samples based on mitochondrial ND2 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses combined with estimates of divergence times were used to build a model of major biogeographical events affecting the species. Phylogeographic analyses were used to provide insights into smaller-scale processes acting within each major lineage. Phylogenetic analysis recovered three major lineages, with divergence dates coincident with late Miocene-early Pliocene arid cycles. One lineage was confined to geographically isolated populations in the Stirling Ranges (Stirling Ranges Lineage, SRL). The continuous range of M. nichollsi was split into two: the Main Range Lineage (MRL) and the Southern Coastal Lineage (SCL). The SCL displays a strong drainage-based population structure, whereas the MRL displays a strong signature of recent expansion, suggesting that these two lineages have had very different biogeographical histories. Late Miocene-Pliocene aridity appears to have isolated populations in the Stirling Ranges and resulted in the formation of two additional lineages on a north-south gradient that are independent of southward-flowing drainage systems. Our results demonstrate that climatic fluctuations are likely to have generated fine-scale phylogeographic structure within M. nichollsi and that catchment regions of Lonesome George survives: Giant tortoises with Pinta Island ancestry identified in the last known purebred individual of Chelonoidis abingdoni native to Pinta Island, marked the extinction of one of 10 surviving giant tortoise species from the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. Using a DNA reference dataset including historical C. abingdoni and >1600 living Volcano Wolf tortoise samples, a site on Isabela Island known to harbor hybrid tortoises, we discovered 17 individuals with ancestry in C. abingdoni. These animals belong to various hybrid categories, including possible first generation hybrids, and represent multiple, unrelated individuals. Their ages and relative abundance suggest that additional hybrids and conceivably purebred C. abingdoni individuals still occur on Volcano Wolf. Spatial analyses suggest locations where additional individuals with C. abingdoni ancestry are most likely to be recovered, consistent with historical records of human movement of tortoises.

The region contains a high number of endemic species, ranging from Gondwanan relicts to much more recently evolved plant and animal species. Myobatrachid frogs are diverse in southwestern Australia, and while we know they have speciated in situ in the southwest, we know little about the temporal and geographical patterning of speciation events. Crinia georgiana is an ideal subject to test hypotheses concerning the effect of climatic history on southwestern Australian anurans, as it is an old lineage with a broad distribution covering the entire region. We compiled an extensive phylogeographical data set based on 1085 bp of the mitochondrial gene ND2 for 68 individuals from 18 sites across the species' range. Two major genetic clades were identified which were largely confined to the high rainfall and southeast coastal biogeographical zones, respectively. The clades appear to have diverged around the Plio-Pleistocene border (1.26-1.72 million years ago), concordant with increasing intensity and frequency of arid climate cycles. Subsequent phylogeographical structure appears to have developed primarily during the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations that also have been integral in generating species diversity in the endemic southwestern Australian flora. Phylogeographical analyses identified several dispersal routes, possible refugial areas within the range of the species and also regions of secondary contact. Dispersal routes identified may now be closed to the species because of habitat destruction and salinity problems in inland regions, posing concerns about the evolutionary potential of the species in light of predicted sclerostin (SOST), has been approved for treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at a high risk for fracture. Previous work in sclerostin global knockout (Sost-/-) mice indicated alterations in immune cell development in the bone marrow (BM), which could be a possible side effect in romosozumab-treated patients. Here, we examined the effects of short-term sclerostin depletion in the BM on hematopoiesis in young mice receiving sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab) treatment for 6 weeks, and the effects of long-term Sost deficiency on wild-type (WT) long-term hematopoietic stem cells transplanted into older cohorts of Sost-/- mice. Our analyses revealed an increased frequency of granulocytes in the BM of Scl-Ab-treated mice bias extended to extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and was correlated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1, and MCP-1 in Sost-/- BM serum. observed alterations in erythrocyte differentiation in the BM and spleen of Sost-/- mice. Taken together, our current study indicates novel roles for Sost in the regulation of myelopoiesis and control of inflammation in the BM.Stem Cell ResearchOsteoporosisStem Cell Research - SciencesChemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wc135k1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4486c5sk2023-08-29T06:09:57Zqt4486c5skDepressive Symptoms and Momentary Mood Predict Momentary Pain Among Rheumatoid Arthritis PatientsGraham-Engeland, Jennifer EZawadzki, Matthew JSlavish, Danica CSmyth, Joshua M2016-02-01BackgroundAlthough a relationship between mood and pain has been established cross-sectionally, little research has examined this relationship using momentary within-person data.PurposeWe examined whether baseline depressive symptoms and within-person levels of negative and positive mood predicted momentary pain among 31 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).MethodsDepressive symptomatology was measured at baseline. Mood and RA symptoms were self-reported via ecological momentary assessment five times a day for seven consecutive days. Analyses controlled for gender, age, weekend day, time of day, and experiences of stress.ResultsGreater momentary positive mood was associated with less momentary pain and fewer arthritis-related restrictions; negative mood was associated with more restrictions. Greater depressive symptomatology also predicted more pain and restrictions, an effect which was not accounted for by mood.ConclusionsResults suggest that both depression and mood are uniquely associated with momentary pain; as such, multi-component interventions may provide Healthapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4486c5skarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9fc1s68s2023-08-29T06:08:53Zqt9fc1s68sIndividual Differences and Day-to-Day Fluctuations in Perceived Self-Regulation Associated With Daily Adherence in Late Adolescents With Type 1 DiabetesBerg, Cynthia AWiebe, whether individual and intraindividual (within-person day-to-day) fluctuations in late adolescents' self-regulation were associated with daily adherence to the type 1 diabetes regimen. Methods 110 school seniors (M age = 17.78 years) and their mothers assessed adolescents' skills underlying self-regulation (executive function, attention, self-control, behavioral inhibition and activation, emotion regulation) and adherence, with glycosylated hemoglobin from medical records. Teens completed daily diaries reporting self-regulation failures surrounding monitoring blood glucose, adherence, and number of blood glucose checks each day for 14 days. Results Hierarchical Linear Models indicated that better daily adherence was associated with teen and mother reports of better self-regulation skills and teens' reports of fewer daily self-regulation failures. Daily adherence was unrelated to temperamental differences in behavioral inhibition and activation. Conclusions Results indicate that both individual and intraindividual differences in self-regulation contribute to daily adherence highlighting the importance of daily self-regulatory challenges to adherence.DiabetesBehavioral and Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9fc1s68sarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1m4353zs2023-08-29T06:08:46Zqt1m4353zsLongitudinal Trajectories of Illness Perceptions Among Adolescents With Type 1 J2014-08-01ObjectivesTo examine development in illness perceptions of type 1 diabetes across adolescence and relationships with intelligence, diabetes responsibility, and diabetes outcomes.MethodsIllness perceptions were measured via the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire at 3 times, every 6 months in 213 adolescents (M age = 13.00; SD = 1.54) with type 1 diabetes. Intelligence and adolescents' perceived responsibility for diabetes were examined, and adolescents' report of adherence and quality of life (QOL), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from medical records addressed diabetes-related outcomes.ResultsLinear growth models showed significant increases in perceptions of diabetes coherence, chronicity, consequences, personal and treatment control, and decreases in diabetes cyclicality and parental control across time. More favorable illness perceptions were generally associated with adolescent intelligence at baseline, more adolescent responsibility for management, better adherence and QOL, and lower HbA1c at each time point.ConclusionsResults suggest that adolescents develop complex illness perceptions, which are associated with better diabetes management.DiabetesAutoimmune DiseasePediatricBehavioral and Social ScienceManagement of diseases and Bacteriophage Isolation and Preparation for Viral MetagenomicsGrasis, Juris A2018-01-01Prokaryotic viruses, or bacteriophages, are viruses that infect bacteria and archaea. These viruses have been known to associate with host systems for decades, yet only recently have their influence on the regulation of host-associated bacteria been appreciated. These studies have been conducted in many host systems, from the base of animal life in the Cnidarian phylum to mammals. These prokaryotic viruses are useful for regulating the number of bacteria in a host ecosystem and for regulating the strains of bacteria useful for the microbiome. These viruses are likely selected by the host to maintain bacterial populations. Viral metagenomics allows researchers to profile the communities of viruses associating with animal hosts, and importantly helps to determine the functional role these viruses play. Further, viral metagenomics show the sphere of viral involvement in gene flow and gene shuffling in an ever-changing host environment. The influence of prokaryotic viruses could, therefore, have a clear impact on host health.Infectious DiseasesGeneticsEmerging Infectious DiseasesAetiology2.2 Factors University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3685k1vwpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2s10m6j22023-08-29T05:49:38Zqt2s10m6j2Assessment of prediction methods for protein structures determined by NMR information about protein conformations in solution. In CASP14, three reference structures provided by solution NMR methods were available (T1027, T1029, and T1055), as well as a fourth data set of NMR-derived contacts for an integral membrane protein (T1088). For the three targets with NMR-based structures, the best prediction results ranged from very good (GDT_TS = 0.90, for T1055) to poor (GDT_TS = 0.47, for T1029). We explored the basis of these results by comparing all CASP14 prediction models against experimental NMR data. For T1027, NMR data reveal extensive internal dynamics, presenting a unique challenge for protein structure prediction methods. The analysis of T1029 motivated exploration of a novel method of \"inverse structure determination,\" in which an AlphaFold2 model was used to guide NMR data analysis. NMR data provided to CASP predictor groups for target T1088, a 238-residue integral membrane porin, was also used to assess several NMR-assisted prediction methods. Most groups involved in this exercise generated similar beta-barrel models, with good agreement with the experimental data. However, as was also observed in CASP13, some pure prediction groups that did not use any NMR data generated models for T1088 that better fit the NMR data than the models generated using these experimental data. These results demonstrate the remarkable power of modern methods to predict structures of proteins with accuracies rivaling solution NMR structures, and that it is now possible to reliably use prediction models to guide and complement experimental NMR University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2s10m6j2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4wj350nf2023-08-29T05:32:13Zqt4wj350nfGenome-Wide Assessment of Diversity and Divergence Among Extant Galapagos Giant SpeciesMiller, DannyCaccone, Adalgisa2018-08-24Genome-wide assessments allow for fuller characterization of genetic diversity, finer-scale population delineation, and better detection of demographically significant units to guide conservation compared with those based on \"traditional\" markers. Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) have long provided a case study for how evolutionary genetics may be applied to advance species conservation. Ongoing efforts to bolster tortoise populations, which have declined by 90%, have been informed by analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence and microsatellite genotypic data, but could benefit from genome-wide markers. Taking this next step, we used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing to collect genotypic data at >26000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 117 individuals representing all recognized extant Galapagos giant tortoise species. We then quantified genetic diversity, population structure, and compared results to estimates from mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci. Our analyses detected 12 genetic lineages concordant with the 11 named species as well as previously described structure within one species, C. becki. Furthermore, the SNPs provided increased resolution, detecting admixture in 4 individuals. SNP-based estimates of diversity and differentiation were significantly correlated with those derived from nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences. The SNP toolkit presented here will serve as a resource for advancing efforts to understand tortoise evolution, species radiations, and aid conservation of the Galapagos die-off hotter-drought fingerprint for forests face grave challenges in the Anthropocene, including hotter droughts increasingly associated with widespread forest die-off events. But despite the vital importance of forests to global ecosystem services, their fates in a warming world remain highly uncertain. Lacking is quantitative determination of commonality in climate anomalies associated with pulses of tree mortality-from published, field-documented mortality events-required for understanding the role of extreme climate events in overall global tree die-off patterns. Here we established a geo-referenced global database documenting climate-induced mortality events spanning all tree-supporting biomes and continents, from 154 peer-reviewed studies since 1970. Our analysis quantifies a global \"hotter-drought fingerprint\" from these tree-mortality sites-effectively a hotter and drier climate signal for tree mortality-across 675 locations encompassing 1,303 plots. Frequency of these observed mortality-year climate conditions strongly increases nonlinearly under projected warming. Our database also provides initial footing for further community-developed, quantitative, ground-based monitoring of global tree mortality.Good Health and Well BeingClimate ActionClimate ChangeDroughtsEcosystemForestsTreespubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2459p914articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9n54f0h72023-08-29T05:10:07Zqt9n54f0h7Stand-replacing wildfires increase nitrification for decades in southwestern ponderosa pine forestsKurth, Valerie JHart, Stephen CRoss, Christopher SKaye, Jason PFul\u00e9, Peter Z2014-05-01Stand-replacing wildfires are a novel disturbance within ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the southwestern United States, and they can convert forests to grasslands or shrublands for decades. While most research shows that soil inorganic N pools and fluxes return to pre-fire levels within a few years, we wondered if vegetation conversion (ponderosa pine to bunchgrass) following stand-replacing fires might be accompanied by a long-term shift in N cycling processes. Using a 34-year stand-replacing wildfire chronosequence with paired, adjacent unburned patches, we examined the long-term dynamics of net and gross nitrogen (N) transformations. We hypothesized that N availability in burned patches would become more similar to those in unburned patches over time after fire as these areas become re-vegetated. Burned patches had higher net and gross nitrification rates than unburned patches (P < 0.01 for both), and nitrification accounted for a greater proportion of N mineralization in burned patches for both net (P < 0.01) and gross (P < 0.04) N transformation measurements. However, trends with time-after-fire were not observed for any other variables. Our findings contrast with previous work, which suggested that high nitrification rates are a short-term response to disturbance. Furthermore, high nitrification rates at our site were not simply correlated with the presence of herbaceous vegetation. Instead, we suggest that stand-replacing wildfire triggers a shift in N cycling that is maintained for at least three decades by various factors, including a shift from a woody to an herbaceous ecosystem and the presence of of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9n54f0h7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1sg453hd2023-08-29T05:05:26Zqt1sg453hdCritical Loads of Acid Deposition for Wilderness Lakes in the Sierra Nevada (California) Estimated by the Steady-State Water Chemistry ModelShaw, Glenn E2014-01-01Major ion chemistry (2000-2009) from 208 lakes (342 sample dates and 600 samples) in class I and II wilderness areas of the Sierra Nevada was used in the Steady-State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model to estimate critical loads for acid deposition and investigate the current vulnerability of high elevation lakes to acid deposition. The majority of the lakes were dilute (mean specific conductance=8.0 ?S cm?1) and characterized 56.8 ?eq L?1). Two variants of the SSWC model were employed: (1) one model used the F-factor and (2) the alternate model used empirical estimates of atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering rates. A comparison between the results from both model variants resulted in a nearly 1:1 slope and an R2 value of 0.98, suggesting that the deposition and mineral weathering rates used were appropriate.Using anANClimit of 10 ?eq L?1, both models predicted a median critical load value of 149 eq ha?1 year?1 of H+ for granitic catchments. Median were ?81 and ?77 eq ha?1 year?1, respectively. Based on the F-factor and empirical models, 36 (17 %) and 34 (16 %) lakes exceeded their critical loads for acid deposition. Our analyses suggest that high elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada have not fully recovered from the effects of acid deposition despite substantial improvement in air quality since the 1970s. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business staggered time discretization of linear elastodynamics in stress-velocity form to systems involving internal variables subjected to a possibly non-linear dissipative evolution is proposed. The original scheme is thus enhanced by another step for the internal variables which, in general, is implicit, although even this step might be explicit if no spatial gradients of the internal variables are involved. Using an abstract Banach-space formulation,a prioriestimates and convergence are proved under a CFL condition. The developed three-step scheme finds applications in various problems of continuum mechanics at small strain. Here, we consider in particular plasticity, viscoelasticity (creep), today's letters have checks inside\" is often interpreted to mean that not all of today's letters have checks inside. In previous work, Goodman and Stuhlm\u00fcller (G&S) proposed a model that predicts that this implicature should depend on the speaker's knowledgeability: If the speaker has only examined some of the available letters (e.g., two of three letters), people are less likely to infer that \"some\" implies \"not all\" than if the speaker has examined all of the available letters. G&S also provided behavioral evidence in support of their model. In this paper, we first show that a simple extension of G&S's model (1) predicts G&S's knowledgeability effects, and in addition, (2) predicts that the knowledgeability effect will be reduced when the speaker's usage indicates numeral alternatives are available. We tested the new model's predictions in four preregistered experiments. All experiments supported the first model prediction, replicating G&S's finding of a main effect of the speaker's knowledge. Further, Experiments 2 and 4 supported the second model prediction showing that the words that a speaker tends to use affect the strength of scalar implicature that comprehenders make. In particular, when the speaker has partial knowledge (e.g., has only examined two of three letters), comprehenders think that \"some\" is more likely to mean \"not all\" when the speaker also tends to produce number words in similar sentences (e.g., \"2 of today's rooms have working smoke detectors.\"). These results have important ramifications for theories of meaning: the context beyond the sentence (e.g., the speaker's tendency to use particular words) affects the set of alternatives that comprehenders consider when inferring meaning.HumansComprehensionLanguageKnowledgeScalar implicatureRational production involves selecting and assembling words and syntactic structures to convey one's message. Here we probe this process by analyzing natural language productions of individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and healthy individuals. Based on prior neuropsychological observations, we hypothesize that patients who have difficulty producing complex syntax might choose semantically richer words to make their meaning clear, whereas patients with lexicosemantic deficits may choose more complex syntax. To evaluate this hypothesis, we first introduce a frequency-based method for characterizing the syntactic complexity of naturally produced utterances. We then show that lexical and syntactic complexity, as measured by their frequencies, are negatively correlated in a large (n = 79) PPA population. We then show that this syntax-lexicon trade-off is also present in the utterances of healthy speakers (n = 99) taking part in a picture description task, suggesting that it may be a general property of the process by which humans turn thoughts into speech.Frontotemporal Show a Curse of Knowledge in False-Belief Reasoning? A Robust Estimate of the True Effect SizeRyskin, Rachel ABrown-Schmidt, SarahSenju, Atsushi2014-01-01Seven experiments use large sample sizes to robustly estimate the effect size of a previous finding that adults are more likely to commit egocentric errors in a false-belief task when the egocentric response is plausible in light of their prior knowledge. We estimate the true effect size to be less than half of that reported in the original findings. Even though we found effects in the same direction as the original, they were substantively smaller; the original study would have had less than 33% power to detect an effect of this magnitude. The influence of plausibility on the curse of knowledge in adults appears to be small enough that its impact on real-life perspective-taking may need to be reevaluated.Behavioral and Social and Social ScienceAdultCognitionConcept FormationCultureHumansJudgmentKnowledge SolvingReality TestingGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7sc763xnarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt81n442f02023-08-29T04:28:46Zqt81n442f0Adolescent Disclosure to Parents and Daily Management of Type 1 DiabetesBerg, Cynthia AQueen, TaraButner, Jonathan JBerg, Deborah J Wiebe and Grayson N Holmbeck Guest Editors Cynthia A Gerhardt Cynthia A2017-01-01OBJECTIVE : To examine how adolescents' daily disclosure to parents about type 1 diabetes management may foster a process whereby parents gain knowledge and are viewed as helpful in ways that may aid diabetes management. METHODS: A total of 236 late adolescents (M age = 17.76) completed a 14-day diary where they reported daily disclosure to, and solicitation from, their parents, how knowledgeable and helpful parents were, and their self-regulation failures and adherence; blood glucose was gathered from meters. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that adolescent disclosure occurred in the context of greater parent solicitation and face-to-face contact and was positively associated with adolescents' perceptions of parental knowledge and helpfulness. Disclosure to mothers (but not to fathers) was associated with better diabetes management (fewer self-regulation failures, better adherence). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent disclosure may be an important way that parents remain knowledgeable about diabetes management and provide assistance that serves to support diabetes management.PediatricPreventionDiabetesMetabolic Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/81n442f0articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7j33z5bx2023-08-29T04:07:19Zqt7j33z5bxGlypican 4 and Mmp14 interact in regulating the migration of anterior endodermal cells limiting layers, including the endoderm, undergo convergence and extension movements to narrow and elongate the body plan. In zebrafish, the dorsal migration of endodermal cells during gastrulation is controlled by chemokine signaling, but little is known about how they migrate during segmentation. Here, we show that glypican 4 (Gpc4), a member of the heparin sulfate proteoglycan family, is required for efficient migration of anterior endodermal cells during early segmentation, regulating Rac activation to maintain polarized actin-rich lamellipodia. An endoderm transplantation assay showed that Gpc4 regulates endoderm migration in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. Further analyses revealed that the impaired endoderm migration in gpc4 mutants results from increases in the expression and assembly of fibronectin and laminin, major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Notably, we found that matrix metalloproteinase 14 (Mmp14a/b) is required for the control of ECM expression during endoderm migration, with Gpc4 acting through Mmp14a/b to limit ECM expression. Our results suggest that Gpc4 is crucial for generating the environment required for efficient migration of endodermal cells, uncovering a novel function of Gpc4 during development.PediatricUnderpinning research1.1 Normal Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7j33z5bxarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3zk7076k2023-08-29T03:49:28Zqt3zk7076kEnhancing Health Message Framing With Metaphor and Cultural Values: Impact on Latinas' Cervical Cancer ScreeningSpina, MelissaArndt, JamieLandau, Linda D2018-02-05BackgroundAn integration of message framing and sociocultural literature suggests that ethnic health disparities may be reduced by incorporating minority groups' cultural values into persuasive health messages. Framing messages with metaphors represents one promising strategy for harnessing cultural values to change health outcomes. Still, the effectiveness of metaphoric health messages in minority populations has received virtually no empirical attention.PurposeTo fill this gap, the present study tested whether a health message using a cancer-screening metaphor targeting collectivism and familism values would engage individual differences in these values to predict Papanicolaou (Pap) smear intentions among Latinas.MethodsLatina women (N = 168) completed an online survey including measures of collectivism and familism. They were randomized to read a message about Pap smears featuring the metaphor the body is a family or no metaphor before reporting their Pap smear intentions.ResultsRegression analyses revealed a pattern of interactions suggesting metaphoric messages engage targeted cultural values: For Latinas reading the family metaphor message, collectivism and familism positively predicted Pap smear intentions, whereas for Latinas reading the no-metaphor message, these values did not predict intentions.ConclusionsThis study offers a foundation for further examination of the potential for metaphoric health messages that connect to cultural values to reduce ethnic health disparities.

However, their functional plasticity, developmental diversity, and multitude of differentiation pathways complicate in vitro generation. Fortunately, there is a vast pool of untapped knowledge from in vivo studies that can guide in vitro engineering. This review highlights the in vivo genesis of mural cells from progenitor populations to recruitment pathways to maturation and identity with an emphasis on how this knowledge is applicable to in vitro models of stem cell differentiation.Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-HumanStem Cell of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/52q5f4j6articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt52x9670s2023-08-29T03:30:59Zqt52x9670sThe impact of school-entry mandates on social inequalities in human papillomavirus vaccinationPolonijo, Andrea N2020-12-01Fundamental cause theory (FCT) is influential for explaining the enduring relationship between social position and health, yet few empirical studies test FCT's contention that policy supporting the equal distribution of interventions across populations can help reduce health inequalities. Following human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine approval, complex socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities emerged in distinct stages of the diffusion of this health innovation. Virginia and the District of Columbia were the first U.S. jurisdictions to implement school-entry HPV vaccination mandates for sixth-grade girls, offering an opportunity to test whether inequalities in HPV vaccination are mitigated by policy that seeks to standardize the age of vaccine administration and remove barriers to knowledge about the vaccine. Using data from the 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen (N = 4579) and a triple-difference approach, this study tests whether vaccine mandates are associated with smaller socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities in health provider recommendation and vaccine uptake. It finds mandates were associated with improvements in provider recommendation and vaccine uptake for some socioeconomic and racial-ethnic groups. However, mandates also likely led to a decline in HPV vaccine series completion overall. Implications of these findings for informing FCT and vaccination policy are discussed.HPV and/or Cervical Cancer VaccinesInfectious DiseasesSexually Transmitted InfectionsCancerVaccine University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/52x9670spublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt174329fm2023-08-29T03:07:32Zqt174329fmCD8 Follicular T Cells Promote B Cell Antibody Class Switch in Autoimmune DiseaseValentine, Kristen David MHoyer, Katrina K2018-07-01CD8 T cells can play both a protective and pathogenic role in inflammation and autoimmune development. Recent studies have highlighted the ability of CD8 T cells to function as T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the germinal center in the context of infection. However, whether this phenomenon occurs in autoimmunity and contributes to autoimmune pathogenesis is largely unexplored. In this study, we show that CD8 T cells acquire a CD4 Tfh profile in the absence of functional regulatory T cells in both the IL-2-deficient and scurfy mouse models. Depletion of CD8 T cells mitigates autoimmune pathogenesis in IL-2-deficient mice. CD8 T cells express the B cell follicle-localizing chemokine receptor CXCR5, a principal Tfh effector cytokine IL-21. CD8 T cells localize to the B cell follicle, express B cell costimulatory proteins, and promote B cell differentiation and Ab isotype class switching. These data reveal a novel contribution of autoreactive CD8 T cells to autoimmune disease, in part, through CD4 follicular-like differentiation and functionality.Autoimmune Peter AHMoore, Jonathan W2018-05-19The spatial dispersal of individuals plays an important role in the dynamics of populations, and is central to metapopulation theory. Dispersal provides connections within metapopulations, promoting demographic and evolutionary rescue, but may also introduce maladapted individuals, potentially lowering the fitness of recipient populations through introgression of heritable traits. To explore this dual nature of dispersal, we modify a well-established eco-evolutionary model of two locally adapted populations and their associated mean trait values, to examine recruiting salmon populations that are connected by density-dependent dispersal, consistent with collective migratory behaviour that promotes navigation. When the strength of collective behaviour is weak such that straying is effectively constant, we show that a low level of straying is associated with the highest gains in metapopulation robustness and that high straying serves to erode robustness. Moreover, we find that as the strength of collective behaviour increases, metapopulation robustness is enhanced, but this relationship depends on the rate at which individuals stray. Specifically, strong collective behaviour increases the presence of hidden low-density basins of attraction, which may serve to trap disturbed populations, and this is exacerbated by increased habitat heterogeneity. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that density-dependent straying and collective migratory behaviour may help metapopulations, such as in salmon, thrive in dynamic landscapes. Given the pervasive eco-evolutionary impacts of dispersal on metapopulations, these findings have important ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both natural and anthropogenic contemporary disturbances.This article is part of the theme University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8gm907dmarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt20b1087z2023-08-29T02:51:34Zqt20b1087zMetabolic capabilities mute positive response to direct and indirect impacts of warming throughout the soil profileDove, Nicholas CTorn, Margaret SHart, Stephen CTa, Neslihan2021-01-01Increasing global temperatures are predicted to stimulate soil microbial respiration. The direct and indirect impacts of warming on soil microbes, nevertheless, remain unclear. This is particularly true for understudied subsoil microbes. Here, we show that 4.5 years of whole-profile soil warming in a temperate mixed forest results in altered microbial community composition and metabolism in surface soils, partly due to carbon limitation. However, microbial communities in the subsoil responded differently to warming than in the surface. Throughout the soil profile-but to a greater extent in the subsoil-physiologic and genomic measurements show that phylogenetically different microbes could utilize complex organic compounds, dampening the effect of altered resource availability induced by warming. We find subsoil microbes had 20% lower carbon use efficiencies and 47% lower growth rates compared to surface soils, which constrain microbial communities. Collectively, our results show that unlike in surface soils, elevated microbial respiration in subsoils may continue without microbial community change the near-term.BacteriaCaliforniaCarbonForestsGlobal WarmingMetagenomeMicrobiotaNitrogenRNARibosomal16SSoilSoil MicrobiologyTemperatureapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/20b1087zarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt902338np2023-08-29T02:51:28Zqt902338npPredicting school students' physical activity intentions in leisure-time and school recess contexts: Testing an integrated model based on self-determination theory and theory of planned behaviorPasi, HeidiLintunen, TaruLeskinen, EskoHagger, Martin SHuertas-Delgado, Francisco Javier2021-01-01BackgroundIdentifying psychological children's physical activity intentions may signpost potentially modifiable targets for interventions aimed at promoting physical activity participation. School recess and leisure-time outside of school are appropriate contexts in which such interventions may be delivered. However, few studies have identified correlates of physical activity intentions in these environments. Examining correlates in these contexts may provide formative evidence on which to base interventions to promote physical activity.PurposeThe current study adopted an integrated theoretical model to test relations between motivational constructs from self-determination theory, social cognition constructs from the theory of planned behavior, and physical activity intentions in leisure-time and school recess contexts.MethodsFinnish school children (N = 845, M age = 13.93, SD = 0.99) from three lower-secondary schools completed self-report measures of perceived autonomy support by peers, autonomous and controlled motivation, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and physical activity intentions for both contexts.ResultsWell-fitting structural equation models controlling for past behavior indicated that autonomous motivation in the school recess context and attitude in both contexts were the most pervasive predictors of physical activity intentions, and mediated the relationship between perceived autonomy support and intentions. Multi-group analyses supported invariance of the models in both contexts across gender, grades, and school, with few variations.ConclusionsThe current study supports relations between motivational and social cognition correlates of children's physical activity intentions in school recess and leisure-time contexts.

We evaluated the effect of a modified weekly cisplatin-based chemotherapy in postoperative CCRT.MethodsA total of 117 patients with LAHNC were enrolled between December 2007 and December 2012. Survival, compliance/adverse events, and independent prognostic factors were analyzed.ResultsMedian follow-up time was 30.0 (3.1-73.0) months. Most patients completed entire course of postoperative CCRT (radiotherapy 60 Gy, 94.9%; 6 times weekly chemotherapy, 75.2%). Only 17.1% patients required hospital admission. The most common adverse effect was grade 3/4 mucositis (28.2%). No patient died due to protocol-related adverse effects. Multivariate analysis revealed the following independent prognostic factors: oropharyngeal cancer, extracapsular spread, and total radiation dose. Two-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 70.9% and 79.5%, respectively.ConclusionModified weekly cisplatin-based chemotherapy is an for LAHNC.Dental/Oral and main source of excessive collagen deposition in liver fibrosis. Here we report the inhibitory effects of the combinational treatment of two natural products, astragalus polysaccharide (APS) and -elemene (ELE) on the activation of human liver hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 cells.MethodsCultured LX-2 cells were treated with different concentrations of APS or ELE for 24 or 48 hours. Cell viability/apoptosis was measured by MTT assay and Annexin activation related and CD44 expressions were measured by real-time PCR and western blot respectively.ResultsThe majority of LX-2 cells showed morphological change in the presence of APS or ELE for 24 hours. Treatment with APS + ELE for 24 or 48 hours significantly inhabited the cell proliferation compared with APS or ELE treatment alone on LX-2 cells. APS + ELE may block the up-regulation of -SMA and CD44 both in mRNA and protein levels through TGF- pathway in LX-2 cells.ConclusionAPS or ELE treatment alone on LX-2 cells could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. The combinational treatment using APS + ELE significantly increased the killing efficiency on LX-2 cells. -SMA and CD44 expressions was inhibited upon APS + ELE treatment through TGF- pathway in LX-2 cells.

Yet, this evidence is derived from between-person methods that do not examine the momentary within-person processes theorized to explain leisure's benefits.PurposeThis study examined momentary relationships between leisure and health and well-being in daily life.MethodsA community sample (n = 115) completed ecological momentary assessments six times a day for three consecutive days. At each measurement, participants indicated if they were engaging in leisure and reported on their mood, interest/boredom, and stress levels. Next, participants collected a saliva sample for cortisol analyses. Heart rate was assessed throughout the study.ResultsMultilevel models revealed that participants had more positive and less negative mood, more interest, less stress, and lower heart rate when engaging in leisure than when not.ConclusionsResults suggest multiple mechanisms explaining leisure's effectiveness, which can inform leisure-based interventions to improve health and well-being.Heart DiseaseClinical ResearchBrain SciencesPublic Healthapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2qf44682articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0m41x3522023-08-29T02:13:58Zqt0m41x352Rumination is independently associated with poor psychological health: Comparing emotion regulation strategiesZawadzki, Matthew J2015-10-03ObjectiveEmotion regulation (ER) strategies are related to psychological health, with most work examining reappraisal and suppression. Yet, emerging findings suggest that rumination may have stronger relationships with psychological health, namely depression, than other ER strategies. This paper replicated and extended this work by testing whether rumination was independently associated with a range of poor psychological health risk indicators and outcomes. In addition, it explored whether the reason why rumination is so deleterious to health is because it underlies the stress-health relationship.DesignParticipants (n = 218) completed measures online.Main outcome measuresSurveys assessed ER strategies (reappraisal, suppression, proactive coping, emotion support seeking, and rumination), health risk indicators (hostility, optimism, self-esteem), health outcomes (depression, poor sleep quality, anxiety) and perceived chronic stress.ResultsMultivariate regression analyses revealed rumination as the only ER strategy with a consistent independent effect on all the health risk indicators and outcomes. Bootstrapping analyses revealed indirect effects of perceived chronic stress on all the health variables via rumination.ConclusionRumination had a deleterious relationship with psychological health, perhaps because rumination underlies the relationship between stress and psychological health. Results have implications for interventions, particularly emphasizing the need to target ruminative thinking after stressful experiences.NeurosciencesClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social ScienceMental and Social Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m41x352articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt80s7202m2023-08-29T02:13:45Zqt80s7202mCovalent, sequence-specific attachment of long DNA molecules to a surface using DNA-templated click chemistryAbel, Gary RCao, Blessing HuynhHein, Jason EYe, Tao2014-08-04We present a novel method that covalently and sequence-specifically attaches long DNA molecules to a surface that is compatible with high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging.

This assessment was followed by a 14-day daily diary during which adolescents rated the severity of general (GS) and diabetes-specific (DSS) stressful events, as well as adherence to their diabetes regimen.ResultsMultilevel modeling revealed that adolescents with more depressive symptoms reported more severe daily stress and poorer daily adherence on average, and had poorer glycemic control. On days with more severe DSS, but not GS, adolescents reported poorer adherence. This association was moderated by an interaction between depressive symptoms and the mean level of DSS severity experienced across the 2-week diary. In adolescents with low levels of depressive symptoms, poorer adherence was reported on days with more severe DSS across all levels of mean DSS severity. In adolescents with average or high levels of depressive symptoms, poorer adherence was reported on days with more severe DSS only when mean DSS severity was average or high.ConclusionsDepressive symptoms are associated with poorer daily adherence and greater stress severity, and interact with mean DSS severity to moderate the link between daily stress and adherence. The results point to the importance of depressive symptoms for understanding associations between stress and adherence during late adolescence.DiabetesPediatricDepressionMental HealthAutoimmune DiseaseBehavioral of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0v4136xnarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8nx381f02023-08-29T02:13:36Zqt8nx381f0The Development of Infant Detection of Inauthentic EmotionWalle, Eric ACampos, Joseph J2014-06-01Appreciating authentic and inauthentic emotional communication is central to the formation of trusting and intimate interpersonal relationships. However, when infants are able to discriminate and respond to inauthentic emotion has not been investigated. The present set of studies was designed to investigate infant sensitivity to 3 specific cues of inauthenticity: the contextual congruency of the emotion, the degree of exaggeration of the emotion, and the clarity with which the emotion is communicated. In each experiment, 16- and 19-month-old infants were presented with an emotional communication in which an inauthentic cue was present or absent. Infant behavioral responding to the emotional context was observed and coded. In all 3 experiments, 19-month-old infants, but not 16-month-old infants, detected inauthentic emotional communication and differentially responded to the environment accordingly. These findings demonstrate that infants do not simply take all emotional communication at face value and are sensitive to features of emotional contexts beyond what is expressively communicated by the adult. Possible developmental mechanisms that may account for the observed developmental shift in infant emotional development are proposed, and implications for the present findings on future research in emotion and emotional development are highlighted.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceMental Peer Factors Associated with Body Image Discrepancy among Fifth-Grade Boys and GirlsMichael, Shannon LWentzel, adolescents are dissatisfied with their body due to a discrepancy between their ideal and actual body size, which can lead to weight cycling, eating disorders, depression, and obesity. The current study examined the associations of parental and peer factors with fifth-graders' body image discrepancy, physical self-worth as a mediator between parental and peer factors and body image discrepancy, and how these associations vary by child's sex. Body image discrepancy was defined as the difference between young adolescents' self-perceived body size and the size they believe a person their age should be. Data for this study came from Healthy Passages, which surveyed 5,147 fifth graders (51 % females; 34 % African American, 35 % Latino, 24 % White, and 6 % other) and their primary caregivers from the United States. Path analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls. The findings for boys suggest father nurturance and getting along with peers are related negatively to body image discrepancy; however, for girls, fear of negative evaluation by peers is related positively to body image discrepancy. For both boys and girls, getting along with peers and fear of negative evaluation by peers are related directly to physical self-worth. In addition, mother nurturance is related positively to physical self-worth for girls, and father nurturance is related positively to physical self-worth for boys. In turn, physical self-worth, for both boys and girls, is related negatively to body image discrepancy.

In each grade, we measured child and parent height/weight and calculated BMI category. We examined whether baseline sociodemographic characteristics, child health-related factors, and parental obesity were significantly associated with exit from and entry into obesity from fifth to tenth grade.ResultsFifth- and tenth-graders were 1%/2% underweight, 53%/60% Sixty-five Multivariately, obese fifth-graders who perceived themselves to be much heavier than ideal (P = .01) and those who had lower household education (P = .006) were less likely to exit obesity; by contrast, overweight fifth-graders were more likely to become obese if they had an obese parent (P < .001) or watched more television (P = .02).ConclusionsObese fifth-graders face challenges in reducing obesity, especially when they lack advantages associated with higher socioeconomic status or when they have a negative body image. Clinicians and others should educate parents on the importance of preventing obesity very early in development. Children who are not yet obese by fifth grade but who have an obese parent or who watch considerable television might benefit from monitoring, as might children who have negative body images.ObesityClinical ResearchNutritionPreventionPediatricStrokeOral SciencesPediatricsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8p0944c1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt44k5d1xd2023-08-29T02:12:52Zqt44k5d1xdDo Infants Really Expect Agents to Act Efficiently? A Critical Test of the Rationality PrincipleScott, Rose MBaillargeon, Ren\u00e9e2013-04-01Recent experiments have suggested that infants' expectations about the actions of agents are guided by a principle of rationality: In particular, infants expect agents to pursue their goals efficiently, expending as little effort as possible. However, these experiments have all presented infants with infrequent or odd actions, which leaves the results open to alternative interpretations and makes it difficult to determine whether infants possess a general expectation of efficiency. We devised a critical test of the rationality principle that did not involve infrequent or odd actions. In two experiments, 16-month-olds watched events in which an agent faced two identical goal objects; although both objects could be reached by typical, everyday actions, one object was physically (Experiment 1) or mentally (Experiment 2) more accessible than the other. In both experiments, infants expected the agent to select the more-accessible object. These results provide new evidence that infants possess a general and robust expectation under referential uncertaintyScott, Rose MFisher, Cynthia2012-02-01Recent evidence shows that children can use cross-situational statistics to learn new object labels under referential ambiguity (e.g., Smith & Yu, 2008). Such evidence has been interpreted as support for proposals that statistical information about word-referent co-occurrence plays a powerful role in word learning. But object labels represent only a fraction of the vocabulary children acquire, and arguably represent the simplest case of word learning based on observations of world scenes. Here we extended the study of cross-situational word learning to a new segment of the vocabulary, action verbs, to permit a stronger test of the role of statistical information in word learning. In two experiments, on each trial 2.5-year-olds encountered two novel intransitive (e.g., \"She's pimming!\"; transitive verbs (e.g., \"She's pimming her toy!\"; Experiment 2) while viewing two action events. The consistency with which each verb accompanied each action provided the only source of information about the intended referent of each verb. The 2.5-year-olds used cross-situational consistency in verb learning, but also showed significant limits on their ability to do so as the sentences and scenes became slightly more complex.

We tested 2.5-year-olds using two novel tasks: a preferential-looking task in which children listened to a false-belief story while looking at a picture book (with matching and non-matching pictures), and a violation-of-expectation task in which children watched an adult 'Subject' answer (correctly or incorrectly) a standard false-belief question. Positive results were obtained with both tasks, despite their linguistic demands. These results (1) support the distinction between spontaneous- and elicited-response tasks by showing that toddlers succeed at verbal false-belief tasks that do not require them to answer direct questions about agents' false beliefs, (2) reinforce claims of robust continuity in early false-belief understanding as assessed by spontaneous-response tasks, and (3) provide researchers with new experimental tasks for exploring early false-belief understanding in neurotypical University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0w27k0kbarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5mq1g91k2023-08-29T02:12:36Zqt5mq1g91kInfants understand deceptive intentions to implant false beliefs about identity: New evidence for early mentalistic reasoningScott, Rose MRichman, Joshua CBaillargeon, Ren\u00e9e2015-11-01Are infants capable of representing false beliefs, as the mentalistic account of early psychological reasoning suggests, or are they incapable of doing so, as the minimalist account suggests? The present research sought to shed light on this debate by testing the minimalist claim that a signature limit of early psychological reasoning is a specific inability to understand false beliefs about identity: because of their limited representational capabilities, infants should be unable to make sense of situations where an agent mistakes one object for another, visually identical object. To evaluate this claim, three experiments examined whether 17-month-olds could reason about the actions of a deceptive agent who sought to implant in another agent a false belief about the identity of an object. In each experiment, a thief attempted to secretly steal a desirable rattling toy during its owner's absence by substituting a less desirable silent toy. Infants realized that this substitution could be effective only if the silent toy was visually identical to the rattling toy (Experiment 1) and the owner did not routinely shake her toy when she returned (Experiment 2). When these conditions were met, infants expected the owner to be deceived and to mistake the silent toy for the rattling toy she had left behind (Experiment 3). Together, these results cast doubt on the minimalist claim that infants cannot represent false beliefs about identity. More generally, these results indicate that infants in the 2nd year of life can reason not only about the actions of agents who hold false beliefs, but also about the actions of agents who seek to implant false beliefs, thus providing new support for the mentalistic claim that an abstract capacity to reason about false beliefs emerges early in human development.Child DevelopmentCognitionConcept (Ang II) and aldosterone contribute to hypertension, oxidative stress and cardiovascular damage, but the contributions of aldosterone during Ang II-dependent hypertension are not well defined because of the difficulty to assess each independently. To test the hypothesis that during Ang II infusion, oxidative and nitrosative damage is mediated through both the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1), five groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: (i) control; (ii) Ang II infused (80 ng/min \u00d7 28 days); (iii) Ang II + AT1 receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg losartan/kg per day \u00d7 21 days); (iv) Ang II + mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist (Epl; 100 mg eplerenone/day \u00d7 21 days); and (v) Ang II + ARB + Epl (Combo; \u00d7 21 days). Both ARB and combination treatments completely alleviated the Ang II-induced hypertension, whereas eplerenone treatment only prolonged the onset of the hypertension. Eplerenone treatment exacerbated the Ang II-mediated increase in plasma and heart aldosterone 2.3- and 1.8-fold, respectively, while ARB treatment reduced both. Chronic MR blockade was sufficient to ameliorate the AT1-mediated increase in oxidative damage. All treatments normalized protein oxidation (nitrotyrosine) levels; however, only ARB and Combo treatments completely reduced lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal) to control levels. Collectively, these data suggest that receptor signalling, and not the elevated arterial blood pressure, is the principal culprit in the oxidative stress-associated cardiovascular damage in Ang II-dependent hypertension.Heart DiseaseCardiovascularHypertensionAetiology2.1 University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5w71r6fwarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt16w237c02023-08-29T02:08:50Zqt16w237c0Structural Insights into the Interaction between a Potent Anti-inflammatory Protein, Viral CC play important roles in the immune system, not only recruiting leukocytes to the site of infection and inflammation but also guiding cell homing and cell development.

Here, we used NMR and fluorescence anisotropy to study the interaction between vCCI and eotaxin-1 (CCL11), a CC chemokine that is an important factor in the asthma response. NMR results reveal that the binding pattern is very similar to the vCCI\u00b7MIP-1 complex and suggest that electrostatic interactions provide a major contribution to binding. Fluorescence anisotropy results on variants of eotaxin-1 further confirm the critical roles of the charged residues in eotaxin-1. In addition, the binding affinity between vCCI and other wild type CC chemokines, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), MIP-1, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), were determined as 1.1, 1.2, and 0.22 nm, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first work quantitatively measuring the binding affinity between vCCI and multiple CC chemokines.Vaccine RelatedBiodefenseEmerging Infectious DiseasesInfectious DiseasesPrevention2.1 endogenous factorsAetiology2.2 Factors relating to the physical environment1.1 Normal biological development and functioningUnderpinning University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/16w237c0articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt54h1h3ff2023-08-29T02:08:13Zqt54h1h3ffAssociations of Parent-Adolescent Relationship Quality With Type 1 Diabetes Management and Depressive Symptoms in Latino and Caucasian YouthMain, AlexandraWiebe, Deborah JCroom, Andrea associations of parent-adolescent relationship quality (parental acceptance and parent-adolescent conflict) with adolescent type 1 diabetes management (adherence and metabolic control) and depressive symptoms in Latinos and Caucasians.MethodsIn all, 118 adolescents and their mothers (56 = Latino, 62 = Caucasian) completed survey measures of parental acceptance, diabetes conflict, adolescent adherence, and adolescent depressive symptoms. Glycemic control was obtained from medical records.ResultsAcross ethnic groups, adolescent-reported mother and father acceptance were associated with better diabetes management, whereas mother-reported conflict was associated with poorer diabetes management and more depressive symptoms. Independent of socioeconomic status, Latinos reported lower parental acceptance and higher diabetes conflict with mothers than Caucasians. Ethnicity moderated some associations between relationship quality and outcomes. Specifically, diabetes conflicts with mothers (mother and adolescent report) and fathers (adolescent report) were associated with poorer mother-reported adherence among Caucasians, but not among Latinos.ConclusionsParent-adolescent relationship quality differs and may have different relations with diabetes management across Latinos and Caucasians.PreventionBehavioral and equationGonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez, PedroKim, D2015-06-01We present a of diffuse optical tomography using the one-way radiative transfer equation. The one-way radiative transfer is a simplification of the radiative transfer equation to approximate the transmission of light through tissues. The major simplification of this approximation is that the intensity satisfies an initial value problem rather than a boundary value problem. Consequently, the inverse problem to reconstruct the absorption and scattering coefficients from transmission measurements of scattered light is simplified. Using the initial value problem for the one-way radiative transfer equation to compute the forward model, we are able to quantitatively reconstruct the absorption and scattering coefficients efficiently and effectively for simple problems and obtain reasonable results for complicated problems.(030.5620) Radiative transfer(170.3660) Light propagation in tissues(170.3880) Medical and biological imagingOptical PhysicsMaterials Engineeringapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/34z3d9c1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3492b2nc2023-08-29T02:01:31Zqt3492b2ncDegrading phonetic information affects matching of audiovisual speech in adults, but not in infantsBaart, MartijnVroomen, JeanShaw, KathleenBortfeld, Heather2014-01-01Infants and adults are well able to match auditory and visual speech, but the cues on which they rely (viz. temporal, phonetic and energetic correspondence in the auditory and visual speech streams) may differ. Here we assessed the relative contribution of the different cues using sine-wave speech (SWS). Adults (N=52) and infants (N=34, age ranged in between 5 and 15months) matched 2 trisyllabic speech sounds ('kalisu' and 'mufapi'), either natural or SWS, with visual speech information. On each trial, adults saw two articulating faces and matched a sound to one of these, while infants were presented the same stimuli in a preferential looking paradigm. Adults' performance was almost flawless with natural speech, but was significantly less accurate with SWS. In contrast, infants matched the sound to the articulating face equally well for natural speech and SWS. These results suggest that infants rely to a lesser extent on phonetic cues than adults do to match audio to visual speech. This is in line with the notion that the ability to extract phonetic information from the visual signal increases during development, and suggests that phonetic knowledge might not be the basis for early audiovisual correspondence detection in speech.Clinical Research1.2 Psychological and CultureExperimental Psychologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3492b2ncarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5tt669jx2023-08-29T02:01:27Zqt5tt669jxHemodynamic preverbal infantsFava, EswenHull, RachelBaumbauer, KyleBortfeld, Heather2014-07-04Numerous studies the ontogeny of lateralization of auditory processing in humans, but most have employed specific subtypes of stimuli and/or have assessed responses in discrete temporal windows. The present study used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to establish changes in hemodynamic activity in the neocortex of preverbal infants (aged 4-11 months) while they were exposed to two distinct types of complex auditory stimuli (full sentences and musical phrases). Measurements were taken from bilateral temporal regions, including both anterior and posterior superior temporal gyri. When the infant sample was treated as a homogenous group, no significant effects emerged for stimulus type. However, when infants' hemodynamic responses were categorized according to their overall changes in volume, two very clear neurophysiological patterns emerged. A high-responder group showed a pattern of early and increasing activation, primarily in the left hemisphere, similar to that observed in comparable studies with adults. In contrast, a low-responder group showed a pattern of gradual decreases in activation over time. Although age did track with responder type, no significant differences between these groups emerged for stimulus type, suggesting that the high- versus low-responder characterization generalizes across classes of auditory stimuli. These results highlight a new way to conceptualize the variable cortical blood flow patterns that are frequently observed across infants and stimuli, with hemodynamic response volumes potentially serving as an early indicator of developmental changes in auditory-processing University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5tt669jxarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5hh8r1rc2023-08-29T01:55:29Zqt5hh8r1rcThe common sense model of illness self-regulation: a conceptual review and proposed extended modelHagger, Martin SOrbell, Sheina2022-07-03The common sense model of illness self-regulation outlines the dynamic processes by which individuals perceive, interpret, and respond to health threats and illness-related information. An extended version of the model is proposed, which specifies additional constructs and processes to explain how lay perceptions of health threats impact coping responses and health-related outcomes. The extended model provides detail on: (a) the mediating process by which individuals' illness representations relate to illness outcomes through adoption of coping procedures; (b) how illness representations are activated by presentation of health-threatening stimuli; (c) behavioral and treatment beliefs as determinants of coping procedures and illness outcomes alongside illness representations; and (d) effects of moderators of relations between cognitive representations, coping procedures, and illness outcomes. The extended model sets an agenda for future research that addresses knowledge gaps regarding how individuals represent and cope with health threats, and may inform effective illness-management interventions. We identify the kinds of research required to provide robust evidence for the extended model propositions. We call for research that employs incipient illness samples, utilizes designs that capture dynamic processes in the model such as cross-lagged panel and intervention designs, and adopts illness-specific measures of coping procedures rather than relying on generic instruments.Behavioral and Social ScienceMind and BodyManagement of diseases and conditions7.1 that inhibit the yeast-to-hyphal transition of Candida albicans, a key virulence trait of this important human fungal pathogen. However, the molecular motifs in mucins that inhibit filamentation remain unclear despite their potential for therapeutic interventions. Here, we determined that mucins display an abundance of virulence-attenuating molecules in the form of mucin O-glycans. We isolated and cataloged >100 mucin O-glycans from three major mucosal surfaces and established that they suppress filamentation and related phenotypes relevant to infection, including surface adhesion, biofilm formation and cross-kingdom competition between C. albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using synthetic O-glycans, we identified three structures (core 1, core 1 + fucose and core 2 + galactose) that are sufficient to inhibit filamentation with potency comparable to the complex O-glycan pool. Overall, this work identifies mucin O-glycans as host molecules with untapped therapeutic potential to fungal pathogens.Infectious DiseasesRare DiseasesLungCystic Fibrosis2.1 Biological environmentInfectionCandida albicansFucoseMucinsPolysaccharidesVirulenceMedicinal and Biomolecular ChemistryBiochemistry and Cell BiologyBiochemistry & Molecular Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/60c3n6v2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6qx7t3jv2023-08-29T01:36:53Zqt6qx7t3jvSecondary Primary Malignancy Risk in Patients With of secondary primary malignancy (SPM) in patients with cervical cancer using a nationwide population-based dataset.Patients newly diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1997 and 2011 were identified using Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Patients with antecedent malignancies were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for SPM were calculated by comparing with the cancer incidence in the general population. Risk factors for cancer development were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models.During the 14-year study period (follow-up of 223,062 person-years), 2004 cancers developed in 35,175 patients with cervical cancer. The SIR for all cancers was 1.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.50-1.63, P < 0.001). SIRs for follow-up periods of >10, 5 to 10, 1 to 5, and <1 year were 1.37, 1.51, 1.34, and 2.59, respectively. After the exclusion of SPM occurring within 1 year of cervical cancer diagnosis, SIRs were significantly higher for cancers of the esophagus (2.05), stomach (1.38), colon, rectum, and anus (1.36); lung and mediastinum (2.28), bone and soft tissue (2.23), uterus (3.76), bladder (2.26), and kidneys (1.41). Multivariate analysis showed that age 60 was a significant SPM risk factor (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59). Different treatments for cervical cancer, including radiotherapy (HR 1.41) and chemotherapy (HR 1.27), had different impacts on SPM risk. Carboplatin and fluorouracil independently increased SPM risk in cervical cancer patients.Patients with cervical cancer are at increased risk of SPM development. Age 60 years, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are independent risk factors. Carboplatin and fluorouracil also increased SPM risk independently. Close surveillance of patients at high risk should be considered for the early detection of most common cause of life-threatening fungal infections in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Crucial to its success as an opportunistic pathogen is the considerable dynamism of its genome, which readily undergoes genetic changes generating new phenotypes and shaping the evolution of new strains. Candida africana is an intriguing C. albicans biovariant strain that exhibits remarkable genetic and phenotypic differences when compared with standard C. albicans isolates. Candida africana is well-known for its low degree of virulence compared with C. albicans and for its inability to produce chlamydospores that C. albicans, characteristically, produces under certain environmental conditions. Chlamydospores are large, spherical structures, whose biological function is still unknown. For this reason, we have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the whole transcriptomes obtained from an efficient C. albicans chlamydospore-producing clinical strain (GE1), compared with the natural chlamydospore-negative C. africana clinical strain (CBS 11016). The transcriptomes of both C. albicans (GE1) and C. africana (CBS 11016) clinical strains, grown under chlamydospore-inducing conditions, were sequenced and assembled into 7,442 (GE1 strain) and 8,370 (CBS 11016 strain) high quality transcripts, respectively. The release of the first assembly of the C. africana transcriptome will allow future comparative studies to better understand the biology and evolution of this important human fungal pathogen.Infectious DiseasesHuman GenomeGenetics2.2 Factors relating to understanding of endothelial cell biology has been facilitated by the availability of primary endothelial cell cultures from a variety of sites and species; however, the isolation and maintenance of primary mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) remain a formidable challenge. Culturing MAECs is difficult as they are prone to phenotypic drift during culture. Therefore, there is a need to have a dependable in vitro culture system, wherein the primary endothelial cells retain their properties and phenotypes.MethodsHere, we developed an effective method to prepare immortalized MAEC (iMAEC) lines. Primary MAECs, initially isolated using a expressing cells were then incubated with DiI-acetylated-low density lipoprotein and sorted via flow cytometry to isolate iMAECs.ResultsiMAECs expressed common markers of endothelial cells, including PECAM1, eNOS, VE-cadherin, and von Willebrand Factor. iMAECs aligned in the direction of imposed laminar shear and retained the ability to form tubes. Using this method, we have generated iMAEC lines from wild-type and various genetically modified mice such as p47phox-/-, eNOS-/-, and caveolin-1-/-.ConclusionIn summary, generation of iMAEC lines from various genetically modified mouse lines provides an invaluable tool to study vascular biology and pathophysiology.BiotechnologyCardiovascularMAECEndothelial cellsShear stressp47phoxeNOScav1Biochemistry and Cell BiologyCardiorespiratory HaematologyOncology and Carcinogenesisapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7k61x4jkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2jx6p26k2023-08-29T00:08:02Zqt2jx6p26kWarming enabled upslope advance in western US forest firesAlizadeh, John TLuce, Charles HAdamowski, Jan FFarid, ArvinSadegh, Mojtaba2021-06-01Increases in burned area and large fire occurrence are widely documented over the western United States over the past half century. Here, we focus on the elevational distribution of forest fires in mountainous ecoregions of the western United States and show the largest increase rates in burned area above 2,500 m during 1984 to 2017. Furthermore, we show that high-elevation fires advanced upslope with a median cumulative change of 252 m (-107 to 656 m; 95% CI) in 34 y across studied ecoregions. We also document a strong interannual relationship between high-elevation fires and warm season vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The upslope advance of fires is consistent with observed warming reflected by a median upslope drift of VPD isolines of 295 m (59 to 704 m; 95% CI) during 1984 to 2017. These findings allow us to estimate that recent climate trends reduced the high-elevation flammability barrier and enabled fires in an additional 11% of western forests. Limited influences of fire management practices and longer fire-return intervals in these montane mesic systems suggest these changes are largely a byproduct of climate warming. Further weakening in the high-elevation flammability barrier with continued warming has the potential to transform montane fire regimes with numerous implications Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jx6p26karticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1cc0t35f2023-08-29T00:02:57Zqt1cc0t35fApplication of the Health Action Process Approach to Social Distancing Behavior During COVID19Hamilton, KyraSmith, Stephanie RKeech, Jacob JMoyers, examined the social cognition determinants of social distancing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in samples from Australia and the US guided by the health action process approach (HAPA).MethodsParticipants (Australia: N = 495, 50.1% women; US: N = 701, 48.9% women) completed HAPA social cognition constructs at an initial time-point (T1), and one week later (T2) self-reported their social distancing behavior.ResultsSingle-indicator structural equation models that excluded and included past behavior exhibited adequate fit with the data. Intention and action control were significant predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples, and intention predicted action and coping planning in the US sample. Self-efficacy and action control were significant predictors of intention in both samples, with attitudes predicting intention in the Australia sample and risk perceptions predicting intention in the US sample. Significant indirect effects of social cognition constructs through intentions were observed. Inclusion of past behavior attenuated model effects. Multigroup analysis revealed no differences in model fit across samples, suggesting that observed variations in the parameter estimates were relatively trivial.ConclusionResults indicate that social distancing is a function of motivational and volitional processes. This knowledge can be used to inform messaging regarding social distancing during COVID-19 and in future pandemics.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceBehavioral and Social a physical education-delivered autonomy supportive intervention to promote leisure-time physical activity in lower secondary school activity in young people is associated with several physical and mental health concerns. Physical education (PE) is a potentially viable existing network for promoting physical activity in this population. However, little research has been conducted on whether PE teachers can influence students' engagement in leisure-time physical activity. The present study therefore examined the efficacy of an intervention aimed at increasing PE teachers' autonomy support on students' leisure-time physical activity (the PETALS trial). The intervention was guided by the trans-contextual model (TCM) explaining the processes by which PE teachers' provision of autonomy support during PE promotes students' motivation and engagement in physical activity in their leisure time.MethodsThe study adopted a cluster-randomized, waitlist control intervention design with randomization by school. Participants were PE teachers (N = 29, 44.83%female; M age = 42.83, SD = 9.53 yrs) and their lower secondary school students (N = 502, 43.82%female; M age = 14.52, SD = 0.71 yrs). We measured TCM constructs, including perceived autonomy support, autonomous motivation in PE and leisure time, beliefs and intentions towards leisure-time physical activity, and physical activity behavior at baseline, post-intervention, and at one-, three-, and six-months. Study hypotheses were tested through a series of ANOVAs and structural equation models using post-intervention and one-month follow-up data.ResultsWe found no changes in TCM constructs or physical activity behavior in either group at post-intervention or at 1 month. Path analyses supported two propositions of the TCM as change variables: perceived autonomy support had a significant effect on autonomous motivation in PE and autonomous motivation in PE had a significant effect on autonomous motivation in leisure time. Although we found a direct effect of autonomous motivation in leisure time on physical activity, we did not find support for the third premise of the TCM that autonomous motivation in leisure time indirectly affects physical activity through beliefs and intentions.ConclusionsCurrent findings did not support the efficacy of the PETALS intervention at changing physical activity behavior and TCM constructs. More research is required to determine whether the TCM predictive validity is supported when other model variables are manipulated through experimental and intervention studies.Trial registrationISRCTN, ISRCTN39374060 .

Unfortunately, most current molecular imaging tools in tissue either lack high spatial resolution (e.g., diffuse optical fluorescence tomography or positron emission tomography) or lack molecular sensitivity (e.g., micro-computed tomography, CT). X-ray luminescence imaging emerged about 10 years ago to address this issue by combining the molecular sensitivity of optical probes with the high spatial resolution of x-ray imaging through tissue. In particular, x-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for the high-resolution imaging of deeply embedded contrast agents in three dimensions (3D) for small-animal imaging. To facilitate the translation of XLCT for small-animal imaging, we have designed and built a small-animal dedicated focused x-ray luminescence tomography (FXLT) scanner with a CT scanner, synthesized bright and biocompatible nanophosphors as contrast agents, and have developed a deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithm. The proposed FXLT imaging system was designed using computer-aided design software and built according to specifications. NaGdF4 nanophosphors doped with europium or terbium were synthesized with silica shell for increased biocompatibility and functionalized with biotin. A deep-learning-based XLCT image reconstruction was also developed based on the residual neural network as a data synthesis method of projection views from few-view data to enhance the reconstructed image quality. We have built the FXLT scanner for small-animal imaging based on a rotational gantry. With all major imaging components mounted, the motor controlling the gantry can be used to rotate the system with a high accuracy. The synthesized nanophosphors displayed distinct x-ray luminescence emission, which enables multi-color imaging, and has successfully been bound to streptavidin-coated substrates. Lastly, numerical simulations using the proposed deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithm has demonstrated a clear enhancement in the reconstructed image quality.

A mismatch between data, data systems, and data needs for decision making can result in inefficient and inequitable capital investments, resource allocations, environmental protection, hazard mitigation, and quality of life. In this paper, we examine the relationship between data and decision making in environmental management, with a focus on water management. We focus on the concept of decision-driven data systems\u2014data systems that incorporate an assessment of decision-makers' data needs into their design. The aim of the research was to examine the process of translating data into effective decision making by engaging stakeholders in the development of a water data system. Using California's legislative mandate for state agencies to integrate existing water and other environmental data as a case study, we developed and applied a participatory approach to inform data-system design and identify unmet data needs. Using workshops and focused stakeholder meetings, we developed 20 diverse use cases to assess data sources, availability, characteristics, gaps, and other attributes of data used for representative decisions. Federal and state agencies made up about 90% of the data sources, and could readily adapt to a federated data system, our recommended model for the state. The remaining 10% of more-specialized data, central to important decisions across multiple use cases, would require additional investment or incentives to achieve data consistency, interoperability, and compatibility with a federated system. Based on this assessment, we propose a typology of different types of data limitations and gaps described by stakeholders. We also propose technical, governance, and stakeholder engagement evaluation criteria to guide planning and building environmental data systems. Data-system governance involving both producers and users of data was seen as essential to achieving workable standards, stable funding, convenient data availability, resilience to institutional change, and long-term buy-in by stakeholders. Our work provides a replicable lesson for using decision-maker and stakeholder engagement to shape the design of an environmental data system, and inform a technical design that addresses both user and producer needs.Generic health relevancewater managementdata Structural Model with Socioecological Connectedness, Ashley CWallander, Jan LElliott, Marc NSchuster, Mark A2023-08-01The objective was to examine the associations of socioecological connectedness with bullying victimization and depressive symptoms in early adolescence and with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in mid-adolescence, and how these might differ between genders. Diverse adolescents (N = 4115; 49.1% girls) in the 7th grade reported on connections with parents/family, peers, school, and neighborhood, as well as bullying victimization and depressive symptoms, and NSSI in 10th grade (Me = 16.1 years). Structural equation modeling with WSLMV indicated that the lower likelihood of NSSI in 10th grade was associated with higher perceptions of connections between adolescents and their families, both directly as well as indirectly through reduced bully victimization and depressive symptoms three years earlier. Higher school connectedness was indirectly associated with the lower likelihood of NSSI through bullying victimization and depressive symptoms. Paths to NSSI varied for girls and boys. Results advance the understanding of developmental pathways leading to NSSI in adolescent girls and boys.PediatricYouth ViolenceViolence ResearchMental HealthDepressionChildhood InjuryPhysical Injury - Accidents and of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7db397s7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8zr6396v2023-08-28T22:55:21Zqt8zr6396vAncient genomes from the Himalayas illuminate the genetic history of Tibetans and their Tibeto-Burman adapted both genetically and culturally to the high altitude environment of the Tibetan Plateau, but fundamental questions about their origins remain unanswered. Recent archaeological and genetic research suggests the presence of an early population on the Plateau within the past 40 thousand years, followed by the arrival of subsequent groups within the past 10 thousand years. Here, we obtain new genome-wide data for 33 ancient individuals from high elevation sites on the southern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau in Nepal, who we show are most closely related to present-day Tibetans. They derive most of their ancestry from groups related to Late Neolithic populations at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau but also harbor a minor genetic component from a distinct and deep Paleolithic Eurasian ancestry. In contrast to their Tibetan neighbors, present-day non-Tibetan Tibeto-Burman speakers living at mid-elevations along the southern and eastern margins of the Plateau form a genetic cline that reflects a distinct genetic history. Finally, a comparison between ancient and present-day highlanders confirms ongoing positive selection of high altitude adaptive alleles.Human GenomeGeneticsAdaptationPhysiologicalAltitudeGenomeHistoryAncientHumansNepalTibetapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8zr6396varticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9dd3r1ht2023-08-28T22:54:25Zqt9dd3r1htEngaging stakeholders across a socio-environmentally diverse network of water research sites in North and Maria I2021-06-01Maintaining and restoring freshwater ecosystem services in the face of local and global change requires adaptive research that effectively engages stakeholders. However, there is a lack of understanding and consensus in the research community regarding where, when, and which stakeholders should be engaged and what kind of researcher should do the engaging (e.g., physical, ecological, or social scientists). This paper explores stakeholder engagement across a developing network of aquatic research sites in North and South America with wide ranging cultural norms, social values, resource management paradigms, and eco-physical conditions. With seven sites in six countries, we found different degrees of engagement were explained by differences in the interests of the stakeholders given the history and perceived urgency of water resource problems as well as differences in the capacities of the site teams to effectively engage given their expertise and resources. We categorized engagement activities and applied Hurlbert and Gupta's split ladder of participation to better understand site differences and distill lessons learned for planning comparative socio-hydrological research and systematic evaluations of the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement approaches. We recommend research networks practice deliberate engagement of stakeholders that adaptively accounts for variations and changes in local socio-hydrologic conditions. This, in turn, requires further efforts to foster the development of well-integrated research teams that attract and retain researchers from multiple social science disciplines and enable training on effective engagement strategies for diverse conditions.Stakeholder engagementScience outreachParticipatory researchSocio-hydrologyEnvironmental Science and Candida Role human fungal pathogen that has recently emerged worldwide. It can cause life-threatening disseminated infections in humans, with mortality rates upwards of 50%. The molecular mechanisms underlying its multidrug resistance and pathogenic properties are largely unknown. Few methods exist for genome editing in C. auris, all of which rely on selectable markers that limit the number of modifications that can be made. Here, we present a markerless CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system in C. auris. Using this system, we successfully deleted genes of interest and subsequently reconstituted them at their native loci in isolates across all five C. auris clades. This system also enabled us to introduce precision genome edits to create translational fusions and single point mutations. Using Cas5 as a test case for this system, we discovered a conserved role for Cas5 in the caspofungin response between Candida albicans and C. auris. Overall, the development of a system for precise and facile genome editing in C. auris that can allow edits to be made in a high-throughput manner is a major step forward in improving our understanding of this important human fungal pathogen. IMPORTANCE Candida auris is a recently emerged multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen capable of causing life-threatening systemic infections in humans.

Endophytic microbes have been extensively studied for their plant growth-promoting traits. However, analyses of endophytes require complete removal of epiphytic microorganisms. We found that the established tests to evaluate surface sterility, polymerase chain reaction, and leaf imprints, are unreliable. Therefore, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as an additional assessment of epiphyte removal. We used a diverse suite of sterilization protocols to remove epiphytic microorganisms from the leaves of a gymnosperm and an angiosperm tree to test the influence of leaf morphology on the efficacy of these methods. Additionally, leaf tissue damage was also evaluated by SEM, as damaging the leaves might have an impact on endophytes and could lead to inaccurate assessment of endophytic communities. Our study indicates, that complete removal of the leaf cuticle by the sterilization technique assures loss of epiphytic microbes, and that leaves of different tree species may require different sterilization protocols. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the importance of choosing the appropriate sterilization protocol to prevent erroneous interpretation of host-endophyte interactions. Moreover, it shows the utility of SEM for evaluating the effectiveness of surface sterilization methods and their impact on leaf tissue integrity.EndophytesMicroscopyElectronScanningPinusPlant LeavesPopulusSterilizationendophyteleaf surface sterilizationPinus contortaPopulus fremontiiscanning electron microscopyMicrobiologyMedical Microbiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/05n539tvarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5v32r3152023-08-28T22:01:38Zqt5v32r315A blended intervention to promote physical activity, health and work productivity among office employees using intervention mapping: a study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled physical activity (MVPA) is related to decreased risk of morbidity and mortality. Among working populations, lack of MVPA may also be a risk factor for absenteeism and presenteeism. Both traditional workplace-based and web-based interventions have been suggested as being effective in promoting participation MVPA, health-related outcomes, and work-related productivity. However, several challenges limit their application in real world contexts. A 'blended' intervention approach combining the two intervention strategies is proposed to overcome these limitations. The proposed intervention aims to utilize the blended approach to increase participation in MVPA, health-related outcomes, and work productivity among inactive workers.MethodsThe study will comprise of a three-group cluster randomized controlled trial (cluster-RCT), comprising a three-month actual intervention and a nine-month behavioral follow-up period. The three groups will be: a web-based intervention group, a blended intervention group combining the web-based components with face-to-face workshops and posters, and a control group. Physically inactive office employees (N = 495) from 33 companies (i.e., clusters) will be recruited and randomly assigned to the three groups by cluster randomization. The intervention mapping (IM) framework will be used for selecting and applying effective health behavioral theories and behavioral change techniques (BCTs) to the development, implementation and assessment of the intervention, which will be personally tailored. The primary outcome variable will be objectively-measured MVPA using an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes will consist of indices of health including adiposity, blood pressure, blood sugar, blood lipids, self-reported depression, anxiety, stress, health-related quality of life and work-related variables including absenteeism and presenteeism.DiscussionThe proposed study adopts a robust blended intervention approach that is expected to overcome challenges in applying workplace-based and web-based interventions separately and yield larger effects in promoting MVPA participation, health-related outcomes and work productivity. Improvements in work productivity outcomes will be of particular interest to employers. If more effective, the new blended intervention has the potential to be implemented on a larger scale to benefit workplace populations.Trial registrationThe trial is prospectively registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov PRS (Trial ID: NCT04391270; Date of First 2020).Mind and ResearchBehavioral and Social ScienceClinical Trials and Supportive ActivitiesMental HealthPreventionPrevention of disease and conditionsand promotion of well-being3.1 Primary prevention interventions to modify behaviours or promote wellbeingGeneric University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5v32r315articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3hd5w71k2023-08-28T22:01:24Zqt3hd5w71kA systematic review of human behaviour in and around floodwaterHamilton, KyraDemant, DanielPeden, Amy EHagger, Martin S2020-08-012.3 Psychologicalsocial Health and Well BeingEnvironmental Science and ManagementPublic Health and Health ServicesHuman Geographyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3hd5w71kpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6175p8jh2023-08-28T21:54:11Zqt6175p8jhDo Metaphors Move From Mind to Mouth? Evidence From a New System of Linguistic Metaphors for TimeHendricks, Rose KBergen, Benjamin KMarghetis, Tyler2018-11-01Languages around the world use a recurring strategy to discuss abstract concepts: describe them metaphorically, borrowing language from more concrete domains. We \"plan ahead\" to the future, \"count up\" to higher numbers, and \"warm\" to new friends. Past work has found that these ways of talking have implications for how we think, so that shared systems of linguistic metaphors can produce shared conceptualizations. On the other hand, these systematic linguistic metaphors might not just be the cause but also the effect of shared, non-linguistic ways of thinking. Here, we present a case study of a variety of American English in which a shared, non-linguistic conceptualization of time has become crystallized as a new system of linguistic metaphors. Speakers of various languages, including English, conceptualize time as a lateral timeline, with the past leftward and the future rightward. Until now, this conceptualization has not been documented in the speech of any language. In two studies, we document how members of the U.S. military, but not U.S. civilians, talk about time using conventionalized lateral metaphors (e.g., \"move the meeting right\" to mean \"move the meeting later\"). We argue that, under the right cultural circumstances, implicit mental representations become conventionalized metaphors in language.Behavioral and Social Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6175p8jharticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7d15j2hf2023-08-28T21:36:07Zqt7d15j2hfActive nematic order and and long-range active nematic alignment are reported using a geometry in which kinesin motors are directly coupled to a lipid bilayer, allowing for in-plane motor diffusion during microtubule gliding. We use fluorescence microscopy to image protein distributions in and below the dense two-dimensional microtubule layer, revealing evidence of diffusion-enabled kinesin restructuring within the fluid membrane substrate as microtubules collectively glide above. We find that the lipid membrane acts to promote filament-filament alignment within the gliding layer, enhancing the formation of a globally aligned active nematic state. We also report the emergence of an intermediate, locally ordered state in which apolar dynamic lanes of nematically aligned microtubules migrate across the substrate. To understand this emergent behavior, we implement a continuum model obtained from coarse graining a collection of self-propelled rods, with propulsion set by the local motor kinetics. Tuning the microtubule and kinesin concentrations as well as active propulsion in these simulations reveals that increasing motor activity promotes dynamic nematic lane formation. Simulations and experiments show that, following fluid bilayer substrate mediated spatial motor restructuring, the total motor concentration becomes enriched below the microtubule lanes that they drive, with the feedback leading to more dynamic lanes. Our results have implications for membrane-coupled active nematics in vivo as well as for engineering dynamic and reconfigurable materials where the structural elements and power sources can dynamically colocalize, enabling efficient mechanical work.BioengineeringUnderpinning using an integrated model of health behaviorPhipps, Daniel JHagger, Martin SHamilton, Kyra2020-07-01Excess intake of 'free sugars' is a key predictor of chronic disease, obesity, and dental ill health. Given the importance of determining modifiable predictors of free sugar-related dietary behaviors, we applied the integrated behavior change model to predict free sugar limiting behaviors. The model includes constructs representing 'reasoned' or deliberative processes that lead to action (e.g., social cognition constructs, intentions), and constructs representing 'non-conscious' or implicit processes (e.g., implicit attitudes, behavioral automaticity) as predictors of behavior. Undergraduate students (N = 205) completed measures of autonomous and controlled motivation, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) measures of explicit attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and intentions, past behavior, implicit attitude, and behavioral automaticity at an initial point in time, and free sugar limiting behavior and behavioral automaticity two weeks later. A Bayesian structural equation model indicated that explicit attitude, subjective norms, and PBC predicted behavior via intention. Autonomous motivation predicted behavior indirectly through all TPB variables, while controlled motivation predicted behavior only via subjective norms. Implicit attitudes and behavioral automaticity predicted behavior directly and independently. Past behavior predicted behavior directly and indirectly through behavioral automaticity and intentions, but not implicit attitudes. Current findings suggest pervasive effects of constructs representing both reasoned and non-conscious processes and signpost potential targets for behavioral interventions aimed at minimizing free sugar consumption.Behavioral and Social SciencePreventionNutritionClinical ResearchBasic Anne Myers2013-07-25For linear electron-phonon coupling, the Huang-Rhys factor, S, gives the intensity ratio of the one-quantum vibronic transition (0 1) to the purely electronic origin transition (0 0) in a vibrationally resolved, zero-temperature absorption or emission spectrum. It is often assumed that the overtone to fundamental integrated intensity ratio in resonance Raman scattering of semiconductor nanocrystals is equal to or proportional to S, or that S may be determined from the overtone intensity in some other straightforward manner. In fact, this is not generally possible because of different excitation profiles for overtones and fundamentals, differential sensitivity of overtones and fundamentals to electronic dephasing, and interference effects from partially overlapping electronic transitions. Here we examine the relationship between the Huang-Rhys factor and the overtone to fundamental intensity ratio through spectroscopic simulations using parameters appropriate to II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals such as CdSe. A simple equation relating the overtone to fundamental Raman intensity ratio to the Huang-Rhys factor is obtained only in the case of a single resonant electronic state, excitation at the maximum of the inhomogeneously broadened absorption band, and a homogeneous line width small compared with the phonon frequency.AtomicMolecularNuclearParticle and Plasma PhysicsPhysical of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3d17h9n4articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8k75h5jb2023-08-28T21:10:40Zqt8k75h5jbPhosphorus Speciation in Atmospherically Deposited Particulate Matter and Implications for Terrestrial Ecosystem ProductivityO'Day, ANwosu, H2020-04-21Chemical forms of phosphorus (P) in airborne particulate matter (PM) are poorly known and do not correlate with solubility or extraction measurements commonly used to infer speciation. We used P X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to determine P species in PM collected at four mountain sites (Colorado and California). Organic P species dominated samples from high elevations, with organic P estimated at 65-100% of total P in bulk samples by XANES and 79-88% in extracted fractions (62-84% of total P) by NMR regardless of particle size (10 or 1-10 m). Phosphorus monoester and diester organic species were dominant and present in about equal proportions, with low fractions of inorganic P species. By comparison, PM from low elevation contained mixtures of organic and inorganic P, with organic P estimated at 30-60% of total P. Intercontinental PM transport determined from radiogenic lead (Pb) isotopes varied from 0 to 59% (mean 37%) Asian-sourced Pb at high elevation, whereas stronger regional PM inputs were found at low elevation. Airborne flux of bioavailable P to high-elevation ecosystems may be twice as high as estimated by global models, which will disproportionately affect net primary productivity.ColoradoEcosystemParticle SizeParticulate MatterPhosphorusEnvironmental Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8k75h5jbarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5808g3sf2023-08-28T20:47:33Zqt5808g3sfProbing the Ecology and Climate of the Eocene Southern Ocean With Sand Tiger Sharks Striatolamia for Eocene climate change focus on the Southern Ocean-where tectonics influenced oceanic gateways, ocean circulation reduced heat transport, and greenhouse gas declines prompted glaciation. To date, few studies focus on marine vertebrates at high latitudes to discern paleoecological and paleoenvironmental impacts of this climate transition. The Tertiary Eocene La Meseta (TELM) Formation has a rich fossil assemblage to characterize these impacts; Striatolamia macrota, an extinct () sand tiger shark, is abundant throughout the La Meseta Formation. Body size is often tracked to characterize and integrate across multiple ecological dimensions. S. macrota body size distributions indicate limited changes during TELMs 2-5 based on anterior tooth crown height (n = 450, mean = 19.6 \u00b1 6.4 mm). Similarly, environmental conditions remained stable through this period based on 18OPO4 values from tooth enameloid (n = 42; 21.5 \u00b1 1.6), which corresponds to a mean temperature of 22.0 \u00b1 4.0\u00b0C. Our preliminary Nd (n = 4) results indicate an early Drake Passage opening with Pacific inputs during TELM 2-3 (45-43 Ma) based on single unit variation with an overall radiogenic trend. Two possible hypotheses to explain these observations are (1) S. macrota modified its migration behavior to ameliorate environmental changes related to the Drake Passage opening, or (2) the local climate change was small and gateway opening had little impact. While we cannot rule out an ecological explanation, a comparison with climate model results suggests that increased CO2 produces warm conditions that also parsimoniously DemingHagger, Martin SChatzisarantis, Nikos LD2020-05-01The ironic effect of thought suppression refers to the phenomenon in which individuals trying to rid their mind of a target thought ironically experience greater levels of occurrence and accessibility of the thought compared with individuals who deliberately concentrate on the thought (Wegner, 1994, doi:10.1037/0033-295X.101.1.34). Ironic effects occurring after thought suppression, also known as rebound effects, were consistently detected by previous meta-analyses. However, ironic effects that occur during thought suppression, also known as immediate enhancement effects, were found to be largely absent. In this meta-analysis, we test Wegner's original proposition that detection of immediate enhancement effects depends on the cognitive load experienced by individuals when enacting thought suppression. Given that thought suppression is an effortful cognitive process, we propose that the introduction of additional cognitive load would compete for the allocation of existing cognitive resources and impair capacity for thought suppression. Studies (k = 31) consistent with Wegner's original thought-suppression paradigm were analyzed. Consistent with our predictions, rebound effects were observed regardless of cognitive load, whereas immediate enhancement effects were observed only in the presence of cognitive load.

In California, the current risk of inadequate electricity supply is highest around sunset in late summer. In a zero-carbon grid, resource adequacy will increasingly require adequate stored energy throughout the entire year. Here we seek to develop an intuition about the times of the year when resource adequacy may be most challenged for a solar-dominant system. We use a simplified approach and show that the month of the biggest challenge occurs in winter and can shift by more than two months depending on the amount of solar and storage that are built.storagezero-carbon gridseasonal storagesolarCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1cq81573publicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9s50d2xg2023-08-28T19:16:07Zqt9s50d2xgCensus Demographics and Chlorpyrifos Use California's Central Valley, 2011-15: Distributional Environmental Justice AnalysisHicks, Daniel J2020-04-01Chlorpyrifos, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACI), is one of the most widely used insecticides in the world, and is generally recognized to be a moderate human neurotoxin. This paper reports a distributional environmental justice (dEJ) analysis of chlorpyrifos use in California's Central Valley, examining the way distributions of environmental risks are associated with race, ethnicity, class, gender, and other systems of structural oppression. Spatial data on chlorpyrifos use were retrieved from California's Department of Pesticide Registration public pesticide use records for 2011-2015. These data were combined with demographic data for the Central Valley from the American Community Survey (ACS). Spatial regression models were used to estimate effects of demographic covariates on local chlorpyrifos use. A novel bootstrap method was used to account for measurement error in the ACS estimates. This study finds consistent evidence that Hispanic population proportion is associated with increased local chlorpyrifos use. A 10-point increase in Hispanic proportion is associated with an estimated 1.05-1.4-fold increase in local chlorpyrifos use across Census tract models. By contrast, effects of agricultural employment and poverty on local chlorpyrifos use are ambiguous and inconsistent between Census tracts and Census-designated places.Rural HealthPreventionAgricultureCaliforniaCensusesChlorpyrifosHumansInsecticidesPesticidespesticideschlorpyrifosenvironmental justicespatial regressionpublic dataToxicologypubliceScholarship, University Mengqiang2020-02-18Sequential chemical extraction has been widely used to study soil phosphorus (P) dynamics and inform nutrient management, but its efficacy for assigning P into biologically meaningful pools remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of the modified Hedley extraction scheme using P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy for nine carbonate-free soil samples with diverse chemical and mineralogical properties resulting from different degrees of soil development. For most samples, the extraction markedly overestimated the pool size of calcium-bound P (Ca-P, extracted by 1 M HCl) due to (1) P redistribution during the alkaline extractions (0.5 M NaHCO3 and then 0.1 M NaOH), creating new Ca-P via formation of Ca phosphates between NaOH-desorbed phosphate and exchangeable Ca2+ and/or (2) dissolution of poorly crystalline Fe and Al oxides by 1 M HCl, releasing P occluded by these oxides into solution. The first mechanism may occur in soils rich in well-crystallized minerals and exchangeable Ca2+ regardless of the presence or absence of CaCO3, whereas the second mechanism likely operates in soils rich in poorly crystalline Fe and Al minerals. The overestimation of Ca-P simultaneously caused underestimation of the pools extracted by the alkaline solutions. Our findings identify key edaphic parameters that remarkably influenced the extractions, which will strengthen our understanding of soil P dynamics using this widely accepted procedure.MineralsPhosphatesPhosphorusSoilSoil PollutantsX-Ray Absorption SpectroscopyEnvironmental Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University Priyanka SNobile, J2021-01-01Fungal infections prevalence worldwide. The paucity of available antifungal drug classes, combined with the increased occurrence of multidrug resistance in fungi, has led to new clinical challenges in the treatment of fungal infections. Candida auris is a recently emerged multidrug resistant human fungal pathogen that has become a worldwide public health threat. C. auris clinical isolates are often resistant to one or more antifungal drug classes, and thus, there is a high unmet medical need for the development of new therapeutic strategies effective against C. auris. Additionally, C. auris possesses several virulence traits, including the ability to form biofilms, further contributing to its drug resistance, and complicating the treatment of C. auris infections. Here we assessed red, green, and blue visible lights alone and in combination with photosensitizing compounds for their efficacies against C. auris biofilms. We found that (1) blue light inhibited and disrupted C. auris biofilms on its own and that the addition of photosensitizing compounds improved its antibiofilm potential; (2) red light inhibited and disrupted C. auris biofilms, but only in combination with photosensitizing compounds; and (3) green light inhibited C. auris biofilms in combination with photosensitizing compounds, but had no effects on disrupting C. auris biofilms. Taken together, our findings suggest that photodynamic therapy could be an effective non-drug therapeutic strategy against multidrug resistant C. auris biofilm infections.Infectious lightsBiochemistry and Cell BiologyMicrobiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/25v3h486publicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4672f45k2023-08-28T19:01:24Zqt4672f45kRecordsetting climate enabled the extraordinary 2020 fire season in the western United StatesHiguera, Philip EAbatzoglou, John T2021-01-01ClimateEcosystemFiresSeasonsUnited StatesEnvironmental SciencesBiological SciencesEcologypubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4672f45karticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1938c5902023-08-28T19:01:06Zqt1938c590Multiple elements of soil drive ecosystem functions across biomesDelgado-Baquerizo, of soil biodiversity in regulating multiple ecosystem functions is poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict how soil biodiversity loss might affect human wellbeing and ecosystem sustainability. Here, combining a global observational study with an experimental microcosm study, we provide evidence that soil biodiversity (bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) is significantly and positively associated with multiple ecosystem functions. These functions include nutrient cycling, decomposition, plant production, and reduced potential for pathogenicity and belowground biological warfare. Our findings also reveal the context dependency of such relationships and the importance of the connectedness, biodiversity and nature of the globally distributed dominant phylotypes within the soil network in maintaining multiple functions. Moreover, our results suggest that the positive association between plant diversity and multifunctionality across biomes is indirectly driven by soil biodiversity. Together, our results provide insights into the importance of soil biodiversity for maintaining soil functionality locally and across biomes, as well as providing strong support for the inclusion of soil biodiversity in conservation and management programmes.Life on LandBiodiversityEcosystemFungiHumansSoilSoil Microbiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1938c590articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt18m849z32023-08-28T18:49:08Zqt18m849z3Auditory cortex activation to natural speech and simulated cochlear implant measured with functional goal of most cochlear implant procedures is to improve a patient's ability to discriminate speech. To accomplish this, cochlear implants are programmed so as to maximize speech understanding. However, programming a cochlear implant can be an iterative, labor-intensive process that takes place over months. In this study, we sought to determine whether functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging method which is safe to use repeatedly and for extended periods of time, can provide an objective measure of whether a subject is hearing normal speech or distorted speech. We used a 140 channel fNIRS system to measure activation within the auditory cortex in 19 normal hearing subjects while they listed to speech with different levels of intelligibility. Custom software was developed to analyze the data and compute topographic maps from the measured changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. Normal speech reliably evoked the strongest responses within the auditory cortex. Distorted speech produced less region-specific cortical activation. Environmental sounds were used as a control, and they produced the least cortical activation. These data collected using fNIRS are consistent with the fMRI literature and thus demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique to objectively detect differences in cortical responses to speech endemic North American rodent belonging to the family Cricetidae. We present here the first complete mitogenome within the Neotoma genus.

In this study, we demonstrate that clinical isolates of C. auris have multiple colony and cellular morphologies including the yeast, filamentous, aggregated, and elongated forms. This phenotypic diversity has been observed in eight clinical isolates of C. auris representing four major genetic clades, suggesting that it could be a general characteristic.

We compared four types of work-related self-perceptions, as well as vulnerability to mental health and substance abuse problems, among youths not in education, employment or training (NEET) and among their peers.MethodsParticipants were from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal study, a nationally representative UK cohort of 2,232 twins born in 1994-1995. We measured commitment to work, job-search effort, professional/technical skills, 'soft' skills (e.g. teamwork, decision-making, communication), optimism about getting ahead, and mental health and substance use disorders at age 18. We also examined childhood mental health.ResultsAt age 18, 11.6% of participants were NEET. NEET participants reported themselves as committed to work and searching for jobs with greater diligence than their non-NEET peers. However, they reported fewer 'soft' skills (B = -0.98, p < .001) and felt less optimistic about their likelihood of getting ahead in life (B = -2.41, p < .001). NEET youths also had higher rates of concurrent mental health and substance abuse problems, but these did not explain the relationship with work-related self-perceptions. Nearly 60% of NEET (vs. 35% of non-NEET) youths had already experienced 1 mental health problem in childhood/adolescence. Associations of NEET status with concurrent mental health problems were independent of pre-existing mental health vulnerability.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that while NEET is clearly an economic and mental health issue, it does not appear to be a motivation issue. Alongside skills, work-related self-perceptions and mental health problems may be targets for intervention and service provision among this high-risk population.PediatricClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social ScienceDrug of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5c478560articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3s05708b2023-08-28T17:31:05Zqt3s05708bAuditory Deprivation Does Not Impair Executive Function, But Language Deprivation Might: Evidence From a Parent-Report Measure in Deaf Native Signing ChildrenHall, Matthew LEigsti, Inge-MarieBortfeld, HeatherLillo-Martin, Diane2017-01-01Deaf children are often described as having difficulty with executive function (EF), often manifesting in behavioral problems. Some researchers view these problems as a consequence of auditory deprivation; however, the behavioral problems observed in previous studies may not be due to deafness but to some other factor, such as lack of early language exposure. Here, we distinguish these accounts by using the BRIEF EF parent report questionnaire to test for behavioral problems in a group of Deaf children from Deaf families, who have a history of auditory but not language deprivation. For these children, the auditory deprivation hypothesis predicts behavioral impairments; the language deprivation hypothesis predicts no group differences in behavioral control. Results indicated that scores among the Deaf native signers (n = 42) were age-appropriate and similar to scores among the typically developing hearing sample (n = 45). These findings are most consistent with the language deprivation hypothesis, and provide a foundation for continued research on outcomes of children with early exposure to sign language.Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical ResearchPediatricPediatric Research InitiativeBasic Audiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3s05708barticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7px5t1vc2023-08-28T17:17:33Zqt7px5t1vcFuture climate risks from stress, insects and fire across US forestsAnderegg, William RLChegwidden, JLawler, Joshua2022-06-01Forests are currently a substantial carbon sink globally. Many climate change mitigation strategies leverage forest preservation and expansion, but rely on forests storing carbon for decades to centuries. Yet climate-driven disturbances pose critical risks to the long-term stability of forest carbon. We quantify the climate drivers that influence wildfire and climate stress-driven tree mortality, including a separate insect-driven tree mortality, for the contiguous United States for current (1984-2018) and project these future disturbance risks over the 21st century. We find that current risks are widespread and projected to increase across different emissions scenarios by a factor of >4 for fire and >1.3 for climate-stress mortality. These forest disturbance risks highlight pervasive climate-sensitive disturbance impacts on US forests and raise questions about the risk management approach taken by forest carbon offset policies.

Identification of the determinants of this risky behaviour may provide formative evidence on which to base effective interventions to curb HED in this population. Drawing from theories of social cognition and dual-process models, this study tested key hypotheses relating to reasoned and implicit pathways to action for HED in a sample of Australian university students who drink alcohol. Design A two-wave correlational design was adopted. Methods Students (N = 204) completed self-reported constructs from social cognition theories with respect to HED at an initial time point (T1): attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, intentions, habit, past behaviour, and implicit alcohol identity. Four weeks later (T2), students self-reported their HED behaviour and habit. Results An initial path model indicated attitude and subjective norm predicted intentions, and intentions and implicit alcohol identity predicted HED. Inclusion of past behaviour and habit revealed direct effects of these on HED. Effects of T1 habit on HED were indirect through T2 habit, and there were indirect effects of past behaviour on HED through habit at both time points and the social cognition constructs. Direct effects of intentions and implicit alcohol identity, and indirect effects of attitude and subjective norm, on HED, were attenuated by the inclusion of past behaviour and habit. Conclusion Results indicate that university students' HED tends to be governed by non-conscious, automatic processes than conscious, intentional processes. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Social cognitive factors are associated with risky alcohol consumption behaviours. Dual-process models are being used to explain health behaviours, such as heavy episodic drinking (HED). What does this study add? Past HED behaviour and HED habits have direct and indirect effects on students' HED behaviour. Past behaviour and habit attenuate the effects of intentions and implicit alcohol identity on HED.Substance MisuseAlcoholismAlcohol Use and HealthBehavioral and Social ScienceStrokeCancerCardiovascularOral and gastrointestinalGood ServicesSociologyPsychologyClinical Psychologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/55w9t57marticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6m6554wg2023-08-28T17:17:25Zqt6m6554wgClimatic and ecological preferences, and potential vulnerabilities of soil invertebrates to environmental change, remain poorly understood in terrestrial ecosystems globally.

Vegetation and climate drove the diversity and dominant taxa of soil invertebrates. Our results suggest that declines in forest cover and plant diversity, and reductions in plant production associated with increases in aridity, can result in reductions of the diversity of soil invertebrates in a drier and more managed world. We further developed global atlases of the diversity of these important soil invertebrates, which were cross-validated using an independent database. Our study advances the current knowledge of the ecological preferences and vulnerabilities of the diversity and presence of functionally important soil invertebrates in soils from across the globe. This information is fundamental for improving and prioritizing conservation efforts of soil genetic resources and management policies.Life on neuroimaging can provide insight into the neurobiological factors that contribute to the variations in individual hearing outcomes following cochlear implantation. To date, measuring neural activity within the auditory cortex of cochlear implant (CI) recipients has been challenging, primarily because the use of traditional neuroimaging techniques is limited in people with CIs. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging technology that offers benefits in this population because it is non-invasive, compatible with CI devices, and not subject to electrical artifacts. However, there are important considerations to be made when using fNIRS to maximize the signal to noise ratio and to best identify meaningful cortical responses. This review considers these issues, the current data, and future directions for using fNIRS as a clinical application in individuals with CIs. This article is part of a Special Issue method for real time mapping of optodes-scalp coupling in functional several dozen of optodes to enable reconstructing a hemodynamic image of the entire cerebral cortex. Despite its potential clinical applicability, widespread use of fNIRS with human subjects is currently limited by unresolved issues, namely the collection from the entirety of optical channels of signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sufficient to carry out a reliable estimation of cortical hemodynamics, and the considerable amount of time that placing numerous optodes take with individuals for whom achieving good optical coupling to the scalp is difficult due to thick or dark hair. To address these issues, we developed a numerical method that: 1) at the channel level, computes an objective measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) related to its optical coupling to the scalp, akin to electrode conductivity used in electroencephalography (EEG), and 2) at the optode level, determines and displays the coupling status of all individual optodes in real time on a model of a human head. This approach aims to shorten the pre-acquisition preparation time by visually displaying which optodes require further adjustment for optimum scalp coupling, and to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all optical channels contributing to the functional hemodynamic mapping.

We examined soils collected from 20 distinct profiles across the United States to characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities that live in subsurface soils and to determine whether there are consistent changes in soil microbial communities with depth across a wide range of soil and environmental conditions. We found that bacterial and archaeal diversity generally decreased with depth, as did the degree of similarity of microbial communities to those found in surface horizons. We observed five phyla that consistently increased in relative abundance with depth across our soil profiles: Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Euryarchaeota, and candidate phyla GAL15 and AD3). Leveraging the unusually high abundance of Dormibacteraeota at depth, we assembled genomes representative of this candidate phylum and identified traits that are likely to be beneficial in low-nutrient environments, including the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, the potential to use carbon monoxide (CO) as a supplemental energy source, and the ability to form spores. Together these attributes likely allow members of the candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota to flourish in deeper soils and provide insight into the survival and growth strategies employed by the microbes that thrive in oligotrophic soil environments.IMPORTANCE Soil profiles are rarely homogeneous. Resource availability and microbial abundances typically decrease with soil depth, but microbes found in deeper horizons are still important components of terrestrial ecosystems. By studying 20 soil profiles across the United States, we documented consistent changes in soil bacterial and archaeal communities with depth. Deeper soils harbored communities distinct from those of the more commonly studied surface horizons. Most notably, we found that the candidate phylum Dormibacteraeota (formerly AD3) was often dominant in subsurface soils, and we used genomes from uncultivated members of this group to identify why these taxa are able to thrive in such resource-limited environments.

Recent outbreaks of acute disease in Montana and Nebraska, USA, suggest shifts in geographic distribution, necessitating updated prevalence maps. To create a weighted overlay geographic suitability model for Histoplasma, we used a geographic information system to combine satellite imagery integrating land cover use (70%), distance to water (20%), and soil pH (10%). We used logistic regression modeling to compare our map with state-level histoplasmosis incidence data from a 5% sample from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. When compared with the state-based Centers data, the predictive accuracy of the suitability score-predicted states with high and mid-to-high histoplasmosis incidence was moderate. Preferred soil environments for Histoplasma have migrated into the upper Missouri River basin. Suitability score mapping may be applicable to other geographically specific infectious vectors.Infectious DiseasesInfectionGood Health and of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0bj8s969articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0d48p78c2023-08-28T16:47:07Zqt0d48p78cGenetic mapping reveals Nfkbid as a central regulator of humoral immunity to Toxoplasma gondiiSouza, Scott Y2021-01-01Protective immunity to parasitic infections has been difficult to elicit by vaccines. Among parasites that evade vaccine-induced immunity is Toxoplasma gondii, which causes lethal secondary infections in chronically infected mice. Here we report that unlike susceptible C57BL/6J mice, A/J mice were highly resistant to secondary infection. To identify correlates of immunity, we utilized forward genetics to identify Nfkbid, a nuclear regulator of NF-B that is required for B cell activation and B-1 cell development. Nfkbid-null mice (\"bumble\") did not generate parasite-specific IgM and lacked robust parasite-specific IgG, which correlated with defects in B-2 cell maturation and class-switch recombination. Though high-affinity antibodies were B-2 derived, transfer of B-1 cells partially rescued the immunity defects observed in bumble mice and were required for 100% vaccine efficacy in bone marrow chimeric mice. Immunity in resistant mice correlated with robust isotype class-switching in both B cell lineages, which can be fine-tuned by Nfkbid gene expression. We propose a model whereby humoral immunity to T. gondii is regulated by Nfkbid and requires B-1 and B-2 cells for full protection.GeneticsVaccine RelatedEmerging Infectious DiseasesInfectious NanhaoLiWang, AndyWang, LeePing2021-10-01Proteins that can reversibly alternate between distinctly different folds under native conditions are described as being metamorphic. The \"metamorphome\" is the collection of all metamorphic proteins in the proteome, but it remains unknown the extent to which the proteome is populated by this class of proteins. We propose that uncovering the metamorphome will require a synergy of computational screening of protein sequences to identify potential metamorphic behavior and validation through experimental techniques. This perspective discusses computational and experimental approaches that are currently used to predict and characterize metamorphic proteins as well as the need for developing improved methodologies. Since metamorphic proteins act as molecular switches, understanding their properties and behavior could lead to novel applications of these proteins as sensors in biological or environmental contexts.Generic health relevanceAmino Acid SequenceProtein FoldingProteomefold switchingKaiBlymphotactinmetamorphic proteinmetamorphomeBiophysicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of climate have univariate changes across global landsAbatzoglou, John TDobrowski, Solomon ZParks, Sean A2020-01-01Changes in individual climate variables have been widely documented over the past century. However, assessments that consider changes in the collective interaction amongst multiple climate variables are relevant for understanding climate impacts on ecological and human systems yet are less well documented than univariate changes. We calculate annual multivariate climate departures during 1958-2017 relative to a baseline 1958-1987 period that account for covariance among four variables important to Earth's biota and associated systems: annual climatic water deficit, annual evapotranspiration, average minimum temperature of the coldest month, and average maximum temperature of the warmest month. Results show positive trends in multivariate climate departures that were nearly three times that of univariate climate departures across global lands. Annual multivariate climate departures exceeded two standard deviations over the past decade for approximately 30% of global lands. Positive trends in climate departures over the last six decades were found to be primarily the result of changes in mean climate conditions consistent with the modeled effects of anthropogenic climate change rather than changes in variability. These results highlight the increasing novelty of annual climatic conditions viewed through a multivariate lens and suggest that changes in multivariate climate departures have generally outpaced univariate departures in recent decades.Climate Actionapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/92k571mvarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3x43f5r12023-08-28T16:24:35Zqt3x43f5r1Latino and Non-Latino Perceptions of the (SJV) of California has poor air quality, high rates of asthma, and high rates of obesity. Informational campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the health impacts of poor air quality and promoting behavior change need to be tailored to the specific target audiences. The study examined perceptions of air quality, perceived health impacts, and methods of accessing information about air quality between Latinos and other groups in the SJV. Residents of the SJV (n = 744) where surveyed via one of three methods: community organizations (256), public locations (251), and an internet panel (237). The results suggest that people perceive the air quality in their region to be generally unhealthy, particularly for sensitive groups. The air quality is more likely to be reported as being unhealthy by people with health problems and less unhealthy by Latinos and people who report regularly exercising. Latinos are more likely to report working outdoors regularly, but also more likely to report being able to reduce their exposure if the air quality is unhealthy. The results report differences in informational sources about air quality, suggesting that informational campaigns should target high risk groups using a variety of media.Clinical ResearchAdultAir DietProtogerou, CleoLeroy, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricHagger, Martin S2021-01-01The adoption of carbohydrate-restrictive diets to improve health is increasing in popularity, but there is a dearth of research on individuals who choose to severely restrict or entirely exclude carbohydrates. The present study investigated the beliefs and experiences of individuals following a diet that severely limits, or entirely excludes, dietary carbohydrates, colloquially known as a 'zero-carb' diet, for at least 6 months. Zero-carb dieters (n = 170) recruited via a social networking site completed an online qualitative survey prompting them to discuss their motives, rationale, and experiences of following a low-carb diet. Transcripts of participants' responses were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results revealed that participants' decision to follow a zero-carb diet was driven by health concerns and benefits. Participants expressed a strong social identity and belongingness to online zero-carb communities. Participants reported strong intentions to follow the diet indefinitely. Shortcomings of the diet centered on experienced stigma; lack of support from healthcare providers and significant others; limited access to, and high cost of, foods; and limited scientific data on the diet. Further research into the benefits and shortcomings of zero-carb diets across settings and populations is warranted, and guidelines for healthcare professionals on how to support individuals following a zero-carb diet are needed.Clinical ResearchNutritionBehavioral and Social Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, with Bayesian finite sample Maxwell BRossi, John TBalch, Jennifer K2019-09-01Wildfires are becoming more frequent in parts of the globe, but predicting where and when wildfires occur remains difficult. To predict wildfire extremes across the contiguous United States, we integrate a 30-yr wildfire record with meteorological and housing data in spatiotemporal Bayesian statistical models with spatially varying nonlinear effects. We compared different distributions for the number and sizes of large fires to generate a posterior predictive distribution based on finite sample maxima for extreme events (the largest fires over bounded spatiotemporal domains). A zero-inflated negative binomial model for fire counts and a lognormal model for burned areas provided the best performance. This model attains 99% interval coverage for the number of fires and 93% coverage for fire sizes over a six year withheld data set. Dryness and air temperature strongly predict extreme wildfire probabilities. Housing density has a hump-shaped relationship with fire occurrence, with more fires occurring at intermediate housing densities. Statistically, these drivers affect the chance of an extreme wildfire in two ways: by altering fire size distributions, and by altering fire frequency, which influences sampling from the tails of fire size distributions. We conclude that recent extremes should not be surprising, and that the contiguous United States may be on the verge of even larger wildfire extremes.Bayes TheoremFiresHousingModelsStatisticalUnited StatesWildfiresBayesianclimateextremesfirespatiotemporalwildfireEnvironmental SciencesBiological SciencesAgricultural and Veterinary SciencesEcologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1gj2j80qarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9zs322sc2023-08-28T15:56:34Zqt9zs322scTerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015Abatzoglou, John TDobrowski, Solomon ZParks, Sean AHegewisch, Katherine a dataset of high-spatial resolution (1/24\u00b0, ~4-km) monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2015. TerraClimate uses climatically aided interpolation, combining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the WorldClim dataset, with coarser resolution time varying (i.e., monthly) data from other sources to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure, and solar radiation. TerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets using a water balance model that incorporates reference evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water capacity. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time varying climate and climatic water balance data. We validated spatiotemporal aspects of TerraClimate using annual temperature, precipitation, and calculated reference evapotranspiration from station data, as well as annual runoff from streamflow gauges. TerraClimate datasets showed noted improvement in overall mean absolute error and increased spatial realism relative to coarser resolution gridded datasets.Climate Actionapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9zs322scarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7453255n2023-08-28T15:56:20Zqt7453255nThe Changing Strength and Nature of Fire-Climate Relationships in the Northern Rocky Mountains, U.S.A., 1902-2008Higuera, Philip EAbatzoglou, John TLittell, Jeremy SMorgan, PenelopeCarcaillet, Christopher2015-01-01Time-varying may represent an important component of fire-regime variability, relevant for understanding the controls of fire and projecting fire activity under global-change scenarios. We used time-varying statistical models to evaluate if and how fire-climate relationships varied from 1902-2008, in one of the most flammable forested regions of the western U.S.A. Fire-danger and water-balance metrics yielded the best combination of calibration accuracy and predictive skill in modeling annual area burned. The strength of fire-climate relationships varied markedly at multi-decadal scales, with models explaining < 40% to 88% of the variation in annual area burned. The early 20th century (1902-1942) and the most recent two decades (1985-2008) exhibited strong fire-climate relationships, with weaker relationships for much of the mid 20th century (1943-1984), coincident with diminished burning, less fire-conducive climate, and the initiation of modern fire fighting. Area burned and the strength of fire-climate relationships increased sharply in the mid 1980s, associated with increased temperatures and longer potential fire seasons. Unlike decades with high burning in the early 20th century, models developed using fire-climate relationships from recent decades overpredicted area burned when applied to earlier periods. This amplified response of fire to climate is a signature of altered fire-climate-relationships, and it implicates non-climatic factors in this recent shift. Changes in fuel structure and availability following 40+ yr of unusually low fire activity, and possibly land use, may have resulted in increased fire vulnerability beyond expectations from climatic factors alone. Our results highlight the potential for non-climatic factors to alter fire-climate relationships, and the need to account for such dynamics, through adaptable statistical or processes-based models, for accurately predicting future fire activity.Climate ActionClimateDisastersEcosystemFiresHistory20th CenturyHistory21st StatesGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7453255narticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt74q0h9k72023-08-28T15:56:15Zqt74q0h9k7Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forestsAbatzoglou, John TWilliams, A Park2016-10-18Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000-2015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (>1 ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for 55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984-2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.Climate ActionClimate ChangeForestsHuman MariaKolden, Crystal A2018-11-01Climate shapes geographic and seasonal patterns in global fire activity by mediating vegetation composition, productivity, and desiccation in conjunction with land-use and anthropogenic factors. Yet, the degree to which climate variability affects interannual variability in burned area across Earth is less understood. Two decades of satellite-derived burned area records across forested and nonforested areas were used to examine global interannual climate-fire relationships at ecoregion scales. Measures of fuel aridity exhibited strong positive correlations with forested burned area, with weaker relationships in climatologically drier regions. By contrast, cumulative precipitation antecedent to the fire season exhibited positive correlations to nonforested burned area, with stronger relationships in climatologically drier regions. Climate variability explained roughly one-third of the interannual variability in burned area across global ecoregions. These results highlight the importance of climate variability in enabling fire activity globally, but also identify regions where anthropogenic and other influences may facilitate weaker relationships. Empirical fire modeling efforts can complement process-based global fire models to elucidate how fire activity is likely to change amidst complex interactions among climatic, vegetation, and human factors.Life on LandClimateFiresForestsHumansModelsTheoreticalSeasonsclimateecoregionsfireglobalmodelingEnvironmental SciencesBiological BRyals, California (Sacramento, Solano, and Merced counties) that received biosolids applications for 20 yr.

Measurements included soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) concentrations from 0 to 100 cm and microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN) from 0 to 30 cm in biosolids-amended and control sites. Biosolids treatments had greater amounts of SOC and total N at all sites, and MBC and MBN were greatest at Sacramento and Solano. The largest increases in SOC were at the site that received the lowest cumulative loading rate of biosolids (Solano), where SOC content to 100 cm was 50% greater in amended soils (p < .001). Net changes in soil C stocks to 30 cm were 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 (Solano), -0.04 \u00b1 0.1 (Merced), (Sacramento) Mg C ha-1 yr-1 . These values change when considering deeper soil depths (0-100 cm) to 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 (Solano), 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 (Sacramento) Mg C ha-1 yr-1 , reflecting differences in C stocks changes in surface and subsurface soils across sites.

Our results suggest that local controls on soil C stabilization are more important than amendment application amount at predicting climate benefits and that accounting for soil C changes below 30 cm can provide insight for sequestering C in agroecosystems.BiosolidsCarbonFertilizersNitrogenSoilEarth SciencesEnvironmental SciencesBiological SciencesAgronomy & Agricultureapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6vz1m0nkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt92z1x9fr2023-08-28T15:46:46Zqt92z1x9frThyroid hormones and the potential for regulating glucose metabolism in cardiomyocytes during insulin resistance and T2DMMendez, Dora AOrtiz, Rudy M2021-08-01In order for the heart to maintain its continuous mechanical work and provide the systolic movement to uphold coronary blood flow, substantial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is required. Under normal conditions cardiac tissue utilizes roughly 70% fatty acids (FA), and 30% glucose for the production of ATP; however, during impaired metabolic conditions like insulin resistance and diabetes glucose metabolism is dysregulated and FA account for 99% of energy production. One of the major consequences of a shift in FA metabolism in cardiac tissue is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipotoxicity, which ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thyroid hormones (TH) have direct effects on cardiac function and glucose metabolism during impaired metabolic conditions suggesting that TH may improve glucose metabolism in an insulin resistant condition. None-classical TH signaling in the heart has shown to phosphorylate protein kinase B (Akt) and increase activity of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), which are critical mediators in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake pathway. Studies on peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes have demonstrated TH treatment improved glucose intolerance in a diabetic model and increased insulin-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4) mRNA levels. GLUT4 is a downstream target of thyroid response element (TRE), which demonstrates that THs regulate glucose via GLUT4. Elevated 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) increased glucose oxidation rate glycolytic intermediate, fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) cardiomyocytes, in addition mitochondrial biogenesis and pyruvate transport across the mitochondrial membrane. These findings along with a few other studies on T3 treatment in cardiac tissue suggest TH may improve glucose metabolism in an insulin resistant model and ameliorate the effects of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The purpose of this study is to discriminate these hypotheses by assessing EF in populations where the 2 accounts make contrasting predictions.MethodWe use a between-groups design involving 116 children, ages 5-12 years, across 3 groups: (a) participants with normal hearing (n = 45), (b) deaf native signers who had access to American Sign Language from birth (n = 45), and (c) oral cochlear implant users who did not have full access to language prior to cochlear implantation (n = 26). Measures include both parent report and performance-based assessments of EF.ResultsParent report results suggest that early access to language has a stronger impact on EF than early access to sound. Performance-based results trended in a similar direction, but no between-group differences were significant.ConclusionsThese results indicate that healthy EF skills do not require audition and therefore that difficulties in this domain do not result primarily from a lack of auditory experience. Instead, results are consistent with the hypothesis that language proficiency, whether in sign or speech, is crucial for the development of healthy EF. Further research is needed to test whether sign language proficiency also confers benefits to deaf children from hearing families.Assistive University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8707v8d3articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2127d3862023-08-28T15:03:03Zqt2127d386Biogeography and speciation of terrestrial fauna in the southwestern Western Australia (SWWA), bordering the temperate Southern and Indian Oceans, is the only global biodiversity hotspot recognised in Australia. Renowned for its extraordinary diversity of endemic plants, and for some of the largest and most botanically significant temperate heathlands and woodlands on Earth, SWWA has long fascinated biogeographers. Its flat, highly weathered topography and the apparent absence of major geographic factors usually implicated in biotic diversification have challenged attempts to explain patterns of biogeography and mechanisms of speciation in the region. Botanical studies have always been central to understanding the biodiversity values of SWWA, although surprisingly few quantitative botanical analyses have allowed for an understanding of historical biogeographic processes in both space and time. Faunistic studies, by contrast, have played little or no role in defining hotspot concepts, despite several decades of accumulating quantitative research on the phylogeny and phylogeography of multiple lineages. In this review we critically analyse datasets with explicit supporting phylogenetic data and estimates of the time since divergence for all available elements of the terrestrial fauna, and compare these datasets to those available for plants. In situ speciation has played more of a role in shaping the south-western Australian fauna than has long been supposed, and has occurred in numerous endemic lineages of freshwater fish, frogs, reptiles, snails and less-vagile arthropods. By contrast, relatively low levels of endemism are found in birds, mammals and highly dispersive insects, and in situ speciation has played a negligible role in generating local endemism in birds and mammals. Quantitative studies provide evidence for at least four mechanisms driving patterns of endemism in south-western Australian animals, including: (i) relictualism of ancient Gondwanan or Pangaean taxa in the High Rainfall Province; (ii) vicariant isolation of lineages west of the Nullarbor divide; (iii) in situ speciation; and (iv) recent population subdivision. From dated quantitative studies we derive four testable models of historical biogeography for animal taxa in SWWA, each explicit in providing a spatial, temporal and topological perspective on patterns of speciation or divergence. For each model we also propose candidate lineages that may be worthy of further study, given what we know of their taxonomy, distributions or relationships. These models formalise four of the strongest patterns seen in many animal taxa from SWWA, although other models are clearly required to explain particular, idiosyncratic patterns. Generating numerous new datasets for suites of co-occurring lineages in SWWA will help refine our understanding of the historical biogeography of the region, highlight gaps in our knowledge, and allow us to derive general postulates from quantitative (rather than qualitative) results. For animals, this process has now begun in earnest, as has the process of taxonomically documenting many of the more diverse invertebrate lineages. The latter remains central to any attempt to appreciate holistically biogeographic patterns and processes in SWWA, and molecular phylogenetic studies should - where possible - also lead to tangible taxonomic outcomes.Life on LandAnimalsAustraliaBiodiversityGenetic SpeciationPhylogenyPhylogeographysystematicsconservationevolutionChordataArachnidaInsectaDiplopodaDecapodaMolluscaOnychophoraBiological SciencesEvolutionary Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of a of Diversification in the Kinsey phenotypes maintained within a single breeding population-is an extreme type of intraspecific diversity widespread across the tree of life. Color polymorphism is hypothesized to be an engine for speciation, where morph loss or divergence between distinct color morphs within a species results in the rapid evolution of new lineages, and thus, color polymorphic lineages are expected to display elevated diversification rates. Multiple species in the lizard family Lacertidae are color polymorphic, making them an ideal group to investigate the evolutionary history of this trait and its influence on macroevolution. Here, we produce a comprehensive species-level phylogeny of the lizard family Lacertidae to reconstruct the evolutionary history of color polymorphism and test if color polymorphism has been a driver of diversification. Accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty with multiple phylogenies and simulation studies, we estimate an ancient origin of color polymorphism (111 Ma) within the Lacertini tribe (subfamily Lacertinae). Color polymorphism most likely evolved few times in the Lacertidae and has been lost at a much faster rate than gained. Evolutionary transitions to color polymorphism are associated with shifts in increased net diversification rate in this family of lizards. Taken together, our empirical results support long-standing theoretical expectations that color polymorphism is a information in Earth System Models (ESMs) is derived from pedo-transfer functions that use easy-to-measure soil attributes to estimate hydraulic parameters. This parameterization relies heavily on soil texture, but overlooks the critical role of soil structure originated by soil biophysical activity. Soil structure omission is pervasive also in sampling and measurement methods used to train pedotransfer functions. Here we show how systematic inclusion of salient soil structural features of biophysical origin affect local and global hydrologic and climatic responses. Locally, including soil structure in models significantly alters infiltration-runoff partitioning and recharge in wet and vegetated regions. Globally, the coarse spatial resolution of ESMs and their inability to simulate intense and short rainfall events mask effects of soil structure on surface fluxes and climate. Results suggest that although soil structure affects local hydrologic response, its implications on global-scale climate remains elusive in current ESMs.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9tv0z8z2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt30n8d7222023-08-28T14:06:41Zqt30n8d722Projected increases in western US forest fire despite growing fuel constraintsAbatzoglou, John TBattisti, David SWilliams, A ParkHansen, Winslow DHarvey, Brian JKolden, Crystal A2021-01-01Escalating burned area in western US forests punctuated by the 2020 fire season has heightened the need to explore near-term macroscale forest-fire area trajectories. As fires remove fuels for subsequent fires, feedbacks may impose constraints on the otherwise climate-driven trend of increasing forest-fire area. Here, we test how fire-fuel feedbacks moderate near-term (2021-2050) climate-driven increases in forest-fire area across the western US. Assuming constant fuels, climate-fire models project a doubling of forest-fire area compared to 1991-2020. Fire-fuel feedbacks only modestly attenuate the projected increase in forest-fire area. Even models with strong feedbacks project increasing interannual variability in forest-fire area and more than a two-fold increase in the likelihood of years exceeding the 2020 fire season. Fuel limitations from fire-fuel feedbacks are unlikely to strongly constrain the profound climate-driven broad-scale increases in forest-fire area by the mid-21st century, highlighting the need for proactive adaptation to increased western US forest-fire impacts.Climate Actionapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/30n8d722articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6rm8b03n2023-08-28T14:01:55Zqt6rm8b03nTobacco Product Promotions Remain Ubiquitous and Are Associated with Use and Susceptibility to Use Among Adolescents.Fielding-Singh, PriyaEpperson, Anna EProchaska, Judith J2021-01-22IntroductionThe decline in tobacco smoking among US adolescents has been exceeded by the exponential rise in nicotine vaping with an overall net gain in youth tobacco product use. While cigarette companies are restricted from advertising on television/radio, vaping promotions have been largely unrestricted. This study examined exposure to tobacco product promotions in a US sample of 1003 adolescents and its associations with product use and susceptibility to use.Aims and methodsAdolescents (13-17) were recruited online and anonymously surveyed in 2019 about their ever and current (past 30 days) tobacco smoking (cigarette and cigar) and nicotine vaping behaviors, and among never-users, susceptibility to vaping. Multivariate models tested associations with past-month exposure to tobacco product promotions controlling for demographic features, harm perceptions, and family and peer influences.ResultsTobacco product use was 34% ever-use and 20% seen cigarette (91%) and nicotine vaping (80%) product promotions in the past 30 days. A majority reported exposure at point-of-sale and on major (television and cinema) and social media. In adjusted multivariate models, greater exposure to tobacco product promotions was significantly associated with ever and current smoking and vaping; and among never-users, susceptibility to vaping (all p < .01, effect sizes 1.03-1.05). Family/peer use and attitudes also were significant correlates.ConclusionsTobacco product promotions remain ubiquitous and are significantly associated with adolescents' tobacco product use and susceptibility to vape. Peers and family are important social influences and may reflect indirect channels of tobacco marketing. Stricter regulatory restrictions on tobacco marketing to young people are warranted.ImplicationsThis study adds to mounting evidence showing that tobacco marketing remains pervasive and is associated with tobacco use and susceptibility to use. Most youth report seeing cigarette and nicotine vaping product promotions, with notable differences by channel: traditional media predominate for cigarettes and social media/email for e-cigarettes. Greater exposure to tobacco promotions is significantly associated with ever and current smoking and vaping, and among never-users, susceptibility to vaping. The accumulating findings support stricter regulatory restrictions on marketing of tobacco products in media channels accessed by youth.TobaccoPreventionSubstance MisuseTobacco Smoke and HealthCancerClinical ResearchPediatricRespiratoryGood genomic responses of soil microbiomes to high-severity wildfire: linking community assembly to functional potentialDove, Nicholas CTa, NeslihanHart, Stephen C2022-07-01Increasing wildfire severity, which is common throughout the western United States, can have deleterious effects on plant regeneration and large impacts on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling rates. Soil microbes are pivotal in facilitating these elemental cycles, so understanding the impact of increasing fire severity on soil microbial communities is critical. Here, we assess the long-term impact of high-severity fires on the soil microbiome. We find that high-severity wildfires result in a multi-decadal (>25 y) recovery of the soil microbiome mediated by concomitant differences in aboveground vegetation, soil chemistry, and microbial assembly processes. Our results depict a distinct taxonomic and functional successional pattern of increasing selection in post-fire soil microbial communities. Changes in microbiome composition corresponded with changes in microbial functional potential, specifically altered C metabolism and enhanced N cycling potential, which related to rates of potential decomposition and inorganic N availability, respectively. Based on metagenome-assembled genomes, we show that bacterial genomes enriched in our earliest site (4 y since fire) harbor distinct traits such as a robust stress response and a high potential to degrade pyrogenic, polyaromatic C that allow them to thrive in post-fire environments. Taken together, these results provide a biological basis for previously reported process rate measurements and explain the temporal dynamics of post-fire biogeochemistry, which ultimately constrains ecosystem recovery.EcosystemFiresGenomicsMicrobiotaSoilWildfiresEnvironmental SciencesBiological SciencesTechnologyMicrobiologypubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rf7h8czarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0427k9nm2023-08-28T13:42:16Zqt0427k9nmPerceived social support and quality of life among adolescents in residential youth care: a cross-sectional care (RYC) institutions aim to provide care and stability for vulnerable adolescents with several previous and present challenges, such as disrupted attachments, wide-ranging adverse childhood experiences, mental health problems, and poor quality of life (QoL). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide knowledge of the associations between perceived social support and QoL and to explore the potential moderating effect of perceived social support on QoL for adolescents who have experienced maltreatment and polyvictimization.MethodsAll RYC institutions with adolescents between the ages 12-23 in Norway were asked to participate in the study. A total of 86 institutions housing 601 adolescents accepted the invitation, from which 400 adolescents volunteered to participate. The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Interview was used to gather information on maltreatment histories and degree of victimization; the Kinder Lebensqualit\u00e4t Fragebogen was used to measure QoL through several domains (overall QoL, physical well-being, emotional well-being, and self-esteem); and the Social Support Questionnaire was used to measure perceived social support. Linear regression and independent samples t-test were used to study the associations between perceived social support and QoL as well as the potential moderating effect of perceived social support in the association between maltreatment history and QoL.ResultsPerceived social support was positively associated with QoL for both girls and boys, with domain-specific findings. A higher number of different types of support persons was associated with overall QoL, emotional well-being, and self-esteem for boys, but only with self-esteem for girls. Individual social support from RYC staff and friends was associated with higher QoL for girls. However, perceived social support did not moderate the association between maltreatment history and reduced QoL for either sex.ConclusionsThis study emphasizes the importance of maintaining social support networks for adolescents living in RYC, the crucial contribution of RYC staff in facilitating social support, and the potential value of social skills training for these vulnerable adolescents. Furthermore, a wider range of initiatives beyond social support must be carried out to increase QoL among adolescents with major maltreatment and polyvictimization experiences.Child Abuse Neglect ResearchChildhood InjuryMind and BodyPediatricBehavioral and HealthPhysical Injury - ViolenceViolence and Social ScienceClinical supportMaltreatmentPolyvictimizationPublic Health and Health ServicesHealth Policy & Servicesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, protein the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, is tied to the regulation of multiple cellular processes in pathogenic fungi. Here, we show that Candida albicans relies on an ER-resident protein, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (Ire1) for sensing ER stress and activating the UPR. Compromised Ire1 function impacts cellular processes that are dependent on functional secretory homeostasis, as inferred from transcriptional profiling. Concordantly, an Ire1-mutant strain exhibits pleiotropic roles in ER stress response, antifungal tolerance, cell wall regulation and virulence-related traits. Hac1 is the downstream target of C. albicans Ire1 as it initiates the unconventional splicing of the 19 bp intron from HAC1 mRNA during tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Ire1 also activates the UPR in response to perturbations in cell wall integrity and cell membrane homeostasis in a manner that does not necessitate the splicing of HAC1 mRNA. Furthermore, the Ire1-mutant strain is severely defective in hyphal morphogenesis and biofilm formation as well as in establishing a successful infection in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate that C. albicans Ire1 functions to regulate traits that are essential for virulence and suggest its importance in responding to multiple stresses, thus integrating various stress signals to maintain ER homeostasis.GeneticsBiotechnologyBiodefenseInfectious DiseasesPreventionVaccine Related2.1 Biological and endogenous measuring reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage in cells and roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their consequences for health and disease are emerging throughout biological sciences. This development has led researchers unfamiliar with the complexities of ROS and their reactions to employ commercial kits and probes to measure ROS and oxidative damage inappropriately, treating ROS (a generic abbreviation) as if it were a discrete molecular entity. Unfortunately, the application and interpretation of these measurements are fraught with challenges and limitations. This can lead to misleading claims entering the literature and impeding progress, despite a well-established body of knowledge on how best to assess individual ROS, their reactions, role as signalling molecules and the oxidative damage that they can cause. In this consensus statement we illuminate problems that can arise with many commonly used approaches for measurement of ROS and oxidative damage, and propose guidelines for best practice. We hope that these strategies will be useful to those who find their research requiring assessment of ROS, oxidative damage and redox signalling in cells and in vivo.Generic health relevanceAntioxidantsOxidation-ReductionOxidative StressReactive Oxygen SpeciesSignal Transductionapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Jeffrey D2022-03-01Water potential directly controls the function of leaves, roots, and microbes, and gradients in water potential drive water flows throughout the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Notwithstanding its clear relevance for many ecosystem processes, soil water potential is rarely measured in-situ, and plant water potential observations are generally discrete, sparse, and not yet aggregated into accessible databases. These gaps limit our conceptual understanding of biophysical responses to moisture stress and inject large uncertainty into hydrologic and land surface models. Here, we outline the conceptual and predictive gains that could be made with more continuous and discoverable observations of water potential in soils and plants. We discuss improvements to sensor technologies that facilitate in situ characterization of water potential, as well as strategies for building new networks that aggregate water potential data across sites. We end by highlighting novel opportunities for linking more representative site-level observations of water potential to remotely-sensed proxies. Together, these considerations offer a roadmap for clearer links between ecohydrological processes and the water potential gradients that have the 'potential' to substantially reduce conceptual and modeling uncertainties.Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9m0180tgarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9bq203x52023-08-28T12:51:08Zqt9bq203x5Transcriptional Circuits Regulating Developmental Processes in member of the human microbiota that colonizes multiple niches in the body including the skin, oral cavity, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of healthy individuals. It is also the most common human fungal pathogen isolated from patients in clinical settings. C. albicans can cause a number of superficial and invasive infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. The ability of C. albicans to succeed as both a commensal and a pathogen, and to thrive in a wide range of environmental niches within the host, requires sophisticated transcriptional regulatory programs that can integrate and respond to host specific environmental signals. Identifying and characterizing the transcriptional regulatory networks that control important developmental processes in C. albicans will shed new light on the strategies used by C. albicans to colonize and infect its host. Here, we discuss the transcriptional regulatory circuits controlling three major developmental processes in C. albicans: biofilm formation, the white-opaque phenotypic switch, and the commensal-pathogen transition. Each of these three circuits are tightly knit and, through our analyses, we show that they are integrated together by extensive regulatory crosstalk between the core regulators that comprise each circuit.Dental/Oral and Craniofacial DiseaseInfectious DiseasesAetiology2.1 Biological and endogenous and unequal: Unincorporated community status as a structural determinant of healthGomez-Vidal, CristinaGomez, Anu Manchikanti2021-09-01Despite increasing awareness of the importance of political determinants of health, place-based research has not interrogated one of the most common political statuses: the impact of living in a community without municipal incorporation. In 2010 an estimated 37% of the U.S. population lived in an unincorporated area; despite their ubiquity, unincorporated communities are largely absent from the public health literature. Residents of unincorporated areas typically do not have their own local (e.g., city or municipal) government. This lack of representation leads to political exclusion and diminished access to resources, especially for low-income communities of color, Furthermore, by not disaggregating health data to unincorporated communities, residents are subsumed into county or census tract data that may not be reflective of their community's composition or context. Without jurisdictional distinction in research, there is no accountability for the manufacturing of health inequities in unincorporated communities . In the absence of empirical research on unincorporated communities, this paper uses the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) Framework of the World Health Organization to argue that lack of municipal status is a structural determinant of health responsible for social conditions which generate cumulative health risks for residents. This includes using existing evidence on social conditions typical of unincorporated communities to describe patterns of residential segregation, neighborhood disadvantage, and environmental hazards that may increase residents' exposure to unhealthy environments in unincorporated communities. Finally, we provide an agenda for future public health research that can begin to address this health and racial equity gap for low-income unincorporated communities of color who have, until now, been absent in health equity discourse.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceBehavioral and Social ScienceGeneric health multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen Candida auris is becoming a worldwide public health threat that has been attracting considerable attention due to its rapid and widespread emergence over the past decade. The reasons behind the recent emergence of this fungus remain a mystery to date. Genetic analyses indicate that this fungal pathogen emerged simultaneously in several different continents, where 5 genetically distinct clades of C. auris were isolated from distinct geographical locations. Although C. auris belongs to the CTG clade (its constituent species translate the CTG codon as serine instead of leucine, as in the standard code), C. auris is a haploid fungal species that is more closely related to the haploid and often multidrug-resistant species Candida haemulonii and Candida lusitaniae and is fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Infections and outbreaks caused by C. auris in hospitals settings have been rising over the past several years. Difficulty in its identification, multidrug resistance properties, evolution of virulence factors, associated high mortality rates in patients, and long-term survival on surfaces in the environment make C. auris particularly problematic in clinical settings. Here, we review progress made over the past decade on the biological and clinical aspects of C. auris. Future efforts should be directed toward understanding the mechanistic details of its biology, epidemiology, antifungal resistance, and pathogenesis with a goal of developing novel tools and methods for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of C. auris infections.Vaccine RelatedAntimicrobial ResistanceInfectious DiseasesPreventionGeneticsAetiology2.2 Factors relating Well BeingAntifungal AgentsCandidaCandidiasisDrug ResistanceFungalHumansSaccharomycetalesVirulenceMicrobiologyImmunologyMedical MicrobiologyVirologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/96089366articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt84c7w5gc2023-08-28T11:38:12Zqt84c7w5gcInteractions of microorganisms focus on Candida albicansArevalo, Ashley ValleNobile, Clarissa J2020-09-01Mucus is an important host innate defense factor that lines most epithelial cell layers of the body and provides crucial physical and biological protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Mucins are the main glycoproteins of mucus that are responsible for interacting with microorganisms and are critical for the antimicrobial properties of mucus. The mechanisms by which microorganisms interact with mucins are poorly understood, especially in terms of fungi, and these interactions are continually evolving. Work in bacterial pathogens has shown that mucins inhibit bacterial virulence traits, including quorum sensing, toxin secretion and biofilm formation. Among the fungal clade, human fungal pathogen and commensal Candida albicans engages in constant battle with the host innate immune system. This battle creates strong selective pressures for C. albicans to evolve in response to the host. Recent work in C. albicans found that mucins inhibit specific virulence traits, such as surface adherence, filamentation, biofilm formation and the production of secreted proteases. Here we review the current knowledge of microbial interactions with mucins, with a special emphasis on the interactions between C. albicans and mucins.Infectious DiseasesPreventionEmerging Infectious DiseasesAetiology2.2 and profiles have been measured and semiquantitatively modeled for core/shell quantum dots consisting of 2.7 nm diameter zincblende CdSe cores and thin (0.5 nm) or thick (1.6 nm) CdS shells. The Raman spectra show previously reported trends of increased peak frequency for both the CdSe and the CdS longitudinal optical (LO) phonons with increasing shell thickness. We also find a strong dependence of the peak CdS frequency on excitation energy and a large discrepancy between the experimental frequency of the CdSe + CdS combination band and the sum of the corresponding fundamental frequencies. This suggests that the dominant transitions at high excitation energies are localized on either the CdSe core or the CdS shell and thereby cannot enhance combination band transitions between core and shell. The CdS to CdSe Raman intensity ratios at high excitation energies further support this picture. The electron-phonon coupling for the CdSe LO phonon in the lowest excitonic transition is slightly weaker in the core/shell structures than in pure CdSe quantum dots, contrary to expectations for the Fr\u00f6hlich coupling mechanism. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.core/shellquantum dotelectron-phonon couplingFrohlichresonance RamanFr\u00f6hlichelectronphonon couplingNanoscience & Nanotechnologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, for Landau-de Gennes Numerical of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/66m664mspublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1hn9639j2023-08-28T10:28:22Zqt1hn9639jGetting by with a little help from friends and colleagues: Testing how residents' social support networks affect loneliness and burnout.Rogers, EamonnPolonijo, Andrea NCarpiano, Richard M2016-11-01ObjectiveTo determine how residents' relationships with their sources of social support (ie, family, friends, and colleagues) affect levels of burnout and loneliness.DesignCross-sectional survey.SettingFaculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.ParticipantsA total of 198 physician-trainees in the university's postgraduate medical education program.Main outcome measuresResidents' personal and work-related burnout scores (measured using items from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory); loneliness (measured using a 3-item loneliness scale); and social support (assessed with the Lubben Social Network Scale, version 6).ResultsOf the 234 respondents who completed the Internet-based survey (a 22% response rate), 198 provided complete information on all study variables and thus constituted the analytic sample. Seemingly unrelated regression analyses indicated that loneliness was significantly (P < .01) and positively associated with both personal and work-related burnout scores. Greater friend-based and colleague-based social support were both indirectly associated with lower personal and work-related burnout scores through their negative associations with loneliness.ConclusionSocial relationships might help residents mitigate the deleterious effects of burnout. By promoting interventions that stabilize and nurture social relationships, hospitals and universities can potentially help promote resident resilience and well-being and, in turn, improve patient care.Clinical ResearchBehavioral and Social ServicesGeneral Internal MedicinepubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1hn9639jarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt52p6t5242023-08-28T10:10:14Zqt52p6t524Efficacy of Sterile Fecal Filtrate Transfer effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). However, transferring undefined living bacteria entails uncontrollable risks for infectious and metabolic or malignant diseases, particularly in immunocompromised patients. We investigated whether sterile fecal filtrates (containing bacterial debris, proteins, antimicrobial compounds, metabolic products, and oligonucleotides/DNA), rather than intact microorganisms, are effective in patients with CDI.MethodsWe performed a clinical case series to investigate the effects of fecal filtrate transfer (FFT) in 5 patients with symptomatic chronic-relapsing CDI at the Department of Internal Medicine I at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany). Patients were followed up for at least 6 months and for up to 33 months. Stool was collected from 5 donors selected by the patients, and fully characterized according to FMT standards. Stool was sterile-filtered to remove small particles and bacteria; the filtrate was transferred to patients in a single administration via nasojejunal tube. Fecal samples were collected from patients before and at 1 week and 6 weeks after FFT. Microbiome, virome, and proteome profiles of donors and patients were compared.ResultsIn all 5 patients, FFT restored normal stool habits and eliminated symptoms of CDI for a minimum period of 6 months. Proteome analyses of selected FFT filtrates showed no obvious protein candidates associated with therapeutic efficacy. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing detected diverse bacterial DNA signatures in the filtrates. Analysis of virus-like particles from a filtrate found to reduce symptoms of CDI showed a complex signature of bacteriophages. Bacterial phylogeny and virome profile analyses of fecal samples from recipients indicated longitudinal changes in microbial and viral community structures after FFT.ConclusionsA preliminary investigation of 5 patients with CDI shows that transfer of sterile filtrates from donor stool (FFT), rather than fecal microbiota, can be sufficient to restore normal stool habits and eliminate symptoms. This finding indicates that bacterial components, metabolites, or bacteriophages mediate many of the effects of FMT, and that FFT might be an alternative approach, particularly for immunocompromised patients.PreventionDigestive evidence showing host specificity of colonizing bacteria supports the view that multicellular organisms are holobionts comprised of the macroscopic host in synergistic interdependence with a heterogeneous and host-specific microbial community. Whereas host-bacteria interactions have been extensively investigated, comparatively little is known about host-virus interactions and viral contribution to the holobiont. We sought to determine the viral communities associating with different Hydra species, whether these viral communities were altered with environmental stress, and whether these viruses affect the Hydra-associated holobiont. Here we show that each species of Hydra harbors a diverse host-associated virome. Primary viral families associated with Hydra are Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Inoviridae, and Herpesviridae. Most Hydra-associated viruses are bacteriophages, a reflection of their involvement in the holobiont. Changes in environmental conditions alter the associated virome, increase viral diversity, and affect the metabolism of the holobiont. The specificity and dynamics of the virome point to potential viral involvement in regulating microbial associations in the Hydra holobiont. While viruses are generally regarded as pathogenic agents, our study suggests an evolutionary conserved ability of viruses to function as holobiont regulators and, therefore, constitutes an emerging paradigm shift in host-microbe interactions.Infectious Diseases2.2 Factors relating to the physical environmentAetiologyInfectionAnimalsBacteriaBacteriophagesHydraReproducibility AnalysisDNASpecies SpecificitySymbiosisVirusesGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University viruses matterBosch, Thomas CGGrasis, Juris ALachnit, Tim2015-03-01While largely studied because of their harmful effects on human health, there is growing appreciation that viruses are also important members of the animal holobiont. This review highlights recent findings on viruses associated with Hydra and related Cnidaria. These early evolutionary diverging animals not only select their bacterial communities but also select for viral communities in a species-specific manner. The majority of the viruses associating with these animals are bacteriophages. We demonstrate that the animal host and its virome have evolved into a homeostatic, symbiotic relationship and propose that viruses are an important part of the Hydra holobiont by controlling the species-specific microbiome. We conclude that beneficial virus-bacterial-host interactions should be considered as an integral part of animal development and evolution.Emerging Infectious DiseasesInfectious DiseasesAetiology2.2 Factors infrastructure exposure to large wildfires in the United StatesModaresi Rad, ArashAbatzoglou, mucosal biofilms display distinct structural and virulence characteristics depending growth conditions and the mitis group form communities in multiple oral sites, where moisture and nutrient availability can change spatially or temporally. This study evaluated structural and virulence characteristics of Candida-streptococcal biofilms formed on moist or semidry mucosal surfaces, and tested the effects of nutrient availability and hyphal morphotype on dual-species biofilms. by immortalized keratinocytes on a fibroblast-embedded collagenous matrix were used. Infections were carried out using Streptococcus oralis strain 34, in combination with a C. albicans wild-type strain, or pseudohyphal-forming mutant strains. Increased moisture promoted a homogeneous surface biofilm by C. albicans. Dual biofilms had a stratified structure, with streptococci growing in close contact with the mucosa and fungi growing on the bacterial surface. Under semidry conditions, Candida formed localized foci of dense growth, which promoted focal growth of streptococci in mixed biofilms. Candida biofilm biovolume was greater under moist conditions, albeit with minimal tissue invasion, compared with semidry conditions. Supplementing the infection medium with nutrients under semidry conditions intensified growth, biofilm biovolume and tissue invasion/damage, without changing biofilm structure. Under these conditions, the pseudohyphal mutants and S. oralis formed defective superficial biofilms, with most bacteria in contact with the epithelial surface, below a pseudohyphal mass, resembling biofilms growing in a moist environment. The presence of S. oralis promoted fungal invasion and tissue damage under all conditions. We conclude that moisture, nutrient availability, hyphal morphotype and the presence of commensal bacteria influence the architecture and virulence characteristics of mucosal fungal biofilms.Infectious DiseasesDental/Oral and modelsStreptococcusDentistryImmunologyMedical Microbiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of phase separate to form liquid condensates, which are emerging as critical compartments in fields as diverse as intracellular organization and soft materials design. A myriad of macromolecules, including the protein FUS, form condensates which behave as isotropic liquids. Here, we investigate the influence of filament dopants on the material properties of protein liquids. We find that the short, biopolymer filaments of actin spontaneously partition into FUS droplets to form composite liquid droplets. As the concentration of the filament dopants increases, the coalescence time decreases, indicating that the dopants control viscosity relative to surface tension. The droplet shape is tunable and ranges from spherical to tactoid as the filament length or concentration is increased. We find that the tactoids are well described by a model of a quasi bipolar liquid crystal droplet, where nematic order from the anisotropic actin filaments competes with isotropic interfacial energy from the FUS, controlling droplet shape in a size-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate a versatile approach to Importance of \"Organized Diffusion\" for Scaling Up Community Health Promotion sustained by social norms-collective beliefs about what people expect from each other. Practitioners and researchers alike have been investigating the potential of social norms theory to inform the design of effective interventions addressing these practices in low- and middle-income countries. One approach commonly used to facilitate social norms change is community-based dialogs and trainings. This approach has often been criticized for not being cost-effective, as it usually includes a relatively small number of direct participants and does not allow for scaling-up strategies. In spite of some evidence (as for instance, the SASA! Program) that community dialogs can achieve social norms change, little exists in the literature about how exactly participants in community dialogs engage others in their networks to achieve change. In this paper, we look at the potential of \"organized diffusion\" as a cost-effective strategy to expand the positive effects of community-based interventions to participants' networks, achieving sustainable normative shifts. We provide quantitative evidence from three case studies-Community Empowerment Program in Mali, Change Starts at Home in Nepal, and Voices for Change in Nigeria-showing that participants in community-based interventions can be effectively empowered to share their new knowledge and understandings systematically with others in their networks, eventually facilitating social norms change. Future community-based interventions intending to achieve social norms change would benefit from integrating ways to help participants engage others in their network in transformative conversations.

The necessity to integrate environmental responsiveness and circadian programming is exemplified in photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, which depend on light-driven photochemical processes. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is an excellent model system for dissecting these entwined mechanisms. Its core circadian oscillator, consisting of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, time-of-day signals to clock-output proteins, which reciprocally regulate global transcription. Research performed under constant light facilitates analysis of intrinsic cycles separately from direct environmental responses but does not provide insight into how these regulatory systems are integrated during light-dark cycles. Thus, we sought to identify genes that are specifically necessary in a day-night environment. We screened a dense bar-coded transposon library in both continuous light and daily cycling conditions and compared the fitness consequences of loss of each nonessential gene in the genome. Although the clock itself is not essential for viability in light-dark cycles, the most detrimental mutations revealed by the screen were those that disrupt KaiA. The screen broadened our understanding of light-dark survival in photosynthetic organisms, identified unforeseen clock-protein interaction dynamics, and reinforced the role of the clock as a negative regulator of a nighttime metabolic program that is essential for S. elongatus to survive in the dark.GeneticsSleep ResearchUnderpinning research1.1 Normal biological development and functioningGeneric health sequencingpubliceScholarship, University Glassy Low-Molecular-Weight AIsraelachvili, Jacob N2019-12-03Using a surface forces apparatus (SFA), we quantitatively study the influence of surface damage on the contact mechanics of self-mated glassy polystyrene (PS) films. We use the SFA to measure the contact radius, surface profile, and normal force between the films, including the adhesion force. The molecular weight (MW) of the polymer influences the repeatability of the adhesion measurements and the effective surface energy calculated using the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory. For low-MW PS (MW = 2.33 kDa), the effective surface energy increases over repeated adhesion cycles as the films become progressively damaged. For high-MW PS (MW = 280 kDa), the effective surface energy is constant over repeated adhesion cycles, but hysteresis is still present, manifested in a smaller contact radius during compression of the surfaces than during separation. Our results demonstrate that while the JKR theory is appropriate for describing the contact mechanics of glassy polymer thin films on layered elastic substrates, the contact mechanics of low-MW polymer films can be complicated by surface damage to the films.Chemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9220d4d6articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4xf013mk2023-08-28T04:39:25Zqt4xf013mkDifferent Neuronal Activity Patterns different neuronal activity patterns could each induce a different set of activity-regulated genes. Mapping this coupling between activity pattern and gene induction would allow inference of a neuron's activity-pattern history from its gene expression and improve our understanding of activity-pattern-dependent synaptic plasticity. In genome-scale experiments comparing brief and sustained activity patterns, we reveal that activity-duration history can be inferred from gene expression profiles. Brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the activity-regulated gene program that corresponds to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. Induction of these first-wave genes is mechanistically distinct from that of the later waves because it requires MAPK/ERK signaling but does not require de novo translation. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of gene induction also enable different gene sets to be induced by different activity durations.GeneticsNeurosciencesNeurologicalAnimalsCellsCulturedCerebral Neurosurgeryapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xf013mkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt57h3v1mw2023-08-28T04:08:38Zqt57h3v1mwEffects of 21stcentury climate, land use, and disturbances on ecosystem carbon balance in CaliforniaSleeter, Benjamin MMarvin, David CCameron, Tamara S2019-10-01Terrestrial ecosystems an sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ), sequestering ~30% of annual anthropogenic emissions and slowing the rise of atmospheric CO2 . However, the future direction and magnitude of the land sink is highly uncertain. We examined how historical and projected changes in climate, land use, and ecosystem disturbances affect the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in California over the period 2001-2100. We modeled 32 unique scenarios, spanning 4 land use and 2 radiative forcing scenarios as simulated by four global climate models. Between 2001 and 2015, carbon storage in California's terrestrial ecosystems declined by -188.4 Tg C, with a mean annual flux ranging from a source of -89.8 Tg C/year to a sink of 60.1 Tg C/year. The large variability in the magnitude of the state's carbon source/sink was primarily attributable to interannual variability in weather and climate, which affected the rate of carbon uptake in vegetation and the rate of ecosystem respiration. Under nearly all future scenarios, carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems was projected to decline, with an average loss of -9.4% (-432.3 Tg C) by the year 2100 from current stocks. However, uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon loss was high, with individual scenario projections ranging from -916.2 to 121.2 Tg C and was largely driven by differences in future climate conditions projected by climate models. Moving from a high to a low radiative forcing scenario reduced net ecosystem carbon loss by 21% and when combined with reductions in land-use change (i.e., moving from a high to a low land-use scenario), net carbon losses were reduced by 55% on average. However, reconciling large uncertainties associated with the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 is needed to better constrain models used to establish baseline conditions from which ecosystem-based climate mitigation strategies can individuals from Formative Period (1500 B.C.-A.D. 400) Atacama Desert sites of Ancachi and Quillagua as a means of understanding the dietary and cultural impacts of regional systems of exchange.Materials and methodsThirty-one bone samples recovered from the cemetery of Ancachi (02QU175) and in/around the nearby town of Quillagua were the subject of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of bone collagen and hydroxyapatite and multisource mixture modeling (FRUITS, food reconstruction using isotopic transferred signals) of paleodiet. These individuals were compared with nearly 200 other Formative Period individuals from throughout the region to identify differences in dietary behaviors.Results80.6% (25/31) of the samples yielded sufficient well-preserved collagen and were included in the multisource mixture model. The FRUITS model, which compared individuals with a robust database of available foods from the region, identified a wide diversity of diets in the Ancachi/Quillagua area (including both coastal and interior individuals), and, most notably, thirteen individuals who consumed an average of 11.2 \u00b1 1.9% terrestrial animals, 19.8 \u00b1 1.9% legumes, and 22.5 \u00b1 3.1% marine fauna, a balanced pattern of protein consumption distinct from both the coastal and inland individuals in our larger regional sample.ConclusionsThe combination of stable isotope analysis and multisource mixture modeling permitted the characterization of dietary behavior of 25 individuals from nodal sites in the Atacama Desert, thus enhancing our understanding of the economic and social relationships that bound together Formative Period sites, populations, and individuals in this of family functioning and self-esteem in the quality of life of adolescents referred for psychiatric services: a 3-year Jan L2019-09-01PurposeTo investigate, in adolescents referred for psychiatric services, the associations of initial self-esteem and family functioning with level and change of quality of life (QoL) over a 3-year period, over and above the effect of their emotional problems.MethodsOf 1648 eligible 13-18 years old patients attending the child and adolescent psychiatric clinic (CAP) at least once, 717 (54.8% females) were enrolled at baseline (a response rate of 43.5%). Self- and parent reports on the McMaster Family Assessment Device were obtained. Adolescents reported self-esteem on the Rosenberg Scale, and emotional problems on the Symptom Check List-5. Adolescents completed the Inventory of Life Quality in Children and Adolescents (ILC). After 3 years, 570 adolescents again completed the ILC, and for 418 adolescents parent information was available. The longitudinal analysis sample of 418 adolescents was representative of the baseline sample for age, gender, emotional problems, and QoL. We used modified growth-model analysis, adjusted for SES, age, gender and time of contact with CAP, where residual variances for ILC at baseline and follow-up were fixed to 0.ResultsA poorer family functioning at baseline, reported by parents, was significantly associated with worsening QoL during the 3 years follow-up period (p = 0.001).ConclusionsParents have important knowledge about their families that may reflect long-term influences on QoL development in adolescent psychiatric patients. Health care providers and policy makers should optimize treatment outcomes by addressing family functioning in adolescents with emotional problems.Mental HealthClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social SciencePediatricManagement of diseases and Policy Servicesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/69x9t616articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7dk5w1332023-08-28T03:13:37Zqt7dk5w133Effect of Engineered Nanoparticles Exopolymeric Substances Release from from modern nanotechnologies, can potentially impact the marine environment to pose serious threats to marine ecosystems.

Furthermore, the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration can be triggered by ENPs, suggesting that the EPS release process is mediated through Ca2+ signal pathways. With better understanding of the cellular mechanism mediated ENP-induced EPS release, potential preventative and safety measures can be developed to mitigate negative impact on the marine ecosystem.Life Below WaterNanoparticlesPhytoplanktonCa2+ signalExtracellular polymeric substancesCondensed Matter PhysicsMaterials EngineeringNanotechnologyNanoscience & Nanotechnologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7dk5w133articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5ct701362023-08-28T03:06:27Zqt5ct70136Species detection and individual assignment in species delimitation: can integrative data increase efficacy?Edwards, Danielle LKnowles, L Lacey2014-02-22Statistical species delimitation usually relies on singular data, primarily genetic, for detecting putative species and individual assignment to putative species. Given the variety of speciation mechanisms, singular data may not adequately represent the genetic, morphological and ecological diversity relevant to species delimitation. We describe a methodological framework combining multivariate and clustering techniques that uses genetic, morphological and ecological data to detect and assign individuals to putative species. Our approach recovers a similar number of species recognized using traditional, qualitative taxonomic approaches that are not detected when using purely genetic methods. Furthermore, our approach detects groupings that traditional, qualitative taxonomic approaches do not. This empirical test suggests that our approach to detecting and assigning individuals to putative species could be useful in species delimitation despite varying levels of differentiation across genetic, phenotypic and ecological axes. This work highlights a critical, and often overlooked, aspect of the process of statistical species delimitation-species detection and individual assignment. Irrespective of the species delimitation approach used, all downstream processing relies on how individuals are initially assigned, and the practices and statistical issues surrounding individual assignment warrant careful consideration.GeneticsLife Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5ct70136articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt91d4j8rg2023-08-28T02:43:54Zqt91d4j8rgWe Don't Have a Lot of Healthy Options: Food Environment Perceptions of First-Year, Minority College Students Attending a Food Desert CampusDhillon, college students are at particular risk of dietary maladaptation during their transition to adulthood. A college environment that facilitates consistent access to nutritious food is critical to ensuring dietary adequacy among students. The objective of the study was to examine perceptions of the campus food environment and its influence on the eating choices of first-year students attending a minority-serving university located in a food desert. Focus group interviews with twenty-one first-year students were conducted from November 2016 to January 2017. Students participated in 1 of 5 focus groups. Most interviewees identified as being of Hispanic/Latino or Asian/Pacific Islander origin. A grounded theory approach was applied for inductive identification of relevant concepts and deductive interpretation of patterns and relationships among themes. Themes related to the perceived food environment included adequacy (i.e., variety and quality), acceptability (i.e., familiarity and preferences), affordability, and accessibility (i.e., convenience and accommodation). Subjective norms and processes of decisional balance and agency were themes characterizing interpersonal and personal factors affecting students' eating choices. The perceived environment appeared to closely interact with subjective norms to inform internal processes of decision-making and agency around the eating choices of first-year students attending a minority-serving university campus located in a food desert.Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical ResearchBasic Behavioral global drivers of soil priming is essential to understanding C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. We conducted a survey of soils across 86 globally-distributed locations, spanning a wide range of climates, biotic communities, and soil conditions, and evaluated the apparent soil priming effect using 13C-glucose labeling. Here we show that the magnitude of the positive apparent priming effect (increase in CO2 release through accelerated microbial biomass turnover) was negatively associated with SOC content and microbial respiration rates. Our statistical modeling suggests that apparent priming effects tend to be negative in more mesic sites associated with higher SOC contents. In contrast, a single-input of labile C causes positive apparent priming effects in more arid locations with low SOC contents. Our results provide solid evidence that SOC content plays a critical role in regulating apparent priming effects, with important implications for the improvement of C cycling models under global change scenarios.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/97s664fxarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0t36t6302023-08-28T02:34:57Zqt0t36t630Computing Components of Everyday Stress Responses: Exploring Conceptual Challenges and New OpportunitiesSmyth, M2023-01-01Repeated assessments in everyday life enables collecting ecologically valid data on dynamic, within-persons processes. These methods have widespread utility and application and have been extensively used for the study of stressors and stress responses. Enhanced conceptual sophistication of characterizing intraindividual stress responses in everyday life would help advance the field. This article provides a pragmatic overview of approaches, opportunities, and challenges when intensive ambulatory methods are applied to study everyday stress responses in \"real time.\" We distinguish between three stress-response components (i.e., reactivity, recovery, and pileup) and focus on several fundamental questions: (a) What is the appropriate stress-free resting state (or \"baseline\") for an individual in everyday life? (b) How does one index the magnitude of the initial response to a stressor (reactivity)? (c) Following a stressor, how can recovery be identified (e.g., when the stress response has completed)? and (d) Because stressors may not occur in isolation, how can one capture the temporal clustering of stressors and/or stress responses (pileup)? We also present initial ideas on applying this approach to intervention research. Although we focus on stress responses, these issues may inform many other dynamic intraindividual constructs and behaviors (e.g., physical activity, physiological processes, other subjective states) captured in ambulatory assessment.Clinical ResearchBasic Behavioral and Social Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8jq5r1bspublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2rc502002023-08-28T02:34:21Zqt2rc50200Racial/ethnic disparities in health-related quality of life and health status across pre-, early-, and mid-adolescence: a prospective cohort in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and overall health status among Black, Latino, and White youth during adolescence; (2) whether socioeconomic status (SES) and family contextual variables influence disparities; and (3) whether disparities are consistent from pre- to early- to mid-adolescence.MethodsA population sample of 4823 Black (1755), Latino (1812), and White (1256) youth in three US metropolitan areas was prospectively assessed in a longitudinal survey conducted on three occasions, in 5th, 7th, and 10th grades, when youth reported their HRQOL using the PedsQL short-form Total, Physical and Psychosocial scales and youth and parents separately reported on youth's overall health status. Parents reported their education and household income to index SES, family structure, and use of English at home.ResultsBased on analysis conducted separately at each grade, marked racial/ethnic disparities were observed across all measures of HRQOL and health status, favoring White and disfavoring Black, and especially Latino youth. More strongly present in 5th and 7th grade, HRQOL disparities decreased by 10th grade. Most disparities between White and Black youth disappeared when adjusting for SES. However, even after adjusting for SES, family structure, and English use, overall health status disparities disfavoring Latino youth remained across all three assessments.ConclusionsRacial/ethnic disparities in adolescent HRQOL and health are substantial. These disparities appear consistent from pre- to early-adolescence but diminish for HRQOL by mid-adolescence. As disparities appear influenced by SES and other family contextual variables differently in different racial/ethnic groups, efforts to reduce health disparities in youth should address culturally specific conditions impinging on health.Clinical ResearchPediatricBehavioral and Social ScienceBasic AmericanPublic and Health ServicesPsychologyHealth Policy & Servicesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2rc50200articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2w05g3ts2023-08-28T02:21:19Zqt2w05g3tsSelf-organizing motors divide active KinjalWitten, Thomas AVaikuntanathan, SuriyanarayananGardel, Margaret L2019-06-04The cytoskeleton is a collection of protein assemblies that dynamically impose spatial structure in cells and coordinate processes such as cell division and mechanical regulation. Biopolymer filaments, cross-linking proteins, and enzymatically active motor proteins collectively self-organize into various precise cytoskeletal assemblies critical for specific biological functions. An outstanding question is how the precise spatial organization arises from the component macromolecules. We develop a system to investigate simple physical mechanisms of self-organization in biological assemblies. Using a minimal set of purified proteins, we create droplets of cross-linked biopolymer filaments. Through the addition of enzymatically active motor proteins, we construct composite assemblies, evocative of cellular structures such as spindles, where the inherent anisotropy drives motor self-organization, droplet deformation, and division into two droplets. These results suggest that simple physical principles underlie self-organization in complex biological assemblies and inform bioinspired materials design.Underpinning research1.1 Normal crystalactomyosintactoidsspindleapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2w05g3tsarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt229719cj2023-08-28T02:13:24Zqt229719cjRole in Primary and Secondary Genital and Respiratory muridarum in receptor (TRAIL-R) suppresses inflammation and could therefore affect the course of Chlamydia infections and their long-term sequelae. Wild-type Chlamydia muridarum; the course of the infection was followed with vaginal cultures and the presence of hydrosalpinx determined. To evaluate the role of TRAIL-R following a secondary infection, the mice were vaginally reinfected. WT and TRAIL-R-/- male mice were also infected and reinfected in the respiratory tract, and the course of the diseases and the infections were followed. Following the primary and secondary vaginal infection, no significant differences in vaginal shedding or hydrosalpinx formation were observed between the WT and TRAIL-R-/- mice. The WT and TRAIL-R-/- mice mounted antibody responses in serum and vaginal washes that were not significantly different. After the primary and secondary intranasal infections of the male mice, changes in body weight were determined, and no significant differences were observed between the WT and TRAIL-R-/- mice. Ten days after the primary and the secondary infections, the weight of the lungs and number of C. muridarum inclusion forming units (IFU) were determined. The lungs of the WT mice weighed less compared with the TRAIL-R-/- mice following a primary infection but not after a secondary infection. No differences in the number of C. muridarum IFU in the lungs were observed between the two groups of mice. In conclusion, despite playing a role in inflammation cell-signaling pathways in vitro, TRAIL-R does not appear to play a major role in the susceptibility, clinical outcomes, or long-term sequelae of C. muridarum infections in vivo. IMPORTANCE TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R) is involved in suppressing inflammatory responses. Bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia spp. elicit inflammatory responses in humans following genital, ocular, and respiratory infections. The inflammatory responses are important to control the spread of Chlamydia. However, in certain instances, these inflammatory responses can produce long-term sequelae, including fibrosis. Fibrosis, or scarring, in the genital tract, eye, and respiratory system results in functional deficiencies, including infertility, blindness, and chronic obstructive lung disease, respectively. The goal of this study was to determine if mice deficient in TRAIL-R infected in the genital and respiratory tracts with Chlamydia spp. suffer more or less severe infections, infertility, or lung diseases than wild-type mice. Our results show no differences between the immune responses, infection severity, and long-term sequelae between TRAIL-R knockout and wild-type animals following a genital or a respiratory infection with Chlamydia.Sexually Transmitted InfectionsPreventionInfectious DiseasesLungAetiology2.1 Biological and endogenous Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/229719cjarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5hv7p4nq2023-08-28T02:05:03Zqt5hv7p4nqNICHE AND RANGE SIZE PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT SPECIATION BEGINS IN SMALL, ECOLOGICALLY DIVERGED POPULATIONS IN NORTH (MIMULUS SPP.)Grossenbacher, Dena DSexton, Jason P2014-05-01Closely related species (e.g., sister taxa) often occupy very different ecological niches and can exhibit large differences in geographic distributions despite their shared evolutionary history. Budding speciation is one process that may partially explain how differences in niche and distribution characteristics may rapidly evolve. Budding speciation is the process through which new species form as initially small colonizing populations that acquire reproductive isolation. This mode of species formation predicts that, at the time of speciation, sister species should have highly asymmetrical distributions. We tested this hypothesis in North American monkeyflowers, a diverse clade with a robust phylogeny, using data on geographical ranges, climate, and plant community attributes. We found that recently diverged sister pairs have highly asymmetrical ranges and niche breadths, relative to older sister pairs. Additionally, we found that sister species occupy distinct environmental niche positions, and that 80% of sister species have completely or partially overlapping distributions (i.e., are broadly sympatric). Together, these results suggest that budding speciation has occurred frequently in Mimulus, that it has likely taken place both inside the range and on the range periphery, and that observed divergences in habitat and resource use could be associated with in small Management and Parental Knowledge in Non-Latino White and Latino Youth Managing Type 1 Diabetes.Tucker, ChristyWiebe, Deborah JMain, AlexandraLee, Alyssa GWhite, Perrin C2018-03-01ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to examine associations between adolescents' regulation of information about their type 1 diabetes (adolescent disclosure, secrecy), parental knowledge about their adolescent's diabetes management, diabetes outcomes (adherence, HbA1c), and depressive symptoms in Non-Latino White and Latino families.MethodsIn all, 118 adolescents (56 = Latino, 62 = Non-Latino White) completed surveys of disclosure to and secrecy from parents, parental knowledge of adolescent diabetes management, adherence, and depressive symptoms, and mothers completed measures of maternal knowledge and adolescent adherence. Glycemic control was extracted from medical records. Adolescents also completed structured interviews about parental knowledge about their diabetes-related problems.ResultsInterviews revealed that adolescent disclosure is the primary method by which parents gain knowledge about adolescent diabetes management problems. Adolescent disclosure to and secrecy from parents were uniquely associated with diabetes management and depressive symptoms independent of parental knowledge across ethnic groups; maternal reports of knowledge about her adolescent's diabetes care activities were associated with diabetes management independent of adolescent disclosure and secrecy.ConclusionsAdolescent information management strategies are a primary means by which parents gain knowledge about diabetes, which may facilitate more effective management.DiabetesPediatricPreventionDepressionMental HealthMetabolic and endocrineGood Play Context-Specific Roles in Neuronal Activity-Induced Transcription Arc/Arg3.1 and conserved regulator of eukaryotic gene transcription. However, the exact role of this histone in the transcriptional process remains perplexing. In vertebrates, H2A.Z has two hypervariants, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, that have almost identical sequences except for three amino acid residues. Due to such similarity, functional specificity of these hypervariants in neurobiological processes, if any, remain largely unknown. In this study with dissociated rat cortical neurons, we asked if H2A.Z hypervariants have distinct functions in regulating basal and activity-induced gene transcription. Hypervariant-specific RNAi and microarray analyses revealed that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regulate basal expression of largely nonoverlapping gene sets, including genes that code for several synaptic proteins. In response to neuronal activity, rapid transcription of our model gene Arc is impaired by depletion of H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1. This impairment is partially rescued by codepletion of the H2A.Z chaperone, ANP32E. In contrast, under a different context (after 48 h of tetrodotoxin, TTX), rapid transcription of Arc is impaired by depletion of either hypervariant. Such context-dependent roles of H2A.Z hypervariants, as revealed by our multiplexed gene expression assays, are also evident with several other immediate early genes, where regulatory roles of these hypervariants vary from gene to gene under different conditions. Together, our data suggest that H2A.Z hypervariants have context-specific roles that complement each other to mediate activity-induced neuronal gene transcription.BiotechnologyGeneticsNeurosciences1.1 Normal a zebrafish-optimized optogenetic gene expression system with fine spatial describe optogenetic gene expression system optimized for use in zebrafish. This system overcomes the limitations of current inducible expression systems by enabling robust spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in living organisms. Because existing optogenetic systems show toxicity in zebrafish, we re-engineered the blue-light-activated EL222 system for minimal toxicity while exhibiting a large range of induction, fine spatial precision and rapid kinetics. We validate several strategies to spatially restrict illumination and thus gene induction with our new TAEL (TA4-EL222) system. As a functional example, we show that TAEL is able to induce ectopic endodermal cells in the presumptive ectoderm via targeted sox32 induction. We also demonstrate that TAEL can be used to resolve multiple roles of Nodal signaling at different stages of embryonic development. Finally, we show how inducible gene editing can be achieved by combining the TAEL and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. This toolkit should be a broadly useful resource for the fish community.BioengineeringStem Cell ResearchGeneticsStem Cell Research of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0t62j7nrarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt42j380342023-08-28T00:21:47Zqt42j38034Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Patient Experience in the Inland Empire, CaliforniaPolonijo, Andrea NGardner, AaronClinton, ThomiBrown, Brandon2020-12-01Analyzing secondary data from a 2015 survey of 90 transgender and gender nonconforming individuals in California's Inland Empire, this study reports frequencies of physical and mental health and health care access and discrimination outcomes and differences by age, race/ethnicity, and sex assigned at birth.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of thyroid hormones in the maintenance of a lipid-based metabolism during prolonged fasting in weaned NES pups. To identify additional molecular regulators of fasting, we used a transcriptomics approach to examine changes in global gene expression profiles before and after 6-8 wk of fasting in weaned NES pups. We produced a de novo assembly and identified 98 unique protein-coding genes that were differentially expressed between early and late fasting. Most of the downregulated genes were associated with lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism. A number of downregulated genes were also associated with maintenance of the extracellular matrix, consistent with tissue remodeling during weight loss and the multifunctional nature of blubber tissue, which plays both metabolic and structural roles in marine mammals. Using this data set, we predict potential mechanisms by which NES pups sustain metabolism and regulate adipose stores throughout the fast, and provide a valuable resource for additional studies of extreme metabolic adaptations in mammals.BiotechnologyNutritionGeneticsUnderpinning research2.1 Biological and Between Parental SES and Children's Health-Related Quality of Life: The Role of Objective and Subjective Social Status.Kim, Jan LPeskin, MelissaCuccaro, PaulaElliott, Marc NSchuster, Mark A2018-06-01ObjectiveWe examined (1) the relationship that parental objective social status (OSS) and subjective social status (SSS) have with children's health-related quality of life (HRQOL), (2) whether SSS mediates the association between OSS and HRQOL, and (3) whether these associations differ among Black, Latino, and White children.MethodData came from 4,824 Black, Latino, and White 5th graders in the Healthy PassagesTM study. OSS was measured as parent educational attainment and net equivalent household income. SSS was measured by parent rating of community and national standing on the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status. Child HRQOL was measured with child report on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) physical and psychosocial scales. Structural equation modeling path analysis was conducted using Mplus version 7.4.ResultsThe data supported the hypothesized measurement and structural models. Whereas parental OSS was positively related to psychosocial HRQOL for all three racial/ethnic groups and to physical HRQOL for Latino children, parental SSS was not related to either for any of the racial/ethnic groups. Therefore, mediation by SSS was not supported for any group.ConclusionOSS was confirmed to have stronger association with children's HRQOL than parental SSS. This is in contrast to some research on adults, raising the questions of how best to assess SSS relevant to children and at what point in development SSS may influence children's health and well-being. The persistent relationship found between parental OSS and child health suggests that efforts to improve low socioeconomic resources in families may contribute to improve children's health.Behavioral and Social SciencePediatricClinical Psychologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7x6068wkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0pv2s7ch2023-08-27T23:31:31Zqt0pv2s7chA systematic investigation of reflectance diffuse optical tomography using nonlinear methods and continuous wave measurementsYuan, ZhenZhang, JiangWang, XiaodongLi, Changqing2014-09-01We conducted a systematic investigation of the reflectance diffuse optical tomography using continuous wave (CW) measurements and nonlinear reconstruction algorithms.

To do this, this study derives turbidity from the European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-2 acquired from September 2015 to June 2019 and conducts a rigorous validation with in situ measurements of turbidity from optical sensors at continuous monitoring stations. This validation includes 965 matchup comparisons between satellite and in situ sensor data across 22 stations, yielding R 2 = 0.63 and 0.75 for Nephelometric Turbidity Unit and Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU) stations, respectively. This study then applies remote sensing to evaluate patterns in turbidity during the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates Action (\"Gates action\"), a pilot study designed to increase habitat access and quality for the endangered Delta Smelt. The basic strategy was to direct more freshwater into Suisun Marsh, creating more low salinity habitat that would then have higher (and more suitable) turbidity than upstream river channels. For all seven acquisitions considered from June 29 to September 27, 2018, turbidity conditions in Bays and Sloughs subregions were consistently higher (and more suitable) (26-47 FNU) than what was observed in the upstream River region (13-25 FNU). This overall pattern was observed when comparing images acquired during similar tidal stages and heights.remote sensingwater qualitySuisun of Life MarcSchuster, Mark2014-03-01The aims of the present study were to examine whether Asian American youth experience disparities in quality of life (QL) compared with Hispanic, African American, and white youth in the general population and to what extent socioeconomic status (SES) mediates any disparities among these racial/ethnic groups. Data were obtained from the Healthy Passages study, in which 4,972 Asian American (148; 3%), Hispanic 25%) fifth-graders were enrolled in a population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted in three U.S. metropolitan areas. Youth reported their own QL using the PedsQL and supplemental scales. Parents reported youth's overall health status as well as parent's education and household income level. Asian American youth experienced worse status than white youth for three of 10 QL and well-being measures, better status than Hispanic youth on six measures, and better status than African American youth on three measures. However, the observed advantages for Asian American youth over Hispanic and African American youth disappeared when the marked SES differences that are also present among these racial/ethnic groups were taken into account. In contrast, the differences between Asian American and white youth remained after adjusting for SES. These findings suggest that the disparities in QL that favor white youth over Asian American youth exist independent of SES and warrant further examination. In contrast, the QL differences that favor Asian American over Hispanic and African American youth may be partly explained by SES. Interpretations are limited by the heterogeneity existing among Asian Americans.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical Social Lamina Propria Induce Differentiation of Na\u00efve T Cells into T Cells via play a crucial role in immune tolerance, but mechanisms that induce Treg cells are poorly understood. We here have described eosinophils in lamina propria (LP) that displayed high activity, a rate-limiting step during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) synthesis, and expressed TGF-1 mRNA and high levels of ATRA. Co-incubation assay confirmed that LP eosinophils induced the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into Treg cells. Differentiation promoted by LP eosinophils were inhibited by blocked either TGF-1 or ATRA. Peripheral blood (PB) eosinophils did not produce ATRA and could not induce Treg differentiation. These data identifies LP eosinophils as effective inducers of Treg cell differentiation through a known to synergistically interact with each other in the oral cavity. For example, glucosyltransferase B (GtfB), secreted by S. mutans, can bind to the C. albicans cell surface, promoting dual-species biofilm formation. However, the fungal factors mediating interactions with mutans are unknown. The C. albicans adhesins Als1, Als3, are key players in C. albicans single-species biofilm formation, but their roles, if any, in interacting with S. mutans have not been assessed. Here, we investigated the roles of the C. albicans cell wall adhesins Als1, Als3, and Hwp1 on forming dual-species biofilms with S. mutans. We assessed abilities C. albicans wild-type als3/, als1//als3/, with S. mutans by measuring optical density, metabolic activity, cell enumeration, biomass, thickness, and architecture of the biofilms. We observed that the C. albicans wild-type strain formed enhanced dual-species biofilms in the presence of S. mutans in these different biofilm assays, confirming that C. albicans and S. mutans synergistically interact in the context of biofilms. Our results reveal that C. albicans Als1 and Hwp1 are major players in interacting with S. mutans, since dual-species biofilm formation was not enhanced when the als1/ or hwp1/ strains were cultured with S. mutans in dual-species biofilms. Als3, however, does not seem to play a clear role in interacting with S. mutans in dual-species biofilm formation.

To measure the relative contribution of each, our research design leverages the predictable effect of ambient temperature on human aggression. Using fine-grained data collected by US forces during the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts, we test whether temperature and violence are linked for attacks that can be initiated by individual combatants, but not for those requiring organizational coordination. To distinguish alternative explanations involving temperature effects on target movements, we examine situations where targets are stationary. We find that when individual combatants have discretion over the initiation of violence, ambient temperature does shape battlefield outcomes. There is no such effect when organizational coordination is necessary. We also find that ambient temperature affects combat-age males' endorsement of insurgent violence in a survey taken during the conflict in Iraq. Our findings caution against attributing strategic causes to violence and encourage research into how strategic and individual-level motivations interact in Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4f9985sbarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4f95b02f2023-08-22T20:32:26Zqt4f95b02fContribution of the world's main dust source regions to the global cycle of dustKok, Jessica S2021-01-18Abstract. Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth's atmosphere, the relative contributions of the world's major dust source regions to the global dust cycle remain poorly constrained. This problem hinders accounting for the potentially large impact of regional differences in dust properties on clouds, the Earth's energy balance, and terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we constrain the contribution of each of the world's main dust source regions to the global dust cycle. We use an analytical framework that integrates an ensemble of global model simulations with observationally informed constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth. We obtain a data set that constrains the relative contribution of each of nine major source regions to size-resolved dust emission, atmospheric loading, optical depth, concentration, and deposition flux. We find that the 22-29 Tg (one standard error range) global loading of dust with geometric diameter up to 20 m is partitioned as follows: North African source regions contribute ~50 % (11-15 Tg), Asian source regions contribute ~40 % (8-13 Tg), and North American and Southern Hemisphere regions contribute ~10 % (1.8-3.2 Tg). Current models might on average be overestimating the contribution of North African sources to atmospheric dust loading at ~65 %, while underestimating the contribution of Asian dust at ~30 %. However, both our results and current models could be affected by unquantified biases, such as due to errors in separating dust aerosol optical depth from that produced by other aerosol species in remote sensing retrievals in poorly observed desert regions. Our results further show that each source region's dust loading peaks in local spring and summer, which is partially driven by increased dust lifetime in those seasons. We also quantify the dust deposition flux to the Amazon rainforest to be ~10 Tg/year, which is a factor of 2-3 less than inferred from satellite data by previous work that likely overestimated dust deposition by underestimating the dust mass extinction efficiency.

Here, we improve the simulated dust properties with datasets that leverage measurements of size-resolved dust concentration and asphericity factor (improved simulation) in a coupled global chemical transport model (IMPACT) with a radiative transfer module (RRTMG) (default simulation). The global and annual average of dust aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (DAOD550) from the improved simulation (0.029) falls within the range of a semi-observation-based estimate (0.030 \u00b1 0.005), in contrast to that (0.023) of the default simulation. Improved agreement against semi-observation-based estimate of the radiative effect efficiency was obtained using less absorptive SW and more absorptive LW dust refractive indices. Our sensitivity simulations reveal that the improved simulation leads to a similar net global dust radiative effect at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) on a global scale to the default simulation (0.08 vs. 0.09 W \u00b7m2) but results in less cooling at the surface (0.23 vs. 0.88 W \u00b7m2), because of enhanced LW warming by coarser aspherical dust. Our results thus suggest less atmospheric radiative heating due to aspherical dust with coarser size over the major source regions (0.15 vs. 0.79 W \u00b7m2 on a global scale).Climate Actionapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/16p5p8mqpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt31s4c3tr2023-08-22T20:29:07Zqt31s4c3trContribution of the world's main dust source regions to the global cycle of dustKok, S2021-01-01Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth s atmosphere, the relative contributions of the world s major source regions to the global dust cycle remain poorly constrained. This problem hinders accounting for the potentially large impact of regional differences in dust properties on clouds, the Earth s energy balance, and terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we constrain the contribution of each of the world s main dust source regions to the global dust cycle. We use an analytical framework that integrates an ensemble of global aerosol model simulations with observationally informed constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD). We obtain a dataset that constrains the relative contribution of nine major source regions to size-resolved dust emission, atmospheric loading, DAOD, concentration, and deposition flux. We find that the 22 29 Tg (1 standard error range) global loading of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 um is partitioned as follows: North African source regions contribute 50% (11 15 Tg), Asian source regions contribute 40% (8 13 Tg), and North American and Southern Hemisphere regions contribute 10% (1.8 3.2 Tg). These results suggest that current models on average overestimate the contribution of North African sources to atmospheric dust loading at 65 %, while underestimating the contribution of Asian dust at 30 %. Our results further show that each source region s dust loading peaks in local spring and summer, which is partially driven by increased dust lifetime in those seasons. We also quantify the dust deposition flux to the Amazon rainforest to be 10 Tg yr1, which is a factor of 2 3 less than inferred from satellite data by previous work that likely overestimated dust deposition by underestimating the dust mass extinction efficiency. The data obtained in this paper can be used to obtain improved constraints on dust impacts on clouds, climate, biogeochemical cycles, and other parts of the Earth system.Life Below WaterClimate ActionAstronomical and Space SciencesAtmospheric SciencesMeteorology & Atmospheric Sciencesapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/31s4c3trarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5g7457v82023-08-22T20:28:48Zqt5g7457v8Improved representation of the global dust cycle using observational constraints on dust properties and abundanceKok, SWhicker, Chloe A2021-01-01Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth s atmosphere, atmospheric models struggle to accurately represent its spatial and temporal distribution. These model errors are partially caused by fundamental difficulties in simulating dust emission in coarseresolution models and in accurately representing dust microphysical properties. Here we mitigate these problems by developing a new methodology that yields an improved representation of the global dust cycle. We present an analytical framework that uses inverse modeling to integrate an ensemble of global model simulations with observational constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth.We then compare the inverse model results against independent measurements of dust surface concentration and deposition flux and find that errors are reduced by approximately a factor of 2 relative to current model simulations of the Northern Hemisphere dust cycle. The inverse model results show smaller improvements in the less dusty Southern Hemisphere, most likely because both the model simulations and the observational constraints used in the inverse model are less accurate. On a global basis, we find that the emission flux of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 um (PM20) is approximately 5000 Tg yr1, which is greater than most models account for. This larger PM20 dust flux is needed to match observational constraints showing a large atmospheric loading of coarse dust. We obtain gridded datasets of dust emission, vertically integrated loading, dust aerosol optical depth, (surface) concentration, and wet and dry deposition fluxes that are resolved by season and particle size. As our results indicate that this dataset is more accurate than current model simulations and the MERRA-2 dust reanalysis product, it can be used to improve quantifications of dust impacts on the Earth system.BioengineeringClimate ActionAstronomical and Space SciencesAtmospheric SciencesMeteorology & Atmospheric Sciencesapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5g7457v8articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9g74x2f02023-08-22T20:23:16Zqt9g74x2f0Observations suggest that North African dust absorbs less solar radiation than models estimateAdebiyi, Adeyemi AHuang, YueSamset, Bj\u00f8rn HKok, Jasper F2023-01-01Abstract: Desert dust accounts for a large fraction of shortwave radiation absorbed by aerosols, which adds to the climate warming produced by greenhouse gases. However, it remains uncertain exactly how much shortwave radiation dust absorbs. Here, we leverage in-situ measurements of dust single-scattering albedo to constrain absorption at mid-visible wavelength by North African dust, which accounts for approximately half of the global dust. We find that climate and chemical transport models overestimate North African dust absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) by up to a factor of two. This occurs primarily because models overestimate the dust imaginary refractive index, the effect of which is partially masked by an underestimation of large dust particles. Similar factors might contribute to an overestimation of AAOD retrieved by the Aerosol Robotic Network, which is commonly used to evaluate climate and chemical transport models. The overestimation of dust absorption by models could lead to substantial biases in simulated dust impacts on the Earth system, including warm biases in dust radiative effects.Climate Actionapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9g74x2f0articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9cp497d52023-08-22T20:21:40Zqt9cp497d5A review of coarse mineral dust in the Earth systemAdebiyi, AdeyemiKok, Jasper vasculature is critical to the health of most organ systems in the body. However, the endothelial cells (ECs) forming the vasculature can exhibit a number of distinct functional subphenotypes like arterial or venous ECs, as well as angiogenic tip and stalk ECs. In this study, we investigate the in vitro differentiation of EC subphenotypes from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using our staged induction methods and chemically defined mediums, highly angiogenic EC subpopulations, as well as less proliferative and less migratory EC subpopulations, are derived. Furthermore, the EC subphenotypes exhibit distinct surface markers, gene expression profiles, and positional affinities during sprouting. While both subpopulations contained greater than 80% VE-cad+/CD31+ cells, the tip/stalk-like EC contained predominantly Flt4+/Dll4+/CXCR4+/Flt-1- cells, while the phalanx-like EC was composed of higher numbers of Flt-1+ cells. These studies suggest that the tip-specific EC can be derived in vitro from stem cells as a distinct and relatively stable EC subphenotype without the benefit of its morphological positioning in solution to the challenges of and Robert P2022-10-01Understanding variation of traits within and among species through time and across space is central to many questions in biology. Many resources assemble species-level trait data, but the data and metadata underlying those trait measurements are often not reported. Here, we introduce FuTRES (Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies; pronounced few-tress), an online datastore and community resource for individual-level trait reporting that utilizes a semantic framework. FuTRES already stores millions of trait measurements for paleobiological, zooarchaeological, and modern specimens, with a current focus on mammals. We compare dynamically derived extant mammal species' body size measurements in FuTRES with summary values from other compilations, highlighting potential issues with simply reporting a single mean estimate. We then show that individual-level data improve estimates of body mass-including uncertainty-for zooarchaeological specimens. FuTRES facilitates trait data integration and discoverability, accelerating new research agendas, especially scaling from intra- to interspecific trait variability.Generic health undergoes a rapid structural transition to a degraded phase in ambient conditions, limiting its utility in devices such as optical switches. In this work, we demonstrate that the degradation process in GaTe flakes can be slowed down dramatically via encapsulation with graphene. Through examining Raman signatures of degradation, we show that the choice of substrate significantly impacts the degradation rate and that the process is accelerated by the transfer of GaTe to hydrophilic substrates such as SiO2/Si. We find that double encapsulation with both top and bottom graphene layers can extend the lifetime of the material for several weeks. The photoresponse of flakes encapsulated in this way is only reduced by 17.6 \u00b1 0.4% after 2 weeks, whereas unencapsulated flakes display no response after this time. Our results demonstrate the potential for alternative, van der Waals material-based passivation strategies in unstable layered materials and highlight the need for careful selection of substrates for 2D electronic devices.Chemical EngineeringMaterials Engineeringapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5nr9p629articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5kj3c2832023-08-21T16:17:34Zqt5kj3c283Shark teeth zinc isotope values DewayneKim, Sora L2023-07-01Trophic ecology and resource use are challenging to discern in migratory marine species, including sharks. However, effective management and conservation strategies depend on understanding these life history details. Here we investigate whether dental enameloid zinc isotope (66Znen) values can be used to infer intrapopulation differences in foraging ecology by comparing 66Znen with same-tooth collagen carbon and nitrogen (13Ccoll, 15Ncoll) values from critically endangered sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus) from Delaware Bay (USA). We document ontogeny and sex-related isotopic differences indicating distinct diet and habitat use at the time of tooth formation. Adult females have the most distinct isotopic niche, likely feeding on higher trophic level prey in a distinct habitat. This multi-proxy approach characterises an animal's isotopic niche in greater detail than traditional isotope analysis alone and shows that 66Znen analysis can highlight intrapopulation dietary variability thereby informing conservation management and, due to good 66Znen fossil tooth preservation, palaeoecological reconstructions.Dental/Oral and Craniofacial DiseaseLife on IsotopesCarbonEcologyNitrogenSharksapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3nz013bsarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5b6414tz2023-08-21T16:08:52Zqt5b6414tzCoordination of Self- and Parental-Regulation Surrounding Type I Diabetes Management in Late AdolescenceButner, Jonathan EBerg, Cynthia AMunion, AKTurner, Sara LHughes-Lansing, 1 diabetes management involves self- and social-regulation, with past research examining components through individual differences unable to capture daily processes.PurposeDynamical systems modeling was used to examine the coordinative structure of self- and social-regulation (operationalized as parental-regulation) related to daily diabetes management during late adolescence.MethodsTwo hundred and thirty-six late adolescents with type 1 diabetes (M age = 17.77 years, SD = .39) completed a 14-day diary reporting aspects of self- (e.g., adherence behaviors, cognitive self-regulation failures, and positive and negative affect) and parental-regulation (disclosure to parents, knowledge parents have, and help parents provide).ResultsSelf-regulation functioned as one coordinative structure that was separate from parental-regulation, where mothers and fathers were coordinated separately from each other. Mothers' perceived helpfulness served as a driver of returning adolescents back to homeostasis.ConclusionsThe results illustrate a dynamic process whereby numerous facets of self- and social-regulation are coordinated in order to return diabetes management to a stable state.Behavioral and Social SciencesPublic Healthapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5b6414tzarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt02m4m98n2023-08-21T15:33:27Zqt02m4m98nIdentity of the reversible hole theory calculations are combined with time-resolved photoluminescence experiments to identify the species responsible for the reversible trapping of holes following photoexcitation of InP/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum dots (QDs) having excess indium in the shell [P. Cavanaugh et al., J. Chem. Phys. 155, 244705 (2021)]. Several possible assignments are considered, and a substitutional indium adjacent to a zinc vacancy, In3+/VZn 2-, is found to be the most likely. This assignment is consistent with the observation that trapping occurs only when the QD has excess indium and is supported by experiments showing that the addition of zinc oleate or acetate decreases the extent of trapping, presumably by filling some of the vacancy traps. We also show that the addition of alkyl carboxylic acids causes increased trapping, presumably by the creation of additional zinc vacancies. The calculations show that either a single In2+ ion or an In2+-In3+ dimer is much too easily oxidized to form the reversible traps observed experimentally, while In3+ is far too difficult to oxidize. Additional experimental data on InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in the absence of chloride demonstrates that the reversible traps are not associated with Cl-. However, a zinc vacancy adjacent to a substitutional indium is calculated to have its highest occupied orbitals about 1 eV above the top of the valence band of bulk ZnSe, in the appropriate energy range to act as reversible traps for quantum confined holes in the InP valence band. The associated orbitals are predominantly composed of p orbitals on the Se atoms adjacent to the Zn vacancy.Physical SciencesEngineeringChemical SoheilGopinath, ArvindGoyal, Sachin2021-01-01Initially straight slender elastic filaments or rods with constrained ends buckle and form stable two-dimensional shapes when prestressed by bringing the ends together. Beyond a critical value of this prestress, rods can also deform off plane and form twisted three-dimensional equilibrium shapes. Here, we analyze the three-dimensional instabilities and dynamics of such deformed filaments subject to nonconservative active follower forces and fluid drag. We find that softly constrained filaments that are clamped at one end and pinned at the other exhibit stable two-dimensional planar flapping oscillations when active forces are directed toward the clamped end. Reversing the directionality of the forces quenches the instability. For strongly constrained filaments with both ends clamped, computations reveal an instability arising from the twist-bend-activity coupling. Planar oscillations are destabilized by off-planar perturbations resulting in twisted three-dimensional swirling patterns interspersed with periodic flipping or reversal of the swirling direction. These striking swirl-flip transitions are characterized by two distinct timescales: the time period for a swirl (rotation) and the time between flipping events. We interpret these reversals as relaxation oscillation events driven by accumulation of torsional energy. Each cycle is initiated by a fast jump in torsional deformation with a subsequent slow decrease in net torsion until the next cycle. Our work reveals the rich tapestry of spatiotemporal patterns when weakly inertial strongly damped rods are deformed by nonconservative active forces. Taken together, our results suggest avenues by which prestress, elasticity, and activity may be used to design synthetic macroscale pumps or mixers.nlin.PScond-mat.softMathematical SciencesPhysical SciencesEngineeringFluids & Plasmasapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/84t7v2cparticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8j7987cx2023-08-21T14:38:11Zqt8j7987cxSmall, smaller, smallest: the origins and evolution of ancient dual symbioses in a Phloem-feeding insect.Moran, NancyBennett, Gordon2013-01-01Many insects rely on bacterial symbionts with tiny genomes specialized for provisioning nutrients lacking in host diets. Xylem sap and phloem sap are both deficient as insect diets, but differ dramatically in nutrient content, potentially genome evolution. For sap-feeding insects, sequenced symbiont genomes for phloem-feeding examples from Sternorrhyncha and xylem-feeding results Nasuia-ALF has the smallest bacterial genome yet sequenced (112 kb), and that the Sulcia-ALF genome (190 kb) is smaller than that of Sulcia in other insect lineages. Together, these symbionts retain the capability to synthesize the 10 essential amino acids, as observed for several symbiont pairs from xylem-feeding Auchenorrhyncha. Nasuia retains genes enabling synthesis of two amino acids, DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Both symbionts have lost genes underlying ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, possibly as a consequence of the enriched sugar content of phloem. Shared genomic features, including reassignment of the UGA codon from Stop to tryptophan, and phylogenetic results suggest that Nasuia-ALF is most closely related to Zinderia, the betaproteobacterial symbiont of spittlebugs. Thus, Nasuia/Zinderia and Sulcia likely represent ancient associates that have co-resided in hosts since the divergence of leafhoppers and spittlebugs >200 Ma, and possibly since for the manipulation and interrogation of biomolecules between metallic probes immersed in micro/nanofluidic channels. The behavior of ions in response to applied fields is a major issue in the use of these techniques in sensing applications. Here, we experimentally and theoretically elucidate the behavior of background currents in these systems. These large currents have a slowly decaying transient response, as well as noise that increases with ionic concentration. Using mechanically controllable break junctions (MCBJ), we study the ionic response in nanogaps with widths ranging from a few nanometers to millimeters. Moreover, we obtain an expression for the ionic current by solving time-dependent Nernst-Planck and Poisson equations. This expression shows that after turning on an applied voltage, ions rapidly respond to the strong fields near the electrode surface, screening the field in the process. Ions subsequently translocate in the weak electric field and slowly relax within the diffusion layer. Our theoretical results help to explain the short- and long-time behavior of the ionic response found in experiments, as well as the various length scales involved.BiotechnologyChemical SciencesEngineeringTechnologyPhysical Chemistryapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/95k8341barticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3g35f0z52023-08-21T13:29:40Zqt3g35f0z5Crossover behavior of frames chemical reaction rates in solution as reactants overcoming a barrier in the presence of friction and noise. For weak coupling to the solution, the reaction rate is limited by the rate at which the solution can restore equilibrium after a subset of reactants have surmounted the barrier to become products. For strong coupling, there are always sufficiently energetic reactants. However, the solution returns many of the intermediate states back to the reactants before the product fully forms. Here, we demonstrate that the thermal conductance displays an analogous physical response to the friction and noise that drive the heat current through a material or structure. A crossover behavior emerges where the thermal reservoirs dominate the conductance at the extremes and only in the intermediate region are the intrinsic properties of the lattice manifest. Not only does this shed new light on Kramers' classic turnover problem, this result is significant for the design of devices for thermal management and other applications, as well as the proper simulation of transport at the nanoscale.cond-mat.stat-mechcond-mat.mes-hallapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3g35f0z5articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt91k1h2202023-08-21T12:59:45Zqt91k1h220Petro-riskscapes and environmental distress in West Texas: Community perceptions of environmental degradation, threats, and lossElser, HollyGoldman-Mellor, SidraMorello-Frosch, RachelDeziel, Nicole CRanjbar, KelseyCasey, Joan A2020-12-01Unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) expanded rapidly in the United States between 2004-2019 with resultant industrial change to landscapes and new environmental exposures. By 2019, West Texas' Permian Basin accounted for 35% of domestic oil production. We conducted an online survey of 566 Texans in 2019 to examine the implications of UOGD using three measures from the Environmental Distress Scale (EDS): perceived threat of environmental issues, felt impact of environmental change, and loss of solace when valued environments are transformed (\"solastalgia\"). We found increased levels of environmental distress among respondents living in counties in the Permian Basin who reported a 2.75% increase in perceived threat of environmental issues (95% CI = -1.14, 6.65) and a 4.21% increase in solastalgia (95% CI = 0.03, 8.40).

Our results indicate increased environmental distress in response to UOGD-related environmental degradation among Texans and highlight the importance of considering susceptible sub-groups.PreventionEarthquakesHydraulic fracturingMental healthNatural ShearKhajeh, ArashHe, XinYeon, JejoonKim, Seong HMartini, Ashlie2018-05-29Shear-driven chemical reaction mechanisms are poorly understood because the relevant reactions are often hidden between two solid surfaces moving in relative motion. Here, this phenomenon is explored by characterizing shear-induced polymerization reactions that occur during vapor phase lubrication -pinene between sliding hydroxylated and dehydroxylated silica surfaces, complemented by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest that oxidative chemisorption of the -pinene molecules at reactive surface sites, which transfers oxygen atoms from the surface to the adsorbate molecule, is the critical activation step. Such activation takes place more readily on the dehydroxylated surface. During this activation, the most strained part of the -pinene molecules undergoes a partial distortion from its equilibrium geometry, which appears to be related to the critical activation volume for mechanical activation. Once -pinene molecules are activated, association reactions occur between the newly attached oxygen and one of the carbon atoms in another molecule, forming ether bonds. These findings have general implications for mechanochemistry because they reveal that shear-driven reactions may occur through reaction pathways very different from their thermally induced counterparts and specifically the critical role of molecular distortion in such reactions.Chemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of has been a popular functional imaging modality in preclinical imaging. Near infrared probes used in fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) are designed to localize in the targeted tissues, hence sparse solution to the FMT image reconstruction problem is preferred. Nonconvex regularization methods are reported to enhance sparsity in the fields of statistical learning, compressed sensing etc. We investigated such regularization methods in FMT for small animal imaging with numerical simulations and phantom experiments. We adopted a majorization-minimization algorithm for the iterative reconstruction process and compared the reconstructed images using our proposed nonconvex regularizations with those using the well known L(1) regularization. We found that the proposed nonconvex methods outperform L(1) regularization in accurately recovering to recognize that others may hold and act on false beliefs has been proposed to reflect an evolved, species-typical adaptation for social reasoning in humans; however, controversy surrounds the developmental timing and universality of this trait. Cross-cultural studies using elicited-response tasks indicate that the age at which children begin to understand false beliefs ranges from 4 to 7 years across societies, whereas studies using spontaneous-response tasks with Western children indicate that false-belief understanding emerges much earlier, consistent with the hypothesis that false-belief understanding is a psychological adaptation that is universally present in early childhood. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used three spontaneous-response tasks that have revealed early false-belief understanding in the West to test young children in three traditional, non-Western societies: Salar (China), Shuar/Colono (Ecuador) and Yasawan (Fiji). Results were comparable with those from the West, supporting the hypothesis that false-belief understanding reflects an adaptation that is universally present early Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2z65p5hqarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5f06p8t12023-08-21T11:45:04Zqt5f06p8t1Reply to Rubio-Fern\u00e1ndez et al.: Different traditional false-belief tasks impose processing demands for transcriptional in a variety of biological processes such as spermatogenesis, metabolism, stem cell activity, and tumor progression.

These particles will ultimately enter the oceanic environment and interact with dissolved organic carbon. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of their behavior, transport, and fate in marine systems is still much needed. This study, using carbon black (CB, 14 nm) nanoparticles as a model, aimed to investigate the impact of CNPs on marine microgel formation, a critical shunt between DOC and particulate organic carbon that potentially represents a ~70-Gt organic carbon flux. We found that CB can enhance the stability of DOC polymers and reduce microgel equilibrium sizes in concentration as low as 1 gL(-1) CB, possibly due to negative surface charges on CB that decrease cross-linking bridges through Ca(2+) bonds. The reduction of marine microgel formation induced by CB could lead to a decrease in the downward transportation of microbial substrates and nutrients, and therefore, could have a significant impact on the carbon cycle and the marine ecosystem.Life Below generates functional viral small RNAs and regulates viral IRES RNAs (vsRNAs) have been studied in plants and insects. However, the generation and function of small RNAs from cytoplasmic RNA viruses in mammalian cells remain unexplored. This study describes four vsRNAs that were detected in enterovirus 71-infected cells using next-generation sequencing and northern blots. Viral infection produced substantial levels (>10(5) copy numbers per cell) of vsRNA1, one of the four vsRNAs. We also demonstrated that Dicer is involved in vsRNA1 generation in infected cells. vsRNA1 overexpression inhibited viral translation and internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) activity in infected cells. Conversely, blocking vsRNA1 enhanced viral yield and viral protein synthesis. We also present evidence that vsRNA1 targets stem-loop II of the viral 5' untranslated region and inhibits the activity of the IRES through this sequence-specific targeting. Our study demonstrates the ability of a cytoplasmic RNA virus to generate functional vsRNA in mammalian cells. In addition, we also demonstrate a potential novel mechanism for a positive-stranded RNA virus to regulate viral translation: generating a vsRNA that targets the IRES.BiotechnologyInfectious DiseasesGenetics2.2 Factors relating to and Thermodynamic Viewpoints on Claims of a Spontaneous H2O2 Formation at the Air-Water InterfaceNguyen, DuyLyu, PinNguyen, Son C2023-03-23Recent claims of the spontaneous H2O2 formation at the air-water interface of water microdroplets have sparked debates on its feasibility.

However, advancement in motor neuron replacement therapy has been significantly constrained by the difficulties in large-scale production at a cost-effective manner. Current methods to derive motor neuron heavily rely on biochemical stimulation, chemical biological screening, and complex physical cues. These existing methods are seriously challenged by extensive time requirements and poor yields. An innovative approach that overcomes prior hurdles and enhances the rate of successful motor neuron transplantation in patients is of critical demand. Iron, a trace element, is indispensable for the normal development and function of the central nervous system. Whether ferric ions promote neuronal differentiation and subsequently promote motor neuron lineage has never been considered. Here, we demonstrate that elevated iron concentration can drastically accelerate the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward motor neuron lineage potentially via a transferrin mediated pathway. HB9 expression in 500 nM iron-treated hESCs is approximately twofold higher than the control. Moreover, iron treatment generated more matured and functional motor neuron-like cells that are 1.5 times more sensitive to depolarization when compared to the control. Our methodology renders an expedited approach to harvest motor neuron-like cells for disease, traumatic injury regeneration, and drug screening.NeurosciencesStem Cell Research Cell BiologyBiomedical Engineeringapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2k3518starticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt86w4g5cf2023-08-21T10:11:37Zqt86w4g5cfA Genetic Screen To Assess Dopamine Receptor (DopR1) Dependent Sleep Regulation in DrosophilaJiang, YiqinPitmon, EliseBerry, JackWolf, Fred WMcKenzie, ZachLebestky, Tim J2016-12-01Sleep is an essential behavioral state of rest that is regulated by homeostatic drives to ensure a balance of sleep and activity, as well as independent arousal mechanisms in the central brain. Dopamine has been identified as a critical regulator of both sleep behavior and arousal. Here, we present results of a genetic screen that selectively restored the Dopamine Receptor (DopR/DopR1/dumb) to specific neuroanatomical regions of the adult Drosophila brain to assess requirements for DopR in sleep behavior. We have identified subsets of the mushroom body that utilizes DopR in daytime sleep regulation. These data are supported by multiple examples of spatially restricted genetic rescue data in discrete circuits of the mushroom body, as well as immunohistochemistry that corroborates the localization of DopR protein within mushroom body circuits. Independent loss of function data using an inducible RNAi construct in the same specific circuits also supports a requirement for DopR in daytime sleep. Additional circuit activation of discrete DopR+ mushroom body neurons also suggests roles for these subpopulations in sleep behavior. These conclusions support a new separable function for DopR in daytime sleep regulation within the mushroom body. This daytime regulation is independent of the known role of DopR in nighttime sleep, which is regulated within the Fan-Shaped Body (FSB). This study provides new neuroanatomical loci for exploration of dopaminergic sleep functions in Drosophila, and expands our understanding of sleep regulation during the day vs. night.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceBehavioral and Social ScienceNeurosciencesSleep Research1.1 of polarized light.Sandoval, ChristopherKim, Arnold D2017-02-01We introduce a new model for multiple scattering of polarized light by statistically isotropic and mirror-symmetric particles, which we call the generalized Kubelka-Munk (gKM) approximation. It is obtained through a linear transformation of the system of equations resulting from applying the double spherical harmonics approximation of order one to the vector radiative transfer equation (vRTE). The result is a 32\u00d732 system of differential equations that is much simpler than the vRTE. We compare numerical solutions of the vRTE with the gKM approximation for the problem in which a plane wave is normally incident on a plane-parallel slab composed of a uniform absorbing and scattering medium. These comparisons show that the gKM approximation accurately captures the key features of the polarization state of multiply scattered light. In particular, the gKM approximation accurately captures the complicated polarization characteristics of light backscattered by an optically thick medium composed of a monodisperse distribution of dielectric spheres over a broad range of sphere sizes.Optical PhysicsElectrical and Electronic EngineeringOpthalmology and OptometryOpticsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5f42q06qarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt76v109xk2023-08-21T09:52:32Zqt76v109xkImportance of Content and Format of Oral Health Instruction to Low-income Mexican Immigrant Parents: A Qualitative J2018-01-01PurposeThis study's purpose was to explore how content and format of children's oral health instruction in the dental clinic is perceived by parents and might affect parents' knowledge and behaviors.MethodsThirty low-income Mexican immigrant parents of children age five years and under were recruited from dental clinics in 2015 to 2016. In-person qualitative interviews in Spanish about their children's and their own experiences of dental care and home oral hygiene practices were conducted, digitally recorded, translated, and transcribed. Data analysis involved iteratively reading text data and developing and refining codes to find common themes.ResultsTwenty-five of 30 parents recalled receiving oral hygiene instruction, and 18 recalled receiving nutrition instruction and were included in analyses. The format and effectiveness of instruction varied. More engaging educational approaches were recalled and described in more detail than less engaging educational approaches. As a result of oral hygiene and nutritional instruction, most parents reported changing their oral hygiene home behaviors for their children; half aimed to reduce purchasing sugary foods and drinks.ConclusionsMost parents recalled receiving oral hygiene and nutrition instruction as part of their child's dental visit and reported incorporating the instruction and recommendations they received into their children's home routine.Pediatric Research InitiativeNutritionDental/Oral and Craniofacial DiseasePediatricBehavioral and Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical Research7.1 Individual care needs3.1 Primary prevention interventions to modify behaviours or promote wellbeingPrevention of disease and conditionsand promotion of well-beingManagement of diseases and conditionsOral of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/76v109xkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3w42149t2023-08-21T09:48:19Zqt3w42149tAttention Problems as a Predictor of Type 1 Diabetes Adherence and Metabolic Control Across Adolescence.Turner, Sara LBerg, Cynthia AButner, Jonathan EWiebe, Deborah J2018-01-01ObjectiveManagement of type 1 diabetes is a difficult self-regulatory process requiring continued attention to complex regimen tasks. The purpose of this study was to examine whether youths' attention problems were associated with poorer adherence and HbA1c across time, and whether higher parental involvement reduced these associations.MethodsAdolescents with type 1 diabetes (N = 199, M age = 12.43 years, SD = 1.50) and their mothers rated youths' attention problems and adherence at three time points. Adolescents rated parents' diabetes-specific monitoring and behavioral involvement. HbA1c was collected from medical records.ResultsAdolescents' (but not mothers') greater reports of attention problems compared with their average related to lower adherence across time. Adolescents' (but not mothers') reports of greater attention problems compared with their average related to lower adherence across time.ConclusionsYouth attention problems may help us understand poor adherence, and interventions to promote parental involvement may buffer this risk.DiabetesPediatricBehavioral and Social SciencePrevention7.1 Individual care needsManagement of acid precatalyst, -(,-dimethylbenzyl)styrenes are shown to cyclize efficiently to afford a variety of new indanes that possess a benzylic quaternary center.

Observations indicate a fivefold increase in summer burned area (BA) in forests in northern and central California during 1996 to 2021 relative to 1971 to 1995. While the higher temperature and increased dryness have been suggested to be the leading causes of increased BA, the extent to which BA changes are due to natural variability or anthropogenic climate change remains unresolved. Here, we develop a climate-driven model of summer BA evolution in California and combine it with natural-only and historical climate simulations to assess the importance of anthropogenic climate change on increased BA. Our results indicate that nearly all the observed increase in BA is due to anthropogenic climate change as historical model simulations accounting for anthropogenic forcing yield 172% (range 84 to 310%) more area burned than simulations with natural forcing only. We detect the signal of combined historical forcing on the observed BA emerging in 2001 with no detectable influence of the natural forcing alone. In addition, even when considering fuel limitations from fire-fuel feedbacks, a 3 to 52% increase in BA relative to the last decades is expected in the next decades (2031 to 2050), highlighting the need for proactive adaptations.Climate ActionCaliforniaanthropogenic climate changeforest firesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/62d0511varticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0wf9k3hp2023-08-21T08:56:58Zqt0wf9k3hpMeasurement of electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z boson in cross section for the production of two jets in association with a Z boson, in proton-proton collisions at [Formula: see text], is measured using data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7[Formula: see text].

Because individuals with periodontitis are at greater risk for atherosclerosis as well as respiratory infections, we in-vestigated the role of C. pneumoniae in inflammation and periodontal dis-ease. We found that C. pneumoniae was more frequently found in subgingival dental plaque obtained from periodontally diseased sites of the mouth versus healthy sites. The known periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were also found in the plaque. In addition, C. pneumoniae could efficiently invade human gingival epithelial cells (GECs) in vitro, causing translocation of NF-B to the nucleus along with increased secretion of mature IL-1 cytokine. Supernatants collected from C. pneumoniae-infected GECs showed increased activation of caspase-1 protein, which was significantly reduced when nlrp3 gene expression was silenced using shRNA lentiviral vectors. Our results demonstrate that C. pneumoniae was found in higher levels in periodontitis patients compared to control pa-tients. Additionally, C. pneumoniae could infect GECs, leading to inflammation caused by activation of NF-B and the NLRP3 inflammasome. We propose that the presence of C. pneumoniae in subgingival dental plaque may contribute to periodontal disease and could be used as a potential risk indicator of perio-dontal disease.LungPneumoniaInfectious DiseasesDental/Oral and Inducible gene expression systems are valuable tools for studying biological processes. We previously developed an optogenetic gene expression system called TAEL that is optimized for use in zebrafish. When illuminated with blue light, TAEL transcription factors dimerize and activate gene expression downstream of the TAEL-responsive C120 promoter. By using light as the inducing agent, the TAEL/C120 system overcomes limitations of traditional inducible expression systems by enabling fine spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. Here, we describe ongoing efforts to improve the TAEL/C120 system. We made modifications to both the TAEL transcriptional activator and the C120 regulatory element, collectively referred to as TAEL 2.0. We demonstrate that TAEL 2.0 consistently induces higher levels of reporter gene expression and at a faster rate, but with comparable background and toxicity as the original TAEL system. With these improvements, we were able to create functional stable transgenic lines to express the TAEL 2.0 transcription factor either ubiquitously or with a tissue-specific promoter. We demonstrate that the ubiquitous line in particular can be used to induce expression at late embryonic and larval stages, addressing a major deficiency of the original TAEL system. This improved optogenetic expression system will be a broadly useful resource for the zebrafish community.GeneticsBiotechnologyapplication/pdfCC-BY-NC-NDeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0pt811dbpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1rf453j22023-08-21T04:20:39Zqt1rf453j2Intrusive Parenting in Chinese American Immigrant Families: Relations With and Children's AdjustmentKho, CarmenMain, AlexandraChung, Qing2019-01-01This observed and parent- and child-reported intrusive parenting, parent and child cultural orientations, and children's adjustment in a socioeconomically diverse sample of Chinese American immigrant families. Participants were 239 Chinese American school-aged children (M age = 9.19 years, range = 7.49 to 10.96 years) and their parents from first- and second-generation immigrant families. Parents and children reported on parents' intrusive parenting, their own cultural orientations, and parents and teachers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Observed intrusive parenting behaviors were coded from videotaped parent-child conflict discussions. Findings from path analysis indicated that there was a unique positive association between child Chinese orientation and child-reported intrusive parenting, a unique negative association between parents' American orientation and child reported intrusive parenting, and a unique positive association between child American orientation and observed intrusive parenting. Intrusive parenting was negatively associated with child adjustment, but associations varied depending on measurement. Findings suggest that different measures of intrusive parenting are differentially associated with children's adjustment in Chinese American immigrant families.Behavioral and Social ScienceBasic Behavioral and Social SciencePediatricintrusive adjustmentcultural orientationsPolicy and AdministrationPsychologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1rf453j2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt36p1c31w2023-08-21T04:19:49Zqt36p1c31wParent-Child Conflict Profiles in Chinese American Immigrant Families: Links to conflict is a salient family process in Asian immigrant families and often a stressful experience for Asian American youth due to value discrepancies between Asian and Western cultures. The present study examined ratings of parent-child conflict across conflict topics from parents' and children's perspectives in a sample of Chinese American immigrant families with school-age children (N = 239; age = 7.5-11 years). Latent profile analyses identified three parent-rated conflict profiles and four child-rated conflict profiles. Parent and child conflict profiles were unrelated to each other and differentially related to family sociocultural factors and children's psychological adjustment. Parents' moderate conflict profile scored highest on parent-rated child behavior problems and had the highest household density and lower parent Chinese orientation. Children's moderate-specific and high conflict profiles scored higher on child-reported behavior problems than the low conflict profile. These results highlight the need to assess family conflict from both parents' and children's perspectives and target parent-child conflict communication as a pathway to prevent or reduce behavioral problems in Chinese American children of immigrant families.Behavioral and Social SciencePediatricAdolescentAsian understudied, Gaps opportunities for advancing justice in disadvantaged communitiesFernandez-Bou, Angel SantiagoOrtiz-Partida, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6tw6t7s9publicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3bk6h5vb2023-08-21T04:12:23Zqt3bk6h5vbCommunity Perspectives and Environmental in qualitygovernment frontline communities of California's Central Valley experience environmental and socioeconomic injustice, water insecurity, extremely poor air quality, and lack of fundamental infrastructure (sewage, green areas, health services), which makes them less resilient. Many communities depend financially on agriculture, while water scarcity and associated policy may trigger farmland retirement further hindering socioeconomic opportunities. Here we propose a multi-benefit framework to repurpose cropland in buffers inside and around (400-m and 1600-m buffers) 154 rural disadvantaged communities of the Central Valley to promote socioeconomic opportunities, environmental benefits, and business diversification. We estimate the potential for (1) reductions in water and pesticide use, nitrogen leaching, and nitrogen gas emissions, (2) managed aquifer recharge, and (3) economic and employment impacts associated with clean industries and solar energy. Retiring cropland within 1600-m buffers can result in reductions in water use of 2.18 km3/year, nitrate leaching into local aquifers of 105,500 t/year, greenhouse emissions of 2,232,000 t CO2-equivalent/year, and 5388 t pesticides/year, with accompanying losses in agricultural revenue of US$4213 million/year and employment of 25,682 positions. Buffer repurposing investments of US$27 million/year per community for ten years show potential to generate US$101 million/year per community (total US$15,578 million/year) for 30 years and 407 new jobs/year (total 62,697 jobs/year) paying 67 % more than prior farmworker jobs. In the San Joaquin Valley (southern Central Valley), where groundwater overdraft averages 2.3 km3/year, potential water use reduction is 1.8 km3/year. We have identified 99 communities with surficial soils adequate for aquifer recharge and canals/rivers within 1600 m. This demonstrates the potential of managed aquifer recharge in buffered zones to substantially reduce overdraft. The buffers framework shows that well-planned land repurposing near disadvantaged communities can create multiple benefits for farmers and industry stakeholders, while improving quality of life in disadvantaged communities and producing positive externalities for society.Rural HealthClimate hybrid imaging modality, which is able to improve the spatial resolution of optical imaging to hundreds of micrometers for deep targets by using superfine X-ray pencil beams. However, due to the low X-ray photon utilization efficiency in a single pinhole collimator based XLCT, it takes a long time to acquire measurement data. Herein, we propose a multiple pinhole collimator based XLCT, in which multiple X-ray beams are generated to scan a sample at multiple positions simultaneously. Compared with the single pinhole based XLCT, the multiple X-ray beam scanning method requires much less measurement time. Numerical simulations and phantom experiments have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the multiple X-ray beam scanning method. In one numerical simulation, we used four X-ray beams to scan a cylindrical object with 6 deeply embedded targets. With measurements from 6 angular projections, all 6 targets have been reconstructed successfully. In the phantom experiment, we generated two X-ray pencil beams with a collimator manufactured in-house. Two capillary targets with 0.6 mm edge-to-edge distance embedded in a cylindrical phantom have been reconstructed successfully. With the two beam scanning, we reduced the data acquisition time by 50%. From the reconstructed XLCT images, we found that the Dice similarity of targets is 85.11% and the distance error between two targets is less than 3%. We have measured the radiation dose during XLCT scan and found that the radiation dose, 1.475 mSv, is in the range of a typical CT scan. We have measured the changes of the collimated X-ray beam size and intensity at different distances from the collimator. We have also studied the effects of beam size and intensity in the reconstruction of XLCT.Biomedical ImagingBioengineering(170.3890) Medical optics instrumentation(170.6960) using proton-proton collision data produced by the CERN LHC at s=13Te is presented. Events are selected with two leptons (an electron and a muon, two electrons, or two muons) that both have transverse impact parameter values between 0.01 and 10 cm and are not required to form a common vertex. Data used for the analysis were collected with the CMS detector in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 118 (113) fb-1 in the ee channel ( e and channels). The search is designed to be sensitive to a wide range of models with displaced e , ee , and final states. The results constrain several well-motivated models involving new long-lived particles that decay to displaced leptons. For some areas of the available phase space, these are the most stringent constraints to date.CMS CollaborationAtomicMolecularNuclearParticle and Plasma PhysicsQuantum PhysicsNuclear & Particles Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5099m4cwarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2405k8d52023-08-21T02:33:52Zqt2405k8d5Valley-dependent exciton fine Autler-Townes phase of Bloch states can have profound effects on electron dynamics1-3 and lead to novel transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall effect and the valley Hall effect4-6. Recently, it was predicted that the Berry phase effect can also modify the exciton states in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, and lift the energy degeneracy of exciton states with opposite angular momentum through an effective valley-orbital coupling1,7-11. Here, we report the observation and control of the Berry phase-induced splitting of the 2p exciton states in (MoSe2) optical Stark spectroscopy. We observe the time-reversal-symmetric analogue of the orbital Zeeman effect resulting from the valley-dependent Berry phase, which leads to energy difference of +14 (-14) meV between the 2p+ and 2p- exciton states in the K (K') valley, consistent with the ordering from our ab initio GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation results. In addition, we show that the light-matter coupling between intraexciton states is remarkably strong, leading to a prominent valley-dependent Autler-Townes doublet under resonant driving. Our study opens up pathways to coherently manipulate the quantum states and excitonic excitation with infrared radiation in two-dimensional semiconductors.cond-mat.mes-hallNanoscience & Nanotechnologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2405k8d5articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9w01g0bp2023-08-21T02:11:07Zqt9w01g0bpTwentyfirst century bioarchaeology: article presents outcomes from a Workshop entitled \"Bioarchaeology: Taking Stock and Moving Forward,\" which was held at Arizona State University (ASU) on March 6-8, 2020. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the School of Human Evolution and Social Change (ASU), and the Center for Bioarchaeological Research (CBR, ASU), the Workshop's overall goal was to explore reasons why research proposals submitted by bioarchaeologists, both graduate students and established scholars, fared disproportionately poorly within recent NSF Anthropology Program competitions and to offer advice for increasing success. Therefore, this Workshop comprised 43 international scholars and four advanced graduate students with a history of successful grant acquisition, primarily from the United States. Ultimately, we focused on two related aims: (1) best practices for improving research designs and training and (2) evaluating topics of contemporary significance that reverberate through history and beyond as promising trajectories for bioarchaeological research. Among the former were contextual grounding, research question/hypothesis generation, statistical procedures appropriate for small samples and mixed qualitative/quantitative data, the salience of Bayesian methods, and training program content. Topical foci included ethics, social inequality, identity (including intersectionality), climate change, migration, violence, epidemic disease, adaptability/plasticity, the osteological paradox, and the developmental origins of health and disease. Given the profound changes required globally to address decolonization in the 21st century, this concern also entered many formal and informal discussions.HumansUnited StatesArchaeologyBayes TheoremSchoolsUniversitiesArizonaclimate in pp collisions pair production cross section in proton-proton collisions at [Formula: see text] TeV is presented.

The limits are derived from the results presented in a recent search for long-lived charged particles in proton-proton collisions, based on data collected by the CMS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. In the pMSSM parameter sub-space considered, 95.9 % of the points predicting charginos with a lifetime of at least 10 ns are excluded. These constraints on the pMSSM are the first obtained at the LHC. Charginos with a lifetime greater than 100 ns and masses up to about 800 GeV in the AMSB model are also excluded.

Purcelliella pentastirinorum\" is a more recent endosymbiotic acquisition. Hawaiian cixiid planthoppers occupy diverse habitats including lava tube caves and shrubby surface landscapes, which offer different nutritional resources and environmental constraints. Genomic studies have focused on understanding the nutritional provisioning roles of cixiid endosymbionts more broadly, yet it is still unclear how selection pressures on endosymbiont genes might differ between cixiid host species inhabiting such diverse landscapes, or how variation in selection might impact symbiont evolution. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of Sulcia, Vidania, and Purcelliella isolated from both surface and cave-adapted planthopper hosts from the genus Oliarus. We found that nutritional biosynthesis genes were conserved in Sulcia and Vidania genomes in inter- and intra-host species comparisons. In contrast, Purcelliella genomes retain different essential nutritional biosynthesis genes between surface- and cave-adapted planthopper species. Finally, we see the variation in selection pressures on symbiont genes both within and between host species, suggesting that strong coevolution between host and endosymbiont is associated with different patterns of molecular evolution on a fine scale that may be associated with the host Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cd825cjarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt49s1d3jr2023-08-21T00:56:37Zqt49s1d3jrA complex interplay of shape ancient co-occurring symbiont genomesVasquez, Yumary MBennett, Gordon M2022-08-01Many insects depend on ancient associations with intracellular bacteria for essential nutrition. The genomes of these bacteria are often highly reduced. Although drift is a major driver of symbiont evolution, other evolutionary forces continue to influence them. To understand how ongoing molecular evolution and gene loss shape symbiont genomes, we sequenced two of the most ancient symbionts known, Sulcia and Nasuia, from 20 Hawaiian Nesophrosyne leafhoppers. We leveraged the parallel divergence of Nesophrosyne lineages throughout Hawaii as a natural experimental framework. Sulcia and Nasuia experience ongoing-but divergent-gene loss, often in a convergent fashion. Although some genes are under relaxed selection, purifying and positive selection are also important drivers of genome evolution, particularly in maintaining certain nutritional and cellular functions. Our results further demonstrate that symbionts experience dramatically different evolutionary environments, as evidenced by the finding that Sulcia and Nasuia have one of the slowest and fastest rates of molecular evolution known.GeneticsHuman GenomeUnderpinning research1.1 Normal biological development and decorrelation of azimuthal angles between the two jets with the largest transverse momenta is presented for seven regions of leading jet transverse momentum up to 2.2[Formula: see text]. The analysis is based on the proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8[Formula: see text] corresponding to an of 19.7[Formula: see text]. The dijet azimuthal decorrelation is caused by the radiation of additional jets and probes the dynamics of multijet production. The results are compared to fixed-order predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and to simulations using Monte Carlo event generators that include parton showers, hadronization, and multiparton interactions. Event generators with only two outgoing high transverse momentum partons fail to describe the measurement, even when supplemented with next-to-leading-order QCD corrections and parton showers. Much better agreement is achieved when at least three outgoing partons are complemented through either next-to-leading-order predictions or parton showers. This observation emphasizes the need to improve predictions for multijet production.hep-exAtomicMolecularNuclearParticle and Plasma PhysicsQuantum PhysicsNuclear & Particles Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4bv9r1xharticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5xm2c06v2023-08-20T22:28:43Zqt5xm2c06vMeasurement of inclusive jet production and nuclear center-of-mass energy of [Formula: see text] is studied with the CMS detector at the LHC.

The observation of coherent dynamics between distant mechanical resonators can be a key step toward scalable phonon-based applications. Here we report tunable coherent phonon dynamics with an architecture comprising three graphene mechanical resonators coupled in series, where all resonators can be manipulated by electrical signals on control gates. We demonstrate coherent Rabi oscillations between spatially separated resonators indirectly coupled via an intermediate resonator serving as a phonon cavity. The Rabi frequency fits well with the microwave burst power on the control gate. We also observe Ramsey interference, where the oscillation frequency corresponds to the indirect coupling strength between these resonators.

Under this rapid global change, maximizing conservation success requires a paradigm shift from maintaining ecosystems in idealized past states toward facilitating their adaptive and functional capacities, even as species ebb and flow individually. Developing effective strategies under this new paradigm will require deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics that govern ecosystem persistence and reconciliation of conflicts among approaches to conserving historical versus novel ecosystems. Integrating emerging information from conservation biology, paleobiology, and the Earth sciences is an important step forward on the path to success. Maintaining nature in all its aspects will also entail immediately addressing the overarching threats of growing human population, overconsumption, pollution, and climate change.Life Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1q669296articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4nv8q9s22023-08-20T21:30:43Zqt4nv8q9s2Ontogenetic and Among-Individual Variation in Foraging Strategies of Northeast Pacific White Sharks Based on Stable Isotope AnalysisKim, Sora LTinker, M TimEstes, James AKoch, Paul LHughes, William2012-01-01There is growing evidence for individuality in dietary preferences and foraging behaviors within populations of various species. This is especially important for apex predators, since they can potentially have wide dietary niches and a large impact on trophic dynamics within ecosystems. We evaluate the diet of an apex predator, the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), by measuring the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of vertebral growth bands to create lifetime records for 15 individuals from California. Isotopic variations in white shark diets can reflect within-region differences among prey (most importantly related to trophic level), as well as differences in baseline values among the regions in which sharks forage, and both prey and habitat preferences may shift with age. The magnitude of isotopic variation among sharks in our study (>5 for both elements) is too great to be explained solely by geographic differences, and so must reflect differences in prey choice that may vary with sex, size, age and location. Ontogenetic patterns in (15)N values vary considerably among individuals, and one third of the population fit each of these descriptions: 1) (15)N values increased throughout life, 2) (15)N values increased to a plateau at 5 years of age, and 3) (15)N values remained roughly constant values throughout life. Isotopic data for the population span more than one trophic level, and we offer a qualitative evaluation of diet using shark-specific collagen discrimination factors estimated from a 3+ year captive feeding experiment ((13)C(shark-diet) and (15)N(shark-diet) equal 4.2 and 2.5, respectively). We assess the degree of individuality with a proportional similarity index that distinguishes specialists and generalists. The isotopic variance is partitioned among differences between-individual by calendar year of sub-adulthood (12%). Our data reveal substantial ontogenetic and individual dietary variation within a white shark population.Behavioral and Social ScienceNutritionAgingAnimalsCaliforniaCarbon IsotopesDietEcosystemFeeding Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, dynamics of ecosystem collapse are fundamental to determining how and why biological communities change through time, as well as the potential effects of extinctions on ecosystems. Here, we integrate depictions of mammals from Egyptian antiquity with direct lines of paleontological and archeological evidence to infer local extinctions and community dynamics over a 6,000-y span. The unprecedented temporal resolution of this dataset enables examination of how the tandem effects of human population growth and climate change can disrupt mammalian communities. We show that the extinctions of mammals in Egypt were nonrandom and that destabilizing changes in community composition coincided with abrupt aridification events and the attendant collapses of some complex societies. We also show that the roles of species in a community can change over time and that persistence is predicted by measures of species sensitivity, a function of local dynamic stability. To our knowledge, our study is the first high-resolution analysis of the ecological impacts of environmental change on predator-prey networks over millennial timescales and sheds light on the historical events that have shaped modern requirements for monitoring essential biodiversity variables of coastal ecosystemsMuller-Karger, Frank biodiversity and high productivity of coastal terrestrial and aquatic habitats are the foundation for important benefits to human societies around the world. These globally distributed habitats need frequent and broad systematic assessments, but field surveys only cover a small fraction of these areas. Satellite-based sensors can repeatedly record the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra that contain the absorption, scattering, and fluorescence signatures of functional phytoplankton groups, colored dissolved matter, and particulate matter near the surface ocean, and of biologically structured habitats (floating and emergent vegetation, benthic habitats like coral, seagrass, and algae). These measures can be incorporated into Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), including the distribution, abundance, and traits of groups of species populations, and used to evaluate habitat fragmentation. However, current and planned satellites are not designed to observe the EBVs that change rapidly with extreme tides, salinity, temperatures, storms, pollution, or physical habitat destruction over scales relevant to human activity. Making these observations requires a new generation of satellite sensors able to sample with these combined characteristics: (1) spatial resolution on the order of 30 to 100-m pixels or smaller; (2) spectral resolution on the order of 5 nm in the visible and 10 nm in the short-wave infrared spectrum (or at least two or more bands at 1,030, 1,240, 1,630, 2,125, and/or 2,260 nm) for atmospheric correction and aquatic and vegetation assessments; (3) radiometric quality with signal to noise ratios (SNR) above 800 (relative to signal levels typical of the open ocean), 14-bit digitization, absolute radiometric calibration <1%, high radiometric stability and linearity, and operations designed to minimize sunglint; and (4) temporal resolution of hours to days. We refer to these combined specifications as H4 imaging. Enabling H4 imaging is vital for the conservation and management of global biodiversity and ecosystem services, including food provisioning and water security. An agile satellite in a 3-d repeat low-Earth orbit could sample 30-km swath images of several hundred coastal habitats daily. Nine H4 satellites would provide weekly coverage of global coastal zones. Such satellite constellations are now feasible and are used in various applications.Life Below WaterLife on we present a unique resistive switching (RS) mechanism study of Pt/TiO2/Pt cell, one of the most widely studied RS system, by focusing on the role of interfacial bonding at the active TiO2-Pt interface, as opposed to a physico-chemical change within the RS film. This study was enabled by the use of a non-conventional scanning probe-based setup. The nanoscale cell is formed by bringing a Pt/TiO2-coated atomic force microscope tip into contact with a flat substrate coated with Pt. The study reveals that electrical resistance and interfacial bonding status are highly coupled together. An oxygen-mediated chemical bonding at the active interface between TiO2 and Pt is a necessary condition for a non-polar low-resistance state, and a reset switching process disconnects the chemical bonding. Bipolar switching mode did not involve the chemical bonding. The nature of chemical bonding at the TiO2-metal interface is further studied by density functional theory calculations.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2ms68244articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1fj8r1xd2023-08-20T19:31:43Zqt1fj8r1xdLong-term impact of cover crop and reduced disturbance tillage on soil pore size distribution and soil water storageAraya, Samuel NMitchell, Jeffrey PHopmans, Jan WGhezzehei, Teamrat A2022-01-01We studied the long-term impact of contrasting tillage and cover cropping systems on soil structure and hydraulic properties. Complete water retention and conductivity curves for the top (0-5 cm) and subsurface (20-25 cm) soils were characterized and contrasted. Dynamic water storage and retention were evaluated using numerical simulations in HYDRUS-2D software. Compared with standard-till (ST) and no-cover-crop (NO) systems, soils under no-till (NT) and cover cropping (CC) systems showed improved soil structure in terms of pore size distribution (PSD). Changes in hydraulic conductivity (K) under these systems led to an increased infiltration rate and water retention. However, NT and CC plots had lower water content at field capacity (33 kPa suction) and lower plant-available water (PAW) compared with ST and NO plots. Numerical simulations, however, showed that NT and CC plots have higher water storage (albeit marginal in magnitude) and water availability following irrigation. Because the numerical simulations considered retention and conductivity functions simultaneously and dynamically through time, they allow the capture of hydraulic states that are arguably more relevant to crops. The study concludes that the long-term practices of NT and CC systems were beneficial in terms of changes to the PSD. NT and CC systems also marginally improved soil water conductivity and storage at the plot scale.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1fj8r1xdarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4384d5q82023-08-20T18:05:08Zqt4384d5q8Genomic responses to parallel temperature gradients in the eelgrass Zostera marina in JBay, Rachael A2023-06-01The extent of parallel genomic responses to similar selective pressures depends on a complex array of environmental, demographic, and evolutionary forces. Laboratory experiments with replicated selective pressures yield mixed outcomes under controlled conditions and our understanding of genomic parallelism in the wild is limited to a few well-established systems. Here, we examine genomic signals of selection in the eelgrass Zostera marina across temperature gradients in adjacent embayments. Although we find many genomic regions with signals of selection within each bay there is very little overlap in signals of selection at the SNP level, despite most polymorphisms being shared across bays. We do find overlap at the gene level, potentially suggesting multiple mutational pathways to the same phenotype. Using polygenic models we find that some sets of candidate SNPs are able to predict temperature across both bays, suggesting that small but parallel shifts in allele frequencies may be missed by independent genome scans. Together, these results highlight the continuous rather than binary nature of parallel evolution in polygenic traits and the complexity attributes predict the relative magnitude of ecological and genetic recovery following mass mortalitySchiebelhut, Lauren MGaylord, BrianGrosberg, Richard KJurgens, Laura JDawson, Michael N2022-11-01Theoretically, species' characteristics should allow estimation of dispersal potential and, in turn, explain levels of population genetic differentiation. However, a mismatch between traits and genetic patterns is often reported for marine species, and interpreted as evidence that life-history traits do not influence dispersal. Here, we couple ecological and genomic methods to test the hypothesis that species with attributes favouring greater dispersal potential-e.g., longer pelagic duration, higher fecundity and larger population size-have greater realized dispersal overall. We used a natural experiment created by a large-scale and multispecies mortality event which created a \"clean slate\" on which to study recruitment dynamics, thus simplifying a usually complex problem. We surveyed four species of differing dispersal potential to quantify the abundance and distribution of recruits and to genetically assign these recruits to probable parental sources. Species with higher dispersal potential recolonized a broader extent of the impacted range, did so more quickly and recovered more genetic diversity than species with lower dispersal potential. Moreover, populations of taxa with higher dispersal potential exhibited more immigration (71%-92% of recruits) than taxa with lower dispersal potential (17%-44% of recruits). By linking ecological with genomic perspectives, we demonstrate that a suite of interacting life-history and demographic attributes do influence species' realized dispersal and genetic neighbourhoods. To better understand species' resilience and recovery in this time of global change, integrative eco-evolutionary approaches are needed to more rigorously evaluate the effect of dispersal-linked attributes on realized dispersal and population Nrf2-Related Gene Expression and Mitochondrial Activity Are Impaired during the Progression of Diabetes in UCD-T2DM RatsThorwald, Max JayOrtiz, M2022-01-01The onset of type II diabetes increases the heart's susceptibility to oxidative damage because of the associated inflammation and diminished antioxidant response. Transcription factor NF-B initiates inflammation while Nrf2 controls antioxidant defense. Current evidence suggests crosstalk between these transcription factors that may become dysregulated during type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) manifestation. The objective of this study was to examine the dynamic changes that occur in both transcription factors and target genes during the progression of T2DM in the heart. Novel UC Davis T2DM (UCD-T2DM) rats at the following states were utilized: (1) lean, control Sprague-Dawley (SD; n = 7), (2) insulin-resistant pre-diabetic UCD-T2DM = 9), (3) 2-week recently (2Wk; n = 9), (4) 3-month diabetic UCD-T2DM (3Mo; n = 14), and (5) 6-month UCD-T2DM n = 9). NF-B acetylation increased 2-fold in 3Mo and 6Mo diabetic animals compared to SD and Pre animals. Nox4 protein increased 4-fold by 6Mo compared to SD. Nrf2 translocation increased 82% in Pre compared to SD but fell 47% in 6Mo animals. GCLM protein fell 35% in 6Mo compared to Pre. Hmox1 mRNA decreased 45% in 6Mo animals compared to SD. These data suggest that during the progression of T2DM, NF-B related genes increase while Nrf2 genes are suppressed or unchanged, perpetuating inflammation and a lesser ability to handle an oxidant burden altering the heart's redox state. Collectively, these changes likely contribute to the diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications.CardiovascularGeneticsDiabetesNutritionPreventionHeart DiseaseAetiology2.1 Biological radiation plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the evolutionary process. However, the concept has provoked strong and differing opinions concerning its definition and nature among researchers studying a wide diversity of systems. Here, we take a broad view of what constitutes an adaptive radiation, and seek to find commonalities among disparate examples, ranging from plants to invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and remote islands to lakes and continents, to better understand processes shared across adaptive radiations. We surveyed many groups to evaluate factors considered important in a large variety of species radiations. In each of these studies, ecological opportunity of some form is identified as a prerequisite for adaptive radiation. However, evolvability, which can be enhanced by hybridization between distantly related species, may play a role in seeding entire radiations. Within radiations, the processes that lead to speciation depend largely on (1) whether the primary drivers of ecological shifts are (a) external to the membership of the radiation itself (mostly divergent or disruptive ecological selection) or (b) due to competition within the radiation membership (interactions among members) subsequent to reproductive isolation in similar environments, and (2) the extent and timing of admixture. These differences translate into different patterns of species accumulation and subsequent patterns of diversity across an adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiations occur in an extraordinary diversity of different ways, and continue to provide rich data for a better understanding of the diversification of life.AdaptationBiologicalAnimalsGenetic SpeciationPhylogeographyPlantsSpatial AnalysisTimeGeneticsEvolutionary Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wd7k7rkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt02d7x9h22023-08-20T15:11:19Zqt02d7x9h2Neighborhood Ethnic Composition and Self-rated Health Among Chinese and Vietnamese American ImmigrantsGuan, Y2021-06-01Immigrants tend to live in areas with higher co-ethnic density, and the effect of neighborhood ethnic composition could be particularly salient for health. This study explored associations between neighborhood ethnic composition and self-rated health among Asian immigrants. We analyzed data collected at baseline from 670 Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants enrolled in a lifestyle intervention trial. Residential addresses were geocoded and combined with neighborhood socio-demographic profiles based on census data. We used generalized estimating equations to examine neighborhood ethnic composition and self-rated health. Independent of individual-level factors, living in neighborhoods more densely populated by whites was associated with poor/fair self-rated health. Neighborhood household income and density of participants' own ethnic group were not associated with poor/fair self-rated health. More research is warranted to disentangle reasons why Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants living in white-concentrated neighborhoods reported poorer self-rated health, including investigating effects of discrimination, relative deprivation, and availability of social resources.Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical ResearchBasic Behavioral and University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/02d7x9h2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt21w6f8vw2023-08-20T15:10:41Zqt21w6f8vwSerious quit attempts and cessation implications for Asian American male smokersGuan, AliceKim-Mozeleski, Jin ETan, Judy Joyce WTsoh, Janice Y2020-01-01IntroductionSmoking prevalence remains high among Asian American immigrant men, particularly those with limited English proficiency. Understanding ways to promote serious quit attempts (defined as a quit attempt lasting at least 24 h) could be crucial for reducing tobacco-related health disparities in this population. This study examines correlates of serious past year quit attempts among Chinese and Vietnamese American male daily smokers.MethodsBaseline survey data were collected between 2015 and 2017 from a lifestyle intervention trial (N = 340 Chinese and Vietnamese male daily smokers). Data analysis was conducted in 2019. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with serious past year quit attempts.ResultsLess than half (43.2%) of the study participants had at least one serious past year quit attempt. Significant correlates of serious quit attempts included utilizing evidence-based methods (OR = 12.83, 95% CI 5.17-31.84) or other methods (OR = 3.92, 95% CI 3.92-13.73) to facilitate quitting compared to those who did not attempt to quit. Also, participants who had a physician encounter in the past year were more likely to have had a serious quit attempt (OR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.12-4.53). Discussing smoking during a past year doctor's visit, however, was not a significant correlate of serious quit attempts.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the importance of promoting the use of smoking cessation resources, and potentially utilizing healthcare encounters to facilitate cessation. Investigations are warranted to understand better how patient-physician interactions can enhance smoking cessation.Tobacco Smoke and HealthBehavioral and Social SciencePreventionClinical ResearchTobaccoPrevention of disease and conditionsand promotion of well-being3.1 Primary prevention interventions to modify behaviours or promote wellbeingCancerRespiratoryStrokeGood of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/21w6f8vwpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt198325ks2023-08-20T15:05:12Zqt198325ksStability and instability for low refractive-index-contrast particle trapping in a dual-beam optical trapHuff, AlisonMelton, Charles NHirst, Linda SSharping, Jay E2015-10-01A dual-beam optical trap is used to trap and manipulate dielectric particles. When the refractive index of these particles is comparable to that of the surrounding medium, equilibrium trapping locations within the system shift from stable to unstable depending on fiber separation and particle size. This is due to to the relationship between gradient and scattering forces. We experimentally and computationally study the transitions between stable and unstable trapping of poly(methyl methacrylate) beads for a range of parameters relevant to experimental setups involving giant unilamellar vesicles.

As an alternative candidate target for therapy, here we identified an oncogene, ROS1, as an important driver for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metastasis. Among tumors from 188 oral cancer patients, upregulated ROS1 expression strongly correlated with metastasis to lung and lymph nodes. Mechanistic studies uncover that the activated ROS1 results from highly expressed ROS1 gene instead of gene rearrangement, a phenomenon distinct from other cancers. Our data further reveal a novel mechanism that reduced histone methyltransferase EZH2 leads to a lower 27 suppressive modification, relaxes chromatin, and promotes the accessibility of the transcription factor STAT1 to the enhancer and the intron regions of ROS1 target genes, CXCL1 and GLI1, for upregulating their expressions. Down-regulation of ROS1 in highly invasive OSCC cells, nevertheless, reduces cell proliferation and inhibits metastasis to lung in the tail-vein injection and the oral cavity xenograft models.

We quantified the extent to which vegetation and evapotranspiration (ET) are presently cold-limited in California's upper Kings River basin and used a space-for-time substitution to calculate the sensitivity of riverflow to vegetation expansion. We found that runoff is highly sensitive to vegetation migration; warming projected for 2100 could increase average basin-wide ET by 28% and decrease riverflow by 26%. Kings River basin ET currently peaks at midelevation and declines at higher elevation, creating a cold-limited zone above 2,400 m that is disproportionately important for runoff generation. Climate projections for 2085-2100 indicate as much as 4.1 \u00b0C warming in California's Sierra Nevada, which would expand high rates of ET 700-m upslope if vegetation maintains its current correlation with temperature. Moreover, we observed that the relationship between basin-wide ET and temperature is similar across the entire western slope of California's Sierra Nevada, implying that the risk of increasing montane ET with influence microbial behaviors that underlie nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas production, and soil formation. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of soils makes it challenging to untangle the effects of different matrix properties on microbial behaviors. To address this challenge, we developed a tunable artificial soil recipe and used these materials to study the abiotic mechanisms driving soil microbial growth and communication. When we used standardized matrices with varying textures to culture gas-reporting biosensors, we found that a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli) grew best in synthetic silt soils, remaining active over a wide range of soil matric potentials, while a Gram-positive bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) preferred sandy soils, sporulating at low water potentials. Soil texture, mineralogy, and alkalinity all attenuated the bioavailability of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signaling molecule that controls community-level microbial behaviors. Texture controlled the timing of AHL sensing, while AHL bioavailability was decreased ~105-fold by mineralogy and ~103-fold by alkalinity. Finally, we built artificial soils with a range of complexities that converge on the properties of one Mollisol. As artificial soil complexity increased to more closely resemble the Mollisol, microbial behaviors approached those occurring in the natural soil, with the notable exception of organic matter. IMPORTANCE Understanding environmental controls on soil microbes is difficult because many abiotic parameters vary simultaneously and uncontrollably when different natural soils are compared, preventing mechanistic determination of any individual soil parameter's effect on microbial behaviors. We describe how soil texture, mineralogy, pH, and organic matter content can be varied individually within artificial soils to study their effects on soil microbes. Using microbial biosensors that report by producing a rare indicator gas, we identify soil properties that control microbial growth and attenuate the bioavailability of a diffusible chemical used to control community-level behaviors. We find that artificial soils differentially affect signal bioavailability and the growth of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) microbes. These artificial soils are useful for studying the mechanisms that underlie soil controls on microbial fitness, signaling, potential to image the biodistribution of nanoparticles inside deep tissues. In XLCT, X-ray excitable nanophosphors emit optical photons for tomographic imaging. The lifetime of the nanophosphor signal, rather than its intensity, could be used to extract biological microenvironment information such as oxygenation in deep tumors. In this study, we propose the design, the forward model, and the reconstruction algorithm of a time domain XLCT for lifetime imaging with high spatial resolution. We have investigated the feasibility of the proposed design with numerical simulations. We found that the reconstructed lifetime images are robust to noise levels up to 5% and to unknown optical properties up to 4 times of absorption and scattering coefficients.BioengineeringBiomedical ImagingOptical PhysicsMaterials Engineeringapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/38x6z6h7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0sb8r3vm2023-08-20T13:07:45Zqt0sb8r3vmSUGT1 controls interface during HIV-1 infection is a prerequisite for the development of innovative antiviral therapies. Here we show that the suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 (SUGT1) is a permissive factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Expression of SUGT1 increases in infected cells on human brain sections and in permissive host cells. We found that SUGT1 determines the permissiveness to infection of lymphocytes and macrophages by modulating the nuclear import of the viral genome. More importantly, SUGT1 stabilizes the microtubule plus-ends (+MTs) of host cells (through the modulation of microtubule acetylation and the formation of end-binding protein 1 (EB1) comets). This effect on microtubules favors HIV-1 retrograde trafficking and replication. SUGT1 depletion impairs the replication of HIV-1 patient primary isolates and mutant virus that is resistant to raltegravir antiretroviral agent. Altogether our results identify SUGT1 as a cellular factor involved in the post-entry steps of HIV-1 infection that may be targeted for new therapeutic approaches.HIV/AIDSInfectious DiseasesGenetics2.1 Biological and endogenous factorsAetiology2.2 Factors Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0sb8r3vmarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8vb0q9x62023-08-20T12:36:02Zqt8vb0q9x6Impact of fire on active layer and permafrost microbial communities metagenomes large reservoirs of potentially labile carbon (C). Understanding the dynamics of C release from these soils requires us to account for the impact of wildfires, which are increasing in frequency as the climate changes. Boreal wildfires contribute to global emission of greenhouse gases (GHG-CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirectly result in the thawing of near-surface permafrost. In this study, we aimed to define the impact of fire on soil microbial communities and metabolic potential for GHG fluxes in samples collected up to 1 m depth from an upland black spruce forest near Nome Creek, Alaska. We measured geochemistry, GHG fluxes, potential soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure via 16SrRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil moisture, C content and the potential for respiration were reduced by fire, as were microbial community diversity and metabolic potential. There were shifts in dominance of several microbial community members, including a higher abundance of candidate phylum AD3 after fire. The metagenome data showed that fire had a pervasive impact on genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, methanogenesis and the nitrogen cycle. Although fire resulted in an immediate release of CO2 from surface soils, our results suggest that the potential for emission of GHG was ultimately reduced at all soil depths over the longer term. Because of the size of the permafrost C reservoir, these results are crucial for understanding whether fire produces a positive or negative feedback loop contributing to the global C cycle.Climate ActionAlaskaBiodiversityCarbonFiresMetagenomePermafrostSoil and conservation in the age of genomics: The Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoise as a efficient of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nonmodel species. Population genetic theory predicts that this large number of independent markers should provide detailed insights into population structure, even when only a few individuals are sampled. Still, sampling design can have a strong impact on such inferences. Here, we use simulations and empirical SNP data to investigate the impacts of sampling design on estimating genetic differentiation among populations that represent three species of Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.). Though microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA analyses have supported the distinctiveness of these species, a recent study called into question how well these markers matched with data from genomic SNPs, thereby questioning decades of studies in nonmodel organisms. Using >20,000 genomewide SNPs from 30 individuals from three Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoise species, we find distinct structure that matches the relationships described by the traditional genetic markers. Furthermore, we confirm that accurate estimates of genetic differentiation in highly structured natural populations can be obtained using thousands of SNPs and 2-5 individuals, or hundreds of SNPs and 10 individuals, but only if the units of analysis are delineated in a way that is consistent with evolutionary history. We show that the lack of structure in the recent SNP-based study was likely due to unnatural grouping of individuals and erroneous genotype filtering. Our study demonstrates that genomic data enable patterns of genetic differentiation among populations to be elucidated even with few samples per population, and underscores the importance of sampling design. These results have specific implications for studies of population structure in endangered species and subsequent management decisions.Human GenomeGeneticsGeneric effective descriptors of the nonequilibrium dynamics of diverse many-body systems. For example, motile, point-like topological defects capture the salient features of two-dimensional active liquid crystals composed of energy-consuming anisotropic units. We dispersed force-generating microtubule bundles in a passive colloidal liquid crystal to form a three-dimensional active nematic. Light-sheet microscopy revealed the temporal evolution of the millimeter-scale structure of these active nematics with single-bundle resolution. The primary topological excitations are extended, charge-neutral disclination loops that undergo complex dynamics and recombination events. Our work suggests a framework for analyzing the nonequilibrium dynamics of bulk anisotropic systems as diverse as driven complex fluids, active metamaterials, biological tissues, and collections of robots or organisms.cond-mat.softGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6f2657d7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6b20n15c2023-08-20T09:49:59Zqt6b20n15cDietary prophage inducers and viruses and microbial cells per gram of fecal matter (dry weight) in the large intestine are important to human health. The responses of three common gut bacteria species, and one opportunistic pathogen, to 117 commonly consumed foods, chemical additives, and plant extracts were tested. Many compounds, including Stevia rebaudiana and bee propolis extracts, exhibited species-specific growth inhibition by prophage induction. Overall, these results show that various foods may change the abundances of gut bacteria by modulating temperate phage and suggests a novel path for landscaping the human gut microbiome.NutritionComplementary how migrations affect human securities, look to the pastAltschul, Jeffrey HKintigh, Yves V2021-01-11Vibrio fischeri is a cosmopolitan marine bacterium that oftentimes displays different colony morphologies, switching from a smooth to a wrinkly phenotype in order to adapt to changes in the environment. This wrinkly phenotype has also been associated with increased biofilm formation, an essential characteristic for V. fischeri to adhere to substrates, to suspended debris, and within the light organs of sepiolid squids. Elevated levels of biofilm formation are correlated with increased microbial survival of exposure to environmental stressors and the ability to expand niche breadth. Since V. fischeri has a biphasic life history strategy between its free-living and symbiotic states, we were interested in whether the wrinkly morphotype demonstrated differences in its expression profile in comparison to the naturally occurring and more common smooth variant. We show that genes involved in major biochemical cascades, including those involved in protein sorting, oxidative stress, and membrane transport, play a role in the wrinkly phenotype. Interestingly, only a few unique genes are specifically involved in macromolecule biosynthesis in the wrinkly phenotype, which underlies the importance of other pathways utilized for adaptation under the conditions in which Vibrio bacteria are producing this change in phenotype. These results provide the first comprehensive analysis of the complex form of genetic activation that underlies the diversity in morphologies of V. fischeri when switching between two different colony morphotypes, each representing a unique biofilm ecotype.IMPORTANCE The wrinkly bacterial colony phenotype has been associated with increased squid host colonization in V. fischeri The significance of our research is in identifying the genetic mechanisms that are responsible for heightened biofilm formation in V. fischeri This report also advances our understanding of gene regulation in V. fischeri and brings to the forefront a number of previously overlooked genetic networks.

In this study, we use a theoretically informed qualitative approach to investigate the implementation of two policies to promote breastfeeding in Vietnam. We conducted semi-structured interviews with national and local policy stakeholders (n = 26) in 2017. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and then translated to English by certified translators. Transcript data were analysed using an integrated conceptual framework of policy implementation. Respondents identified several positive outcomes resulting from implementation of an extended maternity leave policy (Labour Code No. 10/2012/QH13) and further restrictions on marketing of breast milk substitutes (Decree No. 100/2014/ND-CP). Decree No. 100, in particular, was said to have reduced advertising of breast milk substitutes in mass media outlets and healthcare settings. Key implementation actors were national-level bureaucratic actors, local organizations and international partners. Findings reveal the importance of policy precedence and a broader set of policies to promote the rights of women and children to support implementation. Other facilitators were involvement from national-level implementing agencies and healthcare personnel and strength of government relationships and coordination with non-governmental and international organizations. Implementation challenges included insufficient funding, limited training to report violations, a cumbersome reporting process and pervasive misinformation about breast milk and breast milk substitutes. Limited reach for women employed in the informal labour sector and in rural communities was said to be a compatibility issue for the extended maternity leave policy in addition to the lack of impact on non-parental guardians and caretakers. Recommendations to improve policy implementation include designating a role for international organizations in supporting implementation, expanding maternity protections for all working women, building local-level policy knowledge to support enforcement, simplifying Decree No. 100 violation reporting processes and continuing to invest in interventions to facilitate a supportive policy environment & ServicesCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3fp327p1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2s8888nf2023-08-20T08:34:58Zqt2s8888nfHawaiian Nysius insects rely on an obligate symbiont with a reduced genome that retains a discrete nutritional profile to match their plant seed dietStever, HeatherEiben, JesseBennett, Gordon MKatz, Laura2021-09-01Seed-feeding Nysius Schneideria nysicola\" (Gammaproteobacteria). Although many other hemipteran insect groups generally rely on bacterial symbionts that synthesize all ten essential amino acids lacking in their plant sap diets, the nutritional role of Schneideria in Nysius hosts that specialize on a more nutritionally complete seed-based diet has remained unknown. To determine the nutritional and functional capabilities of Schneideria, we sequenced the complete Schneideria genomes from three distantly related endemic Hawaiian Nysius seed bug species. The complete Schneideria genomes are highly conserved and perfectly syntenic among Hawaiian Nysius host species. Each circular chromosome is 0.57 Mb in size and encodes 537 protein-coding genes. They further exhibit a strong A + T nucleotide substitution bias with an average G + C nucleotide content of 29%. The predicted nutritional contribution of Schneideria includes four B vitamins and five of the ten essential amino acids that likely match its hosts' seed-based diet.

Neighborhood characteristics were measured with 2000 U.S. Census tract-level data, parents (mostly mothers) rated their own parenting styles, and parents and teachers rated children's behavioral problems. Path analysis was conducted to test two hypotheses: (a) parenting styles mediate the relations between neighborhood characteristics and children's behavioral problems, and (b) children's behavioral problems mediate the relations between neighborhood and parenting styles. We found that neighborhood Asian concentration was positively associated with authoritarian parenting, which in turn was associated with Chinese American children's higher externalizing and internalizing problems (by parents' reports). In addition, neighborhood economic disadvantage was positively related to children's externalizing problems (by parents' reports), which in turn predicted lower authoritative parenting. The current results suggest the need to consider multiple pathways in the relations among neighborhood, family, and child adjustment, and they have implications for the prevention and intervention of behavioral problems in Chinese American children.Drug Abuse (NIDA only)Substance MisuseMental of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6gk1h9vbarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4zf772zc2023-08-20T06:10:11Zqt4zf772zcThe Als3 Cell Wall Adhesin Plays a Critical Role in Human Serum Amyloid A1-Induced and proteins play critical roles in the host defense against invading pathogens. We recently discovered that recombinantly expressed human and mouse serum amyloid A1 (rhSAA1 and rmSAA1, respectively) proteins have potent antifungal activities against the major human fungal pathogen Candida albicans At high concentrations, rhSAA1 disrupts C. albicans membrane integrity and induces rapid fungal cell death. In the present study, we find that rhSAA1 promotes cell aggregation and targets the C. albicans cell wall adhesin Als3. Inactivation of ALS3 in C. albicans leads to a striking decrease in cell aggregation and cell death upon rhSAA1 treatment, suggesting that Als3 plays a critical role in SAA1 sensing. We further demonstrate that deletion of the transcriptional regulators controlling the expression of ALS3, such as AHR1, BCR1, and EFG1, in C. albicans results in similar effects to that of the als3/als3 mutant upon rhSAA1 treatment. Global gene expression profiling indicates that rhSAA1 has a discernible impact on the expression of cell wall- and metabolism-related genes, suggesting that rhSAA1 treatment could lead to a nutrient starvation effect on C. albicans cells.GeneticsInfectious Diseases2.1 Biological and of collagen type I is a hallmark of wound healing and cancer that is commonly attributed to myofibroblasts. However, it remains unknown which effect collagen microarchitecture has on myofibroblast differentiation. Here, we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the hypothesis that the microarchitecture of fibrillar collagen networks mechanically regulates myofibroblast differentiation of adipose stromal cells (ASCs) independent of bulk stiffness. Collagen gels with controlled fiber thickness and pore size were microfabricated by adjusting the gelation temperature while keeping their concentration constant. Rheological characterization and simulation data indicated that networks with thicker fibers and larger pores exhibited increased strain-stiffening relative to networks with thinner fibers and smaller pores. Accordingly, ASCs cultured in scaffolds with thicker fibers were more contractile, expressed myofibroblast markers, and deposited more extended fibronectin fibers. Consistent with elevated myofibroblast differentiation, ASCs in scaffolds with thicker fibers exhibited a more proangiogenic phenotype that promoted endothelial sprouting in a contractility-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that changes of collagen microarchitecture regulate myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis independent of collagen quantity and bulk stiffness by locally modulating cellular mechanosignaling. These findings have implications for regenerative medicine and anticancer treatments.Stem Cell order nonlinear spectroscopies selectively probe optically \"dark\" surface states in small semiconductor nanocrystals?Kelley, Anne Myers2020-03-31Second order nonlinear responses such as sum frequency and second harmonic generation arise from the response of a material system to the second power of an incident electromagnetic field through the material's first hyperpolarizability or second-order optical susceptibility. These quantities are nonzero only for noncentrosymmetric systems, but different length scales of the noncentrosymmetry give rise to second harmonic or sum frequency radiation with different spatial and coherence characteristics. This perspective discusses the possible contributions to the second-order signal from films of small semiconductor quantum dots and addresses whether such experiments are expected to selectively enhance transitions to surface defects or trap states in such systems. It points out how \"surface\" and \"bulk\" contributions to the sum frequency or the second harmonic signal should be distinguishable through their angular dependence in a scattering geometry. It also explores possible mechanisms whereby second order spectroscopies might provide access to surface states that are very weak or absent in other forms of optical spectroscopy.Physical SciencesChemical SciencesEngineeringChemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4d87t4wzarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt58z0b5ns2023-08-20T05:05:10Zqt58z0b5nsParental Use of Multimodal Cues in the Initiation of Joint Attention as a Function of Child Hearing StatusGabouer, AllisonOghalai, JohnBortfeld, Heather2020-07-02In the current study, we examine how hearing parents use multimodal cuing to establish joint attention with their hearing (N=9) or deaf (N=9) children during a free-play session. The deaf children were all candidates for cochlear implantation who had not yet been implanted, and each hearing child was age-matched to a deaf child. We coded parents' use of auditory, visual, and tactile cues, alone and in different combinations, during both successful and failed bids for children's attention. Although our findings revealed no clear quantitative differences in parents' use of multimodal cues as a function of child hearing status, secondary analyses revealed that hearing parents of deaf children used shorter utterances while initiating joint attention than did hearing parents of hearing children. Hearing parents of deaf children also touched their children twice as often throughout the play session than did hearing parents of hearing children. These findings demonstrate that parents differentially accommodate the specific needs of their hearing and deaf children in subtle ways to establish communicative intent.Basic Behavioral and Social SciencePediatricPreventionNeurosciencesAssistive TechnologyBioengineeringRehabilitationBehavioral and Social ScienceClinical Research1.2 Psychological and biological development and functioningEarCognitive SciencesLinguisticsExperimental Psychologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/58z0b5nsarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5w50h06w2023-08-20T03:28:00Zqt5w50h06wNanoscale Friction Behavior Robert the tribological properties of MoS2, the frictional characteristics of other members of the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family have remained relatively unexplored. To understand the effect of the chalcogen on the tribological behavior of these materials and gain broader general insights into the factors controlling friction at the nanoscale, we compared the friction force behavior for a nanoscale single asperity sliding on MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 in both bulk and monolayer forms through a combination of atomic force microscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Experiments and simulations showed that, under otherwise identical conditions, MoS2 has the highest friction among these materials and MoTe2 has the lowest. Simulations complemented by theoretical analysis based on the Prandtl-Tomlinson model revealed that the observed friction contrast between the TMDs was attributable to their lattice constants, which differed depending on the chalcogen. While the corrugation amplitudes of the energy landscapes are similar for all three materials, larger lattice constants permit the tip to slide more easily across correspondingly wider saddle points in the potential energy landscape. These results emphasize the critical role of the lattice constant, which can be the determining factor for frictional behavior at the nanoscale.Affordable the dynamics of dental distributions: insights from shark of the most abundant vertebrate fossils, and because tooth size generally correlates with body size, their accumulations document the size structure of populations. Understanding how ecological and environmental processes influence size structure, and how this extends to influence these dental distributions, may offer a window into the ecological and environmental dynamics of past and present shark populations. Here, we examine the dental distributions of sand tigers, including extant Carcharias taurus and extinct Striatolamia macrota, to reconstruct the size structure for a contemporary locality and four Eocene localities. We compare empirical distributions against expectations from a population simulation to gain insight into potential governing ecological processes. Specifically, we investigate the influence of dispersal flexibility to and from protected nurseries. We show that changing the flexibility of initial dispersal of juveniles from the nursery and annual migration of adults to the nursery explains a large amount of dental distribution variability. Our framework predicts dispersal strategies of an extant sand tiger population, and supports nurseries as important components of sand tiger life history in both extant and Eocene populations. These results suggest nursery protection may be vital for shark conservation with increasing anthropogenic impacts and climate megatooth sharks M2022-06-24Trophic position is a fundamental characteristic of animals, yet it is unknown in many extinct species. In this study, we ground-truth the 15N/14N ratio of enameloid-bound organic matter (15NEB) as a trophic level proxy by comparison to dentin collagen 15N and apply this method to the fossil record to reconstruct the trophic level of the megatooth sharks (genus Otodus). These sharks evolved in the Cenozoic, culminating in Otodus megalodon, a shark with a maximum body size of more than 15 m, which went extinct 3.5 million years ago. Very high 15NEB values (22.9 \u00b1 4.4) of O. megalodon from the Miocene and Pliocene show that it occupied a higher trophic level than is known for any marine species, extinct or extant. 15NEB also indicates a dietary shift in sharks of the megatooth lineage as they evolved toward the gigantic O. megalodon, with the highest trophic level apparently reached earlier than peak size.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5wt1z0z9articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9f90d1vs2023-08-20T02:25:31Zqt9f90d1vsDiscussing lifestyle behaviors: perspectives and experiences of general practitionersHamilton, KyraHenderson, JoannaBurton, EmmaHagger, Martin S2019-01-01Background: Initiatives aimed at increasing participation in preventive health behaviors has been identified as a priority for addressing the increasing incidence of non-communicable chronic disease. General practice is an existing network that can be leveraged to intervene and promote messages for health behavior change. We aimed to explore the extent to which 'lifestyle' behaviors are discussed by general practitioners (GPs) with their patients in their practices, and the context and content of these discussions. Methods: GPs (N = 26) practising in Australian clinics participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis. Results: Results showed discussions of lifestyle behaviors were brief, but relatively frequent and often initiated by the GP. GPs generally provided basic advice and education that was often ad-hoc and in reaction to prompts from the patient. GPs recognized the importance of addressing lifestyle behaviors in practice, but also highlighted substantive barriers that limit the initiation of these discussions. These included patient readiness for change, patient acceptance and openness, patient accountability and responsibility, patient background factors, GPs' role and knowledge, GP financial implications, GP-patient relationship, and lack of time. Conclusions: Current findings provide important preliminary knowledge on the extent to which Australian GPs discuss lifestyle behavior change with patients during routine consultations, the context and content of these discussions, and barriers to initiating these discussions. Further research should seek to gain a better understanding of barriers and identify strategies to mitigate their impact. This might maximize the potential for GPs to promote adaptive lifestyle behavior change for improving patient health.Behavioral and Social SciencePreventionNutritionBasic Behavioral and Social a holographic approach for the case in which a single source-detector pair is used to scan a sample. The source-detector pair collects intensity-only data at different frequencies and positions. By using an appropriate illumination strategy, we recover field cross correlations over different frequencies for each scan location. The problem is that these field cross correlations are asynchronized, so they have to be aligned first in order to image coherently. This is the main result of the paper: a simple algorithm to synchronize field cross correlations at different locations. Thus, one can recover full field data up to a global phase that is common to all scan locations. The recovered data are, then, coherent over space and frequency so they can be used to form high-resolution three-dimensional images. Imaging with intensity-only data is therefore as good as coherent imaging with full data. In addition, we use an 1-norm minimization algorithm that promotes the low dimensional structure of the images, allowing for deep high-resolution imaging.BioengineeringBiomedical ImagingDetectionscreening and diagnosis4.1 Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologiesOptical PhysicsElectrical and Electronic EngineeringOpthalmology and OptometryOpticsapplication/pdfCC-BY-NC-NDeScholarship, University of Disparities MReiter, Paul LBrewer, Noel T2016-09-01Research on prosocial attitudes, social networks, social capital, and social stratification suggest that lower-socioeconomic status (SES), Hispanic, and nonwhite individuals will be more likely than their higher-SES and non-Hispanic white counterparts to engage in health behaviors that serve a social good.

Analyses revealed that (a) parents with lower education and (b) black and Hispanic parents and adolescent males reported higher prosocial vaccination attitudes, but only some attitudes were associated with higher willingness to vaccinate. We discuss these findings in terms of how prosocial attitudes may motivate certain health behaviors and serve as countervailing mechanisms in the (re)production of health disparities and promising targets of future public health interventions.Cervical CancerPreventionHPV and/or Cervical Cancer VaccinesClinical ResearchBehavioral and InfectionsPediatricBasic Behavioral and Social RelatedImmunizationInfectious DiseasesCancerGood University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/68n5g1z3articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt67n4t92v2023-08-20T01:21:29Zqt67n4t92vDifferences in the origin of philosophy between Chinese medicine and western medicine: Exploration of the holistic advantages of Chinese medicineSun, Da-zhiLi, Shao-danLiu, YiZhang, YinMei, RongYang, Ming-hui2013-09-01To explore advantages of Chinese medicine (CM) by analyzing differences in the origin of philosophy for human health between CM and Western medicine (WM). Methodologically, a distinctive feature of CM is its systems theory, which is also the difference between CM and WM. Since the birth of CM, it has taken the human body as a whole from the key concepts of \"qi, blood, yin-yang, viscera (Zang-Fu), and meridian and channel\", rather than a single cell or a particular organ. WM evolves from the Western philosophic way of thinking and merely uses natural sciences as the foundation. The development of WM is based on human structures, or anatomy, and therefore, research of WM is also based on the way of thinking of decomposing the whole human body into several independent parts, which is the impetus of promoting the development of WM. The core of CM includes the holistic view and the dialectical view. Chinese herbal medicines contain various components and treat a disease from multiple targets and links. Therefore, Chinese herbal medicines treat a diseased state by regulating and mobilizing the whole body rather than just regulating a single factor, since the diseased state is not only a problem in a local part of the body but a local reflection of imbalance of the whole body.Complementary and Medicineapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/67n4t92varticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6rv4m68r2023-08-20T01:21:15Zqt6rv4m68rImipramine blue halts head and neck cancer invasion through promoting F-box and and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is that local invasion rather than distant metastasis is the major route for dissemination. Therefore, targeting the locally invasive cancer cells is more important than preventing systemic metastasis in HNSCC and other invasive-predominant cancers. We previously demonstrate a specific mechanism for HNSCC local invasion: the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator Twist1 represses microRNA let-7i expression, leading to the activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and engendering the mesenchymal-mode movement in three-dimensional (3D) culture. However, targeting the EMT regulator is relatively difficult because of its transcription factor nature and the strategy for confining HNSCC invasion to facilitate local treatment is limited. Imipramine blue (IB) is a newly identified anti-invasive compound that effectively inhibits glioma invasion. Here we demonstrate that in HNSCC cells, a noncytotoxic dose of IB represses mesenchymal-mode Twist1-mediated let-7i IB inhibits reactive oxygen species-induced nuclear factor-B pathway activation. Importantly, IB promotes degradation of the EMT inducer Twist1 by enhancing F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 14 (FBXL14)-mediated polyubiquitination of Twist1.

The region has been subjected to dramatic climatic fluctuations and has been geologically active from the Late Miocene to the present. The myobatrachid frog Arenophryne rotunda, a Shark Bay endemic, provides an ideal opportunity to examine the relative effects of fluctuating climates and geological activity on the biota of Shark Bay. A comprehensive phylogeographic analysis of A. rotunda, based on data comprising 1154 bp of the mitochondrial gene ND2, is presented. My results demonstrate a major genetic break that divides this species at the northern edge of the Victorian Plateau into northern and southern species lineages, dating to the Late Miocene, with a further division of the southern species lineage across the Murchison Gorge dating to the Plio-Pleistocene border. Both of these periods are related to prominent geological activity and climatic shifts in the Shark Bay region. Interpretation of phylogeographic results point to the prominent role of fluctuating Pleistocene climates and associated coastal landscape evolution in the generation of phylogeographic structure within the distinct A. rotunda species lineages. Similar processes have been invoked to explain the diversity of other Shark American tree migration paced by climate in the West, lagging in the EastSharma, RomanClark, James S2022-01-18Tree fecundity and recruitment have not yet been quantified at scales needed to anticipate biogeographic shifts in response to climate change. By separating their responses, this study shows coherence across species and communities, offering the strongest support to date that migration is in progress with regional limitations on rates. The southeastern continent emerges as a fecundity hotspot, but it is situated south of population centers where high seed production could contribute to poleward population spread. By contrast, seedling success is highest in the West and North, serving to partially offset limited seed production near poleward frontiers. The evidence of fecundity and recruitment control on tree migration can inform conservation planning for the expected long-term disequilibrium between climate and forest distribution.Climate fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone extremes in the western United StatesKalashnikov, Dmitri ASchnell, Jordan LAbatzoglou, John TSwain, Daniel LSingh, Deepti2022-01-07Wildfires and meteorological conditions influence the co-occurrence of multiple harmful air pollutants including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone. We examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5/ozone co-occurrences and associated population exposure in the western United States (US). The frequency, spatial extent, and temporal persistence of extreme PM2.5/ozone co-occurrences have increased significantly between 2001 and 2020, increasing annual population exposure to multiple harmful air pollutants by ~25 million person-days/year. Using a clustering methodology to characterize daily weather patterns, we identify significant increases in atmospheric ridging patterns conducive to widespread PM2.5/ozone co-occurrences and population exposure. We further link the spatial extent of co-occurrence to the extent of extreme heat and wildfires.

First, the potentials were evaluated by computing bulk and surface properties-surface energy, lattice constant, stiffness constants, and the equation of state-and comparing these to prior experimental measurements and quantum mechanics calculations. Then, the potentials were assessed in terms of the stability of cubic and icosahedral nanoparticles with faces in the {100} and {111} planes, respectively. Although none of the force fields predicts all the evaluated properties with perfect accuracy, one potential-the embedded atom method formalism with a specific parameter set-was identified as best able to model platinum in both bulk and nanoparticle forms.NanotechnologyBioengineeringTheoretical and Computational ChemistryBiochemistry and Cell BiologyComputer SoftwareChemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0bs9d9fmarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0dk492jk2023-08-20T00:12:18Zqt0dk492jkThe in high dimensionsMoscoso, MiguelNovikov, AlexeiPapanicolaou, GeorgeTsogka, Chrysoula2020-05-26The ability to detect sparse signals from noisy, high-dimensional data is a top priority in modern science and engineering. It is well known that a sparse solution of the linear system [Formula: see text] can be found efficiently with an [Formula: see text]-norm minimization approach if the data are noiseless. However, detection of the signal from data corrupted by noise is still a challenging problem as the solution depends, in general, on a regularization parameter with optimal value that is not easy to choose. We propose an efficient approach that does not require any parameter estimation. We introduce a no-phantom weight and the Noise Collector matrix C and solve an augmented system [Formula: see text], where e is the noise. We show that the [Formula: see text]-norm minimal solution of this system has zero false discovery rate for any level of noise, with probability that tends to one as the dimension of [Formula: see text] increases to infinity. We obtain exact support recovery if the noise is not too large and develop a fast Noise Collector algorithm, which makes the computational cost of solving the augmented system comparable with that of the original one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in applications to passive array imaging.high-dimensional probabilityconvex geometrysparsity-promoting algorithmsnoisy M2017-02-01Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate metabolism, but are typically suppressed during times of stressful physiological conditions, including fasting. Interestingly, prolonged fasting in northern elephant seal pups is associated with reliance on a lipid-based metabolism and increased levels of circulating THs that are partially attributed to active secretion as opposed to reduced clearance. This apparent paradox is coupled with complementary increases in cellular TH-mediated activity, suggesting that in mammals naturally adapted to prolonged fasting, THs are necessary to support metabolism. However, the functional relevance of this physiological paradox has remained largely unexplored, especially as it relates to the regulation of lipids. To address the hypothesis that TSH-mediated increase in THs contributes to lipid metabolism, we infused early and late-fasted pups with TSH and measured several key genes in adipose and muscle, and plasma hormones associated with regulation of lipid metabolism. TSH infusion increased the mRNA expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) more than 6.5-fold at 60 min in muscle, and expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) more than 27-fold during the early fast at 60 min, in adipose. Additionally, during the late fast period, the protein content of adipose CD36 increased 1.1-fold, and plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations increased 25% at 120 min, with NEFA levels returning to baseline after 24 h. We show that the TSH-induced increases in THs in fasting pups are functional and likely contribute to the maintenance of a lipid-based metabolism.NutritionBiotechnology1.1 Normal biological development and Health SciencesPhysiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/28t5m1jcarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt26d7x9c82023-08-19T23:33:20Zqt26d7x9c8Predicting Social Distancing Intention and Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Integrated Social Cognition JMoyers, Susette AHamilton, Kyra2020-10-01BackgroundSocial distancing is a key behavior to minimize COVID-19 infections. Identification of potentially modifiable determinants of social distancing behavior may provide essential evidence to inform social distancing behavioral interventions.PurposeThe current study applied an integrated social cognition model to identify the determinants of social distancing behavior, and the processes involved, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsIn a prospective correlational survey study, samples of Australian (N = 365) and U.S. (N = 440) residents completed online self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, anticipated regret, and perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, action planning, habit, and past behavior with respect to social distancing behavior at an initial occasion. Follow-up measures of habit and social distancing behavior were taken 1 week later.ResultsStructural equation models indicated that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC were consistent predictors of intention in both samples. Intention, action planning, and habit at follow-up were consistent predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples. Action planning did not have consistent effects mediating or moderating the intention-behavior relationship. Inclusion of past behavior in the model attenuated effects among constructs, although the effects of the determinants of intention and behavior remained.ConclusionsCurrent findings highlight the importance of subjective norm, moral obligation, and PBC as determinants of social distancing intention and intention and habit as behavioral determinants. Future research on long-range predictors of social distancing behavior and reciprocal effects in the integrated model is warranted.Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical ResearchBasic Behavioral and Healthapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/26d7x9c8articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1zt097mk2023-08-19T22:52:44Zqt1zt097mkAnthropogenic climate change is worsening North pollen seasonsAnderegg, John TAnderegg, Leander DLBielory, LeonardKinney, Patrick pollen has major respiratory health impacts and anthropogenic climate change may increase pollen concentrations and extend pollen seasons. While greenhouse and field studies indicate that pollen concentrations are correlated with temperature, a formal detection and attribution of the role of anthropogenic climate change in continental pollen seasons is urgently needed. Here, we use long-term pollen data from 60 North American stations from 1990 to 2018, spanning 821 site-years of data, and Earth system model simulations to quantify the role of human-caused climate change in continental patterns in pollen concentrations. We find widespread advances and lengthening of pollen seasons (+20 d) and increases in pollen concentrations (+21%) across North America, which are strongly coupled to observed warming. Human forcing of the climate system contributed 50% (interquartile range: 19-84%) of the trend in pollen seasons and 8% (4-14%) of the trend in pollen concentrations. Our results reveal that anthropogenic climate change has already exacerbated pollen seasons in the past three decades with attendant deleterious effects on respiratory health.Climate ActionAir the during a \"fight or flight\" responseBazmi, MaedehEscobar, Ariel L2019-06-03Bazmi and Escobar highlight a recent investigation of the mechanisms that regulate Ca2+ influx during sympathetic stimulation.CardiovascularAdrenergic AgentsCalciumHeartHeart RatePhysiologyMedical Physiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University 1 repolarization channels triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In most mammals, this influx occurs during the ventricular action potential (AP) plateau phase 2. However, in murine models, the influx through L-type Ca2+ channels happens in early repolarizing phase 1. The aim of this work is to assess if changes in the open probability of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-sensitive Kv channels defining the outward K+ current during phase 1 can modulate Ca2+ currents, Ca2+ transients, and systolic pressure during the cardiac in beating hearts. Pulsed local-field fluorescence microscopy and loose-patch photolysis were used to test the hypothesis that a decrease in a transient K+ current (Ito) will enhance Ca2+ influx and promote a larger Ca2+ transient. Simultaneous recordings of Ca2+ transients local-field fluorescence microscopy and loose-patch photolysis showed that a reduction in the phase 1 repolarization rate increases the amplitude of Ca2+ transients due to an increase in Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels. Moreover, 4-AP induced an increase in the time required for AP to reach 30% repolarization, and the amplitude of Ca2+ transients was larger in epicardium than endocardium. On the other hand, the activation of Ito with NS5806 resulted in a reduction of Ca2+ current amplitude that led to a reduction of the amplitude of Ca2+ transients. Finally, the 4-AP effect on AP phase 1 was significantly smaller when the L-type Ca2+ current was partially blocked with nifedipine, indicating that the phase 1 rate of repolarization is defined by the competition between an outward K+ current and optical properties in layered tissues by use of the Born approximation of the radiative transport equation.Kim, Arnold DHayakawa, CaroleVenugopalan, Vasan2006-04-15We use the Born approximation of the radiative transport equation to recover simultaneously the absorption and scattering coefficients in a single layer of a two-layer tissue sample from reflectance data. This method reduces the estimation of both optical properties to a single linear, least-squares problem. It is valid over length scales smaller than a transport mean free path and hence is useful for epithelial tissue layers. We demonstrate the accuracy of this method by using spatially resolved reflectance data computed KeKelley, Myers2017-02-02Zinc to cadmium cation exchange of ZnSe quantum dots has been used to produce a series of alloyed Zn1-xCdxSe quantum dots. As x increases and the lowest-energy exciton shifts to the red, the peak initially broadens and then sharpens as x approaches 1. Resonance Raman spectra obtained with excitation near the lowest excitonic absorption peak show a gradual shift of the longitudinal optical phonon peak from 251 cm-1 in pure ZnSe to 210 cm-1 in nearly pure CdSe with strong broadening at intermediate compositions. The LO overtone to fundamental intensity ratio, a rough gauge of exciton-phonon coupling strength, increases considerably for intermediate compositions compared with those of either pure ZnSe or pure CdSe. The results indicate that partial localization of the hole in locally Cd-rich regions of the alloyed particles increases the strengths of local internal electric fields, increasing the coupling between the exciton and polar optical phonons.Physical SciencesChemical Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8qg267j6articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2ms6n3f32023-08-19T22:00:01Zqt2ms6n3f3Structural basis of L2017-03-17Circadian clocks are ubiquitous timing systems that induce rhythms of biological activities in synchrony with night and day. In cyanobacteria, timing is generated by a posttranslational clock consisting of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins and a set of output signaling proteins, SasA and CikA, which transduce this rhythm to control gene expression. Here, we describe crystal and nuclear magnetic resonance structures of KaiB-KaiC,KaiA-KaiB-KaiC, and CikA-KaiB complexes. They reveal how the metamorphic properties of KaiB, a protein that adopts two distinct folds, and the post-adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis state of KaiC create a hub around which nighttime signaling events revolve, including inactivation of KaiA and reciprocal regulation of the mutually antagonistic signaling proteins, SasA and CikA.Sleep ResearchGeneticsGeneric health relevanceAdenosine filamentation host-permissive conditions organisms can form hypervirulent mucosal biofilms. C. albicans biofilm Efg1, Tec1, Ndt80, and Rob1. The objective of this work was to test whether any of these regulators play a role in cross-kingdom interactions between C. albicans and S. oralis in oral mucosal biofilms, and identify downstream target gene(s) that promote these interactions. Organotypic mucosal constructs and a mouse model of oropharyngeal infection were used to analyze mucosal biofilm growth and fungal gene expression. By screening 6 C. albicans transcription regulator reporter strains we discovered that EFG1 was strongly activated by interaction with S. oralis in late biofilm growth stages. EFG1 gene expression was increased in polymicrobial biofilms on abiotic surfaces, mucosal constructs and tongue tissues of mice infected with both organisms. EFG1 was required for robust Candida-streptococcal biofilm growth in organotypic constructs and mouse oral tissues. S. oralis stimulated C. albicans ALS1 gene expression in an EFG1-dependent manner, and Als1 was identified as a downstream effector of the Efg1 pathway which promoted C. albicans-S. oralis coaggregation interactions in mixed biofilms. We conclude that S. oralis induces an increase in EFG1 expression in C. albicans in late biofilm stages. This in turn increases expression of ALS1, which promotes coaggregation interactions and mucosal biofilm growth. Our work provides novel insights on C. albicans genes which play a role in cross-kingdom interactions with S. oralis in DiseasesAetiology2.1 vivo imaging modality to visualize physiological and pathological processes in small animals. However, FMT reconstruction is ill-posed and ill-conditioned due to strong optical scattering in deep tissues, which results in poor spatial resolution. It is well known that FMT image quality can be improved substantially by applying the structural guidance in the FMT reconstruction. An approach to introducing anatomical information into the FMT reconstruction is presented using the kernel method. In contrast to conventional methods that incorporate anatomical information with a Laplacian-type regularization matrix, the proposed method introduces the anatomical guidance into the projection model of FMT. The primary advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require segmentation of targets in the anatomical images. Numerical simulations and phantom experiments have been performed to demonstrate the proposed approach's feasibility. Numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed kernel method can separate two FMT targets with an edge-to-edge distance of 1 mm and is robust to false-positive guidance and inhomogeneity in the anatomical image. For the phantom experiments with two FMT targets, the kernel method has reconstructed both targets successfully, which further validates the proposed dipole drives short- and long-term patterns of postfire forest recovery in the western United StatesLittlefield, Caitlin EDobrowski, Solomon ZAbatzoglou, John TParks, Sean ADavis, Kimberley T2020-11-24Researchers are increasingly examining patterns and drivers of postfire forest recovery amid growing concern that climate change and intensifying fires will trigger ecosystem transformations. Diminished seed availability and postfire drought have emerged as key constraints on conifer recruitment. However, the spatial and temporal extent to which recurring modes of climatic variability shape patterns of postfire recovery remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify a north-south dipole in annual climatic moisture deficit anomalies across the Interior West of the US and characterize its influence on forest recovery from fire. We use annually resolved establishment models from dendrochronological records to correlate this climatic dipole with short-term postfire juvenile recruitment. We also examine longer-term recovery trajectories using Forest Inventory and Analysis data from 989 burned plots. We show that annual postfire ponderosa pine recruitment probabilities in the northern Rocky Mountains (NR) and the southwestern US (SW) track the strength of the dipole, while declining overall due to increasing aridity. This indicates that divergent recovery trajectories may be triggered concurrently across large spatial scales: favorable conditions in the SW can correspond to drought in the NR that inhibits ponderosa pine establishment, and vice versa. The imprint of this climatic dipole is manifest for years postfire, as evidenced by dampened long-term likelihoods of juvenile ponderosa pine presence in areas that experienced postfire drought. These findings underscore the importance of climatic variability at multiple spatiotemporal scales in driving cross-regional patterns of forest recovery and have implications for understanding ecosystem transformations and species range dynamics under MUSIC.Kim, Arnold DTsogka, Chrysoula2019-11-01We present a method for inverse scattering that relies on intensity-only measurements of the scattered field on a single measurement plane. By collecting measurements from a suite of experiments in which the sample is illuminated using different incident fields, we create sufficient data diversity to overcome the limitations of the intensity-only measurements. We give an explicit procedure that uses an algebraic relation called the polarization identity to convert intensity measurements of scattered fields to interferometric measurements in which one of the scattered fields serves as the reference. By adjusting the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method for these interferometric data, we effectively recover the location and shapes of multiple objects contained in the imaging region. This method is effective and robust to noise as long as there is sufficiently high data diversity and the fractional volume of the scattering objects is not too high. We present image reconstructions for several three-dimensional examples with simulated data computed using the Method of Fundamental Solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of this imaging method.BioengineeringOptical PhysicsElectrical and Electronic EngineeringOpthalmology and OptometryOpticsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2zm3b48rarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7dr015z42023-08-19T20:47:31Zqt7dr015z4Spectral convergence in tapping and physiological fluctuations: coupling and independence of 1/f noise in the central and autonomic nervous systemsRigoli, Lillian MHolman, DanielSpivey, Michael JKello, Christopher T2014-01-01When humans perform a response task or timing task repeatedly, fluctuations in measures of timing from one action to the next exhibit long-range correlations known as 1/f noise. The origins of 1/f noise in timing have been debated for over 20 years, with one common explanation serving as a default: humans are composed of physiological processes throughout the brain and body that operate over a wide range of timescales, and these processes combine to be expressed as a general source of 1/f noise. To test this explanation, the present study investigated the coupling vs. independence of 1/f noise in timing deviations, key-press durations, pupil dilations, and heartbeat intervals while tapping to an audiovisual metronome. All four dependent measures exhibited clear 1/f noise, regardless of whether tapping was synchronized or syncopated. 1/f spectra for timing deviations were found to match those for key-press durations on an individual basis, and 1/f spectra for pupil dilations matched those in heartbeat intervals. Results indicate a complex, multiscale relationship among 1/f noises arising from common sources, such as those arising from timing functions vs. those arising from autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions. Results also provide further evidence against the default hypothesis that 1/f noise in human timing is just the additive combination of processes throughout the brain and body. Our findings are better accommodated by theories of complexity matching that begin to formalize multiscale coordination as a foundation of human behavior.Neurosciences1.1 Normal a seemingly absurd or impossible concept, proposition, or theory that is often difficult to understand or explain, sometimes apparently self-contradictory, and yet ultimately correct or true. How is it possible, for example, that oxygen \"a toxic environmental poison\" could be also indispensable for life (Beckman and Ames Physiol Rev 78(2):547-81, 1998; Davies Biochem Soc Symp 61:1-31, 1995). How can French people apparently disregard the rule that high dietary intakes of cholesterol and saturated fats (e.g., cheese and pat\u00e9) will result in an early death from cardiovascular diseases (Renaud and de Lorgeril Lancet 339(8808):1523-6, 1992; Catalgol et al. al. Nat Med 22(12):1428-1438, 2016)?: the so-called, French Paradox. Doubtless, the truth is not a duality and epistemological bias probably generates apparently self-contradictory conclusions. Perhaps nowhere in biology are there so many apparently contradictory views, and even experimental results, affecting human physiology and pathology as in the fields of free radicals and oxidative stress, antioxidants, foods and drinks, and dietary recommendations; this is particularly true when issues such as disease-susceptibility or avoidance, \"healthspan,\" \"lifespan,\" and ageing are involved. Consider, for example, the apparently paradoxical observation that treatment with low doses of a substance that is toxic at high concentrations may actually induce transient adaptations that protect against a subsequent exposure to the same (or similar) toxin. This particular paradox is now mechanistically explained as \"Adaptive Homeostasis\" (Davies 2017); the non-damaging process by which an apparent toxicant can activate biological signal transduction pathways to increase expression of protective genes, by mechanisms that are completely different from those by which the same agent induces toxicity at high concentrations. In this review, we explore the influences and effects of paradoxes such as the Oxygen Paradox and the French Paradox on the etiology, progression, and outcomes of many of the major human age-related diseases, as well as the basic biological phenomenon of ageing itself.AgingGeneric health relevanceGood the PROMIS-29Craig, Dennis A2014-12-01ObjectivesHealth valuation studies enhance economic evaluations of treatments by estimating the value of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) includes a 29-item short-form HRQOL measure, the PROMIS-29.MethodsTo value PROMIS-29 responses on a quality-adjusted life-year scale, we conducted a national survey (N = 7557) using quota sampling based on the US 2010 Census. Based on 541 paired comparisons with over 350 responses each, pair-specific probabilities were incorporated into a weighted least-squared estimator.ResultsAll losses in HRQOL influenced choice; however, respondents valued losses in physical function, anxiety, depression, sleep, and pain more than those in fatigue and social functioning.ConclusionsThis article introduces a novel approach to valuing HRQOL for economic evaluations using paired comparisons and provides a tool to translate PROMIS-29 responses into quality-adjusted life-years.Health ServicesPain EconomicsHealth & Servicesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8zt2p7vvarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2x14v0vg2023-08-19T19:46:59Zqt2x14v0vgFormal representation of the SS-DB benchmark and experimental evaluation in EXTASCIDCheng, YuRusu, Florin2015-09-01Evaluating the performance of scientific data processing systems is a difficult task considering the plethora of application-specific solutions available in this landscape and the lack of a generally-accepted benchmark. The dual structure of scientific data coupled with the complex nature of processing complicate the evaluation procedure further. SS-DB is the first attempt to define a general benchmark for complex scientific processing over raw and derived data. It fails to draw sufficient attention though because of the ambiguous plain language specification and the extraordinary SciDB results. In this paper, we remedy the shortcomings of the original SS-DB specification by providing a formal representation in terms of ArrayQL algebra operators and ArrayQL/SciQL constructs. These are the first formal representations of the SS-DB benchmark. Starting from the formal representation, we give a reference implementation and present benchmark results in EXTASCID, a novel system for scientific data processing. EXTASCID is complete in providing native support both for array and relational data and extensible in executing any user code inside the system by the means of a configurable metaoperator. These features result in significant improvement over SciDB at data loading, extracting derived data, and operations over derived data. \u00a9 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2x14v0vgarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt74n936vh2023-08-19T19:23:17Zqt74n936vhLong-term genetic stability and a high-altitude East Asian origin for the peoples of the high valleys of the Himalayan arcJeong, ChoongwonOzga, the Himalayan arc from Arunachal Pradesh to Ladahk were among the last habitable places permanently colonized by prehistoric humans due to the challenges of resource scarcity, cold stress, and hypoxia. The modern populations of these valleys, who share cultural and linguistic affinities with peoples found today on the Tibetan plateau, are commonly assumed to be the descendants of the earliest inhabitants of the Himalayan arc. However, this assumption has been challenged by archaeological and osteological evidence suggesting that these valleys may have been originally populated from areas other than the Tibetan plateau, including those at low elevation. To investigate the peopling and early population history of this dynamic high-altitude contact zone, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes (20.8\u00d7-1,311.0\u00d7, mean 482.1\u00d7) of eight individuals dating to three periods with distinct material culture in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) of Nepal, spanning 3,150-1,250 y before present (yBP). We demonstrate that the region is characterized by long-term stability of the population genetic make-up despite marked changes in material culture. The ancient genomes, uniparental haplotypes, and high-altitude adaptive alleles suggest alkynes has been studied. Extensive double-labeling crossover studies have been conducted. While previous studies illustrated that phosphine- and N-heterocyclic carbene-derived catalysts exhibited differing behavior, the origin of these effects has now been evaluated in detail. Many variables, including ligand class, sterics of the ligand and alkyne, temperature, and ring size being formed in intramolecular versions, all influence the extent of crossover observed. A computational evaluation of these effects suggests that dimerization of a key metallacyclic intermediate provides the origin of crossover. Protocols that proceed with crossover are typically less efficient than those without crossover given the thermodynamic stability and low reactivity of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4k3466dnarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2sg5x6x12023-08-19T18:02:01Zqt2sg5x6x1Predicting Hand Washing and Sleep Hygiene Behaviors among College Students: Test of an Integrated Social-Cognition ModelZhang, Chun-QingFang, RongyuZhang, RuHagger, Martin SHamilton, Kyra2020-02-01Objective: Hand washing and sleep hygiene are two important health behaviors. The purpose of the current study was to identify the motivational and volitional antecedents of college students' hand washing and sleep hygiene behaviors based on an integrated model of behavior that combined social-cognition constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). Methods: Using a prospective design, college students (N = 1106) completed a survey assessing the motivational constructs of action self-efficacy, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intentions, and behaviors of hand washing and sleep hygiene at Time 1. Demographic variables were also collected. One month later, at Time 2, college students (N = 524) self-reported on their volitional factors of maintenance self-efficacy, action planning, coping planning, and behaviors of hand washing and sleep hygiene. A further 2 months later, at Time 3, college students (N = 297) were asked to self-report on their hand washing and sleep hygiene behaviors over the past month. Findings: Data were analyzed using variance-based structural equation modelling. Results showed significant direct effects of attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on intentions; significant direct effects of action self-efficacy on maintenance self-efficacy; and significant direct effects of maintenance self-efficacy on action planning and coping planning. Significant direct effects of intention on action planning (sleep hygiene only), and significant direct effects of intention, maintenance self-efficacy (hand washing only), action and coping planning on behavior were also observed. Action planning also moderated the intention-behavior relationship, but only for hand washing. There were also significant total indirect effects of action self-efficacy on behavior mediated by maintenance self-efficacy, action planning, and coping planning for both behaviors, and significant total indirect effects of subjective norm and perceived behavioral control on behavior mediated by intention for sleep hygiene. When past behavior was included in the integrated model predicting all the psychological variables and behavior, all of the structural relations were attenuated. Discussion: Current findings indicate that college students' hand washing and sleep hygiene behaviors are a function of both motivational and volitional factors. Findings also indicate that the TPB and HAPA pathways might differ for the two health behaviors. Implications of the current findings for future health interventions aimed at improving college students' hand washing and sleep hygiene are discussed.Behavioral and Social ScienceBasic Behavioral peopleToxicologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2sg5x6x1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8wj8t8j42023-08-19T17:45:30Zqt8wj8t8j4Mapping of snow water equivalent model assimilating snow observationsCui, GuotaoAnderson, MichaelBales, Roger2023-01-01To estimate snowpack water storage in mountain basins, this study presents a framework that couples a deep-learning long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a zonal bias-correction approach for assimilating ground snow observations. We explored the framework's ability for snow water equivalent (SWE) mapping and forecasting in a domain, including the Feather, Yuba-Bear, and American River basins in California's Sierra Nevada. Through a series of different modeling experiments, performances of the LSTM model and bias-correction approach were independently investigated. The LSTM model trained with meteorological forcing (precipitation and temperature), landscape attributes, and antecedent lagged snow conditions, showed good agreement with SWE reanalysis data (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.99). However, for continuous SWE projection without using SWE reanalysis as the antecedent snow condition, the LSTM model underestimated basin-scale and site-scale SWE (NSE = 0.19), reflecting large discrepancies since model bias accumulates over time. Thus, a zonal inverse-distance-weighting (IDW) bias-correction approach was proposed to assimilate ground observations and correct model trajectory. With the bias correction, SWE estimates were significantly improved (NSE = 0.79). The zonal IDW approach accounts for snow differences across different areas by zonal distance, based on historical snow patterns, showing better predictions than the original IDW, which showed larger biases in complex terrain with a rain shadow. We observed that SWE estimates from the framework were not sensitive to the difference in precipitation and temperature forcings between observation-based data and one-day-ahead weather forecasts, suggesting that the framework can use weather-forecast forcing for snowpack forecasting. Comparison between results from monthly and daily bias corrections showed that increasing bias-correction frequency and integrating more snow observations can further improve SWE estimates. Using the continuous SWE products, analyses of 170 precipitation events showed that snowmelt often occurred when daily temperature was above 3.7 \u00b0C, augmenting runoff. The proposed framework leverages ground observations and a deep-learning model to provide daily gridded snowpack estimates, which are important for runoff forecasting and water supply.Climate ActionSnowpackSnowmeltBias correctionInverse-distance weightLSTM modelEnvironmental EngineeringCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8wj8t8j4publicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6rn7s8s92023-08-19T17:43:29Zqt6rn7s8s9Changes in Fire Activity in Africa from 2002 to 2016 and Their Potential DriversZubkova, MariaBoschetti, LuigiAbatzoglou, John TGiglio, Louis2019-07-16While several studies have reported a recent decline in area burned in Africa, the causes of this decline are still not well understood. In this study, we found that from 2002 to 2016 burned area in Africa declined by 18.5%, with the strongest decline (80% of the area) in the Northern Hemisphere. One third of the reduction in burned area occurred in croplands, suggesting that changes in agricultural practices (including cropland expansion) are not the predominant factor behind recent changes in fire extent. Linear models that considered interannual variability in climate factors directly related to biomass productivity and aridity explained about 70% of the decline in burned area in natural land cover. Our results provide evidence that despite the fact that most fires are human-caused in Africa, increased terrestrial moisture during 2002-2016 facilitated declines in fire activity in Africa.Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6rn7s8s9articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0j9942hj2023-08-19T17:39:50Zqt0j9942hjNatural and managed watersheds show similar responses to recent climate changeFicklin, Darren LAbatzoglou, John TRobeson, Scott MNull, Sarah EKnouft, Jason H2018-08-21Changes in climate are driving an intensification of the hydrologic cycle and leading to alterations of natural streamflow regimes. Human disturbances such as dams, land-cover change, and water diversions are thought to obscure climate signals in hydrologic systems. As a result, most studies of changing hydroclimatic conditions are limited to areas with natural streamflow. Here, we compare trends in observed streamflow from natural and human-modified watersheds in the United States and Canada for the 1981-2015 water years to evaluate whether comparable responses to climate change are present in both systems. We find that patterns and magnitudes of trends in median daily streamflow, daily streamflow variability, and daily extremes in human-modified watersheds are similar to those from nearby natural watersheds. Streamflow in both systems show negative trends throughout the southern and western United States and positive trends throughout the northeastern United States, the northern Great Plains, and southern prairies of Canada. The trends in both natural and human-modified watersheds are linked to local trends in precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, demonstrating that water management and land-cover change have not substantially altered the effects of climate change on human-modified watersheds compared with nearby natural of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0j9942hjarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8127q52g2023-08-19T17:39:47Zqt8127q52gLarge contribution from anthropogenic warming to an emerging North American megadroughtWilliams, A ParkCook, southwestern North America (SWNA) motivates comparisons to medieval megadroughts and questions about the role of anthropogenic climate change. We use hydrological modeling and new 1200-year tree-ring reconstructions of summer soil moisture to demonstrate that the 2000-2018 SWNA drought was the second driest 19-year period since 800 CE, exceeded only by a late-1500s megadrought. The megadrought-like trajectory of 2000-2018 soil moisture was driven by natural variability superimposed on drying due to anthropogenic warming. Anthropogenic trends in temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation estimated from 31 climate models account for 47% (model interquartiles of 35 to 105%) of the 2000-2018 drought severity, pushing an otherwise moderate drought onto a trajectory comparable to the worst Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8127q52garticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6rx8s65z2023-08-19T17:39:37Zqt6rx8s65zHuman-started wildfires expand the fire niche across the United StatesBalch, Jennifer KBradley, Bethany AAbatzoglou, John TNagy, R ChelseaFusco, Emily JMahood, Adam L2017-03-14The economic and ecological costs of wildfire in the United States have risen substantially in recent decades. Although climate change has likely enabled a portion of the increase in wildfire activity, the direct role of people in increasing wildfire activity has been largely overlooked. We evaluate over 1.5 million government records of wildfires that had to be extinguished or managed by state or federal agencies from 1992 to 2012, and examined geographic and seasonal extents of human-ignited wildfires relative to lightning-ignited wildfires. Humans have vastly expanded the spatial and seasonal \"fire niche\" in the coterminous United States, accounting for 84% of all wildfires and 44% of total area burned. During the 21-y time period, the human-caused fire season was three times longer than the lightning-caused fire season and added an average of 40,000 wildfires per year across the United States. Human-started wildfires disproportionally occurred where fuel moisture was higher than lightning-started fires, thereby helping expand the geographic and seasonal niche of wildfire. Human-started wildfires were dominant (>80% of ignitions) in over 5.1 million km2, the vast majority of the United States, whereas lightning-started fires were dominant in only 0.7 million km2, primarily in sparsely populated areas of the mountainous western United States. Ignitions caused by human activities are a substantial driver of overall fire risk to ecosystems and economies. Actions to raise awareness and increase management in regions prone to human-started wildfires should be a focus of United States policy to reduce fire risk and associated hazards.GeographyHuman ActivitiesHumansSeasonsSpatio-Temporal organisms play critical roles in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes, including plant productivity, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Despite their importance, however, we have a limited understanding of how and why belowground biodiversity (bacteria, fungi, protists, and invertebrates) may change as soils develop over centuries to millennia (pedogenesis). Moreover, it is unclear whether belowground biodiversity changes during pedogenesis are similar to the patterns observed for aboveground plant diversity. Here we evaluated the roles of resource availability, nutrient stoichiometry, and soil abiotic factors in driving belowground biodiversity across 16 soil chronosequences (from centuries to millennia) spanning a wide range of globally distributed ecosystem types. Changes in belowground biodiversity during pedogenesis followed two main patterns. In lower-productivity ecosystems (i.e., drier and colder), increases in belowground biodiversity tracked increases in plant cover. In more productive ecosystems (i.e., wetter and warmer), increased acidification during pedogenesis was associated with declines in belowground biodiversity. Changes in the diversity of bacteria, fungi, protists, and invertebrates with pedogenesis were strongly and positively correlated worldwide, highlighting that belowground biodiversity shares similar ecological drivers as soils and ecosystems develop. In general, temporal changes in aboveground plant diversity and belowground biodiversity were not correlated, challenging the common perception that belowground biodiversity should follow similar patterns to those of plant diversity during ecosystem development. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that ecological patterns in belowground biodiversity are predictable across major globally distributed ecosystem types and suggest that shifts in plant cover and soil acidification during ecosystem development are associated with changes in belowground biodiversity over centuries to millennia.Life on LandBiodiversityModelsBiologicalsoil biodiversityecosystem developmentglobal scaleacidificationsoil chronosequencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of the extent to which contact with mineral surfaces affected the molecular integrity of a model protein, with an emphasis on identifying the mechanisms (hydrolysis, oxidation) and conditions leading to protein alteration. To this end, we studied the ability of four mineral surface archetypes (negatively charged, positively charged, neutral, redox-active) to abiotically fragment a well-characterized protein (GB1) as a function of pH and contact time. GB1 was exposed to the soil minerals montmorillonite, goethite, kaolinite, and birnessite at pH 5 and pH 7 for 1, 8, 24, and 168 h and the supernatant was screened for peptide fragments using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. To distinguish between products of oxidative and hydrolytic cleavage, we combined results from the SEQUEST algorithm, which identifies protein fragments that were cleaved hydrolytically, with the output of a deconvolution algorithm (DECON-Routine) designed to identify oxidation fragments. All four minerals were able to induce protein cleavage. Manganese oxide was effective at both hydrolytic and oxidative fact that phyllosilicates-which are not active-induced oxidative cleavage indicates that surfaces acted as catalysts and not as reactants. Our results extend previous observations of proteolytic capabilities in soil minerals to the groups of phyllosilicates and Fe-oxides. We identified structural regions of the protein with particularly high susceptibility to cleavage (loops and strands) as well as regions that were entirely unaffected ( helix).KaolinMineralsOxidation-ReductionProteolysisSoilEnvironmental Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0dp5386barticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8mc9m5692023-08-19T16:23:47Zqt8mc9m569Abiotic Protein Fragmentation by Manganese Oxide: Implications for a Mechanism to Supply Soil Markus2016-04-05The ability of plants and microorganisms to take up organic nitrogen in the form of free amino acids and oligopeptides has received increasing attention over the last two decades, yet the mechanisms for the formation of such compounds in soil environments remain poorly understood. We used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to distinguish the reaction of a model protein with a pedogenic oxide (Birnessite, MnO2) from its response to a phyllosilicate (Kaolinite). Our data demonstrate that birnessite fragments the model protein while kaolinite does not, resulting in soluble peptides that would be available to soil biota and confirming the existence of an abiotic pathway for the formation of organic nitrogen compounds for direct uptake by plants and microorganisms. The absence of reduced Mn(II) in the solution suggests that birnessite acts as a catalyst rather than an oxidant in this reaction. NMR and EPR spectroscopies are shown to be valuable tools to observe these reactions and capture the extent of protein transformation together with the extent of mineral response.Bacterial ProteinsBiotaElectron Spin Resonance of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8mc9m569articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt98g498bx2023-08-19T16:23:43Zqt98g498bxProtein-Mineral Interactions: Molecular Dynamics Simulations Capture Importance of Variations in Mineral Surface Composition and StructureAndersen, simulations, conventional and metadynamics, were performed to determine the interaction of model protein Gb1 over kaolinite (001), Na(+)-montmorillonite (001), Ca(2+)-montmorillonite (001), goethite (100), and Na(+)-birnessite (001) mineral surfaces. Gb1, a small (56 residue) protein with a well-characterized solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure and having -helix, 4-fold -sheet, and hydrophobic core features, is used as a model protein to study protein soil mineral interactions and gain insights on structural changes and potential degradation of protein. From our simulations, we observe little change to the hydrated Gb1 structure over the kaolinite, montmorillonite, and goethite surfaces relative to its solvated structure without these mineral surfaces present. Over the Na(+)-birnessite basal surface, however, the Gb1 structure is highly disturbed as a result of interaction with this birnessite surface. Unraveling of the Gb1 -sheet at specific turns and a partial unraveling of the -helix is observed over birnessite, which suggests specific vulnerable residue sites for oxidation or hydrolysis possibly leading to fragmentation.Chemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/98g498bxarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8827293v2023-08-19T16:05:35Zqt8827293vExcitations and benchmark ensemble density functional theory for two Zeng-HuiTrail, John RBurke, KieronNeeds, method for extracting ensemble Kohn-Sham potentials from accurate excited state densities is applied to a variety of two-electron systems, exploring the behavior of exact ensemble density functional theory. The issue of separating the Hartree energy and the choice of degenerate eigenstates is explored. A new approximation, spin eigenstate Hartree-exchange, is derived.

Cluster members are selected by a photometric-redshift criterion, and categorized as star-forming, quiescent, or intermediate according to their dust-corrected rest-frame colors and magnitudes. We employ a \"delayed-then-rapid\" quenching model that relates a simulated cluster mass accretion rate to the observed numbers of each type of galaxy in the cluster to constrain t Q. For galaxies of mass M 1010.5 M o, we find a quenching timescale of t Q = Gyr in the z 1.5 cluster sample, and Gyr at z 1. Using values drawn from the literature, we compare the redshift evolution of t Q to timescales predicted for different physical quenching mechanisms. We find t Q to depend on host halo mass such that quenching occurs over faster timescales in clusters relative to groups, suggesting that properties of the host halo are responsible for quenching high-mass galaxies. Between z = 0 and z = 1.5, we find that t Q evolves faster than the molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an estimated star formation rate-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of the dynamical time. This suggests that environmental quenching in these galaxies is driven by the motion of satellites relative to the cluster environment, although due to uncertainties in the atomic gas budget at high redshift, we cannot rule out quenching due to simple gas depletion.galaxies: clusters: generalgalaxies: Astrophysicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, crystals (NLCs) offer remarkable opportunities to direct colloids to form complex structures. The elastic energy field that dictates colloid interactions is determined by the NLC director field, which is sensitive to and can be controlled by boundaries including vessel walls and colloid surfaces. By molding the director field via liquid-crystal alignment on these surfaces, elastic energy landscapes can be defined to drive structure formation. We focus on colloids in otherwise defect-free director fields formed near undulating walls. Colloids can be driven along prescribed paths and directed to well-defined docking sites on such wavy boundaries. Colloids that impose strong alignment generate topologically required companion defects. Configurations for homeotropic colloids include a dipolar structure formed by the colloid and its companion hedgehog defect or a quadrupolar structure formed by the colloid and its companion Saturn ring. Adjacent to wavy walls with wavelengths larger than the colloid diameter, spherical particles are attracted to locations along the wall with distortions in the nematic director field that complement those from the colloid. This is the basis of lock-and-key interactions. Here, we study ellipsoidal colloids with homeotropic anchoring near complex undulating walls. The walls impose distortions that decay with distance from the wall to a uniform director in the far field. Ellipsoids form dipolar defect configurations with the colloid's major axis aligned with the far field director. Two distinct quadrupolar defect structures also form, stabilized by confinement; these include the Saturn I configuration with the ellipsoid's major axis aligned with the far field director and the Saturn II configuration with the major axis perpendicular to the far field director. The ellipsoid orientation varies only weakly in bulk and near undulating walls. All configurations are attracted to walls with long, shallow waves. However, for walls with wavelengths that are small compared to the colloid length, Saturn II is repelled, allowing selective docking of aligned objects. Deep, narrow wells prompt the insertion of a vertical ellipsoid. By introducing an opening at the bottom of such a deep well, we study colloids within pores that connect two domains. Ellipsoids with different aspect ratios find different equilibrium positions. An ellipsoid of the right dimension and aspect ratio can plug the pore, creating a class of 2D selective membranes.Chemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/98r4w903articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt90b8x9z52023-08-19T14:28:35Zqt90b8x9z5Colloids in confined liquid a in mechanismBoniello, GiuseppeLuo, YiminBeller, Daniel ASerra, FrancescaStebe, Kathleen J2019-07-14By confining soft materials within tailored boundaries it is possible to design energy landscapes to address and control colloidal dynamics. This provides unique opportunities to create reconfigurable, hierarchically organized structures, a leading challenge in materials science. Example soft matter systems include liquid crystals. For instance, when nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) are confined in a vessel with undulated boundaries, bend and splay distortions can be used to position particles. Here we confine this system in a twist cell. We also study cholesteric liquid crystals, which have an \"intrinsic\" twist distortion which adds to the ones imposed by the solid boundaries. The cholesteric pitch competes with the other length scales in the system (colloid radius, vessel thickness, wavelength of boundary undulations), enriching the possible configurations. Depending on the pitch-to-radius and pitch-to-thickness ratios the interaction can be attractive or repulsive. By tuning the pitch (i.e. changing the concentration of the chiral dopant), it is possible to selectively promote or inhibit particle trapping at the docking sites.Physical SciencesChemical SciencesEngineeringChemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/90b8x9z5articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt6sq1j7ss2023-08-19T14:22:43Zqt6sq1j7ssUnpacking the 'black HealthpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/6sq1j7ssarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8g26j7062023-08-19T14:05:43Zqt8g26j706Unpacking the 'black box' of lay studies have supported the effectiveness of the use of Lay Health Workers (LHWs) as an intervention model for managing chronic health conditions, yet few have documented the mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of the interventions.

This article examines how social relationships are central to meeting the complex demands of managing Type I and Type 2 diabetes across the life span. The social context of diabetes management includes multiple resources, including family (parents, spouses), peers, romantic partners, and health care providers. We discuss how these social resources change across the life span, focusing on childhood and adolescence, emerging adulthood, and adulthood and aging. We review how diabetes both affects and is affected by key social relationships at each developmental period. Despite high variability in how the social context is conceptualized and measured across studies, findings converge on the characteristics of social relationships that facilitate or undermine diabetes management across the life span. These characteristics are consistent with both Interpersonal Theory and Self-Determination Theory, 2 organizing frameworks that we utilize to explore social behaviors that are related to diabetes management. Involvement and support from one's social partners, particularly family members, is consistently associated with good diabetes outcomes when characterized by warmth, collaboration, and acceptance. Underinvolvement and interactions characterized by conflict and criticism are consistently associated with poor diabetes outcomes. Intrusive involvement that contains elements of social control may undermine diabetes management, particularly when it impinges on self-efficacy. Implications for future research directions and for interventions that promote the effective use of the social context to improve diabetes self-management are discussed.

We present hourly climate data to force land surface process models and assessments over the Merced and Tuolumne watersheds in the Sierra Nevada, California, for the water year 2010-2014 period. Climate data (38 stations) includes temperature and humidity (23), precipitation (13), solar radiation (8), and wind speed and direction (8) spanning an elevation range of 333 to 2987 m. Each data set contains raw data as obtained from the source (level 0), data that are serially continuous with noise and non-physical points removed (level 1), and, where possible, data that are gap-filled using linear interpolation or regression with a nearby station record (level 2). All stations chosen for this data set were known or documented to be regularly maintained and components checked and calibrated during the period. Additional time-series data included are available snow water equivalent records from automated stations (8) and manual snow courses (22), as well as distributed snow-depth and co-located soil-moisture measurements (2-6) from four locations spanning the rain-to-snow transition zone in the centre of the domain. Spatial data layers pertinent to snowpack modelling in this data set are basin polygons and 100-m resolution rasters of elevation, vegetation type, forest basal area, tree height, and forest canopy cover, transmissivity, and extinction coefficient.

A large representative sample was examined in 1998 (N = 2,464, MA 13.7), 1999/2000, and 2012 to reassess the outcome measures. At all ages, bullied participants showed more suicide ideation, self-harm, and suicide attempts, regardless of gender. Bullied females showed a decrease in suicide ideation from adolescence to adulthood, while bullied males showed an increase in suicide attempts in the same time period. Being bullied in adolescence strongly predicts suicidal behavior and self-harm. Preventive efforts might reduce the risk of later freedom in two-dimensional (2D) crystals recently emerged as a novel information carrier in addition to spin and charge. The intrinsic valley lifetime in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) is expected to be markedly long due to the unique spin-valley locking behavior, where the intervalley scattering of the electron simultaneously requires a large momentum transfer to the opposite valley and a flip of the electron spin. However, the experimentally observed valley lifetime in 2D TMDs has been limited to tens of nanoseconds thus far. We report efficient generation of microsecond-long-lived valley polarization in WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures by exploiting the ultrafast charge transfer processes in the heterostructure that efficiently creates resident holes in the WSe2 layer. These valley-polarized holes exhibit near-unity valley polarization and ultralong valley lifetime: We observe a valley-polarized hole population lifetime of more than 1 s and a valley depolarization lifetime (that is, intervalley scattering lifetime) of more than 40 s at 10 K. The near-perfect generation of valley-polarized holes in TMD heterostructures, combined with ultralong valley lifetime, which is orders of magnitude longer than previous results, opens up new opportunities for novel valleytronics and spintronics applications.cond-mat.mtrl-scicond-mat.mes-hallapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4h81w790articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1km436m72023-08-19T13:19:06Zqt1km436m7Imaging and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions.

We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field-free generation of a locked spin-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.General Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1km436m7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8hv093kt2023-08-19T13:13:39Zqt8hv093ktInterventions that target improvements in mental health for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders: A narrative reviewDa Paz, Nikko SWallander, Jan L2017-02-01Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) suggest that one in 68 children is affected. With convincing evidence that parenting a child with ASD is associated with elevated distress and mental health problems, researchers have begun to investigate treatments that directly target parents' psychological well-being. We conducted a narrative review of studies that empirically tested the effects of interventions targeting improvements in the mental health of parents of children with ASD. Following a range of search strategies, a total of 13 studies, seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six pre-post test designs, met inclusion criteria. We calculated and reported effect sizes for all RCTs. On average, treatment produced medium to large effect sizes with improvements in parenting stress and general health, and reductions in depression and anxiety. Interventions that appeared promising included: Stress Management and Relaxation Techniques, Expressive Writing, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. However, only one study conducted a follow-up assessment >3months post intervention. Study populations primarily consisted of English-speaking mothers, ages 39 to 42years. Conclusions were limited by small sample sizes, homogeneity of sample population, and reliance on self-report.

Weight status was classified from measured body mass index using standard criteria into nonobese and obese (27% in 5th grade). SES was indexed based on highest education attainment in the household.ResultsYouth in the highest SES had a significantly lower prevalence of obesity than those of lower SES at both 5th and 7th grades when disregarding race/ethnicity. Within-racial/ethnic group analyses mostly confirmed this pattern for Hispanic and White youth, but not for African American youth. When also considering gender, the SES differential in obesity risk was more pronounced among White girls and 5th-grade Hispanic boys.ConclusionGrowing up in a high SES home, marked by having a member with at least a college degree, is associated with lower risk for obesity among Hispanic and White youth. For African American youth, there appears to be no association between SES and obesity. Thus the health advantage generally attributed to higher SES does not appear consistently across racial/ethnic groups for obesity in youth. Further research should identify influences on weight status beyond SES, especially among African American youth.ObesityClinical ResearchNutritionPediatricPreventionAetiology2.3 Psychologicalsocial SciencesPublic Healthapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of HongqiaoDavies, Kelvin JAForman, Henry Jay2015-11-01Increasing oxidative stress, a major characteristic of aging, has been implicated in a variety of age-related pathologies. In aging, oxidant production from several sources is increased, whereas antioxidant enzymes, the primary lines of defense, are decreased. Repair systems, including the proteasomal degradation of damaged proteins, also decline. Importantly, the adaptive response to oxidative stress declines with aging. Nrf2/EpRE signaling regulates the basal and inducible expression of many antioxidant enzymes and the proteasome. Nrf2/EpRE activity is regulated at several levels, including transcription, posttranslation, and interactions with other proteins. This review summarizes current studies on age-related impairment of Nrf2/EpRE function and discusses the changes in Nrf2 regulatory mechanisms with aging.Aging1.1 Normal biological development University of Andreas JDick, Tobias PMurphy, Michael P2014-10-01Ageing and lifespan of organisms are determined by complicated interactions between their genetics and the environment, but the cellular mechanisms remain controversial. There have been a number of studies suggesting that cellular energy metabolism and free radical dynamics affect lifespan, implicating mitochondrial function. Recently, Shen et al. provided apparent mechanistic insight by reporting that mitochondrial oscillations of 'free radical production', 3-day old Caenorhabditis elegans correlated inversely with lifespan. The interpretation of 'mitoflashes' as 'bursts of superoxide' radicals assumes that circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein (cpYFP) is a reliable indicator of mitochondrial superoxide. This interpretation has been criticised because experiments and theoretical considerations both show that changes in cpYFP fluorescence are due to alterations in pH, not superoxide-. We now provide direct evidence that purified cpYFP is completely unresponsive to superoxide. Therefore 'mitoflashes' do not reflect superoxide generation and are not evidence for a link between mitochondrial free radical dynamics and lifespan.Aging1.1 Normal biological development and functioningUnderpinning researchGeneric health relevanceAnimalsCaenorhabditis elegansLongevityMaleMitochondriaSuperoxidesGeneral & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, AT1 blockade hyperglycemia by decreasing adipocyte inflammation of the renin-angiotensin system decreases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Chronic angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade (ARB) increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and decreases the abundance of large adipocytes and macrophage infiltration in adipose. However, the contributions of each tissue to the improvement in hyperglycemia in response to AT1 blockade are not known. Therefore, we determined the static and dynamic responses of soleus muscle, liver, and adipose to an acute glucose challenge following the chronic blockade of AT1. We measured adipocyte morphology along with TNF- expression, F4/80- and CD11c-positive cells in adipose and measured insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation and AKT phosphorylation in soleus muscle, liver, and retroperitoneal fat before (T0), 60 (T60) and 120 (T120) min after an acute glucose challenge in the following groups of male rats: 1) Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF; n = 7 or 8/time point), and 3) OLETF + ARB (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan/kg/day; n = 7 or 8/time point). AT1 blockade decreased adipocyte TNF- expression and at T60, IR phosphorylation was 155% greater in ARB than in OLETF. Furthermore, in retroperitoneal fat AT1 blockade increased glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) protein expression in ARB compared with OLETF. IR phosphorylation and AKT phosphorylation were not altered in the liver of OLETF, but AT1 blockade decreased hepatic Pck1 and G6pc1 mRNA expressions. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic AT1 blockade improves obesity-associated hyperglycemia in OLETF rats by improving adipocyte function and by decreasing hepatic glucose production via gluconeogenesis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system increases adipocyte inflammation contributing to the impairment in adipocyte function and increases hepatic Pck1 and G6pc1 mRNA expression in response to a glucose challenge. Ultimately, these effects may contribute to the development of glucose intolerance.DiabetesDigestive DiseasesLiver DiseaseObesityNutrition2.1 Biological and endogenous GiuseppeSerra, FrancescaStebe, Kathleen J2018-01-01The ability to dictate the motion of microscopic objects is an important challenge in fields ranging from materials science to biology. Field-directed assembly drives microparticles along paths defined by energy gradients. Nematic liquid crystals, consisting of rod-like molecules, provide new opportunities in this domain. Deviations of nematic liquid crystal molecules from uniform orientation cost elastic energy, and such deviations can be molded by bounding vessel shape. Here, by placing a wavy wall in a nematic liquid crystal, we impose alternating splay and bend distortions, and define a smoothly varying elastic energy field. A microparticle in this field displays a rich set of behaviors, as this system has multiple stable states, repulsive and attractive loci, and interaction strengths that can be tuned to allow reconfigurable states. Microparticles can transition between defect configurations, move along distinct paths, and select sites for preferred docking. Such tailored landscapes have promise in reconfigurable systems and in microrobotics applications.cond-mat.softapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0jp3p9wvarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5cv9b3vb2023-08-19T12:36:18Zqt5cv9b3vbOxylipin responses to fasting and insulin infusion in a large mammalian model of fasting-induced insulin resistance, the northern elephant sealWright, Dana postweaning fast of northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) pups is characterized by a reliance on lipid metabolism and reversible, fasting-induced insulin resistance, providing a unique model to examine the effects of insulin on lipid metabolism. We have previously shown that acute insulin infusion induced a shift in fatty acid metabolism dependent on fasting duration. This study complements the previous study by examining the effects of fasting duration and insulin infusion on circulating levels of oxylipins, bioactive metabolites derived from the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Northern elephant seal pups were studied at two postweaning periods (n = 5/period): early fasting (1-2 wk postweaning; \u00b1 late fasting (6-7 wk postweaning; 93 \u00b1 4 kg). Different cohorts of pups were weighed, sedated, and infused with 65 mU/kg of insulin. Plasma was collected prior to infusion (T0) and at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min postinfusion. A profile of 80 oxylipins was analyzed by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Nine oxylipins changed between early and late fasting and eight were altered in response to insulin infusion. Fasting decreased prostaglandin F2 (PGF2) and increased 14,15-dihydroxyicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DiHETrE), 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), and 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDoHE) (P < 0.03) in T0 samples, whereas insulin infusion resulted in an inverse change in area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels in these same metabolites (P < 0.05). In addition, 12-12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE) and 12-HETE decreased with fasting and insulin infusion, respectively (P < 0.04). The oxylipins altered during fasting and in response to insulin infusion may contribute to the manifestation of insulin resistance and participate in the metabolic regulation of associated decompositionAllison, Steven DChacon, Stephany SGerman, P2014-12-01Soil organic chemically heterogeneous, and microbial decomposers face a physiological challenge in metabolizing the diverse array of compounds present in soil. Different classes of polymeric compounds may require specialized enzymatic pathways for degradation, each of which requires an investment of microbial resources. Here we tested the resource allocation hypothesis, which posits that decomposition rates should increase once substrate concentrations are sufficient to overcome biochemical investment costs. We also tested the alternative hypothesis that mixing different substrates increases resource acquisition through priming effects involving generalist enzymes. Using a microcosm approach, we varied the soil concentration of seven distinct substrates individually and in mixture. We found that the percent carbon respired from starch, cellulose, chitin, and the mixture was significantly reduced at the lowest substrate concentration. The activities of -glucosidase and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase that target cellulose and chitin, respectively, were also significantly lower at the lowest concentrations of their target substrates. However, we did not observe parallel declines in enzyme activity with starch or the mixture. Some enzymes, such as -xylosidase, were consistent with specialist strategies because they showed the highest activity in the presence of their target substrate. Other enzymes were more generalist, with activity observed across multiple substrates. Together, these results suggest that the costs of biochemical machinery limit microbial decomposition of substrates at low concentration. The presence of enzymes with low substrate specificity was not sufficient to overcome this constraint for some substrates. Concentration constraints driven by microbial allocation patterns may be common in mineral soil and could be represented in new biogeochemical models Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0gc3k1ztpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt12t3x2sd2023-08-19T12:25:17Zqt12t3x2sdGrowing convergence research: Coproducing climate projections to inform proactive decisions for managing simultaneous wildfire riskCullen, Alison CPrichard, apply a convergence research approach to the urgent need for proactive management of long-term risk associated with wildfire in the United States. In this work we define convergence research in accordance with the US National Science Foundation-as a means of addressing a specific and compelling societal problem for which solutions require deep integration across disciplines and engagement of stakeholders. Our research team brings expertise in climate science, fire science, landscape ecology, and decision science to address the risk from simultaneous and impactful fires that compete for management resources, and leverages climate projections for decision support. In order to make progress toward convergence our team bridges spatial and temporal scale divides arising from differences in disciplinary and practice-based norms. We partner with stakeholders representing US governmental, tribal, and local decision contexts to coproduce a robust information base for support of decision making about wildfire preparedness and proactive land/fire management. Our approach ensures that coproduced information will be directly integrated into existing tools for application in operations and policy making. Coproduced visualizations and decision support information provide projections of the change in expected number of fires that compete for resources, the number of fire danger days per year relative to prior norms, and changes in the length and overlap of fire season in multiple US regions. Continuing phases of this work have been initiated both by stakeholder communities and by our research team, a demonstration of impact and value.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceBehavioral and Social ScienceClimate Actionconvergence researchcoproductionwildfire risk and Security GLP-1 and Daniel EOrtiz, Rudy M2021-04-01The postweaning fast of northern elephant seal pups is characterized by a lipid-dependent metabolism and associated with a decrease in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), insulin, and glucose and increased gluconeogenesis (GNG) and ketogenesis. We have also demonstrated that exogenous GLP-1 infusion increased plasma insulin despite simultaneous increases in cortisol and glucagon, which collectively present contradictory regulatory stimuli of GNG, ketogenesis, and glycolysis. To assess the effects of GLP-1 on metabolism using primary carbon metabolite profiles in late-fasted seal pups, we dose-dependently infused late-fasted seals with low (LDG; 10 pM/kg; n = 3) or high (HDG; 100 pM/kg; n = 4) GLP-1 immediately following a glucose bolus (0.5 g/kg), using glucose without GLP-1 as control (n = 5). Infusions were performed in similarly aged animals 6-8 wk into their postweaning fast. The plasma metabolome was measured from samples collected at five time points just prior to and during the infusions, and network maps constructed to robustly evaluate the effects of GLP-1 on primary carbon metabolism. HDG increased key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate and acetoacetate (P < 0.05) suggesting that elevated levels of GLP-1 promote glycolysis and suppress GNG and ketogenesis, which collectively increase glucose clearance. These GLP-1-mediated effects on cellular metabolism help to explain why plasma GLP-1 concentrations decrease naturally in fasting pups as an evolved mechanism to help conserve glucose during the late-fasting of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8qm1t6rkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8dq2m4h02023-08-19T10:28:34Zqt8dq2m4h0Carbon control on terrestrial ecosystem function across contrasting site productivities: the carbon connection revisitedDove, Nicholas CStark, John MNewman, Gregory SHart, Stephen C2019-07-01Understanding how altered soil organic carbon (SOC) availability affects microbial communities and their function is imperative in predicting impacts of global change on soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem function. However, the response of soil microbial communities and their function to depleted C availability in situ is unclear. We evaluated the role of soil C inputs in controlling microbial biomass, community composition, physiology, and function by (1) experimentally excluding plant C inputs in situ for 9 yr in four temperate forest ecosystems along a productivity gradient in Oregon, USA; and (2) integrating these findings with published data from similar C-exclusion studies into a global meta-analysis. Excluding plant C inputs for 9 yr resulted in a 13% decrease in SOC across the four Oregon sites and an overall shift in the microbial community composition, with a 45% decrease in the fungal : bacterial ratio and a 13% increase in Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio. Although gross N mineralization decreased under C exclusion, decreases in gross N immobilization were greater, resulting in increased net N mineralization rates in all but the lowest-productivity site. Microbial biomass showed a variable response to C exclusion that was method dependent; however, we detected a 29% decrease in C-use efficiency across the sites, with greater declines occurring in less-productive sites. Although extracellular enzyme activity increased with C exclusion, C exclusion resulted in a 31% decrease in microbial respiration across all sites. Our meta-analyses of published data with similar C-exclusion treatments were largely consistent with our experimental results, showing decreased SOC, fungal : bacterial ratios, and microbial respiration, and increased Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio following exclusion of C inputs to soil. Effect sizes of SOC and respiration correlated negatively with the duration of C exclusion; however, there were immediate effects of C exclusion on microbial community composition and biomass that were unaltered by duration of treatment. Our field-based experimental results and analyses demonstrate unequivocally the dominant control of C availability on soil microbial biomass, community composition, and function, and provide additional insight into the mechanisms for these effects in forest ecosystems.Life on LandAffordable and University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8dq2m4h0articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt87x2s3bq2023-08-19T10:04:35Zqt87x2s3bqSingle Molecule Profiling of Molecular Recognition at a Model Electrochemical BiosensorGu, QufeiNanney, WarrenCao, Huan HWang, HaiyangYe, Tao2018-10-31The spatial arrangement of target and probe molecules on the biosensor is a key aspect of the biointerface structure that ultimately determines the properties of interfacial molecular recognition and the performance of the biosensor. However, the spatial patterns of single molecules on practical biosensors have been unknown, making it difficult to rationally engineer biosensors. Here, we have used high-resolution atomic force microscopy to map closely spaced individual probes as well as discrete hybridization events on a functioning electrochemical DNA sensor surface. We also applied spatial statistical methods to characterize the spatial patterns at the single molecule level. We observed the emergence of heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns of surface hybridization of hairpin probes. The clustering of target capture suggests that hybridization may be enhanced by proximity of probes and targets that are about 10 nm away. The unexpected enhancement was rationalized by the complex interplay between the nanoscale spatial organization of probe molecules, the conformational changes of the probe molecules, and target binding. Such molecular level knowledge may allow one to tailor the spatial patterns of the biosensor surfaces to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility.NanotechnologyBioengineeringBiotechnology1.1 Normal biological for two ancient bacterial symbionts with differentially degraded (Hemiptera) bacterial symbionts for nutrition absent in their diets. These bacteria experience extreme genome reduction and require genetic resources from their hosts, particularly for basic cellular processes other than nutrition synthesis. The host-derived mechanisms that complete these processes have remained poorly understood. It is also unclear how hosts meet the distinct needs of multiple bacterial partners with differentially degraded genomes. To address these questions, we investigated the cell-specific gene-expression patterns in the symbiotic organs of the aster (ALF), Macrosteles quadrilineatus (Cicadellidae). ALF harbors two intracellular symbionts that have two of the smallest known bacterial genomes: Nasuia (112 kb) and Sulcia (190 kb). Symbionts are segregated into distinct host cell types (bacteriocytes) and vary widely in their basic cellular capabilities. ALF differentially expresses thousands of genes between the bacteriocyte types to meet the functional needs of each symbiont, including the provisioning of metabolites and support of cellular processes. For example, the host highly expresses genes in the bacteriocytes that likely complement gene losses in nucleic acid synthesis, DNA repair mechanisms, transcription, and translation. Such genes are required to function in the bacterial cytosol. Many host genes comprising these support mechanisms are derived from the evolution of novel functional traits via horizontally transferred genes, reassigned mitochondrial support genes, and gene duplications with bacteriocyte-specific expression. Comparison across other hemipteran lineages reveals that hosts generally support the incomplete symbiont cellular processes, but the origins of these support mechanisms are generally specific to the host-symbiont system.BiotechnologyGenetics2.2 Factors relating to Ganoderma lucidum is used as a dietary supplement and health tonic, but whether it affects longevity remains unclear. We show here that a water extract of G. lucidum mycelium extends lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The G. lucidum extract reduces the level of fibrillarin (FIB-1), a nucleolar protein that correlates inversely with longevity in various organisms. Furthermore, G. lucidum treatment increases expression of the autophagosomal protein marker LGG-1, and lifespan extension is abrogated in mutant C. elegans strains that lack atg-18, daf-16, or sir-2.1, indicating that autophagy and stress resistance pathways are required to extend lifespan. In cultured human cells, G. lucidum increases concentrations of the LGG-1 ortholog LC3 and reduces levels of phosphorylated mTOR, a known inhibitor of autophagy. Notably, low molecular weight compounds (<10 kDa) isolated from the G. lucidum water extract prolong lifespan of C. elegans and the same compounds induce autophagy in human cells. These results suggest that G. lucidum can increase longevity by inducing autophagy and stress resistance.Complementary and Integrative Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9g3115sfarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt54p6v1bf2023-08-19T09:26:11Zqt54p6v1bfDevelopmental Processes Associated With Longitudinal Declines in Parental Responsibility and Adherence to Type 1 Diabetes Management Across AdolescenceWiebe, Deborah JChow, changes in pubertal status and self-efficacy for diabetes management are associated with longitudinal declines in parental responsibility for diabetes, and to determine whether these factors moderate associations between declining parental responsibility and deteriorating adherence across adolescence.MethodsAdolescents (N = 252; 53.6% females) with type 1 diabetes, mothers, and 188 fathers participated in a 2.5-year longitudinal study. Self-reports of pubertal status, adolescent efficacy, parental responsibility, and adherence were completed every 6 months (6 time points).ResultsLatent growth curve modeling revealed that longitudinal increases in efficacy and pubertal maturation were uniquely associated with longitudinal declines in parental responsibility. Declines in parental responsibility were related to deterioration in adherence especially when adolescents did not report concomitant growth in self-efficacy.ConclusionsTransfer of responsibility for diabetes management across adolescence may be more optimal when adolescents' increased independence is titrated to their changing self-efficacy beliefs.DiabetesBehavioral and Social SciencePreventionPediatric7.1 Individual of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/54p6v1bfarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt88d777r52023-08-19T09:22:19Zqt88d777r5Building flux capacity: Citizen scientists increase resolution of soil citizen science programs have been broadly successful in diverse scientific fields, their adoption has lagged in some disciplines, including soil science and ecosystem ecology. Collaborations with citizen scientists may be viewed as a conundrum in these disciplines, which often require substantial labor and technical experience; citizen scientists could improve sampling capacity but may reduce sample quality or require training and oversight prior to and while performing specialized tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating citizen scientists into soil biogeochemistry research, we conducted a proof-of-concept study in high-elevation meadows of the Sierra Nevada in California. A collaboration between university researchers and citizen scientists allowed us to assess spatial and diel patterns of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes with an intensity and frequency that would otherwise be beyond the capacity of a typical research laboratory. This collaboration with citizen scientists increased our sampling intensity by over 700% while only doubling the sampling error relative to that of full-time researchers. With training and support from project scientists, citizen scientists collected data that demonstrate spatial independence of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at scales between 1 m and 175 m. Additionally, we found a lack of temporal variation over a 24-h period for all three GHGs. Citizen scientists participating in this one-day event reported levels of satisfaction commensurate with longer-term, immersive campaigns. The place-based event also proved an effective tool for teaching intangible concepts of soil biogeochemistry and promoting local conservation. Despite perceived barriers to entry, this study demonstrates the mutual benefits of citizen science collaborations in soil science and ecosystem ecology, encouraging adoption by disciplines that have been slow to take advantage of such collaborations. Short-term, local citizen science events can provide meaningful experiences for area residents and teach global biogeochemical cycles identification of the evolution of conducting nano-filaments in TiO2 thin film ReRAMSong, Cheol Seong2013-01-01Unipolar resistance switching (RS) in TiO2 thin films originates from the repeated formation and rupture of the Magn\u00e9li phase conducting filaments through repeated nano-scale phase transitions. By applying the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) type kinetic model to the careful analysis on the evolution of transient current in a pulse-switching, it was possible to elucidate the material specific evolution of the Magn\u00e9li phase filament. This methodology was applied to the two types of TiO2 films grown by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) and sputtering. These two samples have structurally and electrically distinctive properties: PEALD film exhibited high variability in switching parameters and required an electroforming while sputtered film showed higher uniformity without distinct electroforming process. The JMA-type kinetic analysis of the RS behaviors revealed that the rejuvenation of the filament is accomplished by repeated one-dimensional nucleation followed by a two-dimensional growth in PEALD samples, whereas one-dimensional nucleation-free mechanism dominates in sputtered films.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c220480articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt28z0t6sw2023-08-19T09:07:49Zqt28z0t6swStress at work: Differential experiences of high versus low SES workersDamaske, SarahZawadzki, Matthew JSmyth, Joshua M2016-05-01This paper asks whether workers with higher socioeconomic status (SES) experience different levels of stress at work than workers with lower SES and, if so, what might explain these differences. We collected innovative assessments of immediate objective and subjective measures of stress at multiple time points across consecutive days from 122 employed men and women. We find that in comparison to higher SES individuals, those with lower SES reported greater happiness at work, less self-reported stress, and less perceived stress; cortisol, a biological marker of stress, was unrelated to SES. Worker's momentary perceptions of the workplace were predicted by SES, with higher SES individuals more commonly reporting feeling unable to meet work demands, fewer work resources, and less positive work appraisals. In turn, perceptions of the workplace had a generally consistent and robust effect on positive mood, subjective stress, and cortisol.Behavioral and Social ScienceBasic Human SocietyPublic Healthapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/28z0t6swpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5sp6d74s2023-08-19T08:55:45Zqt5sp6d74sCombined Experimental and Simulation Study of Amplitude Modulation Atomic used to measure surface properties at the nanoscale. However, interpretation of measurements from amplitude modulation AFM (AM-AFM) in liquid is not straightforward due to the interactions between the AFM tip, the surface being imaged, and the water. In this work, amplitude-distance measurements and molecular dynamics simulations of AM-AFM were employed to study the effect of surface chemistry on the amplitude of tip oscillation in water. The sample surfaces consisted of self-assembled monolayers where the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity was determined by the terminal group of the alkanethiols. Analysis showed that surface chemical composition influences the hydration structure near the interface which affects the forces experienced by the tip and in turn changes the amplitude profile. This observation could aid our understanding of AM-AFM measurements of interfacial phenomena on various surfaces in water.Chemical Physicsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5sp6d74sarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt37v6q4162023-08-19T07:36:15Zqt37v6q416All-optical switching of nematic liquid crystal films driven by for reversible in-plane and out-of-plane switching of nematic liquid crystal molecules in few micron thick films. Our method leverages the highly localized electric fields (\"hot spots\") and plasmonic heating that are generated in the near-field region of densely packed gold nanoparticle layers optically excited on-resonance with the localized surface plasmon absorption. Using polarized microscopy and transmission measurements, we observe this switching from homeotropic to planar over a temperature range starting at room temperature to just below the isotropic transition, and at on-resonance excitation intensity less than 0.03 W/cm(2). In addition, we controllably vary the in-plane directionality of the liquid crystal molecules in the planar state by altering the linear polarization of the incident excitation.

Increasing evidence suggests that enrichment of neuroendocrine (NE) cells is associated with CRPC. Here, combined RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis reveals that REST is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness acquisition in NE differentiated prostate cancer (PCa) cells via direct transcriptional repression of Twist1 and CD44. Specifically we show that short-term knockdown of REST induces NE differentiation of LNCaP cells. Long-term REST knockdown enhanced the expression of Twist1 and CD44, cell migration and sphere formation. Overexpression of REST in hormone-refractory CWR22Rv1 PCa cells significantly reduces Twist1 and CD44 expression, cell migration and sphere formation. Collectively, our study uncovers REST in regulating EMT and stemness properties of NE PCa cells and suggests that REST is a potential therapeutic target for CRPC.Human GenomeGeneticsProstate CancerUrologic soil nitrogen dynamicsBerhe, Asmeret AsefawTorn, Margaret S2017-01-01In recent years, the role of soil erosion on terrestrial carbon sequestration had been the focus of a growing number of studies. However, relatively little attention has been paid so far to the role of erosion on the lateral distribution of soil nitrogen (N) and the role of geomorphic processes on soil N dynamics. Here, we present primary data on the stock of nitrogen in soil and its rate of erosion at a relatively undisturbed, zero-order watershed in northern California. Erosion transports 0.26-0.47 g N m2 year1 from eroding slope positions (Summit and Slope), and about two-thirds of the eroded N enters depositional landform positions (Hollow and Plain). Our results show that depositional-position soil profiles contain up to 3 times more N than soil profiles in the eroding positions. More than 92% of all soil nitrogen was chemically bound to soil minerals in all the landform positions, compared to 2-4% each found in the free light and occluded light fractions. Nitrogen associated with the free light fraction in topsoil is particularly susceptible to loss by soil erosion. By comparison, soil N associated with the aggregate-protected occluded light fractions and the mineral-associated dense fractions is likely to be protected from gaseous and dissolved losses. On average, we found that soil N has mean residence time of 694 years in eroding landform positions, compared to 2951 years in depositional landform positions. Our results also show that microbial processing of organic matter exerts strong control on overall soil N storage and N stabilized through sorptive interactions with soil minerals only in poorly drained depositional landform positions. Soil erosion exerts important control on stock, distribution, and long-term fate of soil N in dynamic landscapes.Life on LandSoil erosionSoil nitrogenSoil organic matterCoupled C ManagementAgronomy & Agricultureapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/37q9x48warticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt98w1s34n2023-08-19T06:02:14Zqt98w1s34nOestrogeninduced angiogenesis promotes adenomyosis characterized by the invasion of endometrial epithelial cells into the myometrium of uterus, and angiogenesis is thought to be required for the implantation of endometrial glandular tissues during the adenomyotic pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that compared with eutopic endometria, adenomyotic lesions exhibited increased vascularity as detected by sonography. Microscopically, the lesions also exhibited an oestrogen-associated elevation of microvascular density and VEGF expression in endometrial epithelial cells. We previously reported that oestrogen-induced Slug expression was critical for endometrial epithelial-mesenchymal transition and development of adenomyosis. Our present studies demonstrated that estradiol (E2) elicited a Slug-VEGF axis in endometrial epithelial cells, and also induced pro-angiogenic activity in vascular endothelial cells. The antagonizing agents against E2 or VEGF suppressed endothelial cells migration and tubal formation. Animal experiments furthermore confirmed that blockage of E2 or VEGF was efficient to attenuate the implantation of adenomyotic lesions. These results highlight the importance of oestrogen-induced angiogenesis in adenomyosis development and provide a potential strategy for treating adenomyosis through intercepting the E2-Slug-VEGF pathway.2.1 Biologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/98w1s34narticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt476393hp2023-08-19T06:01:57Zqt476393hpHydroxychloroquine facilitates autophagosome formation but not degradation to suppress the proliferation of cervical cancer SiHa that inhibits autophagy due to lysosomal acidification, and subsequently blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes which leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes that may accelerate tumor cell death. Given these hypothesis the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HCQ in the inhibition of autophagy and the induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer SiHa cells. Cervical cancer SiHa cells were cultured with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) as positive control of autophagy or treated with HCQ as part of the experimental groups. LC3 and P62/SQSTM1 were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting, respectively in order to evaluate initially autophagosome formation and their degradation. Specific green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 was subsequently detected by fluorescence microscopy in order to confirm the formation of autophagosomes. MTT and flow cytometry were adopted respectively to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of the SiHa cells. miRNA-9* was also investigated. The results demonstrated that HCQ increased the expressions of LC3 mRNA and LC3II protein and GFP-LC3 signalling but reduced the expression of p62/STSQM1 in cervical cancer SiHa cells. These results indicated HCQ has the ability to inhibit autophagy as incapable of degrading the autophagosome. However, HCQ may promote SiHa cell apoptosis apoptotic assay and miRNA-9* results revealed. HCQ has the ability to inhibit autophagy by blocking the degradation of autophagosomes and subsequently facilitates the apoptosis of cervical cancer SiHa cells.Cancer1.1 Normal biological development and functioningUnderpinning researchapoptosisautophagycervical cancerhydroxychloroquineapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/476393hparticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt72j404r82023-08-19T05:49:41Zqt72j404r8The Rise of Valley Fever: Prevalence and Cost Burden a fungal infection endemic in the southwestern United States (US). In California, CM incidence increased more than 213% (from 6.0/100,000 (2014) to 18.8/100,000 (2017)) and continues to increase as rates in the first half of 2018 are double that of 2017 during the same period. This cost-of-illness study provides essential information to be used in health planning and funding as CM infections continue to surge. We used a \"bottom-up\" approach to determine lifetime costs of 2017 reported incident CM cases in California. We defined CM natural history and used a societal approach to determine direct and discounted indirect costs using literature, national datasets, and expert interviews. The total lifetime cost burden of CM cases reported in 2017 in California is just under $700 million US dollars, with $429 million in direct costs and $271 million in indirect costs. Per person direct costs were highest for disseminated disease ($1,023,730), while per person direct costs were lowest for uncomplicated CM pneumonia ($22,039). Cost burden varied by county. This is the first study to estimate total costs of CM, demonstrating its huge cost burden for California.Infectious DiseasesComparative Effectiveness ResearchBurden of IllnessEmerging Infectious Diseases2.4 of kaolinite and birnessite to protect surface ManuelLiu, Suet YiAhmed, MusahidKleber, Markus2018-04-01It is widely accepted that soil organic carbon cycling depends on the presence and catalytic functionality of extracellular enzymes. Recent reports suggest that combusted and autoclaved soils may have the capacity to degrade organic test substrates to a larger extent than the living, enzyme-bearing soils. In search of the underlying mechanisms, we adsorbed Beta-Glucosidase (BG) and Bovine and the manganese oxide birnessite at pH 5 and pH 7. The protein-mineral samples were then subjected to gradual energy inputs of a magnitude equivalent to naturally occurring wildfire events. The abundance and molecular masses of desorbed organic compounds were recorded after ionization with tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet radiation (VUV). The mechanisms controlling the fate of proteins varied with mineralogy. Kaolinite adsorbed protein largely through hydrophobic interactions and, even at large energy inputs, produced negligible amounts of desorption fragments compared to birnessite. Acid birnessite adsorbed protein through coulombic forces at low energy levels, became a hydrolyzing catalyst at low energies and low pH, and eventually turned into a reactant involving disintegration of both mineral and protein at higher energy inputs. Fragmentation of proteins was energy dependent and did not occur below an energy threshold of 0.20 MW cm2. Neither signal abundance nor signal intensity were a function of protein size. Above the energy threshold value, BG that had been adsorbed to birnessite at pH 7 showed an increase in signal abundance with increasing energy applications. Signal intensities differed with adsorption pH for BSA but only at the highest energy level applied. Our results indicate that proteins adsorbed to kaolinite may remain intact after exposure to such energy inputs as can be expected to occur in natural ecosystems. Protein fragmentation and concomitant loss of functionality must be expected in surface soils replete with pedogenic manganese oxides. We conclude that minerals can do both: protect enzymes at high energy intensities in the case of kaolinite and, in the case of birnessite, substitute for and even exceed the oxidative functionality that may have been lost when unprotected oxidative enzymes were denatured at high chimpanzees integrate sensory are keystone resources that sustain chimpanzees when preferred fruits are scarce. Many figs retain a green(ish) colour throughout development, a pattern that causes chimpanzees to evaluate edibility on the basis of achromatic accessory cues. Such behaviour is conspicuous because it entails a succession of discrete sensory assessments, including the deliberate palpation of individual figs, a task that requires advanced visuomotor control. These actions are strongly suggestive of domain-specific information processing and decision-making, and they call attention to a potential selective force on the origin of advanced manual prehension and digital dexterity during primate evolution. To explore this concept, we report on the foraging behaviours of chimpanzees and the spectral, chemical and mechanical properties of figs, with cutting tests revealing ease of fracture in the mouth. By integrating the ability of different sensory cues to predict fructose content in a Bayesian updating framework, we quantified the amount of information gained when a chimpanzee successively observes, palpates and bites the green figs of Ficus sansibarica. We found that the cue eliciting ingestion was not colour or size, but fig mechanics (including toughness estimates from wedge tests), which relays higher-quality information on fructose concentrations than colour vision. This result explains why chimpanzees evaluate green figs by palpation and dental incision, actions that could explain the adaptive origins of advanced manual prehension.Pan troglodytes schweinfurthiiFicuscolour Biofilm frequently associated with catheter-based infections because of its ability to form resilient biofilms. Prior studies have shown that the transcription factor Bcr1 governs biofilm formation in an in vitro catheter model. However, the mechanistic role of the Bcr1 pathway and its relationship to biofilm formation in vivo are unknown. Our studies of biofilm formation in vitro indicate that the surface protein Als3, a known adhesin, is a key target under Bcr1 control. We show that an als3/als3 mutant is biofilm-defective in vitro, and that ALS3 overexpression rescues the biofilm defect of the bcr1/bcr1 mutant. We extend these findings with an in vivo venous catheter model. The bcr1/bcr1 mutant is unable to populate the catheter surface, though its virulence suggests that it has no growth defect in vivo. ALS3 overexpression rescues the bcr1/bcr1 biofilm defect in vivo, thus arguing that Als3 is a pivotal Bcr1 target in this setting. Surprisingly, the als3/als3 mutant forms a biofilm in vivo, and we suggest that additional Bcr1 targets compensate for the Als3 defect in vivo. Indeed, overexpression of Bcr1 targets ALS1, and HWP1 partially restores biofilm formation in a bcr1/bcr1 mutant background in vitro, though these genes are not required for biofilm formation in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that the Bcr1 pathway functions in vivo to promote biofilm formation, and that Als3-mediated adherence is a fundamental property under Bcr1 control. Known adhesins Als1 and Hwp1 also contribute to biofilm formation, as does the novel protein Ece1.Infectious Diseases2.1 Biological and endogenous factorsAetiology2.2 of bad scienceSmaldino, Paul EMcElreath, Richard2016-09-01Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing-no deliberate cheating nor loafing-by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more 'progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.Generic health relevancemetasciencecultural evolutionstatistical powerreplicationincentivesCampbell's intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The p65 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are strongly induced by IFN-. We studied the behavior of murine GBP1 (mGBP1) upon infection with T. gondii in vitro and confirmed that IFN--dependent re-localization of mGBP1 to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) correlates with the virulence type of the parasite. We identified three parasitic factors, ROP16, ROP18, and GRA15 that determine strain-specific accumulation of mGBP1 on the PV. These highly polymorphic proteins are held responsible for a large part of the strain-specific differences in virulence. Therefore, our data suggest that virulence of T. gondii in animals may rely in part on recognition by GBPs. However, phagosomes or vacuoles containing Trypanosoma cruzi and mGBP5 co-localize with mGBP1 cells. T. gondii thus elicits a cell-autonomous immune response in mice with GBPs involved. Three parasitic virulence factors and unknown IFN--dependent host factors regulate this complex process. Depending on the virulence of the strains involved, numerous GBPs are brought to the PV as part of a large, multimeric structure to combat T. gondii.Vaccine RelatedBiodefenseFoodborne IllnessInfectious DiseasesPreventionEmerging Infectious Diseases2.1 Biological of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8tx070vdarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0414s2zh2023-08-19T02:08:51Zqt0414s2zhEvidence-based recommendations for communicating the impacts of climate change on EllenBoyd, K2022-05-25Climate change poses a multifaceted, complex, and existential threat to human health and well-being, but efforts to communicate these threats to the public lag behind what we know how to do in communication research. Effective communication about climate change's health risks can improve a wide variety of individual and population health-related outcomes by: (1) helping people better make the connection between climate change and health risks and (2) empowering them to act on that newfound knowledge and understanding. The aim of this manuscript is to highlight communication methods that have received empirical support for improving knowledge uptake and/or driving higher-quality decision making and healthier behaviors and to recommend how to apply them at the intersection of climate change and health. This expert consensus about effective communication methods can be used by healthcare professionals, decision makers, governments, the general public, and other stakeholders including sectors outside of health. In particular, we argue for the use of 11 theory-based, evidence-supported communication strategies and practices. These methods range from leveraging social networks to making careful choices about the use of language, narratives, emotions, visual images, and statistics. Message testing with appropriate groups is also key. When implemented properly, these approaches are likely to improve the outcomes of climate change and health communication efforts.Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical ResearchGeneric CCohen, Jonathan DO'Reilly, Randall C2013-10-08The ability to flexibly, rapidly, and accurately perform novel tasks is a hallmark of human behavior. In our everyday lives we are often faced with arbitrary instructions that we must understand and follow, and we are able to do so with remarkable ease. It has frequently been argued that this ability relies on symbol processing, which depends critically on the ability to represent variables and bind them to arbitrary values. Whereas symbol processing is a fundamental feature of all computer systems, it remains a mystery whether and how this ability is carried out by the brain. Here, we provide an example of how the structure and functioning of the prefrontal cortex/basal ganglia working memory system can support variable binding, through a form of indirection (akin to a pointer in computer science). We show how indirection enables the system to flexibly generalize its behavior substantially beyond its direct experience (i.e., systematicity). We argue that this provides a biologically plausible mechanism that approximates a key component of symbol processing, exhibiting both the flexibility, but also some of the limitations, that are associated with this ability in humans.NeurosciencesMental Health1.1 Normal biological development and functioningUnderpinning research1.2 processesNeurologicalBasal GangliaCognitionHumansModelsNeurologicalNeuronsPrefrontal CortexSymbolismgenerativitygeneralizationcomputational modelapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4p0982d0articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt89h3k40k2023-08-19T00:08:57Zqt89h3k40kQuantifying the Farmland Application of Compost to Help Meet California's Waste Diversion LawHarrison, Brendan landmark SB 1383, mandates the diversion of 75% of organic waste entering landfills by 2025. Much of this organic waste will likely be composted and applied to farms. However, compost is expensive and energy intensive to transport, which limits the distance that compost can be shipped. Though the diversion of organic waste from landfills in California has the potential to significantly reduce methane emissions, it is unclear if enough farmland exists in close proximity to each city for the distribution of compost. To address this knowledge gap, we develop the Compost Allocation Network (CAN), a geospatial model that simulates the production and transport of waste for all California cities and farms across a range of scenarios for per capita waste production, compost application rate, and composting conversion rate. We applied this model to answer two questions: how much farmland can be applied with municipal compost and what percentage of the diverted organic waste can be used to supplement local farmland. The results suggest that a composting system that recycles nutrients between cities and local farms has the potential to play a major role in helping California meet SB 1383 while reducing state emissions by Mehmet Z2016-01-01Despite its fundamental importance, physical mechanisms that govern friction are poorly understood. While a state of ultra-low friction, termed structural lubricity, is expected for any clean, atomically flat interface consisting of two different materials with incommensurate structures, some associated predictions could only be quantitatively confirmed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions so far. Here, we report structurally lubric sliding under ambient conditions at mesoscopic (4,000-130,000 nm(2)) interfaces formed by gold islands on graphite. Ab initio calculations reveal that the gold-graphite interface is expected to remain largely free from contaminant molecules, leading to structurally lubric sliding. The experiments reported here demonstrate the potential for practical lubrication schemes for micro- and nano-electromechanical systems, which would mainly rely on an atomic-scale structural mismatch between the slider and substrate components, via the utilization of material systems featuring clean, atomically flat interfaces under ambient conditions.application/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9xw336pjarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0m19d5032023-08-18T23:57:57Zqt0m19d503Infrared nano-spectroscopy of ferroelastic known to exhibit heterogeneity in the form of domain walls. Understanding the properties of these boundaries is crucial for controlling functionality with external stimuli and for realizing their potential for ultra-low power memory and logic devices as well as novel computing architectures. In this work, we employ synchrotron-based near-field infrared nano-spectroscopy to reveal the vibrational properties of ferroelastic (90[Formula: see text] ferroelectric) domain walls in the hybrid improper ferroelectric Ca[Formula: see text]Ti[Formula: see text]O[Formula: see text]. By locally mapping the Ti-O stretching and Ti-O-Ti bending modes, we reveal how structural order parameters rotate across a wall. Thus, we link observed near-field amplitude changes to underlying structural modulations and test ferroelectric switching models against real space measurements of local structure. This initiative opens the door to broadband infrared nano-imaging of heterogeneity in ferroics.cond-mat.mtrl-sciapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m19d503articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7h95x4g22023-08-18T23:24:11Zqt7h95x4g2A Controller Synthesis Method to Achieve Independent Reference Tracking Performance and Disturbance Rejection PerformanceShi, GengjinLiu, ShaojieLi, DonghaiDing, YanjunChen, YangQuan2022-05-10This paper deals with the conflict between the input-output response and the disturbance-output response, which cannot be completely eliminated by traditional and advanced control strategies without using the accurate process model. The inherently close association of these two responses and the unavailability of the accurate process model pose a great challenge to field test engineers of a coal-fired power plant, that is, the design requirements of reference tracking and disturbance rejection are compromised. In this paper, a novel two-degree-of-freedom controller-feedforward compensated (FC) desired dynamic equational (DDE) proportional-integral-derivative (PID) (FC-DDE PID)-is proposed as a viable alternative. In addition to achieving independent reference tracking performance and disturbance rejection performance, its simple structure and tuning procedure are specifically appealing to practitioners. Simulations, experiments, and field tests demonstrate the advantages of the proposed controller in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, thus making FC-DDE PID a convenient and effective controller for the control of the coal-fired power plants, readily implementable on the distributed control system (DCS).Chemical EngineeringMaterials Engineeringapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7h95x4g2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt33k890602023-08-18T22:30:06Zqt33k89060Nodal signaling regulates is driven by dynamic cell behaviors, including migration, that are coordinated with fate specification and differentiation, but how such coordination is achieved remains poorly understood. During zebrafish gastrulation, endodermal cells sequentially exhibit first random, nonpersistent migration followed by oriented, persistent migration and finally collective migration. Using a novel transgenic line that labels the endodermal actin cytoskeleton, we found that these stage-dependent changes in migratory behavior correlated with changes in actin dynamics. The dynamic actin and random motility exhibited during early gastrulation were dependent on both Nodal and Rac1 signaling. We further identified the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Prex1 as a Nodal target and showed that it mediated Nodal-dependent random motility. Reducing Rac1 activity in endodermal cells caused them to bypass the random migration phase and aberrantly contribute to mesodermal tissues. Together, our results reveal a novel role for Nodal signaling in regulating actin dynamics and migration behavior, which are crucial for endodermal morphogenesis and cell fate decisions.PediatricUnderpinning research1.1 origin of the ubiquitous low-frequency shoulder on the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon fundamental in the Raman spectra of CdSe quantum dots is examined. This feature is usually assigned as a \"surface optical\" (SO) phonon, but it is only slightly affected by modifying the surface through exchanging ligands or adding a semiconductor shell. Here we present excitation profile data showing that the low-frequency shoulder loses intensity as the excitation is tuned to longer wavelengths, closer to resonance with the lowest-energy 1Se-1S3/2 excitonic transition. Calculations of the resonance Raman spectra are carried out using a fully atomistic model with an empirical force field to calculate the phonon modes and the standard effective mass approximation envelope function model to calculate the electron and hole wave functions. When a force field of the Tersoff type is used, the calculated spectra closely resemble the experimental ones in showing mainly the higher-frequency LO phonon with 1Se-1S3/2 resonance but showing intensity in lower-frequency features with 1Pe-1P3/2 resonance. These calculations indicate that the main LO phonon peak involves largely motion of the interior atoms, while the low-frequency shoulder is more equally distributed throughout the crystal but not surface-localized. Interestingly, very different results are obtained with the widely used Coulomb plus Lennard-Jones force field developed by Rabani, which predicts far more disordered structures and more localized phonon modes for the nanocrystals compared with hybrid imaging modality in which x-ray excitable particles (phosphor particles) emit optical photons when stimulated with a collimated x-ray beam. XLOT can potentially combine the high sensitivity of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of x-ray imaging. For reconstruction of XLOT data, we compared two reconstruction algorithms, conventional filtered backprojection (FBP) and a new algorithm, x-ray excitation priors (XLOT-EP), in which photon propagation is modeled with the diffusion equation and the x-ray beam positions are used as reconstruction priors. Numerical simulations based on dose calculations were used to validate the proposed XLOT imaging system and the reconstruction algorithms. Simulation results showed nanoparticle concentrations reconstructed with XLOT-EP are much less dependent on scan depth than those obtained with FBP. Measurements at just two orthogonal projections are sufficient for XLOT-EP to reconstruct an XLOT image for simple source distributions. The heterogeneity of x-ray energy deposition is included in the XLOT-EP reconstruction and improves the reconstruction accuracy, suggesting that there is a need to calculate the x-ray energy distribution for experimental pathogen of humans known for its ability to cause a wide range of infections. One major virulence factor of C. albicans is its ability to form hyphae that can invade host tissues and cause disseminated infections. Here, we introduce a method based on atomic force microscopy to investigate C. albicans hyphae in situ on silicone elastomer substrates, focusing on the effects of temperature and antifungal drugs. Hyphal growth rates differ significantly for measurements performed at different physiologically relevant temperatures. Furthermore, it is found that fluconazole is more effective than caspofungin in suppressing hyphal growth. We also investigate the effects of antifungal drugs on the mechanical properties of hyphal cells. An increase in Young's modulus and a decrease in adhesion force are observed in hyphal cells subjected to caspofungin treatment. Young's moduli are not significantly affected following treatment with fluconazole; the adhesion force, however, increases. Overall, our results provide a direct means of observing the effects of environmental factors and antifungal drugs on C. albicans hyphal growth and mechanics with high spatial resolution.IMPORTANCECandida albicans is one of the most common pathogens of humans. One important virulence factor of C. albicans is its ability to form elongated hyphae that can invade host tissues and cause disseminated infections. Here, we show the effect of different physiologically relevant temperatures and common antifungal drugs on the growth and mechanical properties of C. albicans hyphae using atomic force microscopy. We demonstrate that minor temperature fluctuations within the normal range can have profound effects on hyphal cell growth and that different antifungal drugs impact hyphal cell stiffness and adhesion in different ways.Emerging Infectious DiseasesInfectious Jan WOlson, CarolynSztein, A EsterSparks, Donald security has and will continue to rely on Earth's diverse soil resources.

Nitrogen produced by fossil fuel and geological reservoirs of other fertilizers are headed toward possible scarcity, increased cost, and/or geopolitical conflict. Climate change is accelerating the microbial release of greenhouse gases from soil organic matter and will likely play a large role in our near-term climate future. In this Review, we highlight challenges facing Earth's soil resources in the coming century.

DESIGN: A randomized control trial with participants (N = 500) randomized to one of six intervention conditions in a 3 (risk communication format: bulleted list, table, risk ladder) x 2 (mental imagery behaviour: physical activity, active control [sleep hygiene]) factorial design. METHODS: After receiving personalized risk estimates via a website on a smartphone, participants listened to an audiorecording that guided them through a mental imagery activity related to improving physical activity (intervention group) or sleep hygiene behaviour (active control). Participants received text message reminders to complete the imagery for 3 weeks post-intervention, 4 weekly text surveys to assess behaviour and its cognitive and affective precursors, and a mailed survey 90 days post-baseline. RESULTS: Physical activity increased over 90 days by 19.5 more minutes per week (95%CI: 2.0, 37.1) in the physical activity than the active control condition. This effect was driven by participants in the risk ladder condition, who exercised 54.8 more minutes (95%CI 15.6, 94.0) in the physical activity condition than participants in the active control sleep hygiene group. Goal planning positively predicted physical activity behaviour (b = 12.2 minutes per week, p = 0.002), but self-efficacy, image clarity, and affective attitudes towards behaviours did not (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mental imagery-based self-regulation interventions can increase physical activity behaviour, particularly when supported by personalized disease risk information presented in an easy-to-understand format.InterventionMental imageryPhysical activitySelf-regulationmHealthCognitionExerciseHumansMotivationSelf-ControlText Messagingapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/2r58v086articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8v09d68d2023-08-18T17:54:10Zqt8v09d68dEffects of mental simulation of future waterpipe tobacco smoking on attitudes, perceived harms and intended use young adults.Lipkus, IsaacMays, DarrenSheeran, in waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) may occur when smokers and nonsmokers conjure positive mental simulations of WTS. However, effects of these simulations on desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco and potential mediators are unexplored. This research addressed these effects among young adult waterpipe tobacco smokers and nonsmokers. Two online studies were conducted with adults ages 18-30. In Study 1, 200 smokers, 190 susceptible nonsmokers, and 182 nonsusceptible nonsmokers were randomized to mentally simulate or not WTS in the future. In Study 2, 234 smokers and 241 susceptible nonsmokers were randomized to four arms: no simulation or simulations that varied valence of experience (positive, negative or no valence provided). Main outcomes were immediate desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco, cognitive and affective attitudes, and perceived harms. In Study 1, mental simulations increased the desire to smoke waterpipe tobacco among smokers. In Study 2, asking participants to simulate WTS positively or with no valence instruction increased desire to smoke relative to negative valence instruction or no simulation. Negative simulations reduced perceived probability of smoking within a month compared to positive simulations. Effects on desire to engage in WTS were mediated by cognitive and affective attitudes among susceptible nonsmokers and by cognitive attitudes among smokers. These findings suggest that exploring when and how often mental simulations about WTS are evoked and their potency for promoting prevention and cessation of WTS merit further attention.AttitudesMental simulationsWaterpipe tobacco smokingAdolescentAdultAttitudeHumansSmokersSmokingSmoking CessationTobaccoWaterpipeYoung Adultapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8v09d68darticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8q26h98g2023-08-18T17:05:42Zqt8q26h98gRisk Ladder, Table, or Bulleted List? Identifying Formats That Effectively Communicate Personalized Risk and Risk Reduction Information for increase the amount of probabilistic information patients encounter. Little guidance exists about communicating risk for multiple diseases simultaneously or about communicating how changes in risk factors affect risk (hereafter risk reduction). PURPOSE: To determine how to communicate personalized risk and risk reduction information for up to 5 diseases associated with insufficient physical activity in a way laypeople can understand and that increases intentions. METHODS: We recruited 500 participants with <150 min weekly of physical activity from community settings. Participants completed risk assessments for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, and breast cancer (women only) on a smartphone. Then, they were randomly assigned to view personalized risk and risk reduction information organized as a bulleted list, a simplified table, or a specialized vertical bar graph (risk ladder). Last, they completed a questionnaire assessing outcomes. Personalized risk and risk reduction information was presented as categories (e.g., very low). Our analytic sample (N = 372) included 41.3% individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds, 15.9% with vocational-technical training or less, 84.7% women, 43.8% aged 50 to 64 y, and 71.8% who were overweight/obese. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance with post hoc comparisons showed that the risk ladder elicited higher gist comprehension than the bulleted list (P = 0.01). There were no significant main effects on verbatim comprehension or physical activity intentions and no moderation by sex, race/ethnicity, education, numeracy, or graph literacy (P > 0.05). Sequential mediation analyses revealed a small beneficial indirect effect of risk ladder versus list on intentions through gist comprehension and then through perceived risk (bIndirectEffect = 0.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.00, 0.04). CONCLUSION: Risk ladders can communicate the gist meaning of multiple pieces of risk information to individuals from many sociodemographic backgrounds and with varying levels of facility with numbers Comes Home.Alrutz, AnnaBuetow, StephenHuggard, PeterCameron, Linda2020-09-21Emergency responders (police, fire, ambulance and defence force personnel) risk exposure to dangerous and traumatic events, and the possible subsequent development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Consequently, partners of these emergency responders risk developing secondary traumatic stress (STS) from vicarious exposure to the trauma through communication and engagement with their responders. A mixed-methods study of the partners of emergency responders in New Zealand examined the extent of such partner-associated STS. This article focuses on two research questions: to what extent were risk factors for STS identified within that population, and what did the participants believe may help them to mitigate the impact of STS. An online anonymous survey was developed and eligible participants completed a 17-item STS scale, a social support measure, and answered several open-ended questions. Of the 646 participants, twenty percent appear to be experiencing intrusion, arousal, and avoidance symptoms related to the trauma experienced by their responder. Almost half stated they have little or no emotional/informational support related to their responders work. Thematic analysis of free-text responses identified the need for additional support and more direct communication/engagement from the organisations for partners to navigate their experiences of STS and the level of social support received and required. The authors conclude with recommendations to emergency responder including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, consumption of calorie dense/nutrient-poor foods, and sexual risk behavior contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality. Affective states that arise from a wide array of unrelated circumstances (i.e., incidental affect) may carry over to influence ARB. A meta-analysis is needed to systematically examine causal evidence for the role of incidental affect (including specific emotions) in influencing ARB. Method: Integrating effect sizes from 91 published and unpublished experimental studies that include both an incidental-affect induction and neutral-control condition (k = 271 effect sizes: k = 183 negative affect, k = 78 positive affect), this meta-analysis examines how negative and positive affective states influenced ARB and related health cognitions (e.g., intentions, evaluations, craving, perceived control). Results: Negative affective states reliably increased ARB, in analyses where all negative affective states were analyzed (d = .29) and in stratified analyses of just negative mood (d = .30) and stress (d = .48). These effects were stronger among study populations coded as clinically at risk. Positive affective states generally did not influence ARB or related health cognitions, except in the presence of a craving cue. Design issues of extant literature largely precluded conclusions about the effects of specific positive and negative affective states. Conclusion: Taken together, findings suggest the importance of strategies to attenuate negative affect incidental to ARB to facilitate healthier behavioral patterns, especially among clinically at-risk individuals.

When do these messages work? According to Conceptual Metaphor Theory, thinking metaphorically involves looking past concepts superficial differences to identify their similarities at a structural level. Thus, we hypothesized that when peoples general construal mindset is oriented to focus on informations abstract meaning, not its concrete details, they would process a metaphors target health concept in ways that correspond to the dissimilar concept. Accordingly, after priming an abstract, but not concrete, construal mindset: framing sun exposure as enemy confrontation (vs. literally) increased cancer risk perceptions and sun-safe intentions (Study 1; N=186); and framing smoking cessation as an arduous journey (vs. literally) increased appreciation of quitting difficulties and interest in cessation tools (Study 2; N=244).

There is very limited information about the utility of community health worker (CHW) approaches to cancer education for Asian American men. We have previously reported our positive findings from a trial of CHW education about HBV for Cambodian Americans who had never been tested for HBV. This report describes similarities and differences between the outcomes of our CHW HBV educational intervention among Cambodian American men and women. METHODS: The study group for this analysis included 87 individuals (39 men and 48 women) who were randomized to the experimental (HBV education) arm of our trial, participated in the CHW educational intervention, and provided follow-up data six months post-intervention. We examined HBV testing rates at follow-up, changes in HBV-related knowledge between baseline and follow-up, and barriers to HBV testing (that were reported to CHWs) by gender. RESULTS: At follow-up, 15% of men and 31% of women reported they had received a HBV test (p=0.09). HBV-related knowledge levels increased significantly among both men and women. With respect to HBV testing barriers, women were more likely than men to cite knowledge deficits, and men were more likely than women to cite logistic issues. DISCUSSION: Our study findings indicate that CHW interventions can positively impact knowledge among Cambodian American men, as well as women. They also suggest CHW interventions may be less effective in promoting the use of preventive procedures by Cambodian American men than women. Future CHW research initiatives should consider contextual factors that may differ by gender and, therefore, potentially influence the relative effectiveness of CHW interventions for men versus HMaterna, Stefan CWoo, Stephanie2021-02-01Inducible gene expression systems are valuable tools for studying biological processes. We previously developed an optogenetic gene expression system called TAEL that is optimized for use in zebrafish. When illuminated with blue light, TAEL transcription factors dimerize and activate gene expression downstream of the TAEL-responsive C120 promoter. By using light as the inducing agent, the TAEL/C120 system overcomes limitations of traditional inducible expression systems by enabling fine spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. In this study, we describe ongoing efforts to improve the TAEL/C120 system. We made modifications to both the TAEL transcriptional activator and the C120 regulatory element, collectively referred to as TAEL 2.0. We demonstrate that TAEL 2.0 consistently induces higher levels of reporter gene expression and at a faster rate, but with comparable background and toxicity as the original TAEL system. With these improvements, we were able to create functional stable transgenic lines to express the TAEL 2.0 transcription factor either ubiquitously or with a tissue-specific promoter. We demonstrate that the ubiquitous line in particular can be used to induce expression at late embryonic and larval stages, addressing a major deficiency of the original TAEL system. This improved optogenetic expression system will be a broadly useful resource for the zebrafish Chemotherapy versus Cetuximab in Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced study aimed to analyze survival, clinical responses, compliance, and adverse effects in locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) patients treated with split-dose cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (SD-CCRT) cetuximab with therapy (BioRT).Materials and methodsWe retrospectively evaluated 170 LAHNC patients diagnosed between January 1, 2009, and July 31, 2012: 116 received CCRT and 54 received BioRT.ResultsComplete response rates were similar in the SD-CCRT and BioRT groups (63.8% versus 59.3%; P locoregional rates 13.0%, respectively = 0.400). The 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 65.8% in the SD-CCRT group and 65.5% in the BioRT group, respectively (P = 0.647). The 3-year overall survival rate was 78.5% in the SD-CCRT group and 70.9% in the BioRT group, respectively (P = 0.879). Hematologic side effects were significantly more frequent in the SD-CCRT than in the BioRT group. Mucositis frequency was similar.ConclusionsPrimary SD-CCRT and BioRT both showed good clinical response and survival. Hematologic toxicities were more frequent, but tolerable, in the SD-CCRT group. Both groups showed good compliance.CancerClinical ResearchOrphan Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/80b0b8gjpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt4k14x97h2023-08-18T14:14:34Zqt4k14x97hPaediatric head CT scan and subsequent risk of malignancy and benign brain head computed tomography (CT) examination and increased subsequent risk of malignancy and benign brain tumour.MethodsIn the exposed cohort, 24 418 participants under 18 years of age, who underwent head CT examination between 1998 and 2006, were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients were followed up until a diagnosis of malignant disease or benign brain tumour, withdrawal from the National Health Insurance (NHI) system, or at the end of 2008.ResultsThe overall risk was not significantly different in the two cohorts (incidence rate=36.72 per 100 000 person-years in the exposed cohort, 28.48 per 100 000 person-years in the unexposed cohort, hazard ratio (HR)=1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.90-1.85). The risk of benign brain tumour was significantly higher in the exposed cohort than in the unexposed cohort (HR=2.97, 95% CI=1.49-5.93). The frequency of CT examination showed strong correlation with the subsequent overall risk of malignancy and benign brain tumour.ConclusionsWe found that paediatric head CT examination was associated with an increased incidence of benign brain tumour.

Herein, we investigated the role of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a multi-functional protein, in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. Results showed that YY1 contributed to gastric carcinogenesis of SC-M1 cells including growth, viability, and abilities of colony formation, migration, invasion, and tumorsphere formation. Levels of pluripotency genes CD44, Oct4, were Additionally, the 3'-untranslated region of YY1 mRNA was the target miR-34b, down-regulation of YY1 in NUGC-3 gastric cancer cells scarcely expressing miR-34 family. Alternatively, knockdown of miR-34 family promoted tumorigenesis via up-regulation of YY1 in SC-M1 and AZ521 gastric cancer cells with higher levels of miR-34 family. The miR-34 family also affected tumorsphere ultra-structure and inhibited the xenografted tumor growth as well as lung metastasis of SC-M1 cells through YY1. Expressions of miR-34a and miR-34c in gastric cancer tissues of patients were lower than those in normal tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-34 family-YY1 axis plays an important role in the control of gastric carcinogenesis.BiotechnologyStem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - and Carcinogenesisapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/4bc2s7w2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt7v58b6j22023-08-18T12:05:59Zqt7v58b6j2Do Strict Land Use Regulations Make Metropolitan Areas More Segregated by Income?Lens, Michael CMonkkonen, Paavo2016-01-02Problem research strategy and findingsIncome segregation has risen in each of the last four decades in U.S. metropolitan areas, which can have lifelong impacts on the health, economic productivity, and behaviors of residents. Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations-such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls-exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lower-income segregation.Takeaway for practiceDensity restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceBehavioral and Social ScienceLife on Landincome use regulationsexclusionary Regional PlanningUrban & Regional Planningapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7v58b6j2articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0rj6c4p12023-08-18T11:41:17Zqt0rj6c4p1Mental healthcare for young and adolescent LGBTQ+ pandemic has led to a significant change in the way healthcare is dispensed. During the pandemic, healthcare inequities were experienced by various sections of society, based on gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The LGBTQ individuals were also affected by this inequity. There is a lack of information on this topic especially in the developing countries. Hence this issue requires further exploration and understanding. Previous literature briefly explored the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil faced by the LGBTQ community on a regular basis. They feared rejection by family and friends, bullying, physical assault, and religious biases. These issues prevented them from publicly speaking about their sexual orientation thereby making it difficult to collect reliable data. Although they require medical and psychological treatment, they are afraid to ask for help and access healthcare and mental health services. Being mindful of these difficulties, this article explores the various underlying causes of the mental health problems faced by LGBTQ individuals, especially, in the Indian subcontinent. The article also examines the status of healthcare services available to Indian sexual minorities and provides recommendations about possible remedial measures to ensure the well-being Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rj6c4p1publicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt82k6n2sw2023-08-18T11:35:53Zqt82k6n2swThe Cultural Context of Plagiarism and Research Misconduct in ParvezChatterjee, TulikaSandhu, Nimrat KaurGupta, Latika2023-01-01Plagiarism is one of the most frequent forms of research misconduct in South and East Asian countries. This narrative review examines the factors contributing to research misconduct, emphasizing plagiarism, particularly in South, East and Southeast Asian countries. We conducted a PubMed and Scopus search using the terms plagiarism, Asia, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, research misconduct and retractions in January of 2022. Articles with missing abstracts, incomplete information about plagiarism, publication dates before 2010, and those unrelated to South, East, and Southeast Asian countries were excluded. The retraction watch database was searched for articles retracted between 9th January 2020 to 9th January 2022. A total of 159 articles were identified, of which 21 were included in the study using the database search criteria mentioned above. The review of articles identified a lack of training in scientific writing and research ethics, publication pressure, permissive attitudes, and inadequate regulatory measures as the primary reasons behind research misconduct in scientific publications. Plagiarism remains a common cause of unethical publications and retractions in regions of Asia (namely South, East and Southeast). Researchers lack training in scientific writing, and substantial gaps exist in understanding various forms of plagiarism, which heavily contribute to the problem. There is an urgent need to foster high research ethics standards and adhere to journal policies. Providing appropriate training in scientific writing among researchers may help improve the knowledge of different types of plagiarism and promote the use of antiplagiarism software, leading to a substantial reduction update for sparse target recovery in fluorescence molecular tomography accelerated by ordered subsetsZhu, DianwenLi, Changqing2014-12-01Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a promising imaging modality and has been actively studied in the past two decades since it can locate the specific tumor position three-dimensionally in small animals. However, it remains a challenging task to obtain fast, robust and accurate reconstruction of fluorescent probe distribution in small animals due to the large computational burden, the noisy measurement and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. In this paper we propose a nonuniform preconditioning method in combination with L (1) regularization and ordered subsets technique (NUMOS) to take care of the different updating needs at different pixels, to enhance sparsity and suppress noise, and to further boost convergence of approximate solutions for fluorescence molecular tomography. Using both simulated data and phantom experiment, we found that the proposed nonuniform updating method outperforms its popular uniform counterpart by obtaining a more localized, less noisy, more accurate image. The computational cost was greatly reduced as well. The ordered subset (OS) technique provided additional 5 times and 3 times speed enhancements for simulation and phantom experiments, respectively, without degrading image qualities. When compared with the popular L (1) algorithms such as iterative soft-thresholding NUMOS also outperforms them by obtaining a better image in much shorter period of time.Bioengineering(100.3190) Inverse problems(170.3010) Image reconstruction techniques(170.3880) TomographyOptical University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0d25d3cgarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5gp774f32023-08-18T09:58:44Zqt5gp774f3Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease: developing a better model as a tool for therapeutic interventions.Kitazawa, MasashiMedeiros, RodrigoLaferla, Frank M2012-01-01Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among elderly.

All animals, including bees, are associated with a diverse community of microbes, commonly referred to as the microbiome. The bee microbiome is likely to be a crucial factor affecting host health. However, with the exception of a few pathogens, the impacts of most members of the bee microbiome on host health are poorly understood. Further, the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape and change the microbiome are unclear. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the bee microbiome, and we present challenges associated with its investigation. We conclude that global coordination of research efforts is needed to fully understand the complex and highly dynamic nature of the interplay between the bee microbiome, its host, and the environment. High-throughput sequencing technologies are ideal for exploring complex biological systems, including host-microbe interactions. To maximize their value and to improve assessment of the factors affecting bee health, sequence data should be archived, curated, and analyzed in ways that promote the synthesis of different studies. To this end, the BeeBiome consortium aims to develop an online database which would provide reference sequences, archive metadata, and host analytical resources. The goal would be to support applied and fundamental research on bees and their associated microbes and to provide a collaborative framework for sharing primary data from different research programs, thus furthering our understanding of the bee microbiome and its impact on pollinator health.Human GenomeGeneticsZero HungerAnimalsBacteriaBeesBiological EvolutionMicrobiotaPollinationSymbiosisMicrobiologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8vt7k6wfarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8vn1t2p72023-08-18T06:53:23Zqt8vn1t2p7Effect (ILs) is relevant to their use in various applications. However, a mechanistic understanding of how the cation-anion pair affects wettability is still evolving. Here, focusing on phosphonium ILs, wettability was characterized in terms of contact angle using experiments and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Both experiments and simulations showed that the contact angle was affected by the anion and increased as benzoate < salicylate < saccharinate. Further, the simulations showed that the contact angle decreased with increasing cation alkyl chain length for these anions paired with five different tetra-alkyl-phosphonium cations. The trends were explained in terms of adhesive and cohesive energies in the simulations and then correlated to the atomic scale differences between the anions and the cations.Physical SciencesChemical SciencesEngineeringapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8vn1t2p7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9k56545m2023-08-18T05:27:40Zqt9k56545mOn the Predictability of SciencePenner, OrionPan, Raj KPetersen, Alexander MKaski, KimmoFortunato, Santo2013-01-01Correctly assessing a scientist's past research impact and potential for future impact is key in recruitment decisions and other evaluation processes. While a candidate's future impact is the main concern for these decisions, most measures only quantify the impact of previous work. Recently, it has been argued that linear regression models are capable of predicting a scientist's future impact. By applying that future impact model to 762 careers drawn from three disciplines: physics, biology, and mathematics, we identify a number of subtle, but critical, flaws in current models. Specifically, cumulative non-decreasing measures like the h-index contain intrinsic autocorrelation, resulting in significant overestimation of their \"predictive power\". Moreover, the predictive power of these models depend heavily upon scientists' career age, producing least accurate estimates for young researchers. Our results place in doubt the suitability of such models, and indicate further investigation is required before they can be used in recruiting decisions.physics.soc-phcs.DLapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9k56545marticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1gm811qp2023-08-18T05:27:37Zqt1gm811qpReputation and impact in is an important social construct in science, which enables informed quality assessments of both publications and careers of scientists in the absence of complete systemic information. However, the relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood, despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here, we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation rate c depends on the reputation of its central author i, in addition to its net citation count c. To estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly cited scientists, using the total citations Ci of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover c\u00d7, which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with c < c\u00d7, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in Ci. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for highly cited publications meaning that, for c c\u00d7, the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition, we have developed a stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science.BibliometricsCareer MobilityComputer University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1gm811qparticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0h67063p2023-08-18T04:14:34Zqt0h67063pInfant Language Development Is Related to the Acquisition of WalkingWalle, Eric ACampos, Joseph J2014-02-01The present investigation explored the question of whether walking onset is related to infant language development. Study 1 used a longitudinal design (N = 44) to assess infant locomotor and language development every 2 weeks from 10 to 13.5 months of age. The acquisition of walking was associated with a significant increase in both receptive and productive language, independent of age. Study 2 used an age-held-constant study with 12.5-month-old infants (38 crawling infants; 37 walking infants) to further explore these findings. Results from Study 2 replicated the differences in infant language development between locomotor groups. Additionally, a naturalistic observation of parent-infant interactions (20 crawling dyads; 24 walking dyads) revealed that language development was predicted by multiple factors in the social environment, but only for walking infants. Possible explanations of the findings (e.g., social, cognitive, neurological) are discussed, and topics for future research Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0h67063particleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3338d3d92023-08-18T04:14:23Zqt3338d3d9Walking across Wikipedia: scale-free network model of semantic memory retrievalThompson, Graham WKello, Christopher T2014-01-01Semantic knowledge has been investigated using both online and offline methods. One common online method is category recall, in which members of a semantic category like \"animals\" are retrieved in a given period of time. The order, timing, and number of retrievals are used as assays of semantic memory processes. One common offline method is corpus analysis, in which the structure of semantic knowledge is extracted from texts using co-occurrence or encyclopedic methods. Online measures of semantic processing, as well as offline measures of semantic structure, have yielded data resembling inverse power law distributions. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether these patterns in data might be related. A semantic network model of animal knowledge is formulated on the basis of Wikipedia pages and their overlap in word probability distributions. The network is scale-free, in that node degree is related to node frequency as an inverse power law. A random walk over this network is shown to simulate a number of results from a category recall experiment, including power law-like distributions of inter-response intervals. Results are discussed in terms of theories of semantic structure and processing.scale-free networklevy foragingcategory recallsemanticsPsychologyCognitive Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3338d3d9articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5m00156b2023-08-18T04:13:11Zqt5m00156bJNK Pathway JNK MAP kinase pathway is altered by a broad array of stimuli including exposure to the widely abused drug ethanol, but the behavioral relevance and the regulation of JNK signaling is unclear. Here we demonstrate that JNK signaling functions downstream of the Sterile20 kinase family gene tao/Taok3 to regulate the behavioral effects of acute ethanol exposure in both the fruit fly Drosophila and mice. In flies tao is required in neurons to promote sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant effects of acute ethanol exposure and to establish specific brain structures. Reduced expression of key JNK pathway genes substantially rescued the structural and behavioral phenotypes of tao mutants. Decreasing and increasing JNK pathway activity resulted in increased and decreased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant properties of acute ethanol exposure, respectively. Further, JNK expression in a limited pattern of neurons that included brain regions implicated in ethanol responses was sufficient to restore normal behavior. Mice heterozygous for a disrupted allele of the homologous Taok3 gene (Taok3Gt) were resistant to the acute sedative effects of ethanol. JNK activity was constitutively increased in brains of Taok3Gt/+ mice, and acute induction of phospho-JNK in brain tissue by ethanol was occluded in Taok3Gt/+ mice. Finally, acute administration of a JNK inhibitor conferred resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol in wild-type but not Taok3Gt/+ mice. Taken together, these data support a role of a TAO/TAOK3-JNK neuronal signaling pathway in regulating sensitivity to acute ethanol exposure in flies and in mice.Substance MisuseNeurosciencesGeneticsAlcoholismAlcohol Use and HealthAetiologyUnderpinning research2.1 Biological Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5m00156barticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt49q4t57r2023-08-18T04:12:43Zqt49q4t57rInsulin and GLP1 infusions demonstrate the onset of adiposespecific insulin resistance in a large fasting mammal: potential glucogenic role for GLP1Viscarra, Rudy M2013-07-01Prolonged food deprivation increases lipid oxidation and utilization, which may contribute to the onset of the insulin resistance associated with fasting. Because insulin resistance promotes the preservation of glucose and oxidation of fat, it has been suggested to be an adaptive response to food deprivation. However, fasting mammals exhibit hypoinsulinemia, suggesting that the insulin resistance-like conditions they experience may actually result from reduced pancreatic sensitivity to glucose/capacity to secrete insulin. To determine whether fasting results in insulin resistance or in pancreatic dysfunction, we infused early- and late-fasted seals (naturally adapted to prolonged fasting) with insulin (0.065 U/kg), and a separate group of late-fasted seals with low (10 pM/kg) or high (100 pM/kg) dosages of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) immediately following a glucose bolus (0.5g/kg), and measured the systemic and cellular responses. Because GLP-1 facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, these infusions provide a method to assess pancreatic insulin-secreting capacity. Insulin infusions increased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor and Akt in adipose and muscle of early and late fasted seals; however the timing of the signaling response was blunted in adipose of late fasted seals. Despite the dose-dependent increases in insulin and increased glucose clearance (high dose), both GLP-1 dosages produced increases in plasma cortisol and glucagon, which may have contributed to the glucogenic role of GLP-1. Results suggest that fasting induces adipose-specific insulin resistance in elephant seal pups, while maintaining skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, and therefore suggests that the onset of insulin resistance in fasting mammals is an evolved response to cope with prolonged food long-term effects of being bullied or a bully in adolescence on externalizing and internalizing mental JLLydersen, SSund, AM2015-12-01BackgroundThe aim is to examine associations between bullying involvement in adolescence and mental health problems in adulthood.MethodsInformation on bullying-involvement (being bullied, bully-victim, aggressive toward others) and non-involved was collected from 2464 adolescents in Mid-Norway at mean age 13.7 and again at mean age 14.9. Information about mental health problems and psychosocial functioning was collected about 12 years later at mean age 27.2 (n = 1266).ResultsAll groups involved in bullying in young adolescence had adverse mental health outcomes in adulthood compared to non-involved. Those being bullied were affected especially regarding increased total sum of depressive symptoms and high levels of total, internalizing and critical symptoms, increased risk of having received help for mental health problems, and reduced functioning because of a psychiatric problem in adulthood. While those being aggressive toward others showed high levels of total and internalizing symptoms. Both those being bullied and bully-victims showed an increased risk of high levels of critical symptoms. Lastly, all groups involved in bullying on adolescence had increased risk of psychiatric hospitalization because of mental health problems.ConclusionInvolvement in bullying in adolescence is associated with later mental health problems, possibly hindering development into independent adulthood.PediatricYouth ViolenceViolence ResearchMental HealthClinical Child Psychologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5808j4zharticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt72b6z93b2023-08-18T04:12:19Zqt72b6z93bCombinatorial Fibronectin and Laminin Signaling Promote Highly Efficient Cardiac Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem CellsSa, SilinWong, LianMcCloskey, Kara E2014-08-01Cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising and potentially unlimited cell source for myocardial repair and regeneration. Recently, multiple methodologies-primarily based on the optimization of growth factors-have been described for efficient cardiac differentiation of hESCs. However, the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling in CM differentiation has not yet been explored fully. This study examined the role of ECM signaling in the efficient generation of CMs from both H7 and H9 ESCs. The hESCs were differentiated on ECM a range of fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) ratios and gelatin and evaluated by the fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis on day 14. Of the ECM substrates examined, the 70:30 FN:LN reproducibly generated the greatest numbers of CMs from both hESC lines. Moreover, the LN receptor integrin 4 (ITGB4) and FN receptor integrin cultured on 70:30 FN:LN compared with gelatin. Blocking studies confirmed the role of all these molecules in CM specification, suggesting that the 70:30 FN:LN ECM promotes highly efficient differentiation of CMs through the integrin-mediated MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Lastly, the data suggest that FN:LN-induced signaling utilizes direct cell-to-cell signaling from distinct ITGB4(+) and ITGB5(+) cells.Heart MedicineCardiovascularStem Cell ResearchDevelopment of treatments matrixfibronectinhuman embryonic stem cellsintegrin signalinglamininapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/72b6z93barticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5874x33c2023-08-18T04:08:41Zqt5874x33cDevelopment of children at risk for adverse outcomes participating in early intervention in developing countries: a randomized controlled has indicated positive effects of early developmental intervention (EDI) on the development of children in developing countries. Few studies, however, have examined longitudinally when differential treatment effects may be observed and whether differential outcomes are associated with exposure to different risk factors and country of implementation. Also, birth asphyxia as a risk condition has not been well studied. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that there will be differential developmental trajectories favoring those who receive EDI versus a health education intervention in children in rural areas of India, Pakistan, and Zambia.MethodsChildren with and without birth asphyxia were randomized to EDI or control intervention, which was implemented by parents who received training in biweekly home visits initiated before child age 1 month and continuing until 36 months. Development was assessed in 376 children at ages 12, 24, and 36 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Ages & Stages Questionnaire administered by evaluators blind to intervention assignment and risk condition.ResultsLongitudinal mixed model analysis indicated that EDI resulted in better development over 36 months in cognitive abilities, regardless of risk condition, maternal resources, child gender, or country. Psychomotor development and parent-reported general development showed similar trends as for cognitive abilities, but were not statistically different between intervention conditions. Developmental differences were observed first at 36 months of age.ConclusionEarly developmental intervention has promise for improving development in children across developing countries when exposed to various risk conditions.

The present aims were to examine at what levels of non-normal weight, school-aged children experience lower HRQOL and whether this differs among racial/ethnic groups, when controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) differences.DesignCross-sectional community cohort survey.Subjects and methodsData are from the Healthy Passages, reporting on 4824 Latino, black and white 5th graders in a population-based survey conducted in three United States metropolitan areas. Children's weight status was classified from measured weight and height into underweight (1%), normal weight (52%), overweight (19%), obese obese (14%). Children reported their own HRQOL using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and additional scales addressing global self-worth, physical appearance and body satisfaction. Parents reported children's overall health status.ResultsEach increment in higher non-healthy weight class-overweight to obese to extremely obese-was associated with significantly lower scores in more domains of psychosocial HRQOL compared with that in normal weight. However, only extremely obese children reported significantly lower physical HRQOL. Differences among weight classes remained when adjusting for SES and were independent of race/ethnicity. Underweight children generally reported HRQOL that was not significantly different from normal weight children.ConclusionsOverweight, obese and extremely obese 5th graders on average experience worse HRQOL than normal weight children, especially in psychosocial domains including self-worth and peer relationships, regardless of race/ethnicity. If messages can be conveyed in a sensitive and supportive manner, the desire to improve HRQOL could provide additional motivation for children and their parents in addressing unhealthy weight.PreventionNutritionObesityClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social SciencePediatric2.3 Psychologicalsocial and SciencesEducationEndocrinology & Metabolismapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9s95m0tmarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt8dc1n3kj2023-08-18T04:07:48Zqt8dc1n3kjDose of early intervention treatment during children's first 36 months of life is associated with developmental outcomes: an observational cohort study in three low/low-middle income effects of early developmental intervention (EDI) on early child development have been reported in numerous controlled trials in a variety of countries. An important aspect to determining the efficacy of EDI is the degree to which dosage is linked to outcomes. However, few studies of EDI have conducted such analyses. This observational cohort study examined the association between treatment dose and children's development when EDI was implemented in three low and low-middle income countries as well as demographic and child health factors associated with treatment dose.MethodsInfants (78 males, 67 females) born in rural communities in India, Pakistan, and Zambia received a parent-implemented EDI delivered through biweekly home visits by trainers during the first 36 months of life. Outcome was measured at age 36 months with the Mental (MDI) and Psychomotor (PDI) Development Indices of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II. Treatment dose was measured by number of home visits completed and parent-reported implementation of assigned developmental stimulation activities between visits. Sociodemographic, prenatal, perinatal, and child health variables were measures as correlates.ResultsAverage home visits dose exceeded 91% and mothers engaged the children in activities on average 62.5% of days. Higher home visits dose was significantly associated with higher MDI (mean for dose quintiles 1-2 combined = 97.8, quintiles 3-5 combined = 103.4, p = 0.0017). Higher treatment dose was also generally associated with greater mean PDI, but the relationships were non-linear. Location, sociodemographic, and child health variables were associated with treatment dose.ConclusionsReceiving a higher dose of EDI during the first 36 months of life is generally associated with better developmental outcomes. The higher benefit appears when receiving 91% of biweekly home visits and program activities on 67% of days over 3 years. It is important to ensure that EDI is implemented with a sufficiently high dose to achieve desired effect. To this end groups at risk for receiving lower dose can be identified and may require special attention to ensure adequate effect.PediatricPreventionClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social ScienceGood of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8dc1n3kjarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt96m3b02v2023-08-18T04:07:33Zqt96m3b02vSuicide Attempt in Young People: A Signal for Long-term Health increased since the onset of the global recession, a trend that may have long-term health and social implications.ObjectiveTo test whether suicide attempts among young people signal increased risk for later poor health and social functioning above and beyond a preexisting psychiatric disorder.DesignWe followed up a cohort of young people and assessed multiple aspects of their health and social functioning as they approached midlife. Outcomes among individuals who had self-reported a suicide attempt up through age 24 years (young suicide attempters) were compared with those who reported no attempt through age 24 years (nonattempters). Psychiatric history and social class were controlled for.Setting and participantsThe population-representative Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which involved 1037 birth cohort members comprising 91 young suicide attempters and 946 nonattempters, 95% of whom were followed up to age 38 years.Main outcomes and measuresOutcomes were selected to represent significant individual and societal costs: mental health, physical health, harm toward others, and need for support.ResultsAs adults approaching midlife, young suicide attempters were significantly more likely to have persistent mental health problems (eg, depression, substance dependence, and additional suicide attempts) compared with nonattempters. They were also more likely to have physical health problems (eg, metabolic syndrome and elevated inflammation). They engaged in more violence (eg, violent crime and intimate partner abuse) and needed more social support (eg, long-term welfare receipt and unemployment). Furthermore, they reported being lonelier and less satisfied with their lives. These associations remained after adjustment for youth psychiatric diagnoses and social class.Conclusions and relevanceMany young suicide attempters remain vulnerable to costly health and social problems into midlife. As rates of suicidal behavior rise with the continuing global recession, additional suicide prevention efforts and long-term monitoring and after-care services are needed.Suicide PreventionBasic Behavioral Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/96m3b02varticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt2gq5s92f2023-08-18T04:06:58Zqt2gq5s92fReceptor Polymorphism and Genomic to taste bitterness evolved to safeguard most animals, including humans, against potentially toxic substances, thereby leading to food rejection. Nonetheless, bitter perception is subject to individual variations due to the presence of genetic functional polymorphisms in bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) genes, such as the long-known association between genetic polymorphisms in TAS2R38 and bitter taste perception of phenylthiocarbamide. Yet, due to overlaps in specificities across receptors, such associations with a single TAS2R locus are uncommon. Therefore, to investigate more complex associations, we examined taste responses to six structurally diverse compounds (absinthin, amarogentin, cascarillin, grosheimin, quassin, and quinine) in a sample of the Caucasian population. By sequencing all bitter receptor loci, inferring long-range haplotypes, mapping their on characterizing functionally causal allelic variants, we deciphered at the molecular level how a subjects' genotype for the whole-family of TAS2R genes shapes variation in bitter taste perception. Within each haplotype block implicated in phenotypic variation, we provided evidence for at least one locus harboring functional polymorphic alleles, e.g. one locus for sensitivity to amarogentin, one of the most bitter natural compounds known, and two loci for sensitivity to grosheimin, one of the bitter compounds of artichoke. Our analyses revealed also, besides simple associations, complex associations of bitterness sensitivity across TAS2R loci. Indeed, even if several putative loci harbored both high- and low-sensitivity alleles, phenotypic variation depended on linkage between these alleles. When sensitive alleles for bitter compounds were maintained in the same linkage phase, genetically driven perceptual differences were obvious, e.g. for grosheimin. On the contrary, when sensitive alleles were in opposite phase, only weak genotype-phenotype associations were seen, e.g. for absinthin, the bitter principle of the beverage absinth. These findings illustrate the extent to which genetic influences on taste are complex, yet arise from both receptor activation patterns and linkage structure among receptor genes.BiotechnologyNeurosciencesDental/Oral and DDale, RickKello, Christopher TStreet, Chris NHRichardson, Daniel C2013-01-01BOTH THE SCIENCE AND THE EVERYDAY PRACTICE OF DETECTING A LIE REST ON THE SAME ASSUMPTION: hidden cognitive states that the liar would like to remain hidden nevertheless influence observable behavior. This assumption has good evidence. The insights of professional interrogators, anecdotal evidence, and body language textbooks have all built up a sizeable catalog of non-verbal cues that have been claimed to distinguish deceptive and truthful behavior. Typically, these cues are discrete, individual behaviors-a hand touching a mouth, the rise of a brow-that distinguish lies from truths solely in terms of their frequency or duration. Research to date has failed to establish any of these non-verbal cues as a reliable marker of deception. Here we argue that perhaps this is because simple tallies of behavior can miss out on the rich but subtle organization of behavior as it unfolds over time. Research in cognitive science from a dynamical systems perspective has shown that behavior is structured across multiple timescales, with more or less regularity and structure. Using tools that are sensitive to these dynamics, we analyzed body motion data from an experiment that put participants in a realistic situation of choosing, or not, to lie to an experimenter. Our analyses indicate that when being deceptive, continuous fluctuations of movement in the upper face, and somewhat in the arms, are characterized by dynamical properties of less stability, but greater complexity. For the upper face, these distinctions are present despite no apparent differences in the overall amount of movement between deception and truth. We suggest that these unique dynamical signatures of motion are indicative of both the cognitive demands inherent to deception and the need to respond adaptively in a social context.Behavioral and Social Sciencedeceptionnon-linear of Freshwater Species Endemism, and abundances of species that depend on freshwater habitats are declining worldwide. Efforts to counteract those trends are often hampered by a lack of information about species distribution and conservation status and are often strongly biased toward a few well-studied groups. We identified the 3,906 vascular plants, macroinvertebrates, and vertebrates native to California, USA, that depend on fresh water for at least one stage of their life history. We evaluated the conservation status for these taxa using existing government and non-governmental organization assessments (e.g., endangered species act, NatureServe), created a spatial database of locality observations or distribution information from ~400 data sources, and mapped patterns of richness, endemism, and vulnerability. Although nearly half of all taxa with conservation status (n = 1,939) are vulnerable to extinction, only 114 (6%) of those vulnerable taxa have a legal mandate for protection in the form of formal inclusion on a state or federal endangered species list. Endemic taxa are at greater risk than non-endemics, with 90% of the 927 endemic taxa vulnerable to extinction. Records with spatial data were available for a total of 2,276 species (61%). The patterns of species richness differ depending on the taxonomic group analyzed, but are similar across taxonomic level. No particular taxonomic group represents an umbrella for all species, but hotspots of high richness for listed species cover 40% of the hotspots for all other species and 58% of the hotspots for vulnerable freshwater species. By mapping freshwater species hotspots we show locations that represent the top priority for conservation action in the state. This study identifies opportunities to fill gaps in the evaluation of conservation status for freshwater taxa in California, to address the lack of occurrence information for nearly 40% of freshwater taxa and nearly 40% of watersheds in the state, and to implement adequate protections for freshwater taxa where they are currently lacking.Life on LandLife Below WaterAnimalsBiodiversityCaliforniaConservation of Natural ResourcesFresh WaterInvertebratesPlantsVertebratesGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/3wz9b4pkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt66c7w9ws2023-08-18T04:02:58Zqt66c7w9wsAmyloid-associated activity contributes to the severity and toxicity of a prion phenotypePezza, John AVillali, JaniceSindi, Suzanne SSerio, Tricia R2014-01-01The self-assembly of alternative conformations of normal proteins into amyloid aggregates has been implicated in both the acquisition of new functions and in the appearance and progression of disease. However, while these amyloidogenic pathways are linked to the emergence of new phenotypes, numerous studies have uncoupled the accumulation of aggregates from their biological consequences, revealing currently underappreciated complexity in the determination of these traits. Here, to explore the molecular basis of protein-only phenotypes, we focused on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35/[PSI(+)] prion, which confers a translation termination defect and expression level-dependent toxicity in its amyloid form. Our studies reveal that aggregated Sup35 retains its normal function as a translation release factor. However, fluctuations in the composition and size of these complexes specifically alter the level of this aggregate-associated activity and thereby the severity and toxicity of the amyloid state. Thus, amyloid heterogeneity is a crucial contributor asphyxia through 36months birth asphyxia reduces mortality, but may be argued to increase risk for neurodevelopmental disability in survivors.AimsTo test the hypothesis that development of infants who received resuscitation following birth asphyxia is not significantly different through 36months of age from infants who had healthy births.Study designProspective observational cohort design comparing infants exposed to birth asphyxia with resuscitation or healthy birth.SubjectsA random sample of infants with birth asphyxia who received bag-and-mask resuscitation was selected from birth records in selected communities in 3 countries.Exclusion criteriabirth weight<1500g, severely abnormal neurological examination at 7days, mother<15years, unable to participate, or not expected to remain in the target area. A random sample of healthy-birth infants (no resuscitation, normal neurological exam) was also selected. Eligible=438, consented=407, and 1 valid developmental assessment during the first 36months=376.Outcome measure(s)Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II and PDI (p=.143) over 3 yearly assessments did not differ between children with birth asphyxia and healthy-birth children. Rather there was a trend for birth asphyxia children to improve more than healthy-birth children.ConclusionsThe large majority of infants who are treated with resuscitation and survived birth asphyxia can be expected to evidence normal development at least until age 3. The risk for neurodevelopmental disability should not justify the restriction of effective therapies for birth asphyxia.PediatricPretermLow Birth Weight and Health of the NewbornPerinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal PeriodInfant MortalityPhysical Injury - Accidents University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/8bm102bvarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5bd4z94w2023-08-18T04:02:22Zqt5bd4z94wDopamine and the Development of Executive Dysfunction in Autism Spectrum DisordersKriete, TrentonNoelle, David CDurstewitz, Daniel2015-01-01Persons with autism regularly exhibit executive dysfunction (ED), including problems with deliberate goal-directed behavior, planning, and flexible responding in changing environments. Indeed, this array of deficits is sufficiently prominent to have prompted a theory that executive dysfunction is at the heart of these disorders. A more detailed examination of these behaviors reveals, however, that some aspects of executive function remain developmentaly appropriate. In particular, while people with autism often have difficulty with tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, their fundamental cognitive control capabilities, such as those involved in inhibiting an inappropriate but relatively automatic response, show no significant impairment on many tasks. In this article, an existing computational model of the prefrontal cortex and its role in executive control is shown to explain this dichotomous pattern of behavior by positing abnormalities in the dopamine-based modulation of frontal systems in individuals with autism. This model offers excellent qualitative and quantitative fits to performance on standard tests of cognitive control and cognitive flexibility in this clinical population. By simulating the development of the prefrontal cortex, the computational model also offers a potential explanation for an observed lack of executive dysfunction early in life.Acquired Cognitive ImpairmentIntellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD)Behavioral and Social ScienceNeurosciencesAutismBrain DisordersBasic Behavioral Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5bd4z94warticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt30k576732023-08-18T04:02:14Zqt30k57673Dissociating Cortical Activity during Processing of Native and Non-Native Audiovisual Speech from Early to Late InfancyFava, EswenHull, RachelBortfeld, Heather2014-01-01Initially, infants are capable of discriminating phonetic contrasts across the world's languages. Starting between seven and ten months of age, they gradually lose this ability through a process of perceptual narrowing. Although traditionally investigated with isolated speech sounds, such narrowing occurs in a variety of perceptual domains (e.g., faces, visual speech). Thus far, tracking the developmental trajectory of this tuning process has been focused primarily on auditory speech alone, and generally using isolated sounds. But infants learn from speech produced by people talking to them, meaning they learn from a complex audiovisual signal. Here, we use near-infrared spectroscopy to measure blood concentration changes in the bilateral temporal cortices of infants in three different age groups: 3-to-6 months, 7-to-10 months, and 11-to-14-months. Critically, all three groups of infants were tested with continuous audiovisual speech in both their native and another, unfamiliar language. We found that at each age range, infants showed different patterns of cortical activity in response to the native and non-native stimuli. Infants in the youngest group showed bilateral cortical activity that was greater overall in response to non-native relative to native speech; the oldest group showed left lateralized activity in response to native relative to non-native speech. These results highlight perceptual tuning as a dynamic process that happens across modalities and at different levels of stimulus complexity.PediatricClinical ResearchBehavioral and Social ScienceBasic structure is unaltered by plant invasion, vegetation clipping, and nitrogen fertilization in experimental semi-arid grasslandsCarey, J MichaelEviner, Valerie TMalmstrom, Carolyn MHart, Stephen C2015-01-01Global and regional environmental changes often co-occur, creating complex gradients of disturbance on the landscape. Soil microbial communities are an important component of ecosystem response to environmental change, yet little is known about how microbial structure and function respond to multiple disturbances, or whether multiple environmental changes lead to unanticipated interactive effects. Our study used experimental semi-arid grassland plots in a Mediterranean-climate to determine how soil microbial communities in a seasonally variable ecosystem respond to one, two, or three simultaneous environmental changes: exotic plant invasion, plant invasion + vegetation clipping (to simulate common management practices like mowing or livestock grazing), plant invasion + nitrogen (N) fertilization, and plant invasion + clipping + N fertilization. We examined microbial community structure 5-6 years after plot establishment via sequencing of >1 million 16S rRNA genes. Abiotic soil properties (soil moisture, temperature, pH, and inorganic N) and microbial functioning (nitrification and denitrification potentials) were also measured and showed treatment-induced shifts, including altered NO(-) 3 availability, temperature, and nitrification potential. Despite these changes, bacterial and archaeal communities showed little variation in composition and diversity across treatments. Even communities in plots exposed to three interacting environmental changes were similar to those in restored native grassland plots. Historical exposure to large seasonal and inter-annual variations in key soil properties, in addition to prior site cultivation, may select for a functionally plastic or largely dormant microbial community, resulting in a microbial community that is structurally robust to single and multiple environmental changes.Life on Landclippingenvironmental changeinvasive speciesMediterraneanmicrobial demonstrates spectroscopy (NIRS) as a flexible methodology for measuring cortical activity during overt speech production while avoiding some limitations of traditional imaging technologies. Specifically, language production research has been limited in the number of participants and the types of paradigms that can be reasonably investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - where a sensitivity to motion has encouraged covert (i.e., nonvocalized) production paradigms - and positron emission tomography (PET), which allows a greater range of motion but introduces practical and ethical limitations to the populations that can be studied. Moreover, for these traditional technologies, the equipment is expensive and not portable, effectively limiting most studies to small, local samples in a relatively few labs. In contrast, NIRS is a relatively inexpensive, portable, noninvasive alternative that is robust to motion artifacts associated with overt speech production. The current study shows that NIRS data is consistent with behavioral and traditional imaging data on cortical activation associated with overt speech production. Specifically, the NIRS data show robust activation in the left temporal region and no significant change in activation in the analogous right hemisphere region in a sample of native, English-speaking adults in a picture-naming task. These findings illustrate the utility of NIRS as a valid method for tracking cortical activity and advance it as a powerful alternative when traditional imaging techniques are not a viable option for researchers investigating the neural substrates supporting Distance from Birth through Childhood: Implications for NeuroimagingBeauchamp, Michael SBeurlot, John SBalaban, Evan2011-01-01Measurements of human brain function in children are of increasing interest in cognitive neuroscience. Many techniques for brain mapping used in children, including near-infrared spectroscopy use probes placed on or near the scalp. The distance between the scalp and the brain is a key variable for these techniques because optical, electrical and magnetic signals are attenuated by distance. However, little is known about how scalp-brain distance differs between different cortical regions in children or how it changes with development. We investigated scalp-brain distance in 71 children, from newborn to age 12 years, using structural T1-weighted MRI scans of the whole head. Three-dimensional reconstructions were created from the scalp surface to allow for accurate calculation of brain-scalp distance. Nine brain landmarks in different cortical regions were manually selected in each subject based on the published fNIRS literature. Significant effects were found for age, cortical region and hemisphere. Brain-scalp distances were lowest in young children, and increased with age to up to double the newborn distance. There were also dramatic differences between brain regions, with up to 50% differences between landmarks. In frontal and temporal regions, scalp-brain distances were significantly greater in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere. The largest contributors to developmental changes in brain-scalp distance were increases in the corticospinal fluid (CSF) and inner table of the cranium. These results have important implications for functional imaging studies of children: age and brain-region related differences in fNIRS signals could be due to the confounding factor of brain-scalp distance and not true differences in brain activity.Brain DisordersClinical ImagingUnderpinning ImagingParturitionScalpGeneral Science & Technologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of during listening spontaneous grammatical StephanieWinter, BodoMatlock, TeenieArdell, David HSpivey, Michael2014-01-01Recent research using on constrained visual contexts in particular goal-oriented contexts, viewing a small array of objects on a computer screen and performing some overt decision or identification. Eyetracking paradigms that use pictures as a measure of word or sentence comprehension are sometimes touted as ecologically invalid because pictures and explicit tasks are not always present during language comprehension. This study compared the comprehension of sentences with two different grammatical forms: the past progressive (e.g., was walking), which emphasizes the ongoing nature of actions, and the simple past (e.g., walked), which emphasizes the end-state of an action. The results showed that the distribution and timing of eye movements mirrors the underlying conceptual structure of this linguistic difference in the absence of any visual stimuli or task constraint: Fixations were shorter and saccades were more dispersed across the screen, as if thinking about more dynamic events when listening to the past progressive stories. Thus, eye movement data suggest that visual inputs or an explicit task are unnecessary to solicit analog representations of features such as movement, that could be a key perceptual component to grammatical comprehension.Basic Behavioral and Social ScienceClinical ResearchEye Disease and cognitionperceptual environment: Perspectives from the QuaternaryJackson, Stephen TBlois, Jessica L2015-04-21Community ecology and paleoecology are both concerned with the composition and structure of biotic assemblages but are largely disconnected. Community ecology focuses on existing species assemblages and recently has begun to integrate history (phylogeny and continental or intercontinental dispersal) to constrain community processes. This division has left a \"missing middle\": Ecological and environmental processes occurring on timescales from decades to millennia are not yet fully incorporated into community ecology. Quaternary paleoecology has a wealth of data documenting ecological dynamics at these timescales, and both fields can benefit from greater interaction and articulation. We discuss ecological insights revealed by Quaternary terrestrial records, suggest foundations for bridging between the disciplines, and identify topics where the disciplines can engage to mutual benefit.BiotaFossilsPaleontologyPollenTime Factorscommunity ecologyQuaternary paleoecologyclimate changeapplication/pdfCC-BY-NCeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/93d125m3articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt77h393jb2023-08-18T03:51:08Zqt77h393jbLinking Perceptual Tuning to LanguageFava, EswenHull, RachelBortfeld, Heather2011-01-01Little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie tuning to the native language(s) in early infancy. Here we review language tuning through the lens of type and amount of language experience and introduce a new manner in which to conceptualize the phenomenon of language tuning: the relative speed of tuning hypothesis. This hypothesis has as its goal a characterization of the unique time course of the tuning process, given the different components (e.g., phonology, prosody, syntax, semantics) of one or more languages as they become available to infants, and biologically based maturational constraints. In this review, we first examine the established behavioral findings and integrate more recent neurophysiological data on neonatal development, which together demonstrate evidence of early language tuning given differential language exposure even in utero. Next, we examine traditional accounts of sensitive and critical periods to determine how these constructs complement current data on the neural mechanisms underlying language tuning. We then synthesize the extant infant behavioral and neurophysiological data on monolingual, bilingual, and sensory deprived tuning, thereby scrutinizing the effect of these three different language profiles on the specific timing, progression, and outcome of language tuning. Finally, we discuss future directions researchers might pursue to further understand this aspect of language development, advocating our relative speed of tuning hypothesis as a useful framework for conceptualizing the complex process by which language experience works together with biological constraints to shape language development.PediatricNeurosciencesnear-infrared spectroscopyperceptual tuninglanguage developmentsensory deprivationmonolingual/bilingualPsychologyCognitive Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, subject to noise from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and bias from convergence in macromolecular compositions. Extensive variation in size, structure and base composition of alphaproteobacterial genomes has complicated their phylogenomics, sparking controversy over the origins and closest relatives of the SAR11 strains. SAR11 are highly abundant, cosmopolitan aquatic Alphaproteobacteria with streamlined, A+T-biased genomes. A dominant view holds that SAR11 are monophyletic and related to both Rickettsiales and the ancestor of mitochondria. Other studies dispute this, finding evidence of a polyphyletic origin of SAR11 with most strains distantly related to Rickettsiales. Although careful evolutionary modeling can reduce bias and noise in phylogenomic inference, entirely different approaches may be useful to extract robust phylogenetic signals from genomes. Here we develop simple phyloclassifiers from bioinformatically derived tRNA Class-Informative Features (CIFs), features predicted to target tRNAs for specific interactions within the tRNA interaction network. Our tRNA CIF-based model robustly and accurately classifies alphaproteobacterial genomes into one of seven undisputed monophyletic orders or families, despite great variability in tRNA gene complement sizes and base compositions. Our model robustly rejects monophyly of SAR11, classifying all but one strain as Rhizobiales with strong statistical support. Yet remarkably, conventional phylogenetic analysis of tRNAs classifies all SAR11 strains identically as Rickettsiales. We attribute this discrepancy to convergence of SAR11 and Rickettsiales tRNA base compositions. Thus, tRNA CIFs appear more robust to compositional convergence than tRNA sequences generally. Our results suggest that tRNA-CIF-based phyloclassification is robust to HGT of components of the tRNA interaction network, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. We explain why tRNAs are especially advantageous for prediction of traits governing macromolecular interactions from genomic data, and why such traits may be advantageous in the search for robust signals to address difficult problems in classification and phylogeny.AlphaproteobacteriaBacterial ProteinsComputational BiologyEvolutionMolecularGene Regulatory MartijnDepowski, NicoleBortfeld, HeatherKotz, often studied in isolated modalities, infants' experience with speech is largely multimodal (i.e., speech sounds they hear are accompanied by articulating faces). Across two experiments, we tested infants' sensitivity to the relationship between the auditory and visual components of audiovisual speech in their native (English) and non-native (Spanish) language. In Experiment 1, infants' looking times were measured during a preferential looking task in which they saw two simultaneous visual speech streams articulating a story, one in English and the other in Spanish, while they heard either the English or the Spanish version of the story. In Experiment 2, looking times from another group of infants were measured as they watched single displays of congruent and incongruent combinations of English and Spanish audio and visual speech streams. Findings demonstrated an age-related increase in looking towards the native relative to non-native visual speech stream when accompanied by the corresponding (native) auditory speech. This increase in native language preference did not appear to be driven by a difference in preference for native vs. non-native audiovisual congruence as we observed no difference in looking times at the audiovisual streams in Experiment 2.Clinical ResearchBehavioral and Social & Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/35c4p8d0articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt62m745fk2023-08-18T03:48:31Zqt62m745fkEven free radicals should follow some rules: A Guide to free radical research terminology and methodologyForman, oxidants are now implicated in physiological responses and in several diseases. Given the wide range of expertise of free radical researchers, application of the greater understanding of chemistry has not been uniformly applied to biological studies. We suggest that some widely used methodologies and terminologies hamper progress and need to be addressed. We make the case for abandonment and judicious use of several methods and terms and suggest practical and viable alternatives. These changes are suggested in four areas: use of fluorescent dyes to identify and quantify reactive species, methods for measurement of lipid peroxidation in complex biological systems, claims of antioxidants as radical scavengers, and use of the terms for reactive species.AnimalsAntioxidantsFluorescent DyesFree of nutritional antioxidants really work: Nucleophilic tone and Henry JDavies, Kelvin JAUrsini, Fulvio2014-01-01We present arguments for an evolution in our understanding of how antioxidants in fruits and vegetables exert their health-protective effects. There is much epidemiological evidence for disease prevention by dietary antioxidants and chemical evidence that such compounds react in one-electron reactions with free radicals in vitro. Nonetheless, kinetic constraints indicate that in vivo scavenging of radicals is ineffective in antioxidant defense. Instead, enzymatic removal of nonradical electrophiles, such as hydroperoxides, in two-electron redox reactions is the major antioxidant mechanism. Furthermore, we propose that a major mechanism of action for nutritional antioxidants is the paradoxical oxidative activation of the Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) signaling pathway, which maintains protective oxidoreductases and their nucleophilic substrates. This maintenance of \"nucleophilic tone,\" by a mechanism that can be called \"para-hormesis,\" provides a means for regulating physiological nontoxic concentrations of the nonradical oxidant electrophiles that boost antioxidant enzymes, and damage removal and repair systems (for proteins, lipids, and DNA), at the optimal levels consistent with good health.NutritionComplementary and Integrative HealthPrevention1.1 Normal biological development and functioningUnderpinning researchGeneric of 8 is transcriptionally regulated by and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, involved in protein folding. Its regulation is mostly unknown. We addressed both the functionality of two hypoxia-response elements (HREs) within the promoter, GPx8 HRE1 and HIF stabilizers, as diethyl succinate (DES) or 2-2'-bipyridyl (BP), induces GPx8 expression at both mRNA and protein level. Luciferase activity of pGL3(GPx8wt), containing a fragment of the GPx8 promoter including the two HREs, is also induced by DES/BP or by overexpressing either individual HIF subunit. Mutating GPx8 HRE1 within pGL3(GPx8wt) resulted in a activity than mutating GPx8 HRE2. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay showed that both HREs exhibit enhanced binding to a nuclear extract from DES/BP-treated cells, with stronger binding by GPx8 HRE1. In DES-treated cells transfected with pGL3(GPx8wt) but not HIF1, abolishes luciferase activity. Thus GPx8 is a novel HIF target preferentially responding to HIF2 binding at its two novel functional GPx8 HREs, with GPx8 HRE1 playing the major role. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) treatment increases GPx8 mRNA expression, and reporter gene experiments indicate that induction occurs via HIF. Comparing the effects of depleting GPx8 on the downstream effectors of FGF or insulin signaling revealed that absence of GPx8 results in a 16- or 12-fold increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 by FGF or insulin treatment, respectively. Furthermore, in GPx8-depleted cells, phosphorylation of AKT by insulin treatment increases 2.5-fold. We suggest that induction of GPx8 expression by HIF slows down proliferative signaling during hypoxia and/or growth stimulation through receptor tyrosine & Molecular University of mechanisms of redox signalingForman, Henry JayUrsini, FulvioMaiorino, Matilde2014-08-01A principal characteristic of redox signaling is that it involves an oxidation-reduction reaction or covalent adduct formation between the sensor signaling protein and second messenger. Non-redox signaling may involve alteration of the second messenger as in hydrolysis of GTP by G proteins, modification of the signaling protein as in farnesylation, or simple non-covalent binding of an agonist or second messenger. The chemistry of redox signaling is reviewed here. Specifically we have described how among the so-called reactive oxygen species, only hydroperoxides clearly fit the role of a second messenger. Consideration of reaction kinetics and cellular location strongly suggests that for hydroperoxides, particular protein cysteines are the targets and that the requirements for redox signaling is that these cysteines are in microenvironments in which the cysteine is ionized to the thiolate, and a proton can be donated to form a leaving group. The chemistry described here is the same as occurs in the cysteine and selenocysteine peroxidases that are generally considered the primary defense against oxidative stress. But, these same enzymes can also act as the sensors and transducer for signaling. Conditions that would allow specific signaling by peroxynitrite and superoxide are also defined. Signaling by other electrophiles, which includes lipid peroxidation products, quinones formed from polyphenols and other metabolites also involves reaction with specific protein thiolates. Again, kinetics and location are the primary determinants that provide specificity required for physiological signaling although enzymatic catalysis is not likely involved.

Using freshly isolated skin fibroblasts from RTT patients and healthy subjects, we have demonstrated in RTT cells high levels of H2O2 and HNE protein adducts. These findings correlated with the constitutive activation of NADPH-oxidase (NOX) and that was prevented by a NOX inhibitor and iron chelator pre-treatment, showing its direct involvement. In parallel, we demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial oxidant production, altered mitochondrial biogenesis and impaired proteasome activity in RTT samples. Further, we found that the key cellular defensive enzymes: glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin reductases activities were also significantly lower in RTT. Taken all together, our findings suggest that the systemic OS levels in RTT can be a consequence of both: increased endogenous oxidants as well as altered mitochondrial biogenesis with a decreased activity of defensive enzymes that leads to posttranslational oxidant protein modification and a between electronic and cigarette smoke in human keratinocytes effects of vaping is sparse and inconsistent, therefore, since the use of electronic cigarettes (e-CIGs) has become increasingly popular as a tool to limit tobacco smoking, it is urgent to establish the toxicity of the commercial e-CIGs. Skin (HaCaT) and lung (A549) cells, the main targets of cigarette smoke (CS), were exposed to e-CIG vapor and CS using an in vitro system. The cytotoxic effect of the exposure was analyzed in both cell types by ultrastructural morphology, Trypan Blue exclusion test and LDH assay. cytokines were measured by the Bio-Plex assay. The cytotoxic components of e-CIG were restrained to the flavoring compound and, to a lesser extent, to nicotine although their effects were less harmful to that of CS. Humectants alone exhibited no cytotoxicity but induced the release of cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators. Based on our results, we can state that exposure to e-CIG vapors results in far less toxic than exposure to CS. In fact, besides the deleterious effect of flavor and nicotine, even the humectants alone are able to evocate cytokines release. This study will hopefully promote the development of safer e-CIGs to help people quit smoking.Lung CancerLungCancerSubstance MisuseTobaccoTobacco SciencesToxicologyapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0fm2t3gkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt1xk580vw2023-08-18T03:20:46Zqt1xk580vwA critical review of assays for hazardous components of air pollutionForman, Henry JayFinch, Caleb Ellicott2018-03-01Increased mortality and diverse morbidities are globally associated with exposure to ambient air pollution (AAP), cigarette smoke (CS), and household air pollution (HAP). The AAP-CS-HAP aerosols present heterogeneous particulate matter (PM) of diverse chemical and physical characteristics. Some epidemiological models have assumed the same health hazards by PM weight for AAP, CS, and HAP regardless of the composition. While others have recognized that biological activities and toxicity will vary with components, we focus particularly on oxidation because of its major role in assay outcomes. Our review of PM assays considers misinterpretations of some chemical measures used for oxidative activity. Overall, there is low consistency across chemical and cell-based assays for oxidative and inflammatory activity. We also note gaps in understanding how much airborne PM of various sizes enter cells and organs. For CS, the body burden per cigarette may be much below current assumptions. Synergies shown for health hazards of AAP and CS suggest crosstalk in detoxification pathways mediated by AHR, NF-B, and Nrf2. These complex genomic and biochemical interactions frustrate resolution of the toxicity of specific AAP components. We propose further strategies based on targeted gene expression based on cell-type differences.Climate-Related Exposures and ConditionsTobaccoTobacco Smoke and & Molecular BiologypubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/1xk580vwpublicationoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt9ch2c9bk2023-08-18T03:15:28Zqt9ch2c9bkA Vision for Future Observations for Western U.S. Extreme EducationpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/9ch2c9bkarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt5nn148xk2023-08-18T03:13:24Zqt5nn148xkA Coordinated Analysis of Variance in Affect in Daily LifeScott, Stacey BSliwinski, Martin MSmyth, Joshua M2020-12-01Despite widespread interest in variance in affect, basic questions remain pertaining to the relative proportions of between-person and within-person variance, the contribution of days and moments, and the reliability of these estimates. We addressed these questions by decomposing negative affect and positive affect variance across three levels (person, day, moment), and calculating reliability using a coordinated analysis of seven daily diary, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and diary-EMA hybrid studies (across studies age = 18-84 years, total Npersons = 2,103, total Nobservations = to 74%); in EMA more within-person variance was attributable to momentary rather than daily level. Reliability was adequate to high at all levels of analysis (within-person: .73-.91; between-person: .96-1.00) despite different items and designs. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of future intensive studies of affect variance.Clinical ResearchAdolescentAdultAffectAgedAged80 and overAnalysis been evaluated for application to deep tissue in vivo molecular imaging using optical tomography. A combination of high material density, higher atomic number and efficient NIR luminescence from compatible lanthanide dopant ions indicates that particles that consist of ALnF4 (A = alkaline, Ln = lanthanide element) may offer a very attractive class of materials for high resolution, deep tissue imaging with X-ray excitation. NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs produced an X-ray excited luminescence that was among the most efficient of nanomaterials that have been studied thus far. We have systematically studied factors such as (a) the crystal structure that changes the lattice environment of the doped Eu3+ ions within the unit cell; and extrinsic factors such as (b) a gold coating (with attendant biocompatibility) that couples to a plasmonic excitation, and (c) changes in the NPs surface properties via changes in the pH of the suspending medium-all with a significant impact on the X-ray excited luminescence of NaGdF4:Eu3+NPs. The luminescence NaGdF4:Eu3+ nanoparticle was 25% more intense compared to that of a cubic structure. We observed evidence of plasmonic reabsorption of midwavelength emission by a gold NPs; the The NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs exhibited sensitivity to the ambient pH when excited by X-rays, an effect not seen with UV excitation. The sensitivity to the local environment can be understood in terms of the sensitivity of the excitons that are generated by the high energy X-rays (and not by UV photons) to crystal structure and to the surface state of the particles.BioengineeringNanotechnologyChemical SciencesEngineeringMaterialsapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/5878p1q1articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt0dh6b3d72023-08-18T02:39:20Zqt0dh6b3d7Alkaline earth atom doping-induced changes in the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene: a density functional theory studySerraon, Ace Christian Abraham BOcon, Joey D2021-02-03Density functional theory was used to investigate the effects of doping alkaline earth metal atoms (beryllium, magnesium, calcium and strontium) on graphene. Electron transfer from the dopant atom to the graphene substrate was observed and was further probed by a combined electron localization function/non-covalent interaction (ELF/NCI) approach. This approach demonstrates that predominantly ionic bonding occurs between the alkaline earth dopants and the substrate, with beryllium doping having a variant characteristic as a consequence of electronegativity equalization attributed to its lower atomic number relative to carbon. The ionic bonding induces spin-polarized electronic structures and lower workfunctions for Mg-, Ca-, and Sr-doped graphene systems as compared to the pristine graphene. However, due to its variant bonding characteristic, Be-doped graphene exhibits non-spin-polarized p-type semiconductor behavior, which is consistent with previous works, and an increase in workfunction relative to pristine graphene. Dirac half-metal-like behavior was doped and strontium doped graphene were predicted to have bipolar magnetic semiconductor behavior. These changes in the electronic and magnetic properties of alkaline earth doped graphene may be of importance for spintronic and other electronic device applications.Chemical Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/0dh6b3d7articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt84z7s16p2023-08-18T02:09:19Zqt84z7s16pPredictors of inschool and outofschool sport A SYStandage, MartynHagger, Martin SChan, Derwin KC2021-01-01The current study aimed to predict secondary school students' motivation toward sport injury prevention in \"in-school\" and \"out-of-school\" contexts, and their sport injury prevention behavior at 3-month follow-up using the trans-contextual model (TCM). Hong Kong secondary school students (N = 1566; mean age = 13.34 years, range = 11 to 19; female = 49.42%) were recruited. Participants were asked to complete a survey comprising previously validated scales measuring TCM constructs at baseline and a measure of sport injury prevention behavior at follow-up three months later. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the hypothesized paths among TCM constructs. A SEM specifying hypothesized paths among TCM variables showed acceptable fit with the data (2 (29) = 418.55, CFI = .93, TLI = .90, and RMSEA 90% CI [.09, .10], and SRMR = .05). Findings supported tenets of the TCM: the effects of perceived autonomy support from PE teachers on in-school autonomous motivation toward injury prevention, the trans-contextual relationship between students' \"in-school\" and \"out-of-school\" autonomous motivation toward injury prevention, and the effects of autonomous motivation toward injury prevention on social cognitive variables and subsequent sport injury prevention behaviors. Results supported the tenets proposed within the TCM in predicting students' \"in-school\" and \"out-of-school\" autonomous motivation toward sport injury prevention. Findings underscore the potential importance of autonomy support from PE teachers in facilitating students' sport injury prevention behaviors. Further longitudinal and intervention research is warranted to establish temporal and causal effects of TCM variables in sport injury prevention.PreventionBehavioral and Social SciencePhysical Injury - Accidents and Adverse EffectsGood Health and PhysiologySport Sciencesapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/84z7s16particleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt43m548nv2023-08-18T02:01:35Zqt43m548nvClimate, snow, and soil moisture data set for the Tuolumne and Merced river watersheds, C2019-01-01We present hourly climate data to force land surface process models and assessments over the Merced and Tuolumne watersheds in the Sierra Nevada, California, for the water year 2010-2014 period. Climate data (38 stations) include temperature and humidity (23), precipitation (13), solar radiation (8), and wind speed and direction (8), spanning an elevation range of 333 to 2987 m. Each data set contains raw data as obtained from the source (Level 0), data that are serially continuous with noise and nonphysical points removed (Level 1), and, where possible, data that are gap filled using linear interpolation or regression with a nearby station record (Level 2). All stations chosen for this data set were known or documented to be regularly maintained and components checked and calibrated during the period. Additional time-series data included are available snow water equivalent records from automated stations (8) and manual snow courses (22), as well as distributed snow depth and co-located soil moisture measurements (2-6) from four locations spanning the rain-snow transition zone in the center of the domain. Spatial data layers pertinent to snowpack modeling in this data set are basin polygons and 100 m resolution rasters of elevation, vegetation type, forest canopy cover, tree height, transmissivity, and extinction coefficient.

They currently comprise two genera and four species of extinct and extant taxa. The two extant species, Brachylophus fasciatus from Fiji, Tonga, and Vanuatu and Brachylophus vitiensis from western Fiji, are of considerable conservation concern with B. vitiensis listed as critically endangered. A recent molecular study has shown that Brachylophus comprised three evolutionarily significant units. To test these conclusions and to reevaluate the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Brachylophus, we generated an mtDNA dataset consisting of 1462 base pairs for 61 individuals from 13 islands, representing both Brachylophus species. Unweighted parsimony analyses and Bayesian analyses produced a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis supported by high bootstrap values and posterior probabilities within Brachylophus. Our data reject the monophyly of specimens previously believed to comprise B. fasciatus. Instead, our data demonstrate that living Brachylophus comprise three robust and well-supported clades that do not correspond to current taxonomy. One of these clades comprises B. fasciatus from the Lau group of Fiji and Tonga (type locality for B. fasciatus), while a second comprises putative B. fasciatus from the central regions of Fiji, which we refer to here as B. n. sp. Animals in this clade form the sister group to B. vitiensis rather than other B. fasciatus. We herein describe this clade as a new species of Brachylophus based on molecular and morphological data. With only one exception, every island is home to one or more unique haplotypes. We discuss alternative biogeographic hypotheses to explain their distribution in the Pacific and the difficulties of distinguishing these. Together, our molecular and taxonomic results have important implications for future conservation initiatives for the Pacific iguanas.Life on LandAnimalsBase adherence, and discontinuation among young app-using men who have sex with men in California (N = 761). Approximately, 9.7% of participants had ever used PrEP; 87% of those deemed good candidates for screening (indicated by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention risk index score 10) were not current or past users. PrEP use was associated with higher income [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 4.13; confidence interval and recent (aOR: 2.90; CI: 1.64 to 5.13). Some users (41.5%) wanted help remembering to take PrEP. The top reason for discontinuation was concern about long-term side effects (33.0%). Young men who have sex with men app users are prime candidates for PrEP, despite low uptake. Apps may be useful tools for PrEP information dissemination, adherence monitoring, and support.HIV/AIDSClinical ResearchPreventionClinical Trials and Supportive ActivitiesSexual and Gender of the western United HDettinger, Michael DRice, RobertDozier, Jeff2006-08-01Climate change and climate variability, population growth, and land use change drive the need for new hydrologic knowledge and understanding. In the mountainous West and other similar areas worldwide, three pressing hydrologic needs stand out: first, to better understand the processes controlling the partitioning of energy and water fluxes within and out from these systems; second, to better understand feedbacks between hydrological fluxes and biogeochemical and ecological processes; and, third, to enhance our physical and empirical understanding with integrated measurement strategies and information systems. We envision an integrative approach to monitoring, modeling, and sensing the mountain environment that will improve understanding and prediction of hydrologic fluxes and processes. Here extensive monitoring of energy fluxes and hydrologic states are needed to supplement existing measurements, which are largely limited to streamflow and snow water equivalent. Ground-based observing systems must be explicitly designed for integration with remotely sensed data and for scaling up to basins and whole ranges.

Not only is this view lacking in motivation, but conceiving of the desert base as part of the desert relation renders the concept of desert incoherent. Instead, desert should be thought of as a dyadic relation between a subject and an object, where desert bases are simply the grounds for dyadic desert facts.desertgroundingmetaphysics of desertPhilosophyapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/7006f2qvarticleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt3kf5g4wj2023-08-18T00:45:16Zqt3kf5g4wjIntraspecific trait variation across scales: implications for understanding global change responsesMoran, Emily VHartig, FlorianBell, David M2016-01-01Recognition of the importance of intraspecific variation in ecological processes has been growing, but empirical studies and models of global change have only begun to address this issue in detail. This review discusses sources and patterns of intraspecific trait variation and their consequences for understanding how ecological processes and patterns will respond to global change. We examine how current ecological models and theories incorporate intraspecific variation, review existing data sources that could help parameterize models that account for intraspecific variation in global change predictions, and discuss new data that may be needed. We provide guidelines on when it is most important to consider intraspecific variation, such as when trait variation is heritable or when nonlinear relationships are involved. We also highlight benefits and limitations of different model types and argue that many common modeling approaches such as matrix population models or global dynamic vegetation models can allow a stronger consideration of intraspecific trait variation if the necessary data are available. We recommend that existing data need to be made more accessible, though in some cases, new experiments are needed to disentangle causes of human perception of and response to a growing threat in the Western U.S.; and human health, transportation, and economic systems in growing western communities suffer due to increasingly severe and widespread fires. While modelling wildfire activity and associated wildfire smoke distributions have substantially improved, understanding how people perceive and respond to emerging smoke hazards has received little attention. Understanding and incorporating human perceptions of threats from wildfire smoke is critical, as decision-makers need such information to mitigate smoke-related hazards. We surveyed 614 randomly selected people (in-person) across the Boise Metropolitan Area in Idaho and 1,623 Boise State University affiliates (online), collecting information about their level of outside activity during smoke event(s), knowledge about the source of air quality information and effective messaging preference, perception of wildfire smoke as a hazard, and smoke-related health experiences. This relatively large dataset provides a novel perspective of people's perception of smoke hazards, and provides crucial policy-relevant information to decision-makers. Dataset is available to the public and can be used to address a wide range of research questions.Behavioral and Social ScienceBasic Behavioral and Social ScienceEnvironmental ExposureHumansIdahoSmokeSurveys and QuestionnairesWildfiresapplication/pdfpubliceScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/35b629j8articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt32c247752023-08-18T00:43:40Zqt32c24775Can Essentiality of Origin Save Meritocracy From The Luck Objection?Napoletano, Toby2023-04-01Abstract: Rawls famously argued against meritocratic conceptions of distributive justice on the grounds that the accumulation of merit is an unavoidably lucky process, both because of differences in early environment, and innate talents. Thomas Mulligan (2018a) has recently provided a novel defense of meritocracy against the \"luck objection\", arguing that both sources of luck would be mostly eliminated in a meritocracy. While a system of fair equality of opportunity ensures that differences in social class or early environment do not lead to differences in the accumulation of merit, Kripke's essentiality of origin thesis means that our genetic endowments, and thus our innate talents, could not have been any other way. But if we could not fail to have our innate talents, Mulligan argues, then it is not a matter of luck that we have them, and so the merits we accumulate on their basis are not so luck-dependent. This paper argues that Mulligan's appeal to the essentiality of origin thesis fails to rescue meritocratic conceptions of distributive justice from the luck objection for two reasons. First, even granting essentiality of origin and fair equality of opportunity, the contingencies of the market and the social environment mean that having some innate talents is far luckier than having others. And second, the appeal to essentiality of origin misses the underlying motivation for the luck objection, and ignores the intimate connection between desert and responsibility.Reduced InequalitiesMeritocracyDesertDistributive justiceLuckResponsibilityEssentiality of originApplied EthicsPhilosophyapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University Why grades cannot be deservedNapoletano, Toby2021-12-01It is typically thought that a student deserves\u2014or at least can deserve\u2014a grade in a class. The students who perform well on assessments, who display a high degree of competence, and who complete all of the required work, deserve a good grade. Students who perform poorly on assessments, who fail to understand the course material, and who fail to complete the required work, deserve a bad grade. In this paper, I raise a challenge to this conventional view about grades. In particular, I challenge the idea that grades\u2014understood appropriately\u2014can be objects of desert for class performance. In other words, grades are simply not the kind of thing that can be deserved. The argument is roughly as follows. In general, when some property or quality of ours is measured, where that property or quality is something that makes us deserving of something, the measurement, itself, is not the thing that is or could be deserved. Grades, however, are a measure of student performance, where performance is meant to be the basis on which students deserve their grades. Since they are mere measures of performance, grades are not and could not be deserved on the basis of performance, and so are not possible objects of desert. Rather, they serve as evidence of the desert basis (academic performance, e.g.) that grounds a student's being deserving of other objects (praise or recognition, e.g.). In short, grades, at best, measure how deserving one is, but grades themselves are not deserved.desertmeritgradeseducationPhilosophyapplication/pdfCC-BYeScholarship, University of Californiahttps://escholarship.org/uc/item/66r891w3articleoai:escholarship.org:ark:/13030/qt82w5b9w12023-08-18T00:40:47Zqt82w5b9w1A Multisite Preregistered project (k = 36; N = 3,531) to assess the size and robustness of ego-depletion effects using a novel replication method, termed the paradigmatic replication approach. Each laboratory implemented one of two procedures that was intended to manipulate self-control and tested performance on a subsequent measure of self-control. Confirmatory tests found a nonsignificant result (d = 0.06). meta-analyses using an informed-prior hypothesis ( = 0.30, SD = 0.15) found that the data were 4 times more likely under the null than the alternative hypothesis. Hence, preregistered analyses did not find evidence for a depletion effect. Exploratory analyses on the full sample (i.e., ignoring exclusion criteria) found a statistically significant effect (d = 0.08); Bayesian analyses showed that the data were about equally likely under the null and informed-prior hypotheses. Exploratory moderator tests suggested that the depletion effect was larger for participants who reported more fatigue but was not moderated by trait self-control, willpower beliefs, or task with reduced processing demandsSetoh, PeipeiScott, Rose MBaillargeon, Ren\u00e9e2016-11-22When tested with traditional false-belief tasks, which require answering a standard question about the likely behavior of an agent with a false belief, children perform below chance until age 4 y or later. When tested without such questions, however, children give evidence of false-belief understanding much earlier. Are traditional tasks difficult because they tap a more advanced form of false-belief understanding (fundamental-change view) or because they impose greater processing demands (processing-demands view)? Evidence that young children succeed at traditional false-belief tasks when processing demands are reduced would support the latter view. In prior research, reductions in inhibitory-control demands led to improvements in young children's performance, but often only to chance (instead of below-chance) levels. Here we examined whether further reductions in processing demands might lead to success. We speculated that: (i) young children could respond randomly in a traditional low-inhibition task because their limited information-processing resources are overwhelmed by the total concurrent processing demands in the task; and (ii) these demands include those from the response-generation process activated by the standard question. This analysis suggested that 2.5-y-old toddlers might succeed at a traditional low-inhibition task if response-generation demands were also reduced via practice trials. As predicted, toddlers performed above chance following two response-generation practice trials; toddlers failed when these trials either were rendered less effective or were used in a high-inhibition task. These results support the processing-demands view: Even toddlers succeed at a traditional false-belief task when overall processing demands radical C-H arylations highlight the interplay between chemical and physical rate processes in these multiphase reactions. Anomalous concentration dependences observed here may be reconciled by considering the role of phase transfer processes that mediate concentrations in each phase.

Here, our work provides valuable insights into interfacial structure and ionic interactions during alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The importance of inner-sphere OH- adsorption is demonstrated as the IrOx activity in 4.0 M KOH is 6.5 times higher than that in 0.1 M KOH. Adding NaNO3 as a supporting electrolyte, which is found to be inert for long-term stability, complicates the electrocatalytic reaction in a half cell. The nonspecially adsorbed Na+ in the outer compact interfacial layer is suggested to form a stronger noncovalent interaction with OH- through hydrogen bond than adsorbed K+, leading to the decrease of interfacial OH- mobility. This hypothesis highlights the importance of outer-sphere adsorption for the OER, which is generally recognized as a pure inner-sphere process. Meanwhile, based on our experimental observations, the pseudocapacitive behavior of solid-state redox might be more reliable in quantifying active sites for OER than that measured from the conventional EDL charging capacitive process. The interfacial oxygen transport is observed to improve with increasing electrolyte conductivity, ascribing to the increased accessible active sites. The durability results in a liquid alkaline electrolyzer which shows that adding NaNO3 into KOH solution leads to additional degradation of OER activity and long-term stability. These findings provide an improved understanding of the mechanistic details and structural motifs required for efficient and robust electrocatalysis.Affordable and Clean Energyoxygen DMai, Duy Ryan D2019-09-20Herein we report the development of radical benzylation reactions of quinones using Selectfluor and catalytic Ag(I) initiators.

Mothers reported on child maltreatment when participants were aged 5, 7, 10, and 12 years. Participants were interviewed about their vocational status at age 18 years.ResultsThe unadjusted odds of having low educational qualifications or of not being in education, employment, or training at age 18 years were more than 2 times greater for young people with a childhood history of maltreatment versus those without. These associations were reduced after adjustments for individual and family characteristics. Youths who reported having a supportive adult in their lives had better education outcomes than did youths who had less support.ConclusionsCloser collaboration between the child welfare and education systems is warranted to improve vocational outcomes for maltreated youths.PediatricChild Abuse and Neglect ResearchViolence Mechanisms for Depression among Racial/Ethnic Minority Youth: Empirical Findings, Issues, and RecommendationsScott, Sarah MWallander, Jan LCameron, Linda2015-12-01We (1) review empirical studies that report findings regarding putative protective mechanisms when exposed to risk of depression in African American and Hispanic adolescents; (2) identify key protective mechanisms for different risk contexts that garner empirical support; (3) synthesize the mechanisms identified as protective against depression among racial/ethnic minority adolescents; and (4) discuss improved methods for advancing understanding of resilience against depression in minority youth. The studies were selected from PsycINFO searches that met the following inclusion criteria: participants between 12 and 21 years of age, inclusions of racial/ethnic minority members, examining protection through an interaction with a risk factor, and outcome measures of depression, depressed mood, or depressive symptomatology. We found 39 eligible studies; 13 of which included multiple racial/ethnic groups. The following were supported as protective mechanisms, at least preliminarily, for at least one racial/ethnic group and in at least one risk context: employment, extracurricular activities, father-adolescent closeness, familism, maternal support, attending predominately minority schools, neighborhood composition, non-parent support, parental inductive reasoning, religiosity, self-esteem, social activities, and positive early teacher relationships. To investigate protective mechanisms more comprehensively and accurately across individual, social, and community levels of influence, we recommend incorporating multilevel modeling or multilevel growth curve analyses and large diverse samples.DepressionMental HealthPediatricBehavioral and Social SciencePreventionAetiology2.3 Psychologicalsocial and energy-inefficient cooling methods such as air conditioning would have a large impact on the global energy landscape.
