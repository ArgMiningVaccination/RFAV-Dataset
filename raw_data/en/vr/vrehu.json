NADA acupuncture isincreasingly recognized as a universally useful intervention inthe treatment of addictions specifically and in behavior health more generally. It is recognized as a best practice in the treatment of substance use disorders. Integrative programsusing the NADA protocol are likely to see improvements inengagement, retention, decreas ed drug cravings, anxiety, and less physical symptoms.Keywords: Acudetox, addiction, auricular acupuncture, behavioral health, dual diagnosis, ear acupuncture,NADA, National Acupuncture Detoxification Association, substance use disorders INTRODUCTION The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA)protocol is a unique form of acupuncture. It specifically tar-gets behavioral health, including addictions and co-occurringdisorders. The protocol involves the bilateral insertion of 1 Y5 needles into predetermined points on each ear (auricle). The predetermined points on the ear are sympathetic, Shen Men, kidney, liver, and lung points. These points have been shownto produce neurophysiologic, biochemical, endocrine, emo-tional, and cognitive effects. The NADA protocol is shown toreduce craving and withdrawal symptoms associated with ad-dictive substance use. It is consistently and reliably associatedwith improving engagement and retention (Center for Sub-stance Abuse Treatment, 2006; Helms, 1997). This is not a stand-alone treatment. It is to be used in a comprehensive in- tegrated substance abuse treatment program that promotessymptom relief and improves treatment retention by relievingacute and chronic distress in persons seeking recovery (Centerfor Substance Abuse Treatment, 2006). In addition, the NADA protocol is associated with a decrease in positive urine tests, increased program completion, improved patient satisfaction,and cost savings (Santasiero & Neussle, 2005). The NADA protocol is a nonverbal, nonthreatening inter- vention that has an immediate calming effect on patientsregardless of the specific substance used and regardless ofwhether a coexisting psychiatric disorder has been diagnosed.Initial participation with the NADA protocol improves in- volvement in the treatment process. In most programs, patients receive the five bilateral ear points of the NADA pro-tocol. The protocol can be easily and conveniently admin-istered in small or large group settings. This safe, effective,and cost-efficient procedure has gained increasing acceptancefrom agencies responsible for overseeing addiction treatmentover the past 40 years. More than 500 state addictions programs in the United States use some form of acupuncture (Substance Abuse andMental Services Administration, 2000). Over 1,500 addictionsprograms worldwide use some form of acupuncture (Reuben,2005). NADA protocol acupuncture is increasingly integratedinto dual diagnosis settings to help individuals with addictionand co-occurring disorders to better cope with a broad spec-trum of behavioral health issues. As a balancing treatment, it isof universal benefit, regardless of substance of abuse, in ame- liorating dysphoric states such as depression, anxiety, anger, impaired concentration, decreased energy, and body aches/headaches (Carter, Perlmutter, Norton, & Smith, 2011). ORIGINS Lincoln Hospital, a city-owned facility in the impoverishedSouth Bronx, launched the use of addictions acupuncture toaddress a public health crisis in the 1970s. Like today, the her-oin epidemic of that time overwhelmed the capacity of theexisting treatment system. What came to be known as ''TheLincoln Model'' was inspired by the anecdotal findings of a Hong Kong neurosurgeon (Wen, 1973), who observed that electrical stimulation of the ear lung point (vagus nerve) re-lieved opiate withdrawal symptoms. The Acupuncture RecoveryCenter subsequently discovered that simple manual needlingproduced a more prolonged effect and a reduction in cravingsfor alcohol as well as heroin (Shakur & Smith, 1979). Smith (1979) developed the NADA protocol initially guided by acupuncture theory and acupuncture analgesia research.

Thus, Shen Men, sym-pathetic, kidney, and liver were added to the original lungpoint (Bemis, 2013). The functions of each of the five pointsare as follows: sympathetic is related to disruption in bothsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It has astrong analgesic and relaxant effect on internal organs as it dilates blood vessels. Shen Men regulates excitation and inhi- bition of the cerebral cortex and can produce sedation. Lungis used for analgesia, sweating, and various respiratory condi-tions. Liver addresses symptoms associated with poor liverfunctioning and inflammation. Kidney is a strengthening pointfor the kidneys and can relieve mental weariness, fatigue, andheadaches. Traditional Chinese theory associates the pointswith physical and psychological states. The lung is associated with the grieving process, the liver is associated with resolving aggression, and the kidney is associated with willpower andcoping with fear (Landgren, 2008). Acupuncture points can be stimulated by various means: touch, movement, heat, and electricity as well as needling.Health-related procedures such as acupressure, shiatsu, reiki,healing touch, and tai chi work on principles similar to acu-puncture although no needles are involved. Needling is a convenient and efficient means of stimulating acupuncture points (Smith, Carter, Landgren, & Stuyt, 2011). The acupuncture needles are inserted in the outer ear to a depth of about one eighth of an inch and will penetratecartilage if it is present in that location. Needles are twirled180 degrees for smoother insertion. Notably, the arrangementof acupuncture points on the ear is similar to the arrangementof neurons in the motor cortex of the brain itself. A represen- tation of the entire body is thus achieved and is understood as a ''humunculus'' or microsystem that both reflects and affectsthe body's state of health and disease. The ear is one suchmicrosystem that is easily accessible. Thus, topographically,the outer ear can be represented artistically as an invertedfetus (Stux & Pomeranz, 2003; see Figure 1). NADA Protocol's Five Needle Points NADA was established in 1985 to provide a more uniform approach to the treatment of patients and the training ofpractitioners using ''The Lincoln Model. '' Reflective of this in-tention, the NADA mission statement is as follows (NADAAcupuncture Detoxification Association, n.d.): [NADA], a not-for-profit training and advocacy organiza- tion, encourages community wellness through the use of astandardized auricular acupuncture protocol for behavioral health, including addictions, mental health, and disaster and emotional trauma. We work to improve access and effec-tiveness of care through promoting policies and practiceswhich integrate NADA style treatment with (other) westernbehavioral health modalities. NADA provides a standardized training through the use of designated NADA registered trainers (RTs). RTs reference theNADA Training Resource Manual (NADA, 2010) to providenationally recognized certification of training completion based on the acquisition of a shared set of core competencies.Upon completion of training, practitioners are certified asacupuncture detoxification specialists (ADSs). The NADA protocol for addictions was developed outside the traditional network of acupuncture colleges and universities; most acu-puncture schools do not provide training in the NADA pro-tocol or addictions treatment. Acupuncture for addictions developed in grass-roots com- munity settings and ''in the trenches'' of public health addic-tion treatment programs. The NADA protocol was originallyprovided by anyone trained and certified as an ADS regardless of professional status, which included ADSs without formal medical, nursing, or full-body acupuncture training. The NADA protocol is administered efficiently in a group setting; one ADS is able to treat a group of 15 Y20 persons over the course of a treatment hour. Th is modality can be integrated into any inpatient or outpatient addiction program at any stageof the recovery process to treat a wide range of troublesomecomplaints. It is also easily deployed in the aftermath of acute disaster and trauma. It expands a c c e s sa n dr e m o v e sb a r r i e r st o care in individuals who are otherwise unlikely to receive it. It isimportant to emphasize that NADA protocol is standardizedand uses a specific point combination that does not change.This provides the rationale for why it can be administered byunlicensed practitioners who do not have formal training inmedical assessment or diagnosis. Patients may notice local effects such as warmth and tin- gling. Distal effects may include sensations of warmth or heaviness although these experiences are more typical of body Figure 1.

This reaction is part of the acute re-covery process and passes readily. A few patients can developa headache at the end of a treatment session. Shortening thelength of the session or reducing the number of needles re-solves this problem. Patients may have minimal bleeding afterthe needle is removed. Patients or staff may press a cotton swabto the site where the minimal bleeding has occurred. Postural hypotension is a rare needling reaction that may occur when needles are used. If this occurs, the patient willfeel dizzy and light-headed and may actually faint. When thisoccurs, the needles are removed, and the patient is helped tolie on a flat surface. The episode will resolve in a few minutes,and the patient will exhibit the typical relaxed behavior thatoften accompanies a full duration of treatment. Needling reac-tions occur more often in persons with a relatively labile auto- nomic nervous system and in those unaccustomed to a relaxed state. Patients should be told to eat something before comingfor treatment to reduce the possibility of a needling reaction. RESEARCH REVIEW AND GLOBAL ANECDOTESResearchers have noted the following specific physiologic ef-fects associated with acupuncture as cited in a comprehensive review of the acupuncture literature (Brewington et al., 1994). It has been reported that acupuncture at traditional pointsproduced effects in electroencephalogram, glomerular filtra-tion rate, blood flow, and respiratory rate, whereas stimula-tion of control points by acupuncture needles produced littleor no appreciable effect. Studies have linked acupuncture tothe production of endogenous peptides, such as beta endor-phins and metenkephalins. Acupuncture has also been as- sociated with in other neurotransmitters including adrenocorticotrophic hormone, serotonin, norepi-nephrine, and dopamine levels. Neuroanatomically, the ear isan elastic plate of connective tissue supplied by various cranialand spinal nerves (Cheng, 1999). The spinal nerves affect or-gans and systems locally and distally throughout the body.A biopsychosocial model reasons that acupuncture may in-fluence emotional responses and neurobiology through indi- vidual and group processes (Bradham, 2011). The effect of needling may be blunted in patients taking substantial quantities of met hadone, corticosteroids, and benzodiazepines. Exposure to these substances appears tosuppress part of the relaxation effect during treatment, andthese patients may have a slower response to treatment. Nev-ertheless, the NADA protocol can be used to treat secondaryaddiction in high-dose methadone patients and in patients on benzodiazepine taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms (Smith et al., 2010). Whereas the importance of neurotransmitters in addiction is well established, a complete understanding of NADA pro-tocol neuroscience implications is yet to be established. Moststudies evaluating the effectiveness of ear acupuncture havenot been placebo controlled. Knowledgeable researchers haveinterpreted and designed studies that do not use a placebocontrol. The placebo control model is most appropriate for pharmaceutical research. It is difficult, if not impossible, toapply placebo control standards to social science research.NADA protocol research is best understood as social scienceresearch specifically because it is not used as a stand-alonetreatment (Margolin, Avants, & Holford, 2002). There areno points on the ear or on the body that are truly inactivein the sense of the pharmaceutical ''sugar pill'' placebo. A naturalistic study design compared recidivism rates in three outpatient and four resi dential addiction treatment programs (Shwartz, Shaz, Muvey, & Brannigan, 1999). Thestudy found that addicts choosing NADA protocol treatmentas outpatients were less likely to relapse in the 6 months afterdischarge than patients who chose residential programs thatdid not include NADA protocol treatment. Two controlled clinical trials provide strong support of the NADA protocol as an adjunctive treatment for alcoholics (Bullock, 1987; Bullock, Culliton, & Olander, 1989). Thesestudies produced significantly better outcomes in the activegroup who received the NADA protocol on measures of atten-dance and self-reported need for alcohol. The control groupreported more than twice the number of drinking episodescompared with the active group who received NADA acupunc-ture. In addition, the control group had twice the number of readmissions during the follow-up period. Available evidence suggests that a substantial cost savings is realized when the NADA protocol is integrated into a com-prehensive treatment strategy (Santasiero & Neussle, 2005).Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed journals supportthe adjunctive use of the NADA protocol for the treatment ofheroin, alcohol, and cocaine addiction (Bergdahl, Berman, &Haglund, 1979; Shwartz et al., 1999; Washburn et al., 1993). Treatment of addiction is associatedwith lower community psychiatric hospital costs (SubstanceAbuse and Mental Services Administration, 2000). When theNADA protocol is combined with conventional treatment ina Health Maintenance Organization setting, an additional costsaving is realized (Santasiero & Neussle, 2005). Cost savingswere derived from higher program completion rates, in- creased number of negative urine screens, fewer inpatient rehabilitation days, fewer inpatient psychiatric days, and feweroutpatient detoxification episodes over the course of treatment(Santasiero & Neussle, 2005). Acupuncture may provide additional benefit in the treat- ment of depression and anxiety disorders associated with aco-occurring addiction disorder. For example, the Depart-ment of Veteran Affairs and the Department of Defense evidence-based guidelines reports ''the evidence is good'' that acupuncture may be helpful in the treatment of patients withposttraumatic stress disorder (retrieved from www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/ptsd/). In his comprehensive literature review, Bemis (2013) dis- cusses published qualitative reports, program evaluations,field reports, and news stories that show the value of theNADA protocol as an adjunctive intervention in disaster relief 184 www.journalofaddictionsnursing.com October/December 2014 Copyright \u00a9 2014 International Nurses Society on Addictions.

There isabundant documentation by NADA ADSs and RTs on theanecdotal use of the NADA protocol in disaster relief workthat is detailed in the NADA publication guide points (www.acudetox.com). ADSs assisted first responders by providingNADA treatment in the aftermath of the 9/11 World TradeCenter's attack and Hurricane Katrina. After the 2011 Joplin, MO, tornado disaster, 700 treatments were provided to offer relief from trauma, including finding body parts in the debris.Overwhelmingly positive results were realized with reported benefits including reduction in physical pain and improvedsleep (Bursac, 2011). A prospective research trial measured the effect of NADA acupuncture in seven common physical and behavioral healthsymptoms associated with addiction. This was done in a28-day addiction recovery setting where patients were non-randomized and self-selected. These symptoms were mea- sured on a 10-interval Likert scale and included body aches, headaches, low energy, cravings, anger, depression, anxiety, Figure 2. NADA policy chart, USA.

All patients re- ceived usual and customary conventional treatment, whichincluded intake assessment, physician physical examination,nursing and nurse practitioner care, administration of pre-scription medication, triage to urgent and emergency carewhen necessary, medical and psychiatric services as needed,educational groups, individual and group counseling, nightly12-step meetings, dual diagnosis group, aftercare planning, and the option of participating in either NADA protocol or a study hall free time. Patients in the treatment arm receivedbiweekly NADA protocol treatment plus the conventionaltreatment. Those in the treatment arm had statistically signif-icant symptom reduction across all seven common behavioralhealth symptom measures. Symptom reduction enhances theability to benefit from psychosocial aspects of treatment. Theseresults suggest that NADA acupuncture is a simple and inex- pensive treatment that may alleviate symptoms that negatively impact recovery in individuals with addiction. Further work needs to include long-term outpatient follow-up with NADA acupuncture to measure outcomes over monthsto years in community settings. Additional studies shouldalso evaluate the association of improvement in symptomswith severity of illness, course of illness, and reduction inoverall cost of care. NADA PROTOCOL AND STATE LAWS (SCOPE OF PRACTICE REGULATIONS)A patchwork of state laws exist with respect to the practiceNADA protocol by NADA-certified ADSs. Some states haveno official state guidelines; for example, in Michigan, morethan 500 ADSs practice under the auspices of the Departmentof Consumer and Industry Services. This allows ADSs with varying backgrounds Vincluding counselors, outreach workers, nurses, nurses' aides, social workers, psychologists, physicians,and correctional officers Vto provide the NADA protocol within their scope of practice without difficulty or restraint. NADA policies vary widely from state to state. Some are very restrictive, severely limiting who may provide and super-vise NADA protocol services. Where direct supervision isrequired, an ADS's ability to practice is not, in reality, much better off, because direct supervision requires an (expensive) physician or acupuncturist to be present on site each time atreatment is given. When supervision is legislated, general supervision is best. General supervision assumes (a) initial review and confirma-tion of written protocols appropriate for the particular treat-ment setting, (b) periodic onsite visits sufficient to assure thatthe established protocols are being followed, and (c) availabil- ity by electronic means to address questions or problems that may arise between visits. Program development thrives whensupervision is available at low or no additional cost to thetreatment program (see Figure 2). SUMMARY Most addiction and other behavioral health programs, becauseof the nature of the diseases being treated, have meager meansand must conserve all the resources they have. The NADA pro- tocol is an evidence-based best practice. With permissible lawsor welcoming community standards, it is an affordable serviceoption even for the least resourced programs. Cost of provid-ing the NADA protocol can be minimal when existing staff isused to administer treatment. Materials (acupuncture needles,cotton balls, cotton swabs, hand sanitizer, sharps container) areinexpensive and easy to obtain. Thus, by adding the NADA protocol to existing programs, patient outcomes can be im- proved without incurring any substantial increase in expense. Registered nurses represent the single largest group of li- censed healthcare professionals in the United States (AmericanNurses Association, 2011). Their education and extensivetraining in healthcare make them ideal candidates to supervise,as well as administer, NADA protocol treatment. Unfortu-nately, many state laws unreasonably restrict practice and supervision of NADA protocol to physicians and to full-body acupuncturists. This precludes many addictions programs from being able to use NADA protocol for the overwhelming numberof patients who would benefit. In many states, governmentalstatutes and regulations need to be revised to enable and em-power nurses to provide and supervise NADA protocol inestablished addiction treatment programs, behavioral healthprograms, community settings, integrated medical systems, and settings of disaster and trauma.
