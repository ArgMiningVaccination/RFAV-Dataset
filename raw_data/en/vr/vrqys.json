Okay ... bumblebees, butterflies, bunnies. Got it. But bedbugs? Oh, I think not! Bedbugs are not nice, not fluffy, not useful at all. They can lie dormant in your walls for a year without feeding, and then suddenly wake up hungry for blood. They can latch on to you in hotels, on busses, in dentists' offices ... anywhere people gather, sit, and can drop a critter or its eggs. Bedbugs are dirty, disgusting, and demoralizing. They creep, they crawl, and they cause a lot of alliteration in this blog. Bedbugs are embarrassing and their hosts are unwilling. An influx of bedbugs in your home is not exactly a topic of polite conversation: \"Johnny was accepted to Harvard; Suzie won her swim meet ... and we have bedbugs!\" Having gone online, I learned that the consensus was that the pesticides weren't very effective. There, I found reports of people spraying several times (exposing themselves and their families to dangerous chemical toxins) and having limited or no success. I read of three (non-chemical, ironically) treatments that actually worked: extreme heat, extreme cold, and diatomaceous earth. Here is a link to a source on Amazon: [Nature's Wisdom Food Grade DE. ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RDKKV6/)I have also found it at my local Home Depot. Since most of us can't easily heat a house to 115F (46C), nor was it possible to freeze the house at -26F (-32C), the choice was easy. Diatomaceous earth is stupidly inexpensive and much cheaper than cancer-causing sprays and bombs. Diatomaceous earth is a non-toxic silica dust. You can put it on your mattress, around the baseboards and all over the floor, in the electrical outlets, in the furniture, etc. I love that I can carry it with me when I travel. My assistant reports that she was plagued with them and left the diatomaceous earth for a week or two, then vacuumed up the dust. It makes a mess, she said, since it is a very fine powder. But she put up with it and reapplied twice. Eventually, she was deprived of their company for good. Bedbug bites - homeopathy of course So, what if it's too late and you find out that those nasty, bumpy bites are indeed from bed bugs? Now what? Why homeopathy of course! The first remedy to consider is [Ledum 30X ](https://www.boironusa.com/product/ledum-palustre/)every 3 hours if the itching is bad enough. This won't rid your bed or luggage, but it will certainly reduce the swelling, itching and restlessness. If the level of itching grows into an itching frenzy, then also consider [Arsenicum album ](https://www.boironusa.com/product/arsenicum-album/)6 or 30 every few hours. These remedies can be used for days if needed to reduce the effects of the bites. I love when solutions arise that give us self-sufficiency, cost only a few dollars, and are not only non-toxic but intelligent. A clever use of non-chemical products, homeopathy and self-education; the way to a life well-lived. I am a homeopath with a worldwide practice working with families and individuals via Zoom. I'm also a teacher and most importantly, a mom who raised my now-adult children depending on homeopathy over the last 31 years. I lived decades of my life with food intolerances, allergies, and chemical sensitivities until I was cured with homeopathy, so I understand pain, anxiety, and suffering. You may feel that your issues are more severe or different than anyone else's, but I have seen it all in my practice and in my work in India. My opinion is that nothing has come close to the reproducible, safe and effective results that my clients, students and I have achieved with homeopathy. Call today and learn how homeopathy might just be the missing piece in your health strategy.
