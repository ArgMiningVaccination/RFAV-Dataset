For those aged under 60 in Hong Kong, the German-developed vaccine significantly limited even mild cases of Omicron after just one jab. In contrast, for mild infections, Sinovac's shot had no detectable impact after one or two doses, and offered only about half the protection of the mRNA vaccine after three (about 40%). The implications for China are grim. Just slightly more than 50% of the population has been boosted and, by March 17th, less than half of those aged over 70 had received a third dose, according to the country's National Health Commission. Many old people are not vaccinated at all. China initially approved shots only for healthy people under 60, leading to concerns that [they might be dangerous](/china/2022/04/02/why-so-many-elderly-chinese-are-unvaccinated). With vaccines that do a poorer job of limiting infection, transmission will be high. Although the Chinese government on April 4th cleared another domestic mRNA vaccine candidate for clinical trials, these vaccines are not in arms yet. A push to get the elderly vaccinated, and those already with jabs boosted, seem the only way back to normal.
