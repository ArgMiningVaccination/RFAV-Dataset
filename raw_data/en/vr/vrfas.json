Consider the patient who comes in seeking relief from chronic shoulder pain, only to discover that the remedy lies not just in some form of anatomical adjustment, but more importantly, in addressing their struggle to discern what is best for them in life; to separate the \"pure\" from the \"impure\" is the duty of the Small Intestine, whose channel courses in and around the scapula; and discernment is one aspect of the spirit of the Spleen Yi (one of the 5 spirits discussed below). Healing may also entail creating space for the expression of some repressed emotion that has been aching to be freed. This type of experience is quite common in my office, and I often guide my patients in exercises that aim to identify the ways in which thoughts, emotions, and spiritual quandaries live in the tissues of the body. Furthermore, through the lens of Chinese Medicine, the human body is perceived as a microcosm of the Earth, and Earth a microcosm of the Universe at large. And like any good gardener (of planet or cosmos), the goal of Chinese Medicine is to recreate a harmonious milieu and revive the wisdom of the spirit written in the matrix of your very being. The Three Treasures: Jing, Qi, and ShenIn TCM These 3 elements constitute life itself, and a vital and fulfilling life depends upon their balanced integration. While I'll focus on Shen here, please know that each treasure is deserving of much more attention than this post can offer, and I encourage you to dig deeper on your own (or with your studied acupuncturist/herbalist). Jing, the most substantial of the three, is our essence, our holistic innate strength. Qi is our life force, the intelligent and organized metabolism that makes life tick. Shen is our SPIRIT or personality, the inhabitant of our Heart, that territory of consciousness, thought, and emotion. The Heart is the expression of spirit within matter, Shen within Jing.\"Chinese masters say it is through Shen that we radiate ourselves into the world. This 'spiritual radiance' manifests as our wisdom, emotional well being, and ability to see all sides of an issue... Shen draws our attention to the divine. It contributes to wisdom, virtue, and calmness, and maintains our whole being in order\" (Joswick). When our Shen is in harmony, our eyes are luminous and attentive, and we live with ease and purpose, with clear awareness. We feel connected to something greater, to the mysterious and divine source of life itself. When our Shen is disturbed (primarily as a result of lifestyle, trauma, or extreme emotion), we may struggle with anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, dull thought, poor memory, or in extreme scenarios, mental illness. TCM offers many techniques for tending to the Shen, including: meditation, Tai Qi and Qi Gong, and acupuncture and herbal remedies, such as DAO's Physical and Mental Tranquility formulas. The Five Shen The Shen of the Heart is considered the Emperor in TCM, but it is only one manifestation of spirit in our beings. Under its rule reside four loyal ambassador shens or spirits, each associated with a different Yin organ system. The Five Shen are as follows: In the theory of TCM, the mind and the body of a person are inseparable; to have good health one must have good spirit and pay attention to cultivating one's spirit. TCM is a field that is profoundly influenced by traditional Chinese philosophy and religion. In many TCM classic writings, we can find religious concepts and practices. This article examines six aspects of TCM: the history of TCM; fundamental beliefs of TCM; spirituality in traditional Chinese healing rituals; spirituality in the traditional Chinese pharmacy; spirituality in health maintenance theories; and the spirituality of "}
