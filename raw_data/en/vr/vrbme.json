19NorthShore University HealthSystem Administrative Directives Manual AD-1032 Area Affected: Organization Wide Financial Assistance Policy 1. POLICY: The fundamental purpose of NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore) is to provide quality health care and health-related services that effectively and efficiently meet the needs of individuals and families who reside in the communities served by NorthShore. For purposes of this policy, NorthShore refers to the non-profit hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital, Highland Park Hospital, Skokie Hospital, Swedish Hospital, and Northwest Community Hospital and Northwest Community Day Surgery Center II (collectively, NCH) . Where policy differences apply to Swedish Hospital and NCH, those differences are separately identified. Co nsistent with NorthShore's values of compassion and stewardship, it is the policy of NorthShore to provide financial assistance to patients in need. Furthermore, the purpose of this Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) is to provide the framework under which financial assistance will be granted to patients for emergency or medically necessary care provided by NorthShore to those that reside in the commnuities that we serve. T his policy identifies the specific criteria and application process under which NorthShore will extend financial assistance to individuals whose financial status makes it impossible to pay fully for the services. Note that certain individuals are presumptively eligible to receive services at no cost (see section 4.E). T his policy applies to all emergency or medically necessary care provided by a NorthShore hospital. This policy is not binding upon providers of medical services outside of the hospital. In Exhibit 1 of the FAP , you can find information on providers delivering emergency or other medically necessary care in the hospital facility whose services are covered as part of this policy and a list of providers whose services are not covered as part of this policy. Note that provider services are covered only if you are found to be eligible for financial assistance in accordance with this policy. Free paper copies of the Exhibit 1 are available as part of the FAP online at www.northshore.org/about-us/billing/financial- assistance or www.swedishcovenant.org/for-patients-and-visitors/pay-your-bill/financial-assistance or www.nch.org/billing-insurance/financial-assistance/ or upon request in the emergency department and hospital registration areas. Free paper copies are also available by mail by calling (847) 570-5000 or (773) 989-3841 for Swedish Hospital or (847) 618-4542 for NCH. NorthShore may exclude services from this policy that are covered by an insurance program at another provider location but are not covered at NorthShore after efforts are made to educate the patient on insurance program coverage limitations and provided that federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) obligations are satisfied. This policy describes the criteria used by NorthShore in calculating the amount of the financial assistance discount, if any, the measures NorthShore will take to widely publicize this FAP within the community served by NorthShore, the process used by NorthShore to determine financial assistance eligibility, and the financial assistance application process. The actions NorthShore may take in the event of nonpayment are described in a separate Billing and Collections Policy . That policy can be downloaded on NorthShore's website at www.northshore.org/about- us/billing/financial-assistance or www.swedishcovenant.org/for-patients-and-visitors/pay- your-bill/financial-assistance or www.nch.org/billing-insurance/financial-assistance/ or a free paper copy is available in the emergency department and hospital registration areas or by mail by calling (847) 570-5000 or (773) 989-3841 for Swedish Hospital or (847) 618-4542 for NCH. To be eligible for financial assistance, you must complete and submit a financial assistance application (for patients who are not presumptively eligible) along with any required supporting documentation. Financial assistance applications are due no later than 240 days after the date of the first billing statement sent for the services for which you are requesting financial assistance. Exceptions may be granted as described later in this policy. Nothing in this policy takes precedence over federal, state or local laws or regulations currently in effect today or in effect in the future. Final authority to determine whether NorthShore has made reasonable efforts to determine FAP eligibility resides with NorthShore's Single Business Office, Swedish Hospital's Financial Services Center, and NCH's Patient Services Center . This policy is intended to benefit NorthShore's community consistent with its values of compassion and stewardship. The existence of this FAP does not constitute an offer of financial assistance to any particular patient and creates no contractual rights or obligations. This FAP may be updated by NorthShore in its sole discretion. 20Financial Assistance Policy AD-1032 Page 2 of 16 The policies and procedures stated herein are intended to comply with Illinois state regulations and section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code and related guidance. 2. SCOPE: This policy applies to all emergency or medically necessary care provided by a NorthShore hospital. This policy is not binding upon providers of medical services outside of the hospital. In Exhibit 1 of the FAP , you can find information on providers delivering emergency or other medically necessary care in the hospital facility whose services are covered as part of this policy and a list of providers whose services are not covered as part of this policy. Note that provider services are covered only if you are found to be eligible for financial assistance in accordance with this policy. 3. DEFINITIONS: Application - Means an application for financial assistance to be completed by a patient. Application Period - During the application period, NorthShore will accept and process an application for financial assistance. The application period begins on the date the care is provided to the individual and ends on the 240th day after the date of the first billing statement for the care. Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) - Patients who qualify for financial assistance will not be charged more for emergency or medical necessary care than the amounts generally billed (AGB) to patients who have insurance. 1) The NorthShore AGB percentage is calculated us ing the \"look -back\" method, which is the total of Medicare fee -for- service and private health insurer allowed claims divided by the total gross charges for those claims for a 12-month period. Discounts provided to patients who qualify for financial assistance will be reviewed against the AGB percentage limits to ensure patients are not charged more than AGB. 2) AGB percentages can be found in Exhibit 2 of the FAP. 3) A revised AGB percentage will be calculated annually and applied by the 120th day after the start of the year. Cost of Services Provided - The usual and customary charges at the time of initial billing, multiplied (reduced) by the hospital's relationship of costs to charges (also referred to as the hospital's \"cost to charge ratio\") taken from NorthShore's most recently filed Medicare cost report.

Elective services include procedures that are advantageous to the patient, but not urgent and include medically necessary services and non-medically necessary services, such as cosmetic and dental surgery performed solely to improve appearance or other elective procedures not typically covered by health insurance plans. Elective services that are not medically necessary will not be considered for financial assistance. Emergency Services - Services provided to a patient for a medical condition with acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse), such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the health of the individual (or with respect to a pregnant woman, the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy, or cause serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

The levels of financial assistance provided by NorthShore are based on income, family size, and FPL. Both uninsured and insured patients can apply for financial assistance; and vii. The patient's eligibility for financial assistance will be based on the tables below and may vary based on the financial status of the patient, extenuating financial circumstances and the availability of third party health care benefits. Eligibility guidelines will be revised annually after the poverty level guidelines are published by the federal government and will also include NorthShore's most recently filed Medicare cost to charge ratios. Families with incomes exceeding the guidelines stated below can be screened for payment plan consideration. C. Uninsured Patient Financial Assistance Eligibility : Based on the federal poverty levels, the following table shall be used to determine the discounts offered to uninsured patients qualifying for financial assistance. Discounts provided to patients who qualify for financial assistance will be reviewed against the AGB percentage limits to ensure patients are not charged more than AGB. FPL Tier 0% - 200% FPL 201% 301% - $0 PMT / 100% write -off 100% of the Cost of Services Provided 100% of the Cost of Services Provided AGB Percentage (see Exhibit 2) Annual Maximum Expected Patient Payment $0 PMT / 100% write -off 20% of Annual Family Income 20% of Annual Family Income 20% of Annual Family Income i.FPLs can be found in Exhibit 3 of the FAP and AGB percentages for each hospital can be found in Exhibit 2 . 24Financial Assistance Policy AD-1032 Page 6 of 16 ii. Expected payment for NorthShore hospital charges is determined by reducing hospital charges for medically necessary services on the uninsured patient's bill to 100% of the hospital's cost to charge ratio for patients with family income between two and four times the FPL, or amounts generally billed for patients with family income between four and six times the FPL. A revised percentage will be calculated annually and applied by the 120th day after the start of the year. The NorthShore discount percentages by FPL tier can be found in Exhibit 4 . The Swedish Hospital discount percentages by FPL tier can be found in Exhibit 5 . The NCH discount percentages by FPL tier can be found in Exhibit 6 . iii. In compliance with the Illinois Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act (210 ILCS 89/1) effective 1/1/2022 , eligibility for financial assistance is restricted to patients with Illinois residency and medically necessary charges exceeding $150. Also in compliance with this law, NorthShore has compared the discounts for 135% of the hospital's cost to charge ratio to the amounts generally billed and have applied the more generous discounts for patients. iv. NorthShore will offer uninsured patients who received community-based primary care provided by a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)/community health center or a free and charitable clinic, are referred by such an entity to NorthShore, and seek access to nonemergency hospital-based health care services, with an opportunity to be screened for an assistance with applying for public health insurance programs if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the uninsured patient may be eligible for a public health insurance program. An uninsured patient who receives community-based primary care provided by an FQHC/community health center or free and charitable clinic and is referred by such an entity to the hospital for whom there is not a reasonable basis to believe that the uninsured patient may be eligible for a public health insurance program shall be given the opportunity to apply for hospital financial assistance when hospital services are scheduled. D. Insured Patient Financial Assistance Eligibility : Based on the FPLs, the following table shall be used to determine the discounts offered to insured patients qualifying for financial assistance. Patients may request financial assistance consideration for the balance remaining (i.e., self-pay balance) after their health insurance has paid for medically necessary services. Financial assistance for insured patients is restricted to patients with a patient balance remaining of $150 or greater. Discounts provided to patients who qualify for financial assistance will be reviewed against the AGB percentage limits to ensure patients are not charged more than AGB. The NorthShore discount percentages by FPL tier can be found in Exhibit 4 . The Swedish Hospital discount percentages by FPL tier can be found in Exhibit 5 . The NCH discount percentages by FPL tier can be found in Exhibit 6 . Families with family incomes exceeding the guidelines stated below can be screened for payment plan consideration. FPL Tier 0% - 200% FPL 201% - 400% FPL Expected Patient / 100% write - off AGB Percen tage times remaining self -pay balance FPLs can be found in Exhibit 3 of the FAP and AGB percentages for each hospital can be found in Exhibit 2 . E. Presumptive Eligibility : Uninsured patients may be determined eligible for financial assistance based on the presence of one of the criteria listed below. After at least one criterion has been demonstrated, no other proof of income will be requested. The list below is representative of circumstances in which a patient's family income is less than two times the FPL and the patient is eligible for a 100% reduction of medically necessary charges. Presumptive eligibility screening for an uninsured patient should be completed as soon as possible after receipt of medically necessary services and prior to the issuance of any bill for those services. When notified of a possible presumptive eligibility status, NorthShore will hold any patient statement during the completion of the presumptive eligibility review process. Also, NorthShore can work with external charitable and non-profit agencies to pre-approve individuals for presumptive eligibility in extenuating circumstances. Examples of these agencies include federally qualified health clinics or religious non-profit organizations. i. Presumptive Eligibility Criteria is demonstrated by enrollment in one of the following programs: a) Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC) b) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) c) Illinois Free Lunch and Breakfast Program d) Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) e) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) f) Illinois Housing Development Authority's Rental Housing Support Program 25Financial Assistance Policy AD-1032 Page 7 of 16 g) Organized community-based program or charitable health program providing medical care that assesses and documents low income financial status as criteria h) Medicaid eligibility, but not eligible on date of service or for non-covered service ii.Presumptive Eligibility Criteria can also be demonstrated by the following life circumstances: a)Receipt of grant assistance for medical services b) Homelessness c)Deceased with no estate d) Mental incapacitation with no one to act on patient's behalf e)Recent personal bankruptcy f)Incarceration in a penal institution g) Affiliation with a religious order and vow of poverty h) Evidence from an independent third-party reporting agency indicating family income is less than two times FPL iii. Ways to demonstrate Presumptive Eligibility include: a)Electronic confirmation of program enrollment or other presumptive eligibility criteria. b) Where independent electronic confirmation is not possible, proof of enrollment or other eligibility criteria will be requested. Any one of the following will be satisfactory proof: 1.WIC voucher 2.SNAP card, proof of enrollment screen print, or copy of SNAP approval letter 3.Letter from the school or Free/Reduced Priced Meals & Fee Waiver Notification with Signature 4.LIHEAP Award or Approval letter 5.TANF Approval Letter from Red Cross, DHS, or HFS 6.Rent receipt in the case of state or federally subsidized housing progr am 7.Rent adjustment letter from Lessor or HUD card or letter 8.Card or Award statement showing current eligibility for State of Illinois program 9.Statement from Grant Agency or Grant letter 10.Personal attestation or letter from church or shelter confirming homelessness 11.Letter from attorney, group home, shelter, religious order, or church 12.Notice of Discharge of Debtor that identifies NorthShore as a creditor included in bankruptcy filing F. Eligibility Timeline : i.For uninsured patients, financial assistance determinations will be effective retrospectively for all self-pay balances dated during the application period and prospectively for a period of at least six months without further action by the patient. The patient shall communicate to NorthShore any mate rial change in the patient's financial situation that occurs during the six month period that may affect the financial assistance determination within thirty (30) days of the change. A patient's failure to disc lose a material improvement in family income may void any provision of financial assistance by NorthShore after the material improvement occurs. Presumptive eligibility determinations for uninsured patients may be effective retrospectively for all open self-pay balances. ii.For insured patients, financial assistance determinations will be effective retrospectively for all self-pay balances dated during the application period and prospectively for a period of at least six months without further action by the patient. G. Final Screening for Financial Assistance Eligibility Determinations : There are instances when a patient may appear eligible for financial assistance, but there is no application on file or there is a lack of supporting documentation. In thi s event, external agencies' data and/or NorthShore's accounts receivable payment/charity/bad debt history or membership with the NorthShore Community Health Center at Evanston Hospital or Erie Family Health Center may be used to determine insurance and employment status and to estimate income for financial assistance determinations. NorthShore will approve financial assistance for patients whose financial status has been verified by a third party (e.g., credit scoring). In these situations, a financial assistance adjustment may be posted to the patient account and will not require the patient to submit a financial assistance application. Financial status confirmation through a third party may be done using the Experian Payment Navigator or other third party sources. H. Urgent or Medically Necessary Services : Financial assistance is limited to urgent or medically necessary services rendered in a hospital setting . Nothing in this section is intended to change NorthShore's obligations or practices pursuant to federal or state law respecting the treatment of emergency medical conditions without regard to the patient's ability to pay. 26Financial Assistance Policy AD-1032 Page 8 of 16 I.

S ervice Area Map 59Understanding and Responding to Community Health Needs NS-EEH's mission is helping everyone in its communities be their best. Centra l to this mission is a commitment to providing clinical programs and services t hat meet community health needs, while also pursuing continuous improvement to identify and understand future needs. As such, hospitals within the NS-EEH system conduct Communit y Health Needs Assessments (CHNA's) every three years, in accordance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This comprehensive CHNA process is a collaboration with community partners, using primary an d secondary data, to identify, prioritize and address health issues within the service areas. The process ensures that community benefit programs and resources are focused on significant health needs as perceived by the community at large, as well as align ment with NS -EEH's mission, services and strategic priorities. Internal and community stakeholders review the data and prioritize issues and opportunities based on an assessment of: Magnitude: the size of the population affected and the degree of variance from benchmarks and trends Impact/Seriousness: the degree to which the issue affects or exacerbates other quality of life and health -related issues Feasibility: the ability to reasonably impact the issue given available resources Consequences of inaction: the risk of not addressing the problem at the earliest opportunity Below are the links to full CHNAs for each entity within the health system: Edward - Elmhurst Health (inclusive of Edward, Elmhurst and Linden Oaks Hospitals) www.eehealth.org/CHNA NorthShore (inclusive of Evanston, Glenbrook, Highland Park and Skokie Hospitals) www.northshore.org/CHNA Northwest Community H ealthcare www.nch.org/CHNA Swedish Hospita l www.swedishcovenant.org/CHNA Implementation Strategy Plans (ISP) are developed to outline how the hospital plans to address prioritized health needs and are meant to align the hospital's initiatives and programs with goals, objectives and indicators that address significant community health needs.

By improving data collection efforts in these areas, NS -EEH is able to better understand its patients, which allows the organization to 1) u se preferred language to improve communication, understanding , and build better relationships between patients and caregivers and 2) identify groups of patients that are not receiving the same desired high -quality care and/or results .

In the next few years, NS-EEH plan s to achieve best practice of <5% of its patients in a general category of \"other,\" \"declined,\" or \"unknown\" category for race and ethnicity. Each part of the organization has an improvement goal over last year with the exception of NCH, which is already in the best practice range (and their goal is to maintain best practice). Entity Current % Goal for 2022 EEH 5.6% (SDOH) - Enhancing screening opportunities for SDOH allows for better understand ing of challenges and barriers that community members face, providing the opportunity for navigation to critical resources and services they may need. NS- EEH is piloting collection of social determinants of health in five areas, including: 1.Food insecurity 2.Housing instability 3.Barriers to transportation 4.Interpersonal violence 5.Financial resource strain T his information helps strengthen understanding to adjust plans of care to meet patients where they are at and/or connect patients to important community resources, such as a food pantry . Starting in January of 2024, NS- EEH will collect SDOH for all individuals admitted to one of its hospitals . In addition to asking patients these que stions, NS- EEH is integrating two new pieces of technology to support this work: A Natural Language Processing tool to review notes that physicians and the care team have previously documented in the patient chart. Anywhere it has been documented that a pa tient is /was in need of resources for one of these areas of SDOH, this technology will highlight and bring the note to the care teams' attention . Find Help tool integration into electronic health record s. This \"directory\" will help care team s id entify grou ps in the community that may be able to connect the patient to resources in thes e S DOH areas.

Heal thy Driven Chicago - This program focuses on providing educational resources and information to feel empowered and in control of one's health. It is provided through a partnership between Edward - Elmhurst Health and ABC7 Chicago. He althy Driven Families - This community facing electronic platform was created to educate, guide and support parents and families in a preventive lifestyle, with a goal of effecting change in childhood obesity rates. Key areas of focus include healthy eating, exercise, and sleep habits. In addition, families are linked to a variety of resources including nutrition consults, mental health, primary care, fitness programs, food pantries and mental health organizations. Pa tient/Family Advisory Committee - The Patient/Family Advisory Committee (PFAC) strives to incorporate the perspective of patients and families into the design and evaluation of Edward -Elmhurst Health processes, services, environment, equipment and patient communication. The committee include s patients, their family members and employees. Co mmunity Investment Fund - In August 2021, the EEH Board of Trustees approved the establishment of a Community Investment Fund with an initial $100 million investment to provide annual grant funding to comm unity organizations aligned with the following goals: Advancing Health and well -being (health equity and social determinants of health) Local economic growth (supply chain diversity and job creating prioritizing DEI principles). Th is fund was a key component of EEH's merger with NorthShore University Health System to form NorthShore - Edward -Elmhurst Health, demonstrating the organization's commitment to vibrant, community -connected care. With 46 applicants and requests in excess of $41M, EEH awarded nearly 86$4M in Community Investment Fund grants to 14 organizations in EEH's service area during the inaugural year of this program. These organizations are addressing a broad spectrum of identified community needs including mental health programming, acce ss to services, health literacy, food insecurity, housing, job creation and career development. A liaison program was established to connect EEH leaders with each funded organization to discuss the program and its progress on key performance metrics as wel l as any obstacles and potential for additional partnership opportunities. Key Accomplishments from CHNA Implementation Strategy Plan Addre ssing A ccess to Healthcare EEH' s Physician Services Department recruited over 100 providers (physicians and advanced practice providers) which allowed for growth in the local employed/affiliated provider network from 631 to 665 (+5%), thus increasing access throughout the community. Furth er, the primary care provider network conducted more than 400,000 Medicaid and Medicare visits which represented nearly one third of total primary care visit volume. EEH continues to recruit into specialties where access andservice gaps have been prioritized within the community including psychiatry, primary care,endocrinology and rheumatology. Informing under - and uninsured patients that financial assistance is available is an important part of EEH's plan to increase patient access to essential health c are services. EEH proactively screens patients, identifies those in need of assistance and guides them to appropriate next steps based on their unique financial circumstances. EEH's ongoing partnership with DuPage Health Coalition is an important componen t of the Access to Healthcare strategy. Ch ronic Disease ( Improving Early Detection, Prevention and Wellness ) Obe sity The Endeavor Program is a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to weight loss including surgical, medical and lifestyle modifications for individuals aged 16 and older. During the planning cycle , EEH expanded access to two new locations, Plainfield and Lombard, expanding beyond the existing clinics in Naperville, Elmhurst and Hinsdale. In addition, EEH established a new pediatricweight loss clinic for children 15 and younger. During the last few years, over 30,000 patient weightloss visits were co mpleted and over 300 bariatric surgical procedures were performed. Led by a registered dietitian and trained lifestyle coach, Jump Start your Health is a year- long lifestyle change program accredited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to helppeople lose weight, increase activity, and prevent disease. The research -based curriculum helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes and adopt healthy lifestyle habits aimed to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Over the course of t he FY20 -22 planning cycle, the program was expanded to include participants by adding a virtual component to improve access for community members. The Healthy Driven Families robust resource is automatically included in the patients After Visit Summary (AV S) for all at -risk pediatric patients, which provides families with important guidance on available resources. In collaboration with community partners, EEH sponsored a community Take a Hike challenge for the second consecutive year to encourage the community to rediscover the health benefits of being 87active and spending time outdoors. During the past few years, over 2,000 community residents participated in the Challenge. Di abetes Given the positive patient outcomes and demand for services, EEH expanded Diabetes Center access points over the past few year s - collectively services are now offered in Elmhurst, Naperville, Bolingbrook, Plainfield and Yorkville. Internal EEH data revealed racial and ethnic disparities (Hispanic and African American) associated with prevalence of diabetes across certain geographies. To that end, a pilot program was launched in Addison which embeds a diabetic educator and utilizes a diabetes equity navigator ai med to identify patients and further improve diabetic -related health outcomes. Cardiovascular Care EEH continued to support and participate in the Young Hearts for Life program. E EH continues to provide many community education programs focused on heart health and stroke prevention. These webinars reached hundreds of community members annually , providing education on awareness, prevention, and symptom identification. Regular news, email, blog, and newsletter content is provided to the community by EEH on variety of topics associated with heart disease and stroke prevention. The monthly Healthy Driven Newsletter, with a distribution of over 300,000 , covered various heart healthy lifestyle topics . Ca ncer Care EEH enhanced its website allowing for streamlined patient navigation based on individual diagnosis. The dedicated Breast Cancer page was launched, and work began to expand content to include lung, colorectal, prostate and urology. Virtual navigation service - In collaboration with Impact Advisors, EEH established a virtual navigation program to ensure timely follow -up post -diagnosis. EEH continues to offer free online screening tools (BreastAware, ColonAware and LungAware) toidentify 'at risk' individuals and connect them to appropriate resources for early detection and treatment. Regular news, email, blog and newsletter content is provided to the community by EEH onvariety of topics associated with cancer prevention. The monthly Healthy Driven Newsletter, with a distribution of over 300,000 , included prevention lifestyle and informative articles , including topics on cancer care. Addr essing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Du ring the most recent CHNA and Implementation Strategy planning process, EEH identified an opportunity to improve the systematic identification of patients with underlying social determinants of health ( SDOH ) aimed to enhance the referral process to community -based organizations (CBO). An Epic module was implemented to identify patients in need of community resources such as food banks and other social support. 88Connections to Community Resources EE H partnered with findhelp.org (formerly known as Aunt Bertha), a social care network that connects people with social services in their communities to ensure they receive the care they need to improve their overall health status. Ment al Health/Substance Use Access to Behavioral Health Services Recruitment continues in a very competitive market with a limited supply of providers. Over the FY20 -22 Community Benefit planning cycle, Linden Oaks Medical Group (LOMG) successfully added over 10 psychiatry providers and 14 c ounselors to expand access to critical counseling and medication management services. Driven initially by the impact of COVID -19, LOMG counselors and psychiatrists continue to offer virtual visits to ensure access to counseling and telepsychiatry/medication management treatment. Behavioral Health Integration has proven to be successful through the EEH network. This care delivery model embeds behavioral health therapists within the physician office as an immediate resource for community members ensuring appropriate follow -up care. Linden Oaks continues to expand this care delivery model to additional primary care and specialty clinic locations. Care coordination within ED and medical floors of acute care hospitals has been r e-engineered . The number of patients seeking psychiatric care in the emergency departments (EDs) and medical floors has risen both nationally and locally, creating barriers to appropriate patient access. In response, Linden Oaks enhanced processes to ensure optimal throughput across the units. Key modificationsincluded: increased discharge planners, expanded virtual telepsychiatry, and Medical Directorrounding. Co mmunity Outreach to Support Behavioral Health Linden Oaks leadership and staff routinely gather input from the broader community to proactively address key imperatives. Below are examples of community events intended to bring front line leaders together to address mental health services within the community: Linden Oaks continues a collaborative partnership with clinical providers of traditional outpatientcounseling and therapy services. To improve engagement and dialogue with community providers,Linden Oaks provided an opportunity to solicit feedback via Community Provider Think Tank events ; topics included COVID reactivation plans and the newly formed Centralized Admission Inpatient Unit. The Linden Oaks Patient Family Advisory Council (PFAC) seeks to enhance the delivery of health care at Linden Oaks by providing a forum for patients and families to work in partnership with hospital staff in the development and implementation of programs, policies, and practice standards. The PFAC members are encouraged to bring forward suggestions and recommendations that may influence the patient care experience to ensure all patients receive, Safe, Seamless, and Personal Care. As a part of the Linden Oaks Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program, a pilot program was launchedto expand the Program focused specifically on adolescents (Teen MHFA) . EE H Opioid Initiative EEH continues to take a leadership role in fighting the opioid epidemic. Led by a task force launched in 2016, the health system has implemented a series of programs and projects, including standardized 89treatment plans and best practice guidelines for patients presenting to EEH on selected opioids. Key initiatives and accomplishments are summarized below: The Midwest Alternative to Opioids Project (ALTO) is a collaboration between the Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin Hospital Associations and represents a unique opportunity to impact emergency department prescribing across the region. EEH participated in the Illinois Hospital Associate ALTO cohort study and adopted performance metrics considered best practices to measure outcomesassociated with opioid reductio n efforts. EEH Emergency Department partnered with DuPage County to distribute Narcan (provided to EEH free of charge from the County) for home use as part of an initiative to prevent overdose relateddeaths. New standardized, evidence -based pain manage ment protocols and order sets were piloted at Edward Hospital to reduce opioid use among mothers experiencing cesarean deliveries. As a resultof this project, during the first phase opioid use during a hospital stay was reduced from 92% to 68% and opioid prescriptions at discharge were reduced from 92% to 60%. Given the success of this pilot project, the protocols were expanded to Elmhurst Hospital. EEH partnered with third party addiction treatment centers to provide services to EmergencyDepartment patie nts in need of follow -up care associated with chemical dependency or substance abuse.

Data was analyzed for the CHNA community as a whole as well as Lake County, Cook County North Suburbs and Cook -County -Chicago North Side communities. To provide additional insight into underserved populations, data was further reviewed for zip codes with high economic needs according to Dignity Health's Community Need Index (CNI). Based on demographic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated zip code in the United States on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0. A score of 1.0 indicates a zip code with the least need, while a score of 5.0 represents a zip code with the most need. The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services. Zip codes with a CNI score above 3.4 have higher socioeconomic needs related to factors such as income, education, language, insurance and housing. The CHNA community has a total population of 1,607,577 according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015 -2019 5 -year estimates.

Input from key stakeholders has been provided on how the pandemic influenced related health factors. Mental Health The pandemic has stressed and worried nearly everyone and has negatively impacted the economy and housing and caused significant grief and loss. The pandemic is exacerbating mental health issues and making them more obvious and mental health issues and drug abuse are escalating .Social Isolation Social isolation resulting from the extended duration of the pandemic (affecting all age groups) was discussed by focus group participants. A sense of belonging has been compromised due to isolation. There has been an increase in violence among teens due to isolation and lack of supervision.Financial Impact The financial impact of the pandemic continues to loom, as people lose their homes and suffer other financial stresses. and the community is seeing the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on adolescents and young adults.Physical Health Physical health has declined during the pandemic \u2014due to, among other things, a lack of screening services and delayed health screenings (sometimes even if there are symptoms present). The result of these actions may be late -stage diagnosis and ongoing health issues over a period of years.Impact on Youth The fact that youth were out of school for an extended time due to the pandemic has led to numerous issues including an increase in mental health issues and suicide among yout h. Teachers have not been able to observe children in the classroom and identify potential healthcare issues due to schools transitioning to in-home learning. 113CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Community Input Focus Groups Economic Disadvantages Lack of Access to Resources for Low -Income/Minority Populations Poverty Structural RacismComplexity of Healthcare System Health Inequity Hospital Reimbursement Structure Increased Need for Inclusive and Culturally Competent Care Lack of Mental Health Providers Lack of Statistically Diverse Workforce TelehealthCertain Members of Community are Not Participating in Healthcare Choosing Between Basic Needs and Health Needs Delay of Preventative Care Distrust of Healthcare System Isolation (Youth and Elderly Population) Lack of Health Literacy Written Summary of Focus Groups Limited Food Access Safe and Affordable HousingFactors Impacting Health in the NorthShore Community 114CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Community Input Focus Groups -Most Significant Unmet Healthcare Needs Written Summary of Focus Groups Mental Health Increased demand for mental health services Lack of mental health professionals Cost of mental health care Access to Healthcare; Navigating the Healthcare System Insufficient number of medical providers Lack of effective communication of health information and available resources Patient advocates are needed to: assist with understanding how insurance works and calculating costs educate and direct patients to available social servicesPrimary and Preventative Care Access for uninsured and underinsured Medication assistance Comprehensive wellness visits Discrimination/Health Inequity/Mistrust Resurgence of discrimination Diverse and culturally competent workforce Lack of trust in the healthcare system Housing/Employment/Food Insecurity Lack of affordable housing Lack of stability with basic needs Identification of Most Underserved Populations People who are low -income, uninsured / underinsured, or homeless People with serious mental illness / behavioral health issues Members of Black and Brown populations, minority populations and indigenous communities Immigrants, undocumented workers and individuals who are not U.S. residents LGBTQ+ (including youth) Elderly populations People with disabilities 115CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Community Input Community Survey In order to develop a broad understanding of community health needs, NorthShore conducted an online community survey from January to February of 2022.

Four focus groups were comprised of leaders representing public health, major employers, public schools, social services, NorthShore leaders and the community at -large. A fifth focus group was conducted with leaders from public health. Focus groups explored multiple areas to identify significant health needs of the community as well as potential ways to addre ss identified needs. The areas included 1.) factors impacting health in the community; 2.) greatest unmet health needs; 3.) health status in the community; 4.) barriers to addressing health needs, 5.) underserved groups, and 6.) greatest economic social issues. This section of the report summarizes what the key stakeholders said without assessing the credibility of their comments. 1. Factors Impacting Health in the Community Focus group participants were first asked to generally indicate what is impacting health within the community. Some positive factors were mentioned by focus group participants that have improved health within the community, including the great health and education resources in the community, increases in research leadi ng to better care, improvement in telehealth and technology, great not -for- profit organizations that collaborate on issues (which has improved from the past), and a high vaccination status (in general , including COVID). However, numerous negative factors were cited by focus group participants included the following: a. COVID -19 Pandemic Numerous focus group participants believed that the COVID -19 pandemic has significantly negatively impacted health within the co mmunity and that the impact is widespread. The pandemic has stressed and worried nearly everyone and has negatively impacted the economy and housing and caused significant grief and los s. Social isolation resulting from the extended duration of the pandemic (affecting all age groups) was discussed by focus group participants. A sense of belonging has been compromised due to isolat ion. The financial impact of the pandemic continues to loom, as people lose their homes and suffer other financial stresses. Mental health issues and drug abuse are escalating, and the community i s seeing the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on adolescents and young adults. The pandemic has also made it more difficult for individuals to take care of chronic health conditions. Focus group participa ntsnoted that physical health has declined during the pandemic \u2014due to, among other things, a lack of screening services and delayed health screenings (sometimes even if there are symptoms present) . The result of these actions may be late -stage diagnosis and ongoing health issues over a period of years. Additionally, people were forced to put healthy lifestyles on hold (such as going to th e gym) and to find other ways to proactively manage health when resources were closed or reallocated due to the pandemic. It was noted by one focus group participant that the pandemic has created a \"moment of crisis\" for children. The fact that yo uthwere out of school for an extended time due to the pandemic has led to numerous issues, including an increase in mental health issues and suicide, an inability to observe children in the classroom and identify potential healthcare issues, and an increase in violence due to lack of supervision. Furthermore, staffing shortages in the classroom due to the pandemic has negatively impacted quality of life. Lastly, work -life changes in the family have impacted childcare in many homes. In general, the pandemic is exacerbating numerous healthcare issues and making them more obvious. 145CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Reportb. Mental Health Focus group participants mentioned that the mental and social wellbeing of the community continues to be a struggle -which has been exacerbated by the pandemic -and that mental health ultimately affects physical health. Isolation caused by the pandemic and by winter weather contributes to mental health issues. Many peo pleare lonely and do not have a sense of belonging. People need community for mental strength. The stigma associated with mental health must be addressed. While the pandemic has been a time that calls for increased mental health therapy and psychosocial support, access to these resources has been limited, especially for youth. c. Economic Disadvantages For certain members of the population, a lack of financial security negatively impacts their health. This is true for those i ndividuals who live in poverty \u2014especially those who experience intergenerational poverty. Many in the community are experiencing employment and education challenges. Focus group participants noted that the economically disadvantaged population is growing, and that healthcare costs, housing costs, and early childcare costs are rapidly rising. Due to financial constraints, individuals sometimes make decisions that negatively impact physical and mental wellbeing (for example, they must decide on whether to pay for medication or food). Some lack insurance coverage due to unemployment or underemployme nt.For the underinsured, knowing what insurance will pay impacts preventative care. d. Housing / Food / Safety There were several aspects of housing mentioned by focus group participants that impact health within the community. First, t here are vast disparities within the community and segregation of housing, rather than an integrated community. Second, it was mentioned that housing has a significant impact on health, and that resea rchshows the great impact that housing stability, quality, and affordability, and the neighborhood in which one lives, has on individual health outcomes. Third, housing can create an unsafe physical envi ronment, for example, when lead pipes are present in the home. Food insecurity was raised by focus group participants as a negative factor impacting community health. Regarding safety, a general collapse of civility was discussed. Because interactions among people have worsened (compared to 20 years ago), people are not as willing to help each other, resulting in many people feeling unsafe. e. Fractured Healthcare System One focus group participant referred to a \"fractured health system\" where there are disparities in treatment and access, and part of the community is not even participating in healthcare. For example, there are many people without access to healthcare, such as the middle -income population, who have a hard time accessing special ists and mental health providers. Also, there are long wait times for appointments and issues with scheduling appointments due to an overwhelmed system creating a scheduling backlog. Even getting toan appointment can be challenging for some individuals, as there is a lack of affordable escorted transportation for individuals who cannot afford caregivers (for those who need services bey onda traditional taxi). 146CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report Navigating the healthcare system was also discussed by focus group participants \u2014specifically, that navigating the health system is extremely complicated, even for those in the healthcare system. For example, people are unsure of who to call, when to call, where to follow through, etc. Focus group participants pointed out t hatthere is a lack of onsite health advocates \u2014people who can interpret healthcare \"speak\" to common persons, especially in the senior population. Also, help is needed navigating uninsured and unde rinsured individuals through the healthcare system by communicating available financial resources. Focus group participants discussed the prohibitive cost of healthcare services and prescription drugs. With the cost of healt hcare being high, there is a lack of education of the availability of affordable healthcare options and a need for better transparency of fee structures. Oftentimes, people do not understand healthcare cost s. Thus, even if health issues are identified, there may be a lack of access to follow -up care due to prohibitive cost. Another aspect of the healthcare system that needs addressed is understaffing of healthcare institutions, a workforce shortag e, and provider burnout. As healthcare workers continue to experience stress, employers should address employee wellness. Another aspect of the healthcare system that needs addressed is how hospitals are compensated by payors. Furthermore, racism, implicit bias, homophobia, and ageism are present within the healthcare system, leading to unequal acces s to healthcare. Also, there is a lack of providers with whom patients can connect, such as psychiatrists of color. Immigration status is also an issue that impacts an individual's willingness to acce ss healthcare because individuals are unsure if they can seek treatment. Communication of healthcare information to the community through social media has been very positive in some respects, but th ereis also a lot of misinformation circulating, which hospitals are working to combat. Varying levels of health literacy exist throughout the community. f. Schools / Childcare Resources Because of remote learning, youth is a population that has been missed within our healthcare system during the pandemic. Many children are primarily interacting through social media; however, they need more face -to-face social and emotional interaction, and gaps have been broadened. Focus group participants noted that in Illinois there has been a loss of available adolescent beds and resources, and there a re insufficient resources to respond to the needs of this population. g. Fear / Lack of Trust of the Healthcare System Focus group participant indicated that there is an \"unhealthy skepticism of public leaders\" in the community, particularly in certain groups of color. This lack of trust instills fear in people and makes them withdraw. One root cause of the lack of trust mentioned by a focus group participant was previous illegal medical practices e xperimented on African Americans. At the present time, that lack of trust is leading to mistrust of vaccines. Generally, there is a hesitancy or reluctance to get healthcare, to go to the hospital, to g et vaccinations, etc. among certain groups of color. 147CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report 2. Greatest Unmet Health Needs a. Mental Health / Behavioral Health Focus group participants mentioned access to mental health/behavioral health services (including for youth and adolescents, a nd including therapy and psychosocial support), among the greatest unmet health needs within the community. If people present at the emergency department, they are often screened out at this level. Access is a challenge, as providers are booked for months, and there is a lack of available beds. Increases are seen in suicides, post -natal depression, and families dealing with added stressors and anx iety. b. Physical Health Physical health was mentioned by focus group participants as one of the greatest unmet health needs, as people are not seekin g preventative care. The cause may be due to a variety of reasons, including economic circumstances, lack of transportation, high cost (including medication costs), lack or insurance, or lack of knowledge. Furthermore, preventative screenings are hard to access for certain populations, such as uninsured adults. Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have access to certain preventative screening services in -house (such as colonoscopy and mammogram). Also, people may delay preventative care due to the pandemic or other concerns. There must be a greater focus on preventative care, health maintenance and physicals. It was noted by one focus group participant that the sense of overwhelm in the healthcare system impacts workers and is stemming people from wanting preventa tive care, so the system is becoming crisis oriented. Vaccines in the most vulnerable communities are needed. There is needed focus on overall wellness of people and communities holistically (min d, body, spirit). People must be educated on where and how they can get help (for example, the location of food pantries) \u2014and it is important to distinguish between a lack of resources and a lack of awareness of resources. Dignity and self -respect come into play (some people may not want to seek help), as well as some people using resources that they may not need as much as others. An increa sedsocial services network is needed so that people can find availability of services and have one -stop care. c. Access to Healthcare Access to healthcare was also mentioned by focus group participants as one of the greatest unmet healthcare needs. There must becontinued affordability and access to services. While great strides have been made in providing community -level programs, more work is needed. There are continued access challenges for the undocum ented and those with Medicaid \u2014for example, NorthShore does not accept Medicaid in primary care clinics. This creates a segregated healthcare system for those individuals. Access to sup portive care and resources is also needed, as well as more healthcare options, to improve the quality of healthcare. Resources to assist individuals navigate the complex healthcare system are needed (such as navigating the preauthorization pr ocess), as there is a lack of understanding in that regard, especially among the elderly. Language barriers must be overcome, and resources must be current (address outdated websites, etc.) Health education and awareness in disease prevention and care is lacking as well as health literacy. More classes and support groups are needed in the community. Access to correct information is needed \u2014and educating people on how to determine what information is true or false, and what sources they can trust. 148CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report d. Lack of Healthcare Providers A lack of healthcare providers (including primary care physicians) was mentioned as one of the greatest unmet health needs, b othin general and among diverse providers, as well as a lack of specialty providers in free/reduced cost clinics. No -shows may be causing a lack of offerings due to capacity in some instances. It was no ted that a lack of diverse providers impacts communication with patients and fails to combat the lack of trust. e. Under -Resourced Populations and Structural Racism Under -resourced populations include Black/African American, Latino, medical refugees, recent immigrants, and persons with disabi lities. The healthcare system must acknowledge structural racism and must be designed to address these barriers. Gender -affirming care is needed for pediatric and adolescent patients. f. Social Determinants of Health Safe, stable, and affordable housing were mentioned by focus group participants as some of the greatest unmet health needs in the community (including housing for individuals after discharge), as well as food insecurity, education, and unemployment. 3. Whether Health of the Community Improved, Declined or Stayed the Same Whenever asked whether the health of the community has improved, declined, or stayed the same over the past few years, most r espondents believed that health is declining. Some specifically indicated that mental health is declining. Some specified that health has improved for the insured and wealthy but declined f or the poor and uninsured. The pandemic was cited as a primary cause of the decline for several reasons \u2014isolation has led to increased drug use and mental and behavioral health issues, people are not seeking care (including preventative care) for fear of COVID, and statistically there is an increased rate of death. Also, college -age students and youn g adults have felt the effects of the pandemic and experienced anxiety. Also due to the pandemic, poverty has increased, people have lost jobs and health insurance, and education has been permanently al tered. Also, burnout has impacted all industries, and has impacted available healthcare services. The pandemic has also uncovered disparities among minority patient populations, and exposed se gregation and discrimination (including Black and Latino populations), conditions which have existed for decades. Pandemic healthcare difficulties have also exposed a declining safety net that has existed for a long time, as there is a decreased ability to help underserved communities. The pandemic has also compromised basic resources such as access to workout facilities. The decline has created an environment that is reactive, versus focusing on the long -term. Focus group participants noted that a few good things may have come from the pandemic. For example, one positive factor is th e recognition of integrated needs (mental health, physical health, and financial health) needing to be addressed at all levels. Also, communication has improved due to need. 149CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report 4. Barriers to Addressing Health Needs Focus group participants mentioned the following barriers to addressing health needs within the community and noted that stro ng leadership support to solve the issues and challenges is needed. a. Mental Health Resources Focus group participants indicated that many more therapists, nurses, and technicians are needed to serve mental health patie nts. The pandemic has caused \"pandemic fatigue\" -burnout and complacency depending on the circumstances and ability to access resources. The new reality or sense of \"normal\" is causing u ncertainty in people's daily lives and is causing people to become scared, confused, or to feel unsettled. Isolation brought on by the pandemic is also a barrier. The stigma surrounding mental healthcare still exists and is a barrier to tapping into services. Also, the virtual environmen t of accessing mental healthcare services due to the pandemic is a barrier. In the healthcare treatment context, virtual meetings dehumanize some of the interactions. The structure of the mental health system is a barrier, as it is based on a \"band -aid approach\" versus a wholistic approach. b. Lack of Healthcare Providers Focus group participants noted that there is a lack of healthcare providers \u2014especially mental health providers with immediate av ailability (all age groups). There is a shortage of primary care providers and preventative care options. Also, more providers are needed that patients can identify with (more providers of color are n eeded), and there is a lack of a strategic plan and/or pipeline to match diverse providers to patients. Focus group participants noted that \"community -based primary care\" is needed. Healthcare is needed in places that are easier for people to access, and more community clinics would respond to this need. With the overcrowding of facilities and provider offices, the fear of COVID is deterring people from seeking care. Furt hermore, scheduling and availability are limited. Staffing shortages and pandemic burnout (on the provider side) were also discussed by focus group participants. There is a la ck of providers and support professionals, and many have left the industry. This situation is causing high turnover, long hours, and much stress for those who work in healthcare, and there are currentl y many open positions. Healthcare organizations must offer a work environment that prioritizes employee care and allows employees to take the time off work for their own healthcare. c. Poverty Focus group participants observed that there is a lot of unemployment and poverty in the community, and people who do not hav e financial resources often do not prioritize health and have limited resources and services available to them. Also noted was that there is a lack of healthcare information distributed to this p opulation. Finally, many people do not have resources for medications. Given these factors, there is a general sense that systems/resources are unable to keep people safe and protected. 150CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report d. Complexity of Healthcare System Focus group participants noted that the complexity of the healthcare system is a barrier to addressing the healthcare needs w ithin the community. First and foremost, focus group participants discussed the difficulty of navigating the healthcare system in general. People do not know where to sign up for insurance, how their i nsurance works, or how to navigate the healthcare system. People are unfamiliar with Federally Qualified Health Centers and what care is available there. People question what services exist, how tofind providers, how to get to provider locations and access the services, and who will pay for their care. People need to know how to navigate the healthcare system \u2014ambassadors or navigators are needed to help people know how or where to get help. This would give people a sense of mastery over the requirements that must be met to understand the healthcare system and get the help they ne ed. Focus group participants discussed the current lack of temporary/transitional services available within the community. Essent ially, there are not places for people to land, and there is a long wait for services to assist people with mental health, housing, food, and employment. Fulfilling the need for downstream resources is important because providing these services will decrease the need for resources in the future. Medicare/Medicaid do not provide a complete chain of help for people. There is a decrease in support ingservices due to low funding and high demand. Focus group participants noted that, while there are a lot of ideas, a lack of funding exists. Finally, focus group participants noted that a significant barrier to addressing the health needs of the community is the com pensation model of healthcare providers (which is based on cash versus care). e.Access to Healthcare Focus group participants discussed how \"access to healthcare\" is a barrier to addressing health needs within the community. N umerous factors negatively impact access to healthcare. Focus group members noted that the high cost of healthcare is a barrier, as well as a lack of insurance, a lack of understand ingof insurance, and a decreasing number of medical facilities that will treat patients without insurance. Within the community, there is little awareness and knowledge regarding health issues and awarene ss of available programs, a lack of primary care, and long wait times for appointments. The Community Health Center was mentioned, although focus group participants noted that there is a lack of know ledge of or access to the center, and that the center is the only point in the system accommodating underserved populations. Healthcare is particularly difficult to access for those individuals who lack residency. Undocumented persons are not able to access services as there is a fear of being turned away and subject to legal action impacting residency. One focus group participant noted that it is impossible to access primary care if you are uninsur ed or undocumented \u2014and that you have no choice but to use the emergency room. According to focus group participants, transportation systems and routes to healthcare services are not available in suburban areas. Transportation for persons with physical disabilities is a barrier \u2014and there currently is no such transportation. Financial and safety barriers also exist. People may be able to find transportatio n to the hospital, but not for follow -up visits or referrals from the emergency room. People also need transportation to pharmacies to get their medications. 151CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report Finally, focus group participants discussed the issues of health literacy and technological ability. Information is changing so fast that it is hard to keep up, and attention must be paid to information versus misinformation. Technological ability is a barrier, however. One focus group participant asked, if people do not know how to usethe technology, how are they going to access information and care? It was noted that there is too much emphasis on technology for a population that is not proficient in the use of technology. f. Social Determinants of Health Focus group participants noted that job opportunities are needed within the community with livable wages, as well as job -trainin g programs and workforce training, so people can get the resources they need. Affordable housing is also needed, and people do not have resources for food. Childcare is also needed within the commu nity, because obtaining childcare impacts the ability to make healthcare appointments (for example, women with young children scheduling mammograms). g. Diversity and Inclusion Focus group participants noted that different populations within the community face different levels of opportunities and cha llenges. For example, language access for non -English speaking populations is a problem (for example, electronic medical records are only produced in English), and healthcare institutions must commit to being anti -racist/diverse and be able to deliver information through language barriers and provide it to a diverse community. One participant noted that antisemitism, racism, all the \"isms\" and phobias are heightened in the current environment and will play a large role going forward, and that there must be a commitment to serve everyone in the community. Another participant noted that, while there may be improvements in some parts of the city, there is historic disinvestment in Black neighborhoods. Focus group participants commented that within the community there is a cultural/histor ical distrust of the healthcare system and of the government, along with disparities in care, and that the gap is widening. h. Other There were several other barriers to addressing health needs within the community discussed by the focus group participants. Discussion was held regarding barriers experienced by the elderly population. To that end, the \"digital divide\" was mentioned -that there is a technology gap for certain populations -and how t o make technology accessible and understandable by certain populations. Also, technology/internet access is needed. With an aging society and life expectancy increasing, it is important for the eld erly to be able to navigate the healthcare system and to be able to remain independent. Also, the elderly need hearing and vision services, and more time with their physicians. Focus group participants also discussed a shortage of childcare and day programs for children within the community, day patie nt spots, and the ability for youth and teens to receive assistance across the board. One barrier in this regard has been space. Finally, focus group participants discussed the need for people to understand how to take care of themselves through preventa tive care, healthy eating, and exercise. 152CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report 5. Underserved Groups Focus group participants were asked to identify who are the most underserved groups within the community. An overarching them e discussed by focus group participants was that it must be understood that underserving a subset of the population impacts the overall health of the entire community . The following were identified by focus group participants as the most underserved groups within the community: People who are low -income, uninsured/underinsured, or homeless, and other traditionally marginalized groups, are underserved. Me dical care is expensive, and people in this group think they cannot afford doctors or medications. This population may not know how to navigate healthcare system. There are disparities in treat ment, and differing treatment based on insurance plans. People in this group may be bypassing regular healthcare and may be unable (or afraid) to access care. The pandemic has created less access to help for these individuals. People with serious mental illness/behavioral health issues are also underserved. These individuals often have no political p ower or voice within the community. Members of Black and Brown populations, minority populations, and indigenous communities are underserved. There is a history of systemic racism and overall lack of equality among these populations. Relationships with these populations need to be reframed, and the lack of diversity in the healthcare system mus t be addressed. Children need to be exposed to different professions at an early age, and programs must be established in schools to teach children about medical professions. Also, healthcare provider education is needed to teach cultural education and communication skills and empathy to healthcare providers as well as how to combat mistrust (which must be addressed through targeted education and meeting individuals where they are located). Immigrants, undocumented workers, and individuals who are not U.S. residents are underserved. Language barriers exist, and th eseindividuals may experience fear and feel as though they are \"in the shadows.\" Characteristic of this group is a lack of representation in government and feeling like they have no voice politica lly. People with disabilities are underserved and are often overlooked and sidelined. Many people in this group do not have the re sources to become independent. Numerous other populations were identified by focus group participants as being underserved within the community, including t he elderly (especially those without an advocate, caregiver, or family), children and disconnected youth, young adults, LGBTQ (including youth), the uneducated (communications may not meet their nee ds), those who do not have access to technology or who are unable/unsure how to use technology, single moms with children, the \"sandwiched\" population (the generation between children andaging population who often take no time for themselves for mental health), those who need access to vaccines and boosters (currently, the system is not \"friendly\"), frontline workers who suff er from exhaustion, and NorthShoreConnect users (as there are significant disparities for those who access the system). 153CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report 6.Greatest Economic Social Issues Focus group participants were asked to identify the greatest social economic issues within the community. The following issue s were discussed by focus group participants: Poverty -Poverty has widespread effects and impacts one's ability to access proper food and affordable housing. Often there is a significant lag time when submitting applications for federal or state resources \u2014for example, people may have utilities shut off before they obtain help. There are numerous causes of poverty, includi ng intergenerational poverty and fixed income constraints for older generations. Mental Health -Currently, there is high demand for mental health services, but a low supply of providers and resources, and sti gmas still exist around the need for mental health support. Access to Healthcare -Access to healthcare is hindered by many obstacles \u2014including the cost of care (even for those who are ins ured), obtaining insurance, and the coordination of deductibles and costs. New families or people that are new to the community are unsure of what to do and where to go for assistance. Health Literacy -Health literacy is an issue among various populations due to language differences and different levels of educ ation. Also, if parents have low health literacy and are unaware of health matters, their children may suffer as a result. Safe and Affordable Housing -Safe and affordable housing is an important issue, along with environmental matters that come into play if people have mold or lead in their household. People must sometimes wait for years to have home repairs competed. One focus group participant noted that 49.5% of the county residents paymore than 30% of income for housing. Employment -Employment is challenging for many people for various reasons, including difficulty navigating employment sites/onl ine job boards, lack of skills, and lack of mentorship. While there are many open positions, there is a lack of qualified candidates to fill those positions. Thus, emphasis must be placed on how to train people to fill positions, workforce development, getting into schools to increase awareness of healthcare careers, and recognizing that the \"typical\" college path is not needed. Employment is also c hallenging for people with disabilities. Racism and Cultural Differences -Racism and cultural differences prevent opportunities for people to advance economically. It h elps people to see people that look like themselves \u2014there is safety in that, and it makes people feel like they can bring their full self. Other -Other economic social issues raised by focus group participants include transportation, drugs, and the uncertainty of CO VID and what it means in our daily lives. 154CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report 7. Most Significant Unmet Healthcare Needs (and How to Address Those Needs) Focus group participants were first asked to identify the most significant unmet healthcare needs within the community, and t hento discuss how to address those health needs. Their responses are summarized below. a. Mental Health Description of Health Need: Focus group participants identified mental health as one of the most significant unmet healthcare needs of the community \u2014in gen eral, affecting all populations \u2014from childhood diagnosis to adult depression and medication, and at all levels. Demand for mental health services has increased fo r avariety of reasons, including stressors related to the pandemic and resulting loneliness, isolation, frustration, and helplessness. There is a lack of mental health professionals, and mental he alth services are expensive and economically out of reach, even with insurance. Low reimbursement rates also an issue for providers. While state legislators have been focusing on mental health, demand and strain are outweighing what has been accomplished, and it is still difficult for people to get the kind of care they need. Addressing mental health needs is very important because proper mental health c arehelps individuals from a physical health perspective, too. How to Address: A common theme focus group participants raised to address mental health within the community is to rework the model of care m akethe services more accessible to people. Ideas to make services more accessible included establishing mental health clinics in the middle of residential areas; expanding menta l health services into schools (for example, Evanston High School has a social worker); expanding telehealth services and mobile clinics; expanding real -time tools to assist people in a mental health crisis (such as hotlines); and integrating mental health screenings into wellness visits. Additionally, people need assistance overcoming the cost of accessing mental health services. Access to care ismade difficult by the fact that public assistance is not accepted by most mental health providers. Training was also raised as a fundamental means to address mental health, including culturally relevant mental healthcare tra ining on a community level, increasing public awareness of mental health concerns and communication of care, mental health first aid training (for example, the mental health first aid training progr am at the Josselyn Center), and training lay populations to bring education to the community. A proactive approach in supporting mental wellbeing was suggested, such as by engaging friends, parents, teach ersof children to help identify mental health issues and improve the network around youth. Focus group participants discussed the need for an expanded and diversified workforce and increased pipeline of mental health service providers, initiatives to assist the immediate need with acute care, and retooling the system for long -term mental health care. Mental health care providers are faced with inadequate breaks a nd increasing restrictions, and there is a heavy focus on seeing more patients, resulting in less time spent with patients (which raises trust and ethical concerns). 155CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report b. Access to Healthcare; Navigating the Healthcare System Description of Health Need: Focus group participants noted that access to healthcare is being hindered in various ways. First, there are not enough healt hcare providers and staff. Many people are leaving the profession or supplementing their income (especially primary care providers). Second, there is a lack of effectiv e communication of health information and resources to the community. While there may be information and resources to help those in need, people need confidence and support to better access the informa tion and find resources. Third, people have difficulty navigating the healthcare system and many are \"falling through the cracks\" (particularly the elderly). Patient advocates are needed to help people figure out the costs of care, how their insurance works, what community social services are available, and where to go to receive services. People who do not understand technology may nee d assistance and support that is not computer based. How to Address: Focus group participants next discussed how to improve access to healthcare and navigation of the healthcare system. As to a shortage of healthcare providers and staff, focus group participants had various recommendations, including creating a Workforce Development Task Force, exposing youth to health knowledge and medical professions in school and developing a progressive curriculum, and mentoring people to go into the medical field. Inthe workplace, the need to reduce workload and stress for healthcare workers was discussed, along with considering financial rewards to incentivize healthcare workers to remain in their role (al though it was recognized that for some people financial incentives not worth it compared to stress of the profession). As to a lack of effective communication of health information and resources to the community, a recommendation was made to fo cuson making sure that the community knows about available services and resources and to reconsider the how health information is getting out to community members in need of assistance. For exa mple, it was also mentioned that people may not be aware of certain rebate programs. As to difficulty navigating the healthcare system, more robust care navigation assistance is needed to help people find safet y net services/resources. Oftentimes, services/resources exist but people are not aware of what is available. Investment in a healthcare navigation program is needed to effect real change. More social wo rkers, patient navigators, and patient ambassadors are needed because they are familiar with the healthcare system and can identify gaps. One focus group participant suggested creating a career p athfor people to act as consultants on insurance \u2014potentially a government office that people could go for help with insurance. If people lose insurance or find out that their insurance is no longer a ccepted, healthcare providers should give a list of resources to people, so they do not fall through the cracks. c. Primary and Preventative Care Description of Health Need: Better access to primary care is needed, particularly for the uninsured and underinsured, as it is known that poverty contrib utes to health problems remaining unaddressed. Medication assistance is also needed, with a focus on diabetes and long -term medication management, especially in the senior pop ulation. Thorough and complete wellness visits are needed for more effective preventative care, and visits need to be more comprehensive. Also, there is an imbalance of focus on body health ve rsus brain health. Finally, people need to better understand healthy life skills, including healthy eating habits. 156CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report How to Address: Focus group participants discussed the need for better access to primary care within the community. Numerous suggestions were made, including to expand or add locations to NorthShore's Community Health Center, create new or expanded collaborations among organizations that target underserved commu nities (such as Erie Family Health Centers), increase mobile services within communities (including for dental and preventative services), innovate school -based services models (such as by expanding clinic hours to accommodate parents getting flu shots in the evening), improve access to healthcare for NorthShore employees, and improve access to providers at NorthShore to get as many people seen as possible (including through same -day appointments). As to addressing preventative care, numerous focus group participants emphasized the importance of providers taking the time to understand what patients need, which would involve increasing the length of time of wellness visits (especially in youth). Also, physicians need to spend more time to help manage and coordina te care. Consideration should be given to utilizing technologies to obtain input from the patients, and then actually responding to that input by following through on next steps (which is currently la cking). Preventative care in youth can be bolstered through parenting classes and programs that help parents model good health and wellbeing. Furthermore, expanded outreach to young adults at colleges an d high schools regarding health literacy should be considered. To that end, suggestions included speaking at schools and sending providers into schools, establishing means to see healthcare provid ersoutside of a healthcare setting, and leveraging social media. Focus group participants suggested that creating better access to primary and preventative care may require taking a step bac k and getting back to basics, and essentially rebuilding healthcare programs and redetermining priorities. Also, influential organizations within the community should engage in advocacy efforts and use their voices to make healthcare more affordable. The power of insurance companies must be balanced with the power of providers to be able to make decisions that benefit patients and the c omm unity. d. Discrimination / Health Inequity / Mistrust Description of Health Need: Focus group participants discussed a resurgence of discrimination in this country. Those feeling the brunt of this discrimina tion are impacted the health needs described in this report. The community lacks access to providers with whom patients can identify, as well as a statistically diverse and culturally competent workforce that matches the geographical area of care. Also, healthcare inequities exist within the healthcare system and there is a lack of inclusive care. Focus group participant s also discussed a general lack of trust in the healthcare system and noted that a healthcare system is needed that puts patients first and that is welcoming and fosters engagement, access, and trust. How to Address: Focus group participants emphasized the need to combat discrimination within the healthcare system. Patients need healthcare providers to whom they can relate (including clinical and administrative staff) -providers that look like them -and they need providers that will meet them where they are. To impro ve diversity among healthcare providers, the community must develop a diverse talent pipeline, and start early to develop these careers. Suggestions included considering a middle/high school ment orship program to foster these careers and recruiting with an intentional focus on diversity at every level of the organization. Also, healthcare providers must commit to hiring and training people o f color\u2014for all levels of jobs, from low -level to executive level, and should also look at their own workforce to elevate or groom people of color for positions of authority and decision -making. Diversity of cli nical and administrative staff would help develop trust in the community. Focus group participants also discussed the need for intentional education of providers on the importance of cultural compete ncyand implicit racial biases (for providers and administration). This step can help build trust with vulnerable communities and lead to better healthcare outcomes. Community healthcare must include population -focused programs that offer inclusive care. To that end, it is important for NorthS hore to understand who is in its service area, and to ensure all patient voices and experiences are represented. Welcoming spaces must be created for all people (regardless of culture, language, etc .) This may involve the utilization of community healthcare workers (not clinicians, but rather people who can interface with clinicians). Marketing communications must be in all relevant languages, and efforts must be made to identify language barriers and provide interpreter services. 157CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report To combat discrimination, health inequity, and mistrust, there must be community collaboration that includes key partners. Th ereare numerous organizations that need to be included in the dialogue about issues and solutions, and all groups must be represented, including immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQ, etc. Also, community or ganizations can use their buying power to show support for black and brown and other minority -owned businesses within the community. e. Housing / Employment / Food Insecurity Description of Health Need: Focus group participants observed the need for access to home ownership and for people to experience stability and wealth wit hin the community. More affordable housing is needed, as well as more multi -unit housing. There is a great need for stability in people's lives, especially given t he challenges brought on by the pandemic, which compromised mental health outcomes, children's wellbeing, employment, food security, and more. How to Address: Focus group participants supported an increase in the supply of affordable housing within the community. Also, an emphasis on employment was suggested, perhaps utilizing partnerships to guarantee employment upon completion of a certification or degree program. Also, food pantry deliveries to se niors in need was suggested. Within the discussion of significant health needs and how to best address those needs, it was mentioned that no single group can\"do it alone,\" and that the community working together will have the greatest impact on addressing health needs, such as through Community -Connected Care, an organization that helps those within th e community who need healthcare services and that is funded by philanthropic support from generous community partners. 158CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix B -Summary of Focus Groups: Public Health Department Input Return to Report Public health officials from the City of Evanston Department of Health, Lake County Health Department, and the Village of Sko kieHealth Department were interviewed to obtain additional input on the health needs of the community. The officials were asked three questions regarding community health, their responses to which aresummarized as follows. First, the officials were asked for their input regarding the most significant health needs within the community and their th oughts on recommended strategies for how to address those needs. Mental health was cited as a significant health need for numerous reasons, including the unwillingness of providers to accept Medicaid or Medicare, a lack of available inpatient mental health care, a lack of psychiatry providers (including a lack of diverse providers), the stigma surrounding seeking mental health treatment, and a lack of means to better identify and refer individuals with mental health needs. Suggestions to address the need for mental health services in the community include mental health first aid training a nd establishing a mental health \"living room\" program. A mental health \"living room\" model aims to have a dedicated building for mental health living rooms, which offer people experiencing a mental health crisis a calm and safe environment. Access to healthcare was also mentioned as a significant health need. Access to healthcare is hindered by numerous factors, i ncluding a lack of insurance, the high cost of care, staffing and resource constraints (due to retirements and people leaving the industry), and high volume and long wait times to obtain help. The off icials stated that all healthcare services should be accessible to everyone. Several suggestions were made to address this health need, including better identifying patients and improving referrals (whi ch requires an investment in digital technology and investment in resources to which individuals are referred), helping channel people to other resources rather than going through emergency rooms, and continuing to utilize telehealth (which has helped capacity by decreasing the no -show rate and improving continuity of care). Other significant health needs mentioned by the officials included a lack of trust in the healthcare system (especially among the African American community), the challenge of moving primary care diagnoses to specialty care, intergenerational poverty, nutrition, and inactive lifestyles. Social determinants of health tha t need addressed within the community include education (particularly how education is funded), the ability to earn a living wage, better housing, and food. Second, the officials were asked for their input regarding health disparities within the community and their thoughts on what populations in the community are most underserved. Individuals at lower socio -economic levels experience health disparities within the community, and a guaranteed income program was instituted in Evan ston to help individuals who have experienced extreme hardships during the pandemic. Undocumented residents also experience health disparities. While there is some governmental funding, the number of undocumented residents within the community is unknown and resources are limited. Undocumented residents may have a fear of seeking healthcare and may be unable to access care once diagnosed or when they become sick. Minority populations within the community \u2014including African American, Brown, and Hispanic communities \u2014experience health disparities. Structural racism must be a ddressed, as well as the ability for minorities to earn a living wage. Many essential workers were unable to work from home during the pandemic. Because they needed income, they were forced to go into the workplace, which increased their likelihood of exposure to COVID, leading to more deaths and infections. Individuals who speak English as a second language, or those who do not speak English at all (including immigrants, South Asians, and Middle Eastern populations) experience health disparities within the community, and deeper connections must be made with thes e communities. The elderly population also experiences health disparities in the community, as long -term care facilities are not investing in disease prevention (as seen with COVID). Also, i ndividuals with mental health needs experience health disparities in the community. 159CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Return to Report Third, the officials were asked their opinion regarding emerging health needs within the community. Poor diet and lack of exe rcise were discussed, with contributing factors including socio -economic status, the digital environment, and the pandemic. Another emerging health need discussed was negativity or hesitancy toward vaccines, especially given the threat of other infectious diseases and the future of COVID -19. Lessons learned from COVID may inform future responses to emerging new infectious diseases. There is a need for resources, staffing, and funding (particularly an increased investment in prevention). While improving public health infrastructure is important, the current trend is reduced government al funding as states try to find a COVID exit strategy. While it is hard to predict the future, it is important to build off lessons learned from COVID. Additional emerging health issues identified by theofficials include coordination and intake processes to help individuals in the health care system, and crime and violence. Evanston is seeking to put programs and initiatives in place to keep youth engage d and away from crime and violence. 160CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix C -Community Survey Summary Return to Report In order to develop a broad understanding of community health needs, NorthShore conducted a community survey during February and March of 2022. A link to the survey was distributed via e -mail, social media and word of mouth to the community at -large. A total of 947 surveys were completed. The majority of respondents were White/Caucasian (76%), 9% identified as Hispanic orLatino, 7% of the respondents identified as Asian, and 4% identified as Black or African American. The remaining 4% identified with other racial or ethnic identities. Respondents by age group were as follows: AgeGroup Percent respondents while males represented 21%. The remaining 1% of respondents identified as other genders or chose not to answer. Given the reported demographics above, care should be taken with interpreting the survey results. The ethnicities, ages and gender of survey respondents do not match demographics for the CHNA Community. Specifically, the survey reached more whites andmore females compared to demographic information for the community. Additionally, themajority of survey respondents were adults, aged 55+. Survey respondents were asked to rate the current status of their health. The majority of the respondents indicated the status of their health was good. Almost 65% of the survey respondents indicated they are always able to visit a doctor when needed. When asked for about the reasons why they are unable to visit a doctor when needed, respondents indicated the fact that doctors are not taking new patients, limited appointments are available and/or appointments are not available for months, inability to afford the doctor visit, and getting time off work as primary reasons why they could not visit the doctor when needed. The majority of respondents, over 74%, have had a routine physical in the last year. Respondents indicated the biggest source of stress in their daily life was financial stability and relationships. In addition, respondents indicated the biggest challenges related to the COVID -19 pandemic were mental health and social isolation and juggling work and family. 161CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix C -Community Survey Summary Return to Report When asked to rate how the same issues impacted the community, respondents identified cost of health care, mental health, obesity and assistance with navigating the healthcare system as the issues that affected the community most. The charts below summarize all of the responses to these questions.When asked \"How much do these health issues affect YOU?\" cost of health care, mental health, awareness and availability of healthy food choices and assistance with navigating the healthcare system were the issues that affected respondents most. 162CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix C -Community Survey Summary Return to Report The survey asked the following two questions: What do you believe are the current STRENGTHS of your community? What do you believe are the WEAKNESSES in your community? The survey provided predetermined responses that could be selected from the list. Respondents were instructed to mark up to f iveselections. Below is a summary of strengths and weaknesses identified. 163CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix C -Community Survey Summary Return to Report Below is summary of the survey results regarding specific statements regarding community resources and health behaviors. Key findings are summarized on the following page. 164CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix C -Community Survey Summary Return to Report Approximately 62% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed with eating five fruits and vegetables each day. Significantly less, 35%, exercise at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week. 17% of the survey respondents indicated transportation to and from doctor appointments is challenging. 10% of the survey respondents disagreed that the housing they lived in was affordable and safe.Community Resources and Health Behaviors -Key Findings 165CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix D -Impact of Actions Taken to Address the Significant Health Needs Identified in the Prior CHNA Return to Report Evaluation oftheImpact ofActions benefits inAdvancing theState thegreatest serve . health theanticipated oftheinitiatives hospital outlined inthe strategic plan bycollecting data onhow many individuals utilized components oftheinitiative .Measurement oftheimpact also assessed bygathering ongoing feedback from thehospitals' Community Advisory Committees, senior leadership andphysician leadership .

This process identified 16 health needs listed below. To facilitate prioritization of identified health needs, a ranking process was used. Health needs were ranked based on the fo llowing five factors. Each factor received a score between 0 and 5. 1)How many people are affected by the issue or size of the issue? For this factor, ratings were based on the percentage of the community who are impacted by the identified need. The following scale was utilized: >25% of are the consequences of not addressing this problem? Identified health needs which have a high death rate or have a high impact on chronic diseases received a higher rating. 3)The impact of the problem on vulnerable populations. Needs identified which pertained to vulnerable populations were rated for this factor. 4)How important the problem is to the community. Needs identified through community focus groups and the community survey were rated for this factor. 5)Prevalence of common themes. The rating for this factor was determined by how many sources of data (leading causes of death, health outcomes and factors and primary data) identified the need.Access to Health Services (Cost, Language, Navigating Healthcare System) Affordability of Healthcare Cancer Chronic Health Conditions (Diabetes and High Blood Pressure) Health Inequity/Discrimination Food Insecurity Heart DiseaseHealth Literacy Lack of Affordable Housing Maternal and Child Health Mental/Behavioral Health Obesity Poverty Preventative Care Violence/Safety Youth Mental Health/Substance Abuse 195CHNA Executive Summary Key Health Indicators Community Input About Our Community Prioritized Health Needs Appendices Appendices Appendix E -Description of NorthShore's Prioritization Process In addition, 28 NorthShore stakeholders provided input by rating each health need for each of the following statements using a scale of 1 to 6. 1.

Years of the most current data available differ by data source. In some instances, 2021 may be the most current year available for data, while 2014 may be the most cu rrent year for other sources. Likewise, survey data based on self -reports, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), should be interpreted with particular cau tion. In some instances, respondents may over or under report behaviors and illnesses based on fear of social stigma or misunderstanding the question being asked. In addition, respondents may be prone to recall bias -that is, they may attempt to answer accurately, but they remember incorre ctly. In some surveys, reporting and recall bias may differ according to a risk factor or health outcome of interest. Despite these limitations, most of the self -report surveys anal yzed in this CHNA benefit from large sample sizes and repeated administrations, enabling comparison over time. Similarly, while the qualitative data collected for this study provi de valuable insights, results are not statistically representative of a larger population due to nonrandom recruiting techniques and a small sample size. Data were collected at onepoint in time and among a limited number of individuals. Therefore, findings, while directional and descriptive, should not be interpreted as definitive.

NorthShore -Edward- Elmhurst Health desires to continue providing clinical programs and services to meet community health needs, while also pursuing continuous improvement in existing and future programs to improve the overall health of individuals in the communities it ser ves. This joint Implementation Strategy Plan (ISP) was conducted by the following hospitals within NorthShore -Edward- Elmhurst Health: Evanston, Glenbrook, Highland Park and Skokie. These four hospitals collectively serve the same communities within NorthShore University HealthSys tem(NorthShore). For the remainder of this report \"NorthShore\" will refer to these four hospitals. Please note that Edward- Elmhurst Health, Swedish Hospital and Northwest Community Healthcare develop and release their own separate ISPs.NorthShore -Edward -Elmhurst Health's Mission The core mission of NorthShore -Edward Elmhurst is to \"help everyone in our communities their best.\" About NorthShore -Edward -Elmhurst Health Needs AddressedSteering Committee MembersConclusion Executive Summary Purpose of a Hospital's Implementation Strategy An Implementation Strategy Plan (ISP) outlines how a hospital plans to address community health needs and is intended to satisfy the requirements set forth by state law and the Internal Revenue Code Section 501(r)(3) regarding Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) and Implementation Strategy. The ISP process is meant to align NorthShore University HealthSystem's (NorthShore) initiatives and programs with goals, objectives and indicators that address significant community health needs described in the CHNA . Community Definition NorthShore's patients collectively come from a large geographic area. For purposes of this report, the community served by NorthShore includes 54 zip codes in Lake County, northern Cook County and the north side of Chicago. The map to the right shows the level to which each zip code utilizes NorthShore's services and is based on inpatient, outpatient and emergency room visits. Patient Visits - FYE 2021 200Executive SummaryPrioritized Health NeedsSignificant Health Needs Not AddressedSteering Committee MembersConclusion Executive Summary The ISP was developed after the comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was completed. Please refer to the com plete CHNA for the full report. Strategies and action plans were developed based on a consensus among a steering committee comprised of NorthShore leaders after input from each of the respective disciplines. The organization intends to undertake the following strategies to meet the identified community health needs. Most of the strategies and initiatives will be coordinated and advanced through teams comprised of representatives from each of the four hospitals included in this joint implementation strategy. In instances where an initiative applies to a specific hospital facility, the hospital facility has been identified in the detai led action plans. It is important to note that our health equity work is fundamental and integrated throughout our priority needs' strategies on the following pages. This ISP will be reviewed annually during the two- year lifespan of the 2022 CHNA and updated as needed to ensure viability and i mpact. NorthShore's impact will be communicated regularly to reporting agencies and our community.How the CHNA Implementation Strategy was Developed Expand efforts to identify and respond to social determinants of health (SDOH),such as medication, transportation,housing.

This work is fundamental and integrated throughout our priority needs on the following pages of our ISP . As an organization, we have key commitments around measurement, learning and action which are critical to our ongoing health equ ity work. By improving our data collection efforts on areas such as Race, Ethnicity and Language (REAL), we are able to get a more complete picture of our patient and community demographics, allowing us to improve the way we meet our community's needs and deliver care, all in a welcoming and affirming environment. Enhancing screening opportunities for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) allows us to better understand challenges and barriers that ourcommunity members face, so we can navigate them to critical resources and services they may need. Finally, partnering with community organizations throu gh our Community Investment Fund allows us to further address priority health needs in a powerful, collaborative way. Health equity commitments include: Reduce % of all patients who have had a face to face encounter at NorthShore who we document as \"Other, Declined or Unknown\" Educate and engage front line staff on REAL and/or SOGI data collection improvementeffortsMeasurement: We are working to accurately capture race, ethnicity, language and other preferences and to ensure that all of our patients' perspectives are captured in our measurement systems Develop a consistent and reliable process to collect, visualize, and intervene on SocialDeterminants of Health (SDOH) data Educate and engage team members on SDOH screening effortsLearning: We are investing in leading practices and new ways to listen to our patients and community members, incorporating feedback to understand and impact social determinants of health Enhance partnerships and provide funding through NorthShore's Community InvestmentFund (CIF) to help local organizations build capacity and increase impact, with at least 80%of annual CIF awardee partners addressing CHNA priority needs Build and expand Health Equity Community Liaison program to deepen community partnerships within under -resourced communitiesAction: We are investing in and partnering with like -minded community organizations to close the gap on health disparities. 202Executive SummaryPrioritized Health NeedsSignificant Health Needs Not AddressedSteering Committee MembersConclusion Steering Committee Members NorthShore Steering Committee Members Executive Co -Chairs Mahalakshmi Halasyamani, MD System Chief Clinical Officer Gabrielle Cummings, President, Legacy NorthShore Acute Care Operations & Highland Park Hospital Christine Bloomfield, Senior Consultant, Transformation Management Office Brandon Buchanan, Director, Health Equity Jenise Celestin, Director, NorthShore Community RelationsTameka Crump, Practice Manager, Evanston Hospital Community Health CenterHania Fuschetto, Manager, Community Relations, Glenbrook & Highland Park HospitalsCatherine Glunz, MD, Medical Director, Evanston Hospital Community Health Center Jesse Peterson Hall, President, Glenbrook HospitalThomas Hensing, MD, Medical OncologySamantha Maras, Assistant Vice President, Ambulatory, Quality and Population HeathMark Schroeder, Manager, Community Relations, Evanston & Skokie HospitalsRobyn Thurston, Director, Medical Group OperationsJeffery Zakem, Manager, Office of Community Health Equity & Engagement 203Executive SummaryPrioritized Health NeedsSignificant Health Needs Not AddressedSteering Committee MembersConclusion Access to Services Mental Health Chronic Health ConditionsPrioritized Health Needs Access to Health ServicesAccess to Health Services *denotes initiative with health equity integrationACTIONS NORTHSHORE PLANS TO TAKE TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEED Strategy Initiatives/Programs Reportable Metrics/Anticipated ImpactCollaborations 1.Expand efforts to identify and social determinants of health (SDOH), such asmedication, transportation,housing.Implement and expand SDOH screening referral tool within CHC, ETHS Health Center,medical group practices, and emergency departments.* Continue to develop capacity at CHC to better service uninsured and underinsured.*(Evanston Hospital) Explore ways to reduce transportation cost barrier.* Educate NorthShore medical providers on the services available at the CHC and develop collateral to support navigation for under -resourced individuals.* (Evanston Hospital) Explore opportunities to participate in community health fairs with CHC team members based on insights from SDOH screening.* (Evanston Hospital)% of patients screened, % of patients with SDOH needs identified, % of patients connected to resources/services via referrals Increase the number of NorthShore patients with medical homes. # of parking vouchers/total amount# of providers educated# of health fairs and participantsSDOH referral platform; community based organizations addressing SDOH; local Community Health Center; NorthShore Immediate Care sites; NorthShore medical residents 2.

In January 2021, Northwest Community Healthcare (NCH) joined No rthShore University HealthSystem. The NCH Arlington He ights campus features a 509-b ed hospital with a Level II Trauma Center, Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and dedic a t e d p e d i a t r i c e m e r g e n c y department. Throughout the north west suburbs, NCH has 23 doctor's offices; five immediate care centers; seven physical rehabilitation sites; and 13 lab l ocations. A comprehensive listing of physicians and programs can be found at nch.org. Headquartered in Evanston, North Shore is a fully integrated hea lthcare delivery system that includes 6 hospitals\u2014Evanston, G lenbrook, Highland Park, Skokie , Swedish and now NCH. Together, the NorthShore system p rovides clinical excellence an d community-focused care across Chicagoland. NorthShore c onsistently ranks as a Top 15 M ajor Teaching Hospital in the United States, with an established reputation for exceptional p atient care and is a national pioneer in the implementation of advanced health information te chnology. More information, can be found at NorthShore.org and SwedishCovenant.org . NCH has a proud and longstandin g tradition of outreach to the medically und erserved within its northwest suburban service area, and the recent year was no different. What was different; however, was NCH's ability to work swiftly and safely to meet the emerging needs of its community due to the COVID-19 pand emic. NCH had two of the init ial cases of COVID-19 in Illinois in late February and e arly March of 2020 and understan ds it is the utmost health concern of the community. Throug hout the first and second surge of the virus, NCH continued to care for the medically under served of the community. As nati onal and local attention focuses on vaccine availability a nd distribution, NCH continues to lead education efforts to promote vaccine adoption and su pports its community's healing b y recognizing social, economic and emotional im pacts of the virus. NCH maintains a Community Service s Department dedicated to addressing the needs of not only its patients, but of everyone who lives and works in the c ommunity. The Community Services Department utilizes hos pital strengths alongside those of other well-established community partners to identify unm et community health needs and to develop strategic initiatives to address them. Wo rking collaboratively allows NCH to better understand and reach the most vulnerable sectors of t he community with the ultimate goal of improving the community's health status by ens uring everyone has access to ca re and by empowering individuals to make healthy life choices. 211Definition of the Community Served NCH's community, as defined for th e purposes of the CHNA, inclu des each of the ZIP codes that comprise the hospital's Total Service Area (TSA). The TSA is comprised of both the hospital's Primary Service Area (PSA) and Secondary Service Are a (SSA). The geographic footprint is illustrated in the fo llowing map along with a char t that lists the zip codes and names of towns. This community definition was determined because 82% of NCH's p atients originate from the primary and secondary service areas.

A healthy community is not only one where its residents suffer little from physical and mental illness, but also one where its residents enjoy a high quality of life. To reduce the health disparities among residents. By gathering demographic information along with health s tatus and behavior data, it will be possible to identify population segments that are most at-risk for various diseases and injuries. Intervention plans aimed at targeting these individuals may then be develope d to combat some of the socio-economic factors which h ave historically had a negative impact on residents' health. To increase accessibility to preventive services for all commun ity residents . More accessible preventive services will prove beneficial in accompl ishing the first goal (improving health status, increa sing life spans, and elevating the quality of life), as well as lowering the costs associated with caring for late-stage dis eases resulting from a lack of preventive care. CHNA Data Collection/Methodology The CHNA was completed by incorpo rating data from quantitative or a combination of quantitative and qualitative re sources. Quantitative data inclu ded demographic information and secondary data and a combination of quantitative and qualit ative data was gathered through focus groups, online community surveys and key informan t surveys. Quantitative Data Demographic and Chronic Disease Growth Information NCH contracted with Sg2, an indu stry leader in h ealthcare analy tics and consulting, for a comprehensive demographic snapshot of the hospitals service area. Sg2 provided population growth projections for the comm unity by town, age, gender, ethn icity/race, language, income and education. In addition, the y forecasted the projected growth of chronic disease in the outpatient setting for NCH's ser vice area. Changes in community demographics have a direct correlation with healthcare ne eds and how to address them. Secondary Data SparkMap (sparkmap.org) is a product of the Center for Applied Research and Engagement Systems (CARES) and hosted by the University of Missouri. Spark Map uses location-specific data to create maps and communi ty assessments that inform, guide and transform the work of healthcare organizations. The go al of SparkMap is to increase the impact of those working toward healthy, equitable, and s ustainable communities. The w eb portal allows access to data 224in multiple categories which c an be used to explore community health. Custom tools allow the user to filter data by zip code an d create a report specificall y for its community ( Appendix A ). It also allows the user to create a custom report which highlights its community's greatest areas of concern (Appendix B). The 2020 County Health Rankings an d Roadmaps Report (countyheal thrankings.org), a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and th e University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, ranked U.S. counties in every stat e on various health outcomes, health factors, social and ec onomic conditions, and the physica l environment. The major goal of the Rankings is to raise awa reness about the many factors that influence health and that health varies from place to place. Although the Rankings provid e valuable county-wide information it does not examine data at the sub-county level. C ook County is unique in that it is the second-most populous county in the United States after L os Angeles County, California. There are 130 incorporated muni cipalities partially or wholly w ithin Cook County, the largest of which is Chicago, which is home to approximately 54% of the pop ulation of the county. The Cook County Department of Public H ealth recognizes the uniqueness of the county and identified indicators from the Ra nkings for which local data ex isted and created a report specifically for Suburban Cook County ( Appendix C ). Quantitative/Qualitative Data Focus Groups NCH realized the importance of ga thering opinions and feedback from vulnerable populations in the community who have some of th e greatest healthcare needs . An independent moderator was hired to conduct two focus gr oups in February 2021: one with Spanish- speaking under- resourced community members and one with English-speaking under-resourced community members. These focus groups were held at the Community Resource Center in Palatine, located in the hospitals primar y service area. Potential parti cipants were given a short screening questionnaire to ensur e they lived in the hospital's service area and so that participants would vary in age, ge nder, insurance status, incom e and educational levels if possible. The focus groups followed a guideline which mirrored questions included in the community and key informant surve ys so that the information gathered could be used to compare with the survey results . The moderator summarized the r esults of the focus groups which were used as one of the to ols in identifying the most pre dominant community needs (Appendix D ). NCH also conducted a focus group in February 2021 with its Pati ent Family Advisory Council, which is comprised of community m embers who use NCH as their medical home. The same format as the focus groups descri bed above was used, and provid ed an opportunity to gather additional information on the community's beliefs and perceptio ns about the health of its community, which supplemented the data collected in the online Community Health Survey (Appendix E). 225Community Survey NCH developed a comprehensive online community health survey in order to take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the com munity served by the hospital. The survey asked participants to share their beliefs and percep tions about access to care, behavioral health, chronic disease/health issues, modifiable ri sk factors/behaviors and other concerns. It also asked the participants to rank their \"top t hree health concerns\" for the community. The community was invited to participate in the onli ne survey through a media release and a paid advertisement in a local newspaper, NCH's el ectronic community newsletter \"A Healthier You\", NCH's electron ic volunteer and employee newsletters, social media and through an email announcement by N CH's Foundation to all donors . The survey link, located on the home page of the hospital's website (nch.org), was open from February 12 to 22, 2021 and 364 people responded. The ma jority of the respondents were Caucasian (99%), female (71%) and older adults (15% Age 55-64, 36% Age 65-74, and 32% Age 75 or older). The majority (73%) had attained a colle ge degree (associates or hig her) and had either Medicare (63%) or private insurance ( 34%). The majority (72%) live in th e hospital's primary service area and the remainder (28%) live in th e hospital's secondary servic e area. Results from the survey were summarized in a quanti tative/qualitative report ( Appendix F ). 226Key Informant Surv eys An additional online survey was i mplemented as part of the CHNA process specifically to solicit input from key informants; indiv iduals who are considered exper ts in public health. Potential participants were cho sen because of their ability to identify p rimary concerns of the community, including the medically underserved, low-income and minority populations served by the hospital. In January 2021, 44 potential ke y informants were identified an d sent a letter from the hospital's President and CEO to e xplain the purpose of the surv ey and to invite them to participate. A link to the onlin e survey was then emailed to ea ch key informant and was open from February 1-10, 2021. A reminder email was sent to encourag e participation. The key informants were asked the same questions as the community which focused on access to care, behavioral health, chronic disease/health issues, modifiable ri sk factors/behaviors and other concerns. It also asked them to r ank their \"top three health co ncerns\" for the community. Results from the survey were su mmarized in both a quantitative (Appendix G ) and qualitative (Appendix H) report. In all, 24 of the 44 invited parti cipants took part in the Onli ne Key Informant Survey (below).

Representatives from the followi ng departments served on the co mmittee: Behavioral Health, Care Coordination, Community Based Care, Community Services, Co mpliance, Diabetes Services, Emergency Department, EMS, Foundation, Guest Services, Immediate Care Centers, Medical Group, Nursing Excellenc e, Patient Access Services, Pat ient Experience, and Research. In addition, the chair of the Community Health and Outreach Com mittee of the NCH Board of Directors participated in the committee. The committee members were provi ded with an overview of the com munity health needs assessment process and received a summary and comparison docume nt (Appendix J) which was used as a tool to review a ll of the quantitative and qualitative findings. The findings from the focus groups, community survey and key informant survey wer e compared and the secondary data provided supplemen tal information. The most comm on themes and comments from the narrative portion of the surveys were also highlighted in the document. In addition, the committee was given web access to the complete survey results, focus groups summaries and all secondary data. The committee was given time to review the summary and comparison document and to acce ss the additional resources and then reconvened to rank or prioritize the issues. The commi ttee then used the following cr iteria to identify which health needs would be addressed over the next three years: Magnitude : The size or extent of the issue and/or populations affected Impact/Seriousness : The degree to which the issue affects or exacerbatesother quality of life and health-relatedissues Feasibility : The ability to reasonably impact the issue, given availableresources Consequences of Inaction : The risk of not addressing the problem at the earliestopportunity Professional Experience : Health concerns committee members witnessedworking at NCH during the recent year 229Prioritization Results Ranking of Health Concerns Ranking: 1-3 (1 is highest level of concern) Rank #1 Access to Care- Behavioral Health Services Substance Abuse-Alcohol and Drugs Mental Illness (Includes Suicide) Heart Disease/Stroke /High Blood Pressure Cancer Diabetes Obesity-Adults and Children Food Insecurity Physical Activity-Lack Of Child Abuse Domestic Violence Elder Abuse Rank #2 Access to Care-Specialty, Oral He alth, Preventati ve Vision Services and Prescription Medic ation Dementia/Alzheimer's Arthritis/Osteoporosis/Back Chronic Kidney Disease Oral Health Respiratory-Asthma Vision Nutrition Tobacco Usage Adequate-Affordable Housing Safe Neighborhoods Teen Births Rank #3 Access to Care-Immunizations, Primary Care Hearing Loss Sexually Transmitted Diseases Infant/Child Health 230NCH Priority Health Issues to Be Addressed In consideration of the top heal th priorities identified through the CHNA process \u2014 and taking into account hospital resources and overall alignment with the hospital's mission, goals and strategic priorities \u2014 it was determined that NCH would focus t he majority of its efforts on developing and/or supporting strategies and initiatives to improve the following priority areas: 1.Behavioral Health (Mental Hea lth and Substance Abuse) Concern about behavioral health was a consistent theme througho ut the CHNA. This issue has no economic or societ al boundaries; all data confirme d that mental health and substance abuse is a major and g rowing concern in NCH's service area. In addition, as noted previously, access to care for behavioral health is extre mely difficult for under- resourced, often uninsured indiv iduals. State and community-bas ed resources have almost disappeared due to funding c uts and those that do remain often do not accept individuals without insurance or those who are on Medicaid whic h leaves no alternative other than using area emergency de partments for care and medica tions. A vast majority of the qualitative feedback from the CHNA indicated significant concern about alcohol and drug abuse with opioids and heroin addiction being the most prevalent. Survey participants shared that treatmen t for behavioral health issues carries embarrassment and a stigma which discourag e many from seeking help. 2. Obesity Obesity is another issue that was consis tently expressed as a major health concern in all aspects of the CHNA. All three focus groups ranked obesity as a major concern for both adults and children and more th an half of the key informants ra nked it a major concern. Lack of physical activity, nutrition and food insecurity furthe r solidified obesity as a health concern of epidemic propor tion. Secondary data shows that 19.8 % of low- income people living in NCH's se rvice area have low access to f ood; higher than the state rate of 14.68% and U.S. of 18.94%. In addition, there is a shortage of stores accepting SNAP (Supplemental Nutr ition Assistance Program) bene fits in the NCH Service Area. Food insecurity tr anslates directly into poorer h ealth-and more visits to the emergency department. A U.S. Depa rtment of Agriculture report found that food insecurity was linked to 10 of the costliest and deadliest prev entable diseases in the country. 3.Access to Healthcare for U nder-Resourced The committee spent a great deal of time discussing access to c are and the inequities within the hospital's se rvice area. The assessments rankings for access to care, and all of the health concerns, are represen tative of the entire broad community. Individuals with insurance have little issues with accessing healthcare services but the assessment clearly indicated that this is not the case with under-resourced, often uninsured individuals. Access to all areas of healthcar e, including specialty, behavio ral, oral, vision, screenings, and medication is challenging when financial resources are limi ted. (Note that although 231access to primary care was not r anked a major concern, the comm ittee thought it should be included in Implementation Plan as it is often a dire ct link to accessing specialty care). The CHNA showed that NCH's service area has a higher uninsured rate for both adults (11.32%) and children (3.65% ) than the state (9 .93% and 3.35%). In addition, NCH's service area has a higher percent of individual s with limited English proficiency (14.23%) than both th e state (8.64%) and U.S. (8.40 %) which often makes accessing healthcare difficult. Un employment rates for NCH's se rvice area (7.2%) are higher than both the state (6.5 %) and U.S. (6.4%) and public tr ansportation is extremely limited. Because of these factors, the committee selected \"Acce ss to Care for the Under- Resourced\" as one of the key priority areas. 4.Cancer (Including Tobacco) Cancer is the second leading cau se of death in the United State s, exceeded only by heart disease. Approximately 608,570 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2021, which translates to about 1,670 deaths per day. Illinois is expected to have 74,980 new cases of cancer and 23,070 cancer deaths in 2021. All three foc us groups unanimously agreed that cancer is a major c oncern (100%) and more than half of the key informants surveyed (55%) and community sur veyed (58%) agreed. Secondary data indicated that breast and prostate cancer are the most concerning, especially for the Medicarepopulation. In addition, the lo w-income focus groups unanimous ly ranked tobacco a major concern (100%) which incl udes not only cigarettes but also e-cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Chronic Disease (Diabetes, Heart Disease/Stroke, and High Blood Pressure) Statistics show that in 2018, 34.2 million Americans had diabet es, and another 88 million U.S. adults had pre-diabetes, equating to $237 billion dollars in health care costs. Heart disease is the leading cause of d eath in the United States. Approximately 655,000 Americans die from heart diseas e each year-that is one in four deaths. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary a rtery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to th e heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack. Stroke is another form o f heart disease and in the Unit ed States someone has a stroke every 40 seconds and dies f rom a stroke every 4 minutes. All three focus groups indicated that heart disease, str oke and diabetes are major hea lth concerns. The key informant participants also ranked these as major concerns. Once the priority areas were dete rmined, the multidisciplinary committee identified key individuals to serve on issue s pecific committees to develop im plementation strategies and tactics for each of the areas. These individuals also developed metrics to measure the success of the strategies which will be monitored and upd ated over the next three years. In acknowledging the wi de range of priority health issues that emerged from the CHNA process, NCH determined that it could only effecti vely focus on those which it deemed most pressing, most under-addressed, and most within its ability to influence. Responses to the remaining needs identified are noted below: Health Priority Reason 232Previous CHNA and Im plem entat ion Plan The needs identified in the 2021 CHNA were almost identical to the needs identified in the 2018 CHNA with the exception of B ehavioral Health. The magnitud e and seriousness of both mental health and substance abuse concerns increased significan tly. This could have been impacted by the fact that the 2021 CHNA took place during the C OVID-19 pandemic, a time when many people were feeling depr essed, isolated or had situat ions that caused an increased amount of stress. In 2020, despite the pandemic, NC H was able to meet more than h alf of the goals that were developed to measure the effectiv eness of the strategies and tactics implemented to impact the needs identified in the 2018 CHNA. The pandemic negatively impacted NCH's ability to meet some of the goals because p rograms were suspended due to t he stay at home order and so that hospital staff could focus their efforts on helping wit h COVID patients. For the FY22- FY24 Implementation plan, NCH w ill continue to utilize the stra tegies and tactics in the FY19- FY21 Implementation Plan which i ncludes: screenings, education, treatment, support and improving access to care. Public Dissemination The CHNA was posted on NCH's hospital website, nch.org/chna, in July 2021. There is also a link which allows an opportunity for the public to submit any comments or questions they may have on the report. There were no comments or questions received regarding the previous assessment conducted in 2018. Access to Care for UR: Specialty and Vision NCH believes access to these are as will be addressed through re ferrals from primary care physicians at commun ity clinics and through screen ings and support services offered by local school districts. Child Abuse, Elder Abuse and Domestic Violence NCH collaborates with four local not-for-profit community agenc ies (Catholic Charities, Children's Advocacy Center, Northwest CASA and WINGS ) to address child abuse, elder abu se and domestic violence. Dementia and Alzheimer's NCH believes there are sufficient community resources available including primary care physicians to diagn ose and nursing homes and memor y care facilities to treat. Teen Sexuality: Pregnancy and STD's NCH collaborates with local school districts that provide sex e ducation and support services and with local community clinics who address p revention and treatment. Safe Neighborhoods and Affordable Housing NCH is a healthcare facility and is not equipped to address hou sing issues. NCH relies on its local municipa lities to address these concern s. 233NCH will provide any individual requesting a copy of the written report with the direct website address, or URL, where the docu ment can be accessed. NCH will also maintain at its facilities hard copies of the CHNA report t hat may be viewed by any who re quests it. Information Gaps While this CHNA is quite comprehe nsive, NCH recognizes that it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the communi ty, nor can it adequately repre sent all possible populations of interest. It must be recognize d that these information gaps might in some ways limit the ability to assess all of the community's health needs. For example, certain population groups \u2014 such as institutionalized persons or those who only speak a language other than English or Spanish\u2014 are not represented in the survey data. Other population groups \u2014 for exam ple, pregnant wo men, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender residents, and members of certai n racial/ethnic or immigrant gr oups \u2014 might not be identifiable or might not be repr esented in numbers sufficient for independent analyses. In terms of content, this assessment was designed to provide a com prehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall co mmunity. However, there are cert ainly a great number of medical conditions that are not specifically addressed. FY2022-FY2024 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN Integration with Operational Planning Community benefit is included in both NCH's strategic plan and operating budget. Implementation Strategies The Community Health Implementation Plan outlines NCH's plans t o address the priority health issues chosen for action in the FY2022-FY2024 period. No te that these strategies are in addition to millions of dollars of Charity Care and Medicaid/Me dicare shortfalls that NCH provides. The Implementation Plan, along with the full Community Health Needs Assessment, were reviewed and approved by th e Community Health and Outreach Committee of the Board on June 15, 2021 and presented to the entire corporate board of directors on June 28, 2021. It was posted on nch.org on June 30, 2021. 234Social Determinants of Health Social determinants of health greatly impact th e health and wellness of individuals in our com- munity. Research shows that income, housing, educa on, diet and employment have a direct correla on to a person's health status. NCH recognizes this and is commi ed to incorpora ng strategies to address these factors in its Community Health Implementa on Plan.

Swedish Hospital and the Alliance for Health Equity adapted the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) model for the CHNA, emphasiz ing the importanc e of community engagement, partnership development, and both primary and secondary data . The Alliance for Health Equity chose this inclusive, community -driven process to leverage and align with health department assessments and to actively engage stakehold ers, including community members, in identifying and addressing strategic priorities to advance health equity. Swedish Hospital worked with the Alliance for Health Equity and local community partners in the communities we serve to identif y and prioritize the following health needs within our community through 2024 : Swedish will continue to partner with members of Alliance for Health Equity and other key community partners within our service area to leverage existing resources and develop strategies which contribute to improving the most pressing health needs of our communities. The corresponding Community Health Implementation Plan will des cribe programs Swedish is undertaking over the coming years to address the prioritized health needs within our community. To access the full collaborative Community Health Needs Assessment for Chicago and Suburban Cook Counties, please visit https://allhealthequity.org/projects/2022 -chna -report/ Our Hospital This CHNA was conducted by the Alliance for Health Equity and pertains to Swedish Hospital. Swedish Hospital is part of NorthShor e\u2014Edward -Elmhurst Health . NorthShore \u2014Edward -Elmhurst Health is a fully integrated healthcare delivery system committed to providing access to quality, vibrant, community -connected care, serving an area of more than 4.2 million residents across six northe ast Illinois counties. Our more than 25,000 team members and more than 6,000 physicians aim to deliver transformative patient experiences and expert care close to home across more than 300 ambulatory locations and eight acute care hospitals - Edward (Naper ville), Elmhurst, Evanston, Glenbrook (Glenview), Highland Park, Northwest Community (Arlington Heights) , Skokie , and Swedish (Chicago) - all recognized as Magnet hospitals for nursing excellence. Located in Naperville, Linden Oaks Behavioral Health, provides for the mental health needs of area residents. NorthShore -Edward - Elmhurst Health desires to continue providing clinical programs and services to meet community health needs, while also pursuing continuous improvement in existing and future progra ms to improve the overall health of individuals in the communities it serves. As such, hospitals within the NorthShore \u2014Edward -Elmhurst Health system conduct Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA's) every three years, using primary and secondary data, to ensure 243 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment community benefit programs and resources are focused on significant health needs as perceived by the community at large, as well as alignment with NorthShore \u2014Edward -Elmhurst Health 's mission, services, and strategic priorities. This CHNA is focuse d on the communities served by Swedish Hospital . Edward -Elmhurst Health, NorthShore University HealthSystem (Evanston, Glenbrook, Highland Park and Skokie Hospitals) and Northwest Community Healthcare develop and release their own separate CHNAs. Swedish Hospital - Services, Locations and Commitment to Community Swedish Hospital serves the culturally -diverse residents of Chicago's north and northwest side communities, with a full - service hospital campus located in Lincoln Square at the intersection of Fos ter and California Avenues. Swedish Hospital provides a full range of comprehensive health and wellness services including an acute care hospital, primary care and specialists in the medical group, strong community outreach programs and Chicago's only cer tified medical fitness center, Galter LifeCenter. Swedish offers more than 50 medical specialties with practices conveniently placed throughout hospital's campus and on multiple sites throughout Chicago's north side communities (including several Immediat e Care Centers) to make care accessible to our patients, wherever they are. Swedish maintains a department dedicated to addressing its outreach objectives of serving the entire community, not only those who come through its doors. Building on a long tradi tion of service, the Community Relations Department utilizes hospital strengths alongside those of other well -established community partners. This strategy allows Swedish to better understand and reach the most vulnerable sectors of the community, while me eting pressing healthcare needs. The goal is to improve the community's health status by empowering citizens to make healthy life choices. Our Commitment to Address Health Equity and Reduce Health Disparities Diversity, equity and inclusion is at the core of who we are, being there for our patients and each other with compassion, respect and empathy. We believe that our strength resides in our differences and in connecting our best to provide community -connected healthcare for all. We commit to: See, hear , and value all team members and patients Connect our best to serve our diverse communities Do everything we can to help you achieve your full potential in work, life, and health We commit to accelerating: Inclusion: The ability to be our authentic selves impacts our life, health and happiness. We are committed to making this a place where all team members and patients feel like they belong. Opportunity: We are becoming a better reflection of the world we live in, investing in community partnerships and leadership development to enhance diversity across NorthShore. Health Equity: We are addressing disparities in health and well -being, advancing access and patient outcomes across all the communities we serve. 244 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Actions by Swedish Hospital to Advance Heal th Equity Regional Lead for CDPH's Healthy Chicago Equity Zone (North/Central Region) Leader of Chicago North Side Collaborative, a Healthcare Transformation Program Swedish Hospital Foundation's investment s in mission -driven programs address ing health equ ity Accelerating system wide strategies for inclusion, opportunity, and health equity Improving collection and training on REAL data Racial Equity in Healthcare Progress Report (Illinois Health and Hospital Association, IHA) Integrating hea lth equity into systemwide quality framework Improving collection of social determinants of health indicators Implicit bias training for care providers and team members Community Investment Fund Partners investing in community organizations to enhance health and wellbeing, advance health equity and support local economic growth Swedish Hospital's Highlighted Community Initiatives Swedish Hospital has a robust offering of community health and outreach programs designed to serve the needs of our diverse community. Highlights include: Pathways : The Pathways Program was developed to strengthen the hospital's ability to identify and assist patients who are survivors of interpersonal violence. Food Connections : The Food Connections Program was developed to strengthen the hospital's ability to address food insecurity and remove food access as a barrier to health. Nutrition and Diabetes Center : This program offers comprehensive education, resou rces and support to patients diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes, as well as individual nutrition education to patients with various nutrition needs. Community Outreach Registered Dietician (CORD): This community -facing dietician engages in educational activities, outreach and pub lic benefit education and enrollment assistance. Healthy Chicago Equity Zone s (HCEZ): Swedish was awarded a grant via the City of Chicago to serve as Regional Lead for the North/Central area of the HCEZ initiative. This program began in the summer of 2021 and focuses on collaboratively working alongside trusted, local community or ganizations and leaders to identify and confront the social and environmental issues that contribute to health and racial inequity. Chicago North Side Collaborative : This Healthcare Transformation Program helps to reduce barriers to care and other disparities by embedding specialty care and other supportive services into local Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) thanks to IL Dept. of Healthcare and Family Serv ices (HFS) Transformation Funding. As part of the hospital's community outreach efforts, the Community Ambassador Program and the Community Leader Engagement Program allow Swedish to further connect with the community. Swedish initiated a Community Ambass ador Program in FY16 which consists of employees throughout the organization who live in the local community and serve as liaisons to further build bridges among neighbors. Ambassadors engage in dialogue with schools, churches, cultural groups and other lo cal organizations to learn more directly about the community's unique needs. Ambassadors share feedback and insight with the Community Relations Department which helps guide development of programming and education to serve the community. Swedish establis hed a Community Leader Engagement Program in FY17 as an extension of the Ambassador Program, to invite leaders from throughout the community to convene several times per year to discuss community health needs and ways to collaborate for the benefit of all. Together, the group has worked on the following health initiatives: head 245 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment injury prevention/bike helmet safety, bystander CPR and community wellness (fitness, nutrition, mind/body, prevention). This Community Leader group consists of more than 100 social s ervice organizations, health care providers, elected officials, schools and others. Members include: Apna Ghar, Between Friends, Budlong Elementary School, Centro Romero, Chicago Police - 20th District, Common Pantry , Erie Family Health, The Friendship Center, HANA Center, Hamdard Health, Hatzalah, Heartland Health Centers, ICNA Relief, Lutheran Social Services, Neighborhood Boys and Girls Club and Rohingya Culture Center. As part of the CHNA process, Swedish's Commun ity Leader group met with hospital leaders and the Alliance for Health Equity staff to provide feedback on initial findings and priorities from the CHNA . Additionally, various organizations from the Community Leader group were active contributors to focus groups related to health care providers and social services, including immigrant and refugee -serving organizations. Swedish Hospital's Participation in the Alliance for Health Equity The Alliance for Health Equity (AHE) is a partnership between the Illino is Public Health Institute (IPHI), hospitals, health departments, and community organizations across Chicago and Cook County. This initiative is one of the largest collaborative hospital -community partnerships in the country with the current involvement of 30+ nonprofit and public hospitals, seven local health departments, and representatives of more than 100 community organizations serving on action teams. The Alliance for Health Equity is a collaboration of Chicago and Cook County -based hospitals that str ives to promote a collective impact on health outcomes in the city of Chicago through an environment that fosters learning, sharing of resources, data and best practices. They are also the driving force to facilitate and execute the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for their hospital members. S wedish has been an active member of the Alliance for Health Equity since June of 2017 when the Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County and the Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborative merged to form the Allia nce for Health Equity. Several S wedish employees participate as active, engaged members of the following committees and workgroups: Steering Committee CHNA Committee Policy Committee Trauma -Informed Hospitals Collaborative Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders Committee Social and Structural Determinants of Health Committee o Subcommittee: Food Security/Food Access Workgroup o Subcommittee: Housing and Health Workgroup Communities We Serve (Service Area) Swedish 's community, as defined for the purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment, includes each of the residential ZIP Codes that comprise the hospital's Primary Service Area (PSA) and Secondary Service as shown in the map in Figure 1. These zip codes encompass fourteen community areas in Chicago \u2014Albany Park, Avondale, Edgewater, Forest Glen, Irving Park, Jefferson Park, Lake View, Lincoln Square, North Cent er, North Park, Portage Park, Rogers Park, Uptown, West Ridge \u2014and the village of Lincolnwood. This community definition was determined because most Swedish 's patients originate from these areas. The total population in Swedish's service area is 686,000. In the service area, 25% of the population identifies as Hispanic /Latinx and 75% Non -Hispanic. Fifty -three percent of the population identifies as white, 10% Asian, 8% 246 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Black/African American, 3% identifies as two or more races, and less than 1% as Native Ame rican (Figure 2). The age distribution for the service area is shown in Figure 3. Figure 1. Map of Swedish Hospital's CHNA service area Figure 2 .

Age distribution, Swedish Hospital's service area, 2016 -2020 US Census, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 There is substantial variation in median income within Swedish's service area (Figure 4). The median income in Rogers Park ($47,315) is nearly $100,000 less than the median income in North Center. In addition, poverty rates are highest in Rogers Park and Uptown. Figure 4. Median household income in Swedish Hospital's service area U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey , 2016-2020 248 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Swedish Hospital serves a remarkably diverse population, and many of the community areas are home to large immigrant and refugee population s. Five of the 14 community areas within Swedish's service area have a limited English - speaking population of 10% or greater (Figure 5). Figure 5.

The CHNA also provided insight into community -based assets and resources that would benefit from support and leverage during the implementation of health improvement strategies. Swedish Hospital partnered with the Alliance for Health Equity (AHE), other hospitals, the Chicago Department of Public Health, Cook County Department of Public Health, and community organizations to complete this collaborative CHNA between March 2021 and March 2 022, during a time that communities across our county, country, and globe have been experiencing profound impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic. The health , economic , and social impacts of the pandemic are strongly present in what we heard from community memb ers and healthcare and public health workers over the course of the assessment. Primary and secondary data from a diverse range of sources were utilized for robust data analysis and to identify community health needs in Chicago and Suburban Cook County. I PHI worked with the CHNA committee and steering committee to design and facilitate a collaborative, community -engaged assessment. As with the 2018 -2019 collaborative CHNA, this 2022 CHNA process is adapted from the Mobilizing for Action through Planning an d Partnerships (MAPP) framework, a community -engaged strategic planning framework that was developed by the National Association for 249 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Both the Chicago and Co ok County Departments of Public Health use the MAPP framework for community health assessment and planning. The MAPP framework promotes a system focus, emphasizing the importance of community engagement, partnership development, and the dynamic interplay o f factors and forces within the public health system. AHE chose this inclusive, community -driven process to leverage and align with health department assessments and to actively engage stakeholders, including community members, in identifying and addressin g strategic priorities to advance health equity. Primary data for the CHNA was collected through three methods: Community input surveys Community resident focus groups Social service provider focus groups Epidemiologists from the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Metopio are invaluable partners in identifying, compiling, and analyzing secondary data for the CHNA. IPHI and the Alliance for Heal th Equity steering committee worked with CDPH and CCDPH to refine a common set of indicators based on an adapted version of the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Model. Secondary data used in the CHNA were compiled from a range of sources. Additional inf ormation can be found in Figures 6 and 7 (p. 11) of the full Alliance for Health Equity Countywide CHNA report . In alignment with the purpose, vision, and values, the Alliance for Heal th Equity prioritizes engagement of community members and community -based organizations as a critical component of assessing and addressing community health needs. Community partners have been involved in the assessment and ongoing implementation process in several ways both in providing community input and in decision making processes ( page 9 of Countywide CHNA Report ). The community - based organizations engaged in the Alliance for Hea lth Equity represent a broad range of sectors such as workforce development, housing and homeless services, food access and food justice, community safety, planning and community development, immigrant rights, youth development, community organizing, faith communities, mental health services, substance use services, policy and advocacy, transportation, older adult services, health care services, higher education, and many more. All community partners work with or represent communities that are disproportion ately affected by health inequities such as communities of color, immigrants, youth, older adults and caregivers, LGBTQ+, individuals experiencing homelessness or housing instability, individuals living with mental illness or substance use disorders, indiv iduals with disabilities, veterans, and unemployed youth and adults. Overview of Data Categories Assessment findings were organized in six areas: overview of health inequities mental health and substance use disorders access to quality health care and community resources COVID -19 social and structural determinants of health chronic conditions - risk factors, prevention, and management The following section highlights primary and secondary data related specifically to Swedish's service area. 250 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Primary Data: Community Input Survey and Focus Groups Community input is the most important data input into the Alliance for Health Equity Community Health Needs Assessment. Particularly in the context of the current COVID -19 pandemic, first -hand information from communities most impacted by inequities is the most up -to-date data we have available about priority community health needs . Swedish Hospital (S wedish ) worked closely with the AHE and community -based organizations that are members of Swedish's Community L eader Program to collect in -depth community input data through a community input survey and focus groups. We collected 1108 surveys and conducted 8 focus groups with residents from Swedish's service area . Community Input Survey The community input survey was a qualitative tool designed to understand community health needs and assets from community members, with a focus on hearing from community members most impacted by health inequities. The community input surveys, along with fo cus group data, informed the priority areas and strategies for community health improvement in Chicago and suburban Cook County. There were 1108 survey respondents from Swedish's service area. Figure 6 is a table of survey respondent demographics. Response s to key questions are included in Figure s 6-9. Figure 6.

In t otal, eight focus groups were held with community members and service providers in S wedish 's service area. Community Resident Focus Groups : AHS Family Health Center Community Health Workers (CHWs) (citywide) Community members that identify as LGBTQ IA+ Immigrant and refugee -serving organizations NAMI Chicago ( individuals with lived experience of mental illness ) NAMI Chicago (family members and caregivers of individuals living with mental illness ) Northwest Side Housing Center (youth) Northwest Side Housi ng Center (parents) There were five major themes identified based on the focus group input collected from across the county: Behavioral health - stigma, substance use, trauma and crisis, social determinants of health and integrated care Child and adolesce nt health - childcare, education, COVID -19 impacts on child and adolescent health, programs, and services Healthcare - insurance and public benefits, local access to services, LGBTQIA+ affirming care, primary care access, and culturally and linguistically appropriate care Social and structural determinants of health - income, employment, education, opportunities for youth, housing and homelessness, and food systems; and Chronic conditions - socioeconomic causes, health behaviors , access and communication, o besity, asthma, hypertension, and diabetes. An overall description of the themes is included in Figure 10. In addition to the five overall themes, there were four cross -cutting topics i dentified that are pervasive and impact health across the spectrum of concerns: Racism and discrimination COVID -19 Safety and violence Community cohesion 255 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 10.

This data was collected and analyzed by Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and compiled and presented by the Illinois Public Health Institute (IPHI). Health Expectancy and Overall Health Status Life Expectancy Life expectancy is t he average number of years an individual is expected to live. As seen in Figure 11, there are disparities in life expectancy within Swedish Hospital's service area. Life expectancy in Rogers Park (73.5) is more than eight years less than life expectancy in Forest Glen (81.9) . For comparison, life expectancy in Chicago is 75.4 and life expectancy in the US overall is 78.8 years. Figure 11.

Worldwide and in the United States chronic diseases are the leading cause of disability and de ath. Chronic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, mental illness, and HIV/AIDS create a significant health and economic cost for individuals and communities. Prevention and management of chronic conditions can sign ificantly reduce the burden of these diseases on individuals and society. Obesity and hypertension are often interconnected risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Within Swedish's service area, more than a quarter of community members are reported to be obese. Similarly, approximately a quarter of adults within the service area are reported to have hypertension. There is significant variation between community areas in obesity and hypertension rates (Figure s 18-19). Figure 18. Map of obesity rates within Swedish Hospital's service area (percentage) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (State and US da ta), Diabetes Atlas (County level data), PLACES, 2019 261 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 19. Map of hypertension rates within Swedish Hospital's service area (percentage) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (State and US data), Diabetes Atlas (County level data), PLACES, 2019 Mortality Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021) data indicate that heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are the leading causes of death in the U.S. and are the leading drivers of the nation's 3.8 trillion in annual he althcare costs. The geographic distribution of chronic disease mortality rates for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are presented in Figures 20-22. (Here we present mortality maps showing all communities in the City of Chicago to show the communities served by Swedish in context with the City overall.) 262 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 20.

Age -adjusted diabetes mortality rate per 100,000 population, Chicago, Illinois Illinois Department of Public Health, Death Certificate Files 2015 -2019 Social and Structural Determinants of Health Social determinants of health such as poverty, limited access to healthy foods, exposure to violence, limited access to healthcare, and housing conditions are both underlying root causes of chronic disease and are barriers to the management of chronic disease. Poverty Healthy People 2020 highlights that communities with high rates of poverty are at increased risk for mental illness, chron ic disease, higher mortality, and lower life expectancy. Within Swedish's service area 22% of non -Hispanic Black and 22% of Native American families live below the federal poverty level compared to 14% of Hispanic/Latino and 9% of white community members . A map of the geographic distribution of poverty within the service area is shown in Figure 23. Rogers Park and West Ridge have the highest percentages of households living in deep poverty (below the 200% federal poverty level) compared to a 28% deep povert y rate for the service area overall (Figure 24). 264 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 23. Map of population living below the 100% federal poverty level, Chicago, Illinois U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 Figure 24. Percentage of population living below the 200% poverty level in Swedish Hospital's service area U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 265 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Education Education is an important determinant of health because poverty, unemployment, and underemployment are highest among those with lower levels of educational attainment . The high school graduation rate within Swedish's service area is 89% which is comparable to the high school graduation rate for Chicago overall (86%). The percentage of the population aged 25 or older with a hi gh school diploma is presented in Figure 25. Figure 25. Map of the percentage of adults aged 25 or older with a high school diploma or equivalent, Chicago, Illinois U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 Unemployment Unemployment and underemployment can create financial instability, which influences access to health care services, insurance, healthy foods, stable quality housing, and other basic needs. The unemployment rate within Swedish's service area is low (5%) compared to the city overall (8%). However, racial, and ethnic disparities are prevalent with non - Hispanic Blacks and Native Americans having higher than average unemployment rates within the service area. In addition to racial and ethnic differences, there are geographic ine quities in unemployment as well (Figure 26). 266 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 26. Map of unemployment rates, Chicago, Illinois U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 Housing Housing can serve as an opportunity for many people in this country, offering a pathway to better health, education, and businesses. However, for some people, housing (or the lack of it) provides a significant path to health inequities that have been sustained for decades due to systemic racism. Seventeen percent o f the population within Swedish's service area is severe housing cost burdened, spending more than 50% of their income on housing costs. Rogers Park and West Ridge have the highest rates of severe housing cost burdened population (Figure 27). 267 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 27. Percentage of population experiencing severe housing cost burden in Swedish Hospital's service area U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 Community safety and violence The root causes of community violence are multifaceted but include issues such as the concentration of poverty, education inequities, poor access to health services, mass incarceration, differential policing strategies, and generational trauma. Research has established that exposure to violence has significant impacts on physical and mental well -being. In addition, exposure to violence in childhood has been linked to trauma, toxic stress, and an increased risk of poor health outcomes across the lifespan. Violence also has a negative impact on the socioeconomic conditions within communities that contribute to the widening of disparities. The p ercent of adults who report that they feel safe in their neighborhood \"all of the time\" or \"most of the time\" within Swedish's service area is 80% which is high compared to the city overall (63%) (Figure 28) . In addition, the homicide mortality rates within the service area are lower than those found in other regions of the city (Figure 29). However, there are significant disparities between community areas (Figure 28). Popul ations in the Rogers Park, West Ridge, and Avondale community areas report feeling significantly less safe in their communities compared to the service area overall. 268 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 28. Percentage of adults that report feeling safe in their neighborhood \"all of the time\" or \"most of the time\" in Swedish Hospital's service area Healthy Chicago Survey, Chicago Department of Public Health, 2020 -2021 269 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 29. Age -adjusted homicide mortality rate per 100,000 population, Chicago, Illinois Illinois Department of Public Health, Death Certificate Files 2015 -2019 Access to Healthcare There are several complex factors that influence access to health care including proximity; affordability; availability, convenience, accommodation, and reliability; quali ty and acceptability; openness and approachability; and cultural responsiveness and appropriateness. Insurance coverage is associated with improved access to health services and better health monitoring. Within Swedish's service area, approximately 10% of the population is uninsured with Albany Park h aving the highest percentage of uninsured population (18%) followed by Avondale (16%) and West Ridge (14%) . Eighteen percent of the population in the service area has Medicaid coverage with West Ridge (32%) and North Park (27%) having the highest rates followed by Rogers Park (25%), Albany Park (24%), Uptown (24%), and Avondale (20%) (Figure s 30-31). 270 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 30.

Percentage of population with Medicaid coverage in Swedish Hospital's service area U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 -2020 271 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Mental health and substance use disorders The World Health Organization states that mental health is an integral and essential component of overall health and wellbeing. Mental health continues to be a top priority for communities in Chicago including those within Swedish's service area. In 2019, 19% of the population in Swedish's service area reported experiencing depression which is comparable to the rates for the city overall. In addition, based on trends from the Healthy Chicago Survey, rates of people experiencing serious psychological distres s have been increasing over time. Within the service area, the hospitalization rates for mood and depressive disorder were highest in Rogers Park and Uptown (Figure 32). Figure 32. Hospitalization rate per 10,000 for mood and depressive disorder , Chicago, Illinois Chicago Department of Public Health, COMPdata, 2017 Chicago Department of Public Health, COMPdata, 2017 Substance use disorders According to the American Psychiatric Association , a substance use disorder is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of a substance despite harmful consequences and day -to-day functioning becomes impaired . Mental Health America estimates that substance abuse affects 25 million Americans dir ectly and an additional 40 million Americans - such as families of drug users or those killed by intoxicated drivers - are impacted indirectly. Within Swedish's service area 25% of adults reported binge drinking in 2019 (Figure 33) and alcohol -related hosp italization rates were highest in Rogers Park and Uptown (Figure 34). 272 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 33. Percentage of adults that reported binge drinking in Swedish Hospital's service area Chicago Department of Public Health, Chicago Health Atlas, 2019 Figure 34. Alcohol -related hospitalization rate per 10,000 popu lation , Chicago, Illinois Chicago Department of Public Health, COMPdata, 2017 273 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Over the past several years, drug overdoses have steadily increased. In 2020 during the COVID -19 pandemic, the rates of drug overdose deaths hit a historic high in the United States. In addition, there are significant inequities in mortality with non-Hispanic Black people being hit the hardest by drug overdose deaths. Within the Swedish service area, Rogers Park and Uptown have the highest count of EMS calls for opioid overdoses (Figure 35). Figure 35. Count of EMS responses for opioid overdoses, Chicago, Illinois Chicago Department of Public Health, Chicago Health Atlas, 2021 274 Swedish Hospital - 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment Priority health needs for FY2 2-24 Based on assessment and analysis of the primary and secondary data compiled for the Swedish Hospital Service Area, Swedish plans to focus on the following needs, with health equity and social determinants of health woven throughout : 1.Access to Health and Social Services 2.Mental and Behavioral Health 3.Chronic Health Conditions and Wellness Figure 36. Swedish Hospital Priority Health Needs Based on relationships with community partners, clinical expertise, strategic priorities and an ongoing commitmen t to community engagement, Swedish believes it is best equipped to make an impact in the above priority needs, including focused attention within communities of greatest need. The corresponding Community Health Implementation Plan will describe programs Sw edish is undertaking over the coming years to address the prioritized health needs within our community.

MISSION VISION VALUESHelp everyone in our communities be their best. Safe, seamless and personal. Every person, every time. Act with Kindness Earn Trust Respect Everyone Build Relationships Pursue Excellence 283Purpose of a Hospital's Implementation Strategy An Implementation Strategy Plan (ISP) outlines how a hospital plans to address com- munity health needs and is intended to satisfy the requirements set forth by state law and the Internal Revenue Code Section 501(r)(3) regarding Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) and Implementation Strategy. The ISP process is meant to align Swedish Hospital's initiatives and programs with goals, objectives and indicators that address significant community health needs described in the CHNA. The CHNA was developed in partnership with the Alliance for Health Equity (AHE), a collaborative of over 30 hospitals, 7 health departments, and 100 community part-ners throughout Chicago and Cook County. It also included direct input from local community members. Swedish Hospital partners with members of AHE and other key community partners within our service area to leverage existing resources and develop strategies which contribute to improving the most pressing health needs of our communities. This implementation plan describes programs Swedish Hospital is undertaking over the coming years to address the prioritized health needs within our community. Community Definition Swedish's community, as defined for the purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment, includes each of the residential ZIP Codes that comprise the hospital's Primary Service Area (PSA) and Secondary encompass fourteen community areas in Chicago\u2014Albany Park, Avondale, Edgewater, Forest Glen, Irving Park, Jefferson Park, Lake View, Lincoln Square, North Center, North Park, Portage Park, Rogers Park, Uptown, West Ridge\u2014and the village of Lincolnwood. This community definition was determined because most Swedish's patients originate from these areas. The total population in Swedish's service area is 686,000. In the service area, 25% of the population identifies as Hispanic/Latinx and 75% Non-Hispanic. Fifty-three percent of the population identifies as white, 10% Asian, 8% Black/African American, 3% identifies as two or more races, and less than 1% as Native American. 2844 How the CHNA Implementation Strategy was Developed The ISP was developed after the comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was completed. Please refer to the complete CHNA for the full report. Strategies and action plans were developed based on a consensus among a steering committee comprised of Swedish Hospital leaders after input from each of the respective disciplines. The organization intends to undertake the following strategies to meet the identified community health needs. It is important to note that our health equity and social determinants of health (SDOH) work is fundamental and integrated throughout our priority needs' strategies on the following pages. This ISP will be reviewed annually during the two-year lifespan of the 2022 CHNA and updated as needed to ensure viability and impact. The impact will be communicated regularly to reporting agencies and our community.

This work is fundamental and integrated throughout our priority needs on the following pages of our ISP . As an organization, we have key commitments around measurement, learning and action which are critical to our ongoing health equity work. By improving our data collection efforts on areas such as Race, Ethnicity and Language (REAL), we are able to get a more complete picture of our patient and community demographics, allowing us to improve the way we meet our community's needs and deliver care, all in a welcoming and affirming environment. Enhancing screening opportunities for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) allows us to better understand challenges and barriers that our community members face, so we can navigate them to critical resources and services they may need. Finally, partnering with community organizations through our Community Investment Fund allows us to further address priority health needs in a powerful, collaborative way. Health equity commitments include: Measurement: We are working to accurately capture race, ethnicity, language and other preferences and to ensure that all of our patients' perspectives are captured in our measurement systems. Lear ning: We are investing in leading practices and new ways to listen to our patients and community members, incorporating feedback to understand and impact social determinants of health. Action: We are investing in and partnering with like-minded community organizations to close the gap on health disparities.Reduce % of all patients who have had a face to face encounter at NorthShore who we document as \"Other, Declined or Unknown\" Educate and engage front line staff on REAL and/or Sexual Orientation andGender Identity (SOGI) data collection improvement ef forts Develop a consistent and reliable process to collect, visualize, and intervene onSocial Determinants of Health (SDOH) data Educate and engage team members on SDOH screening efforts Enhance partnerships and provide funding through NorthShore' s Community Investment Fund (CIF) to help local organizations build capacity and increase impact,with at least 80% of annual CIF awardee partners addressing CHNA priority needs Expand Healthy Chicago Equity Zones, Healthcare Transformation, Food Connectionsand others to deepen community partnerships within under-r esourced communities 286Swedish Steering Committee Members Dr. Shameem Abbasy, VP Quality and Clinical Transformation, Swedish Hospital Maria Balata, Director, Pathways ProgramAmy Beck, Personal Training Manager, Galter LifeCenterCharles Brandon, Director, Healthcare TransformationChristine Bucheit, Manager, Quality Care & TransformationCourtney Carlson, Exercise Physiologist, Carlson, Community Relations Non-invasive CardiologyFrancie Habash, Program Director, Galter LifeCenterDr. Katherine Hanson, Psychology Division Lead, Swedish Medical GroupMarcia Jimenez, Director, Intergovernmental AffairsNadia Jimenez, Director, Community Health & COVID ResponseKate Lawler, Senior Director, Community Health TransformationKim Leslie, Director of Nursing - Emergency DepartmentAji Lukose, Senior Director of Nursing - Psychiatry, Rehab, Med-Surg, Nursing OfficeElizabeth Miniscalco, Director of Nursing - Cancer TreatmentAshlee Roffe, Director, Nutrition ServicesDarcie Trier, Senior Director, Quality, Safety and Patient ExperienceAshley Tsuruda, Director of Development, Foundation and Corporate Relations 287Priority Need: Access to Health & Social Services Strategy Initiatives/Programs Reportable Metrics to Demonstrate Impact Collaborations Expand efforts to identify and respond to social determinants of health (SDOH).Implement and expand SDOH screening and awareness within some inpatient and outpatient settings to navigate patients to resources/services.*# screenings, # of screenings identifying at least one need, # of referrals, # of referrals to Swedish Community Health programsTransformation Program, HCEZ/Community Wellness Center, Food Connections, Pathways, Family Connects Build community-facing page for consumers to search for services and resources.# pageviews Provide funding through NorthShore's Community Investment Fund (CIF) to help local organizations build capacity and increase impact.*$'s invested in local awardee partners addressing CHNA priority needs Expand efforts to support benefits enrollment for under-resourced community members.Initiate process to enroll patients who screen positive for food insecurity in various programs (LINK, SNAP , WIC, food pantries)* # individuals connected to benefits Food Connections, HCEZ/Community Wellness Center, area food pantries Build and expand Benefit Specialists program throughout Swedish Hospital and Community Wellness Center to offer navigation and support for underrepresented and/or under- resourced individuals.*# individuals connected to benefits Increase access to specialty care and diabetes education via Healthcare Transformation Program.Continue to partner with local FQHCs to provide specialty medical care services .*# completed new and follow-up office visits (include breakdown of uninsured), $ care providedTransformation Program, Erie Family Health, Tapestry 360 Health, Howard Brown Health, Hamdard Health Alliance, Asian Human Services Family Health Center Access to 1-1 diabetes education with local FQHCs.* # of patients who receive 1-1 diabetes education, improvement in A1c Strengthen Swedish Hospital's capacity to respond response to survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence via Pathways Program.

Edward Elmhurst Health (EEH) collaborated with DuPage and Will Counties in the development of the counties' most recent CHNAs and implementation strategies and ultimately incorporated these CHNAs into this joint CHNA report. During March and April 2022, EEH hosted a series of internal and community stakeholder forums to review essential county level CHNA information and to establish recommendations for the joint CHNA and Implementation Strategy for EH, EMH, and LOH. Throughout this process, forum participants, whic h included representation from county health departments and medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations, prioritized issues and opportunities based on an assessment of: Overlap between DuPage and Will Counties : The fact that a health need was identified in both the DuPage and Will County CHNAs as an area of opportunity Magnitude : the size of the population affected and the degree of variance from benchmarks and trend s Impact/Seriousness : the degree to which the issue affects or exacerbates other quality of life and health -related issues Feasibility : the ability for EEH to reasonably impact the issue given available resources Consequences of inaction : the risk of not addressing the problem at the earliest opportunity The result of this process was the identification of the following significant health needs for the FY2023 - FY 2025 CHNA: Access to Healthcare Chronic Disease (Obesity , Diabetes, Heart Disease (including hypertension) , and Cancer ) Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Use) Addressing social determinants and connections to community resources The following report provides a summa ry of EEH and characteristics of its community, the CHNA planning process and key findings, and the initiatives EEH has established in its FY202 3-2025 Implementation Strategy. Additional detail, including performance against the FY2020 - FY 20 22 implementation plan, may be found in the appendix (Appendix E). 294EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Introduction This document is the joint CHNA and joint Implementation S trategy for EH, EMH, and LOH , which was adopted for each of EH, EMH, and LOH on May 24, 2022 . Health System Information Edward -Elmhurst Healthcare (EEH) The Edward -Elmhurst Health System (EEH) is comprised of three hospital facilities: Edward Hospital (EH), Elmhurst Memorial Hospital (EMH) and Linden Oaks Hospital (LOH). The primary service area (PSA) of EH, EMH, and LOH together - defined as the area from which these three hospital facilities draw roughly seventy -five percent (75%) of inpatient (IP) admissions - has a population of nearly one million residents and stretches approximately 42 contiguous miles from Yorkville (southwest corner of EH PSA) to Bensenville (northeast corner of EMH PSA). EH, EMH, and LOH also serve a secondary service area (SSA) \u2014 representing a pproximately 15% of IP discharges \u2014of approximately 1 million additional residents. Collectively, EH (in Naperville) and EMH (in Elmhurst) operate 617 licensed acute care beds and LOH (Naperville) operates 108 behavioral health beds. In addition, EEH has m ore than 50 outpatient locations, a large and growing employed and affiliated physician base, two medically based fitness centers, and numerous joint ventures designed to ensure access to cost -effective and high -quality healthcare. A summary of each hospi tal facility is provided below. Edward Hospital EH has 359 acute care beds and a medical staff of over 1,100 physicians across a full scope of medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. EH serves the residents of Chicago's west and southwest suburbs with a PSA inclusive of the following cities: Hospital EMH has 258 acute care beds and a medical staff consisting of over 900 physicians representing nearly every medical specialty and subspecialty. EMH serves the residents of Chicago's west suburbs with a PSA including the cities of Addison, Bellwood, Bensenville, Berkel ey, Elmhurst, Franklin Park, Glen Ellyn, Hillside, Lombard, Melrose Park, Northlake, Stone Park, Villa Park, Westchester, Wood Dale and Oak Brook. Linden Oaks LOH is a 108-bed behavioral health hospital on Edward Hospital's Naperville campus with offices in Naperville, Plainfield , St. Charles, Woodridge, Mokena, Hinsdale, Addison and Orland Park. With more than 50 providers on its medical staff, LOH serves the residents of Chicago's we st and southwest suburbs. LOH has programs for depression , substance abuse, attention deficit disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, eating disorders , medication management and disorders resulting from medical conditions. Linden Oaks Medical Group (LOMG) also has d octors with expertise in mood disorders, anxiety , personality disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. 295EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy As the parent of EH, EMH, and LOH , EEH is a supporting organization of each of EH, EMH, and LOH and is both organized and operated to benefit and perform the functions of these hospitals. In its capacity as their supporting organization, EEH coordinated the CHNA process on behalf of EH, EMH, and LOH that resulted in this report. Accordingly, any reference to the activities of EEH in this report should be understood to be activities conducted on behalf of EH, EMH, and LOH. The mission of EEH is \"Advancing the health of our communitie s\" Toward this end, EEH is committed to meeting the needs of the local community while ensuring the sca le and geographic spread to provide access, efficiency and high quality healthcare. EEH's commitment to the health of its community is fully integrated into its strategic plan, identified within one of the seven priorities (\"Evolving the System\"). The graphic below illustrates the EEH Roadmap, which is used to communicate the System's highest priority initiatives to all stakeholders. EEH community benefit planning, implementation and reporting is supported by the EEH System Community Benefit Steering Committee. The Committee is tasked to assess community need, establish priorities and supporting initiatives, and monitor outcomes to ensure initiatives are consistent with its mission to advance the health of the community served. In addition, as Community Benefit is integrated into the strategic plan and outcomes are periodically reported to the System Board of Directors . 296EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy EEH Demographics Edward -Elmhurst Communities Served EH, EMH, and LOH serve a total service area (TSA) population of nearly two million residents with the majority residing in DuPage and Will counties (69.6%). The map below illustrates the geographic footprint of EH, EMH, and LOH. The specific communities included in EH and EMH's PSA are directly below the service area map. 297EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Edward Hospital Elmhurst Hospital Service Area City - Zip Code Service Area City - Zip Code Edward North Primary Service Area (NPSA) Warrenville - 60555 Elmhurst Primary Service Area (PSA) Elmhurst - 60126 Naperville - 60540 Hillside - 60162 Naperville - 60563 Berkeley - 60163 Naperville - 60565 Villa Park - 60181 Naperville - 60566 Oak Brook - 60523 Naperville - 60567 Bellwood - 60154 Aurora - Aurora - 60503 Northlake - 60164 Aurora - 60504 Stone Park - 60165 Edward South Primary Service Area (SPSA) Naperville - 60564 - table below outlines the System's inpatient population distribution by county.

Specifically, while reviewing DuPage and Will Counties collectively, nearly 5% or 19,019 families were below the poverty line. 025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000175,000200,000 Less than 9th GradeSome DuPage County Will County $131,298 $137,243 $121,308 $99,863 EEH PSA DuPage County Will County State of Illinois2021 Average Household Income 302EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Will and DuPage County Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Process County -specific CHNAs for Will and DuPage counties were developed through \"Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships\" (MAPP) collaborative forums, which allowed for each county, along with community leaders, to identify and prioritize the most pressing health issues within the region. This comprehensive approach considers cross -sector input to ensure creation of outcome -driven county plans that are relevant and responsive to community need . The framework utilizes t he following qualitative and quantitative collection methods: Community Themes and Strengths Assessment : a community survey distributed to residents request ing feedback about the health of the county. The survey is often used by public health systems to evaluate community health by answering questions such as: What is important to our community? How is quality of life perceived in our community? What assets do we have that can be used to improve community health? Local Public Health Assessment : focused on community stakeholder input to assess how well the system works together to provide the 10 Essential Public Health Services1. The Assessment is designed to answer two key questions, \"What are the components, activities, competencies, and capacities of our local service provider system?\" and \"How are the 10 Essen tial Services being provided to our community?\" Community Health Status Assessment : presents quantitative data about each respective county. The information is designed to give a thorough snapshot of the current health status. Forces of Change Assessment : aims to solicit wide -ranging input from community leaders to identify forces such as trends, factors or events that influence the health of the community. The goal is to better understand the current state to influence the outcomes of the future. The DuPage County CHNA was conducted from October 2021 - February 2022 and finalized in March 2022. The process was led by the DuPage County Department of Community Services, a designated Community Action Agency that works to empower people with needs in Du Page County to become self -sufficient and lead enriched, productive lives, and Impact DuPage, a collective impact partnership, primarily comprised of community leaders from health and human service sectors throughout DuPage County. Across four virtual ses sions, EEH partnered throughout the planning phases to develop the DuPage County CHNA, along with the DuPage County Health Department and numerous organizations including representation from public health, healthcare, non -profits, behavioral health, resear ch, education, housing, public safety, and religious/faith -based organizations. Discussion topics focused on review of survey results, discussion of current activities, health equity considerations, strengths, weaknesses, and near and long -term improvement opportunities for each Essential Service. The process and methods used to conduct this CHNA and a description of how input into the CHNA was solicited and considered is contained in the DuPage County CHNA report, provided in Appendix A . The Will County CHNA was conducted from May 2018 - July 2019 and completed in December 2019 . Planning partners supporting development of the plan are listed in Appendix B (Will County CHNA) .

Will and DuPage County Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Findings Key priorities from the Will and DuPage County CHNAs for each county are summarized below: Factors Impacting Health Status Health systems traditionally focus most of their resources on prov iding clinical care, but evidence has shown that underlying social determinants of health (SDOH), individual health behaviors, and the physical environment all play a role in the overall health status of communities. County level CHNA findings associated with these underlying influencers are outlined below . Social Determinants : Primary Drivers - Neighborhood, Built Environment, and Economic Stability Social determinants impacting residents throughout DuPage and Will Counties are summarized bel ow: DuPage Will Food Accessibility Estimated 72,580 persons with food insecurity High fast -food density [.94 per 1,000 restaurants ] Below average for WIC and SNAP certified stores10% of population is affected by food insecurity 15 per every 100,000 people have access to WIC authorized stores 81 neighborhoods are within food deserts [Affecting 437,000 residents ] 31.83% of pop has low food access [Compared to IL (17.69%) and US (19.04%) ] Housing Access and Affordability 425 individuals identified as homeless with an avera ge of 156 homeless nights 16% return to homelessness341 individuals identified as homeless (32% children) 4% of homes a re overcrowded and 30% are substandard conditions Access to Transportation High mean travel time to work (29.8 minutes compared to 26.9 US value) 7.3% of residents utilize public transportation for commute to work, compared to 8.3% for Illinois.3.5% of r esidents utilize public transportation for commute to work, compared to 8.3% for Illinois. 304EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Behavioral Factors and Quality of Life The behavioral factors identified as most significant across DuPage and/or Will County are summarized below: DuPage County Will County Obesity 24.7% of adults (+~2%)d 15% of obese (+~3%)d [Men are more likely to be obese ] Substance Abuse 21.3% of adults drink excessively (+~1%)d Of 12th graders who reported drinking alcohol in the past year, 44% usually obtained alcohol from their parents with their permis sion [Impact DuPage target (2018) 30% ]e24% of adults drink excessively (flat)d 23% of 12th graders have engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks (-7%)d Tobacco Use 14.2% of adults smoke tobacco (+~2%)d 13.4% of adults smoke tobacco Higher than HP 2020 goal of 12%c 1.9% of 12th graders smoke tobacco and 2/3 use e -cigarettesd Marijuana 20% of teens use marijuana (+~2%)d 26% of graders used marijuana in past 30 days (-13%)d Opioids and Drug -Induced Deaths 90% of 12th graders think there is moderate or great risk in using prescription drugs not prescribed to them [93% impact DuPage 2018 target ]e 112 opioid deaths ]eDrug -Induced deaths: 19.1 /100,000 (+~8) e Well over HP 2020 target of 11.3c Social Association s 9.5 membership associations per 10,000 (+.2%)19.2% of adults report having inadequate social and emotional support (no new value) Bullying 38% of 8th graders bullied over past 12 months (no new value) 41% of 8th graders bullied over past 12 months (-9%)e Physical Environment The physical environment directly impacts health and quality of life. Essential to physical health are clea n air and water as well as safely prepared food. Further, exposure to toxic substances increases the risk of preventable diseases. County Health Rankings has several indicators that measure facts about a community's phy sical environment. This includes the built environment and quality of the environment. Measures specified under the Physical Environment category include daily density of fine particulate matter , drinking water violations, severe housing issues, driving al one to work, and having a long commute. During the current CHNA planning process timeframe, Will County was ranked 102 out of 102 (Illinois counties) in this category. Will County has significantly dropped in rank since 2011. Outcome comparison legend: prior value reported 305EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy DuPage County and Will County Identified Areas of Opportunity The MAPP process framework involves examining qualitative and quantitative analysis and performance against industry benchmarks and health outcome trends . From this process , areas of opportunity to improve health status were identified by each county, as summarized below. The areas of overlap between the two may be summarized as : economic stability including built environment, access to healthcare, chronic disease, and mental health/substance abu se. Area of Opportunity DuPage County CHNA 2022 Will County CHNA 2019 Access to Health Care X X Economic Stability (food access/ transportation) X X Neighborhood and Built Environment (physical environment, public transportation to work, household w/ no vehicle) X X Social and Community Context (social associations/social -emotional support) X X Chronic Disease (Cancer/Heart Disease) X X Language/Literary Access X X Mental Health (adults and adolescents) X X Substance Use Disorder Prevention/Treatment (adults and adolescents) X X Obesity X X Workforce Development X Diabetes X* X Education X X Maternal/Child Health X Nutrition/Physical Activity X Oral Health X Tobacco Use X *Racial/ethnic disparity focus 306EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy EEH CHNA and Implementation Strategy Development After collaborating with DuPage and Will Counties in the development of the counties' three -year CHNAs and Implementation Plans (with involvement ranging from participation on executive steering committees to local public health assessments), EEH engaged in the process summarized in the graphic below to develop its FY2023 - FY2025 Plan : This collaborative process involved participation across many internal and community s takeholders (identified in Appendix C) throughout a series of forums . These forums were designed to review EEH service area demographics , Will and DuPage County CHNA findings and areas of focus , finalize the selection of significant health needs for this 20 22 joint CHNA report, prioritize these health needs, and identify resources potentially available to impact and prioritize . Discussions generated from these forums also laid the groundwork for the establishment of community benefit initiatives to support the FY202 3- 2025 Implementation Strategy. The following criteria were used to identify and prioritize the most significant health needs: Overlap between DuPage and Will Counties : The fact that a health need was identified in both the DuPage and Will County CHNAs as an area of opportunity through the MAPP process Magnitude : the size of the population affected and the degree of variance fro m benchmarks and trend Impact/Seriousness : the degree to which the issue affects or exacerbates other quality of life and health -related issues Feasibility : the ability for EEH to reasonably impact the issue given available resources Consequences of inact ion: the risk of not addressing the problem at the earliest opportunity 307EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Further, participants were asked to consider the following questions: What current EEH initiatives are effective and should continue or be enhanced/expanded? What new initiatives should EEH consider to advance the health of the community within the identified priorities? Are there specific population segments that require focused initiatives not already established by EEH? As a health care provider, where can EEH have t he greatest impact when addressing health equity What are key community partnerships we should explore, continue and/or enhance? If EEH were to commit to ONE meaningful new initiative to support the health of our community, what do you suggest? Two additional meetings with external community stakeholders were held: EEH hosted a Health Equity Roundtable event with DuPage and Will County representatives on March 2, 2022 . At this event, cross sector leadership came together to discuss the most pressin g issues, learn from one another, and ultimately discuss ways to strengthen strategies for engagement between EEH/CBOs to effectively serve DuPage and Will County residents. On March 22 , 2022, members of the Edward -Elmhurst Community Advisory Council, which includes representatives of organizations serving and representing the interests of m edically underserved, low -income, and minority populations provid ed input to guide the EEH FY2023 - 2025 Plan . The attendees and populations represented are listed in Appendix C. This group provided their perspective of the most pressing needs of the community , confirmed and refined EEH's preliminary priorities, and provided valuable input around opportunities and initiatives to address these priorities. A final mee ting was held on April 13, 2022, where key EEH internal stakeholders joined together to confirm the prioritized strategic areas of focus and further brainstorm relevant initiatives to develop the implementation strategy. EEH maintains its commitment to responsiveness to the community; to that end, EEH solicits written comments from the community on the most recent CHNA reports and Implementation Strategy of EH, EMH, and LOH. This solicitation can be found on the EEH Community Benefit webpage where the EEH CHNA reports and Implementation Strate gy are made widely available, the following solicitation is posted: \"Please provide any comments you may have on our most recent Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) or Implementation Strategy. Should you have questions, comments or require additional information, email Edward -Elmhurst Health\". No written comments have been received to date. The FY2023 - 2025 implementation strategy , which is the culmination of collective input and agreement on th e significant health needs for EH, EMH, and LOH's 2022 joint CHNA, can be found on page s 18-20. These strategies were identified based upon areas of overlap between the Will and DuPage County CHNAs and consensus on where EEH can play a unique and significa nt role and therefore drive greatest impact . Based on the above detailed process and input, the following health needs were identified as the significant health needs of the EH, EMH, and LOH community for this 20 22 CHNA report: 308EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Access to Healthcare People who lack a regular source of health care may not receive the proper medical services when they need them, which can lead to untreated and missed diagnosis along with adverse health outcomes. In DuPage and Will Counties, approximately 15 -17% (+250,000 residents) of adults do not have a usual provider or source of health care. Chronic Dise ase ( Obesity /Diabetes /Heart disease (including hypertension) ) For both children and adults, obesity is a significant problem within DuPage and Will counties. It can be indicative of underlying SDOH and an unhealthy lifestyle, which increases the risk of chronic disease. Across both counties, nearly 450,000 individuals above the age of 20 years were categorized as obese (BMI > 30). In addition, as previously reported, 14.8% (137,496) of children/adolescents in DuPage County and 13% (90,046) of 6th graders in Will County are obese. Diabetes has been identified as top concerns based upon high rates of uncontrolled diabetes, lack of education and awareness, and cultural barriers to receive appropriate care. Further, racial and ethnic disparities have been identified within the EEH community, thus resulting in higher emergency department utilization and potentially avoidable inpati ent hospital stays. Within DuPage and Will Counties, heart disease continues to remain as one of the most pressing healthcare issues . The most recently published age -adjusted death rate due to coronary heart disease was 68.3/100,000 in DuPage County. Will County's coronary heart disease mortality rate (95.6 per 100,000 population) is higher than the Illinois' mortality rate (94.44 per 100,000 population). Further, uncontrolled bloo d pressure has surfaced as a prioritized concern with varying degrees of imp lication across difference races and ethnicities. In both DuPage and Will Counties, cancer continues as a top 2 cause of death. Further, breast cancer incidence is higher in DuPage County (143.5/100k) than the US (126.8/100k) . In particular the age adjus ted death rate due to breast cancer is approximately 38/100k for Black/African American which is nearly double that realized for White. Finally, in Will County the incidence rate of prostate cancer is higher among the Black population (222/100k), which is nearly double the rate of the White population. Mental Health/Substance Abuse Recent estimates indicate that one in four adults and one in five youth have had a mental health issue in the past year. Mental health disorders are strongly associated with the risk, occurrence, management, progression, and outcome of serious chronic diseases and health conditions. During the Will and DuPage County Community Health Needs Assessment survey period, nearly 200,000 community members reported frequent mental distress. Further alarming is the increasing prevalence of adolescent depression and suicide. In Will County, when asked, \"During the past 12 months did you ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities?\" 35% of 12th graders responded yes in 2018, which is an increase from 30% reported in 2016. When asked, \"During the past 12 months did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide? \" 13% of 12th graders and 15% of 10th graders responded yes, which has decreased from 2014. 309EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Addressing Social Determinants and Connections to Community Resources Health systems traditionally focus most of their resources on providing clinical care, but evidence has shown that underlying social determinants of health (SDOH), individual health behaviors, and the physical environment all play a role in the overall health status of communities. Studies indicate that social determinants and other non -medical factors can account for up to 80% of health outcomes. The primary drivers within DuPage and Will County are detailed on page 11. During the most recent planning cycle, and guided by the Health Equity Task Force, EEH teams gathered to explore, identify an d prioritize efforts around addressing health disparities within the community. To that end, and in consideration moving forward, efforts to develop and enhance programs and partnerships will in corporate recommendations guided by h ealth equity findings. FY20 23-FY202 5 Joint Implementation Strategy for EH, EMH, and LOH As an integral part of the communities it serves, EEH already provides substantial resources to advance its mission (see Appendix E [FY20 20-FY20 22 EEH Implementation Strategy: Outcomes Update] ). EEH will continue to support local, regional and national eff orts addressing the priorities identified in its FY 202 3- 2025 CHNA through coalition building, advocacy, community education and financial support . Active partnership with DuPage and Will County, local municipalities, and other organizations, including but not limited to area school systems, social service agencies, advocacy groups and research organizations will be essential in addressing these priorities. In addition to these ongoing efforts , the EEH Board of Trustees approved the establishment of a $10 0 Million Community Investment Program in August 2021. The Program will provide annual grant funding to community organizations aligned with the following goals: Advancing Health (health equity and social determinants of health) Local economic growth (supply chain diversity and job creating prioritizing DEI principles). The Program will be guided by input from the EEH Regional Board and the EEH Community Advisory Council, which will support ongoing engagement around community need. Synergis tic with broader and ongoing initiatives around community education and advocacy, EEH will be focused over the next three years on the following initiatives (set forth in the chart directly below) to address the significant health needs identified in this 2022 CHNA report. Unless otherwise noted in the chart below, the entity in the Edward -Elmhurst Health system that will be devoting resources to these initiatives will be EEH. As the parent of the system, EEH is in the best position to tackle and lead these initiative s on a coordinated basis. EEH will be carrying on these activities on behalf of its supported organizations, EH, EMH, and LOH. When EH, EMH, or LOH are expected to devote their own resources to an initiative, this fact will be specifically not ed in the chart. As an example, as a behavioral health hospital, LOH is especially well -positioned to address the Behavioral Health significant health need and is thus specifically identified as provided resources to this need throughout the initiatives l isted under 'Behavioral Health' . 310EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy PRIORITY #1: ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE TACTIC MEASUREMENT EEH RESOURCES ANTICIPATED IMPACT STRATEGY 1: Increase access to healthcare Expand public education about the availability of cost effective ambulatory access points Proportionate growth in IC/WIC/Retail versus Levels 1 -3 outpatient ED EEH System marketing/digital communications Reduce avoidable ED utilization Increase right site of care delivery Optimize virtual triage program to enhance connection and include live chat access and Number of virtual triage users EEH System digital marketing and IT resources; outside virtual triage vendor Expand EEMG integrated primary care provider and urgent care network, including identification of specialty care gaps Increased number of EEMG PCP visits /new visits Number of Medicaid/Medicare visits Urgent care visit volume EEH System recruitment team to support physician recruitment and practice support needs , planning support Redu ce avoidable ED utilization; increase access and linkages with primary care and reduce percentage of population without 'usual source of care' Develop expanded virtual care options and 24/7 virtual access to key services Visit volume by time of day Visit volume EEMG ops leadership, digital team support Improve access to needed to key services ; STRATEGY 2: Develop robust community partnerships to identify access deficits and connect patients to services Explore partnerships with Community partners to expand outreach, reduce transportation barriers, reach vulnerable and underserved populations Number of physician visits (0-17, 18+ yrs) Number of low acuity OP ED visits (0 -17 yrs, 18+) EEH community/wellness resource and community outreach re source, planning support Reduce avoidable ED utilization; increase access and linkages with primary care and reduce percentage of population without 'usual source of care' Improve access to needed specialty care; reduce incidence and improve management of chronic diseases Connect with Hispanic organizations to understand deficits in healthcare literacy / navigation and support program development assessments Number of Hispanic physician visits EEH community/wellness resource and community outreach resource STRATEGY 3: Reduce financial and transportation barriers to care Promote and offer financial assistance to eligible patients Number of individuals receiving financial assistance Financial assistance policy; EEH financial counselors Ensure that community un - and under -insured patients have access to high quality health care Identify and assist uninsured patients in ED in obtaining coverage through counseling and related assistance Growth in uninsured patients connected to Medicaid/other insurance EEH financial counselors Partner with DuPage Health Coalition, Will County MAPP collaborative, Impact DuPage to ensure access for low income residents Financial /volunteer support provided to DuPage Health Coalition, Will County MAPP Collaborative.

Note that, while not directly driving initiatives around these priorities, EEH will support many of them by participating in task forces, community collaborative forums, coalition building activities , and distributions through the EEH Community Investment Program. DuPage and Will County Priority Health Issue That Will Not be Addressed and Supporting Rationale: Health Priorities Identified Rationale Education This was identified as a priority area within both Counties as higher education has been linked to positive health outcomes. Specifically, disparities are noted among certain races/ethnicities . As EEH's core competency is health care delivery and not education, support will be provided through community p artnerships and collaboration around job training and other initiatives as appropriate. Funding for educational programs related to workforce development focused on disadvantaged populations is within the scope of the EEH Community Investment Fund and may be supported through that vehicle. Transportation Within the Counties there is consensus around lack of a true transportation system , limited public transit routes and long commutes to work . Support from EEH will be provided through collaborative partnerships and involvement with community coalitions. Further, as EEH aims to address transportation barriers for patients, the System already provides transportation vouchers to low -income individuals on an as -needed basis, as well as a discounted ride services in the Elmhurst region. Food Access Food access, both insecurity and uncertainty, was identified in the most recent CHNAs of both Will and DuPage Counties. As EEH's core competency is healthcare delivery, support will continue to b e provided through community partnerships and collaboration. Workforce Development This was identified within Will County and the County Investment Board has targeted seven key industry sectors: Healthcare and Social Assistance, Wholesale Trade, Professi onal and Technical Services, Finance and Insurance, Information Technology, Manufacturing, and Transportation and Warehouse. As one of the largest employers in the region, EEH is a major provider of jobs and attracts a diverse workforce. Continued growth of the organization and active involvement in regional economic development coalitions will ensure an ongoing positive contribution. Funding for educational programs related to workforce development focused on disadvantaged populations is within the scope of the EEH Community Investment Fund and may be supported through that vehicle. Oral Health This was identified within Will County, which they aim to address through expansion of telehealth/mobile response (mobile dental van). As EEH does not provide dental care services, this is out of scope and will be addressed at the county level. Maternal/Child Health This was identified within Will Co unty during the CHNA assessment process. While not directly prioritized in the FY202 3-2025 EEH implementation strategy, the Hospital is a major contributor to Ma ternal and Child Health through its obstetrics and pediatric service lines, which provide a ful l range of preventive and treatment services for women and children in the region. 314EEH Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Appendix A and B: Will and DuPage County Community Health Needs Assessments ; these may be found on their respective websites or will be made available upon request.

Governance and oversight is provided by the EEH Community Benefit Steering Committee (Appendix D), a system -wide committee with representation from nursing and othe r clinical areas, case management and social work, population health management, legal, finance, planning, marketing, and community/government relations. Highlights of accomplishments are summarized below . Access to Healthcare Provider Recruitment : The System's Physician Services Department recruited over 100 providers (physicians and advanced practice providers) which allowed for growth in the local employed/affiliated provider network from 631 to 6 65 (+5%), thus increasing access thro ughout the community. Further, the primary care provider network conducted more than 400,000 Medicaid and Medicare visits which represented nearly one third of total primary care visit volume. EEH continues to recruit into specialties where access and serv ice gaps have been prioritized within the community including psychiatry, primary care, endocrinology, and rheumatology.

Edward -Elmhurst Health was one of 25 p roviders to pilot the Racial Equity in Healthcare Progress Report (Progress Report) for the Illinois Hospital Association and the Chicago's Racial Equity Rapid Response Team. The Progress Report serves as a long -term accountability tool to document progr ess toward achieving racial health equity. A Health Equity subcommittee was formalized to address racial and ethnic health disparities across the EEH community. Based on internal utilization data and CHNA findings, 2021 initiatives prioritized disparitie s in access to diabetic screening and treatment in specific geographies. In addition, the health equity subcommittee collaborated with local NAACP chapters and other community organizations to explore strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, food insecurit y, and diabetes screening and management. A final area of focus was the development of a health equity dashboard to monitor current state and guide future program development prioritization.
