While both plans give you unlimited access to menshealth.com/uk, exclusive Men's Health SQUAD stories, The Locker Room newsletter and downloadable training plans, only Full Access also includes a Men's Health print magazine subscription, membership to the private Instagram group with direct access to the Men's Health Elite. I'm already a Men's Health print magazine subscriber, what do I have to do to access the Men's Health SQUAD? Thanks for being a magazine subscriber! Men's Health SQUAD is an optional upgrade to your magazine subscription. In addition to your magazine, you will unlock training plans, access to the Men's Health Elite, membership to the closed Instagram page and more.
