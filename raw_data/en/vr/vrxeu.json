Wavy, straight, colored, curly, thick or fine - we all have our own unique hair. Whether we love our hair or wish we could trade it in for a completely different set of locks, we all use shampoo to manage our hair and keep it looking its best. But we don't all use the same shampoo. Shampoo is personal. As I'm sure you know, it can take some experimentation to find the shampoo that works best for your own hair. Because of that, I would never try to convince you to use one particular shampoo. Just as you wouldn't wear the same clothes as me, I wouldn't expect you to use the same shampoo. But I would like to convince you of this: Stop using that conventional shampoo brand you've been using for years and make the switch to a safe, natural, non-toxic shampoo instead. RELATED: 4 Good [Reasons to Buy Natural, Non-Toxic Products](https://mindfulmomma.com/buy-natural-non-toxic-products/) for Your Home & Life Why You Should Switch to Non-Toxic Shampoo I know, I know! Switching shampoo is hard! But here's the thing. Shampoo is a product you use frequently - whether it's once a day or once a week - it still adds up to a lot of shampoo over the course of time. Traditional shampoos are a chemical soup that foam like crazy and smell strongly of something that didn't come from nature. The chemicals that make all that happen can be harmful to you and to the environment - and in the grand scheme of things, it just isn't worth it. Here are some of the toxic ingredients you'll want to avoid in shampoo - so check the ingredient list before you buy: - Sulfates - Sodium lauryl and laureth sulfates are foaming agents and can be contaminated with 1,4 dioxane, a probable carcinogen. - Certain preservatives - This includes parabens which are linked to breast cancer and hormone disruption, as well as DMDM hydantoin, which releases formaldehyde and is linked to hair loss and scalp burns, according to a [class action law suit](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/beauty-products/class-action-lawsuit-claims-maker-of-tresemme-liable-for-hair-loss-scalp-burns/). (FYI - some type of preservatives are necessary in shampoo but safer ones exist.) - Artificial fragrances - The term fragrance is a catchall for thousands of chemicals including hormone disrupting phthalates, as well as skin irritants and allergens. - Petroleum products - Ingredients that come from non-renewable resources are not environmentally friendly. - Benzene - This cancer-causing ingredient has been found in aerosol dry shampoos, so if you use one you'll want to check this [dry shampoo recall list.](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts) Here's my full list of [ingredients to avoid in shampoo](https://mindfulmomma.com/bad-ingredients-in-shampoo/) if you are interested. The good news is that many companies have mastered the art of non-toxic shampoo made with safe, natural and organic ingredients. Clean shampoo brands are made with plant-based ingredients and herbal and botanical extracts, and scented with essential oils or pure, plant extracts, while avoiding the harsh chemicals and artificial fragrance found in conventional shampoos. Keep in mind that organic certification for shampoos is rare, but many are made with some certified organic ingredients. ( [read up on personal care certifications here](https://mindfulmomma.com/certifications-safer-beauty-products/)) There are so many great clean shampoo brands and because we all have different needs, I've split up my recommendations into the following sections: - My picks for best natural shampoos by hair type and personal needs - Best shampoo bars - Best dry shampoo brands - Best non-toxic baby shampoos - Non-toxic drugstore shampoos - Reader recommendations Rest assured, all the shampoos listed here are phthalate free, free of synthetic fragrances, and made without the harmful chemicals found in most conventional shampoo brands.

I've got you covered! Best Dry Shampoo I'm not a dry shampoo user myself because my hair is on the dry side and has enough frizz and volume to keep it fluffy after many days. But since many of you have oily hair or rely on dry shampoo to get you through the week, I'm including some of the top-rated, natural dry shampoos that I've heard about. Due to the [recall of dry shampoos that contain benzene](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/unilever-recalls-dry-shampoos-potential-benzene-rcna53709), I recommend sticking with benzene free dry shampoo powder instead of aerosol dry shampoo sprays.
