CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications ProQuad is indicate d f or simu ltaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rub ella and varicella in individuals f rom 12 months of age. ProQuad can be administered to individuals f rom 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g., to conform with national vaccination sche dules, out break situations, or travel to a region with hig h prevalence of measle s; see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 34.2 Posology and method of administration Posolo gy ProQu ad should be used in accordance to official recommendations. Individuals 12 mont hs of age and older Individuals f rom 12 months of age shou ld receive two doses o f ProQuad or a single dose of ProQu ad followed by a second dose of a monovalent varice lla vacci ne to ensure optimal protection against varicella (see section 5.1). At least one month mus t elap se between the first and second dose of an y live viral attenuate d vaccine. It is preferred th at the s econd dose be administered within three months fo llowing t he f irst dose. Individuals between 9 and 12 months of age Immunogenicity and saf ety data s how th at ProQuad can be administered to individu als between 9 and 12 m onths of age, under special c ircums ta nces (e.g., in accordance with of f icial recommend ations or when early protection is considered necessary). In such cases, individuals shoul d receive a seco nd dose of ProQuad, given a minimum of 3 m onths apart, to ensure optimal protection against m easles a nd varicella (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Indivi duals les s than 9 months of age ProQuad is not indicated in this subset of the paediatric population . The safety and efficacy of ProQuad in children under 9 months of age have not been established. ProQu ad may be used as the second dose in individuals wh o have pr eviously received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine. Method of adm inistration The vaccine is to be injec ted intram uscularly or inj ec tion sites are the anterolateral area of the thig h in youn ger children and the deltoid area in older children, adolescents, and adults. The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patient s with thrombocytopeni a or any coagulation disorder . Prec autions to be taken before handling or administer ing the medicinal product: see section 6.6. For instructions on reconstitution of the me dicinal pr oduct b efore administration, see section 6.6. Th e vaccine should under no circumstances be injected intra vascularly. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensiti vity to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine or to any of th e excipie nts listed in section 6.1 , including neomy cin (see s ections 2 and 4.4). Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type , or other malignant affecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic system. Curr ent immunosuppressive therapy (includin g high doses of corticosteroids) (see sec tion 4. 8). Pro Quad is not contraindicated in individuals who are re ceiving topical or lo w-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement the rapy). 4 Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acqui red) e.g., nodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptoma tic HIV infection or an age -specif ic CD4+ T - lymphocyte percentage in children below 4.8 severely immunocompromised indiv iduals inadvertently body encephalitis, pneumon itis, and f atal outcome as a direct con sequence of diss eminated measles vaccine virus i nf ect io n have been reported. Family history of congenital o r hereditary immunode ficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demo nstrate d. Active untreated tuberculosis. Chil dren und er treat ment f or tuberculosis hav e not e xperi enced exacerbation of the disease when immunized with l ive measles virus vac cine. No studies have been reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccin es on c hildren with untreated tuberculosis . Vaccinati on shoul d be postponed during any illn ess w ith f ever >38.5 C. Pregnancy. Furthermore, p regnancy s hould be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see section 4.6). 4.4 Special warnings and precau tions f or use Traceability In order to impro ve the t raceabil ity of b iological medicin al prod ucts, t he name and the batch number of the administered prod uct should be clearly recorded. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readi ly availabl e in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction f o llowing the admi nistration of the va ccine. Add itionally, live measles vaccine and l ive mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture. Persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, o r other imm ediate reactions (e. g. hives, swelling of th e mouth and thro at, dif f iculty breat hing, hyp ot ension, or shock) subsequent to egg i ngestion may be at an enhanced ri sk of immediate - type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential risk-to-benef it ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vacci nation i n such cases. Due caution s hould be em ployed in the administration of ProQu ad to persons with individual or family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert t o the temperature el evation that may occur f ollowing vaccina tion (see section 4. 8). Indivi duals less than 12 months of age who are vaccinated with a measles -con taining vaccine during measles outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccin e due to the presenc e of circulating antibod ies of m aternal origin and/or immatu rity of t he immune system (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates f or 6 w eek s after vaccination with ProQuad as R eye syndrome has been reported fo llowing the use of salicylates dur ing wild -type varicella inf ection. Vaccination wi th ProQuad may not result in pr otection in all vaccine recipients. Transmission Excretion of small a mounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat ha s occurred in the majority of susc eptible individu als 7 to 28 days after vaccination . There is no confirmed evidenc e to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated i ndividuals. Consequently, transmi ssion through close personal conta ct, whil e accepted as a theoretical possibility, i s not regar ded as a signif icant risk; however, transmission of the rubella 5 vaccine virus to inf ants vi a breast milk has been documented wit hout any evidence of clinical dis ease (see section 4.6). There are no repo rts of t ransmission of the more attenuated Enders' Ed monston strain of me asles virus or the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus from va ccine re cip ients to susceptible contacts. Post-marketing experience suggests that transmission of varicella vacci ne virus (Oka/Me rck strain) resulting in varicella inf ection including disseminated disease may rarel y occur between vaccine recipients (who develop or do not develop a varic ella- like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella including healthy as well as high-risk individuals (see section 4.8). High - risk individuals sus ceptibl e to varicella i nclude: immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3), pregnant wom en without documented positive history of varicella (chickenpox) or labor atory evidence of prior in f ection, newborn infants of mothers without documented pos itive h istory of varice lla or laboratory evidence of prior inf ection. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with high -risk ind ividuals susceptib le to va ricella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. In circumst ances w here contact wit h high - risk individuals susce ptible to varicella is unavoidable, the poten tial risk of transmission of the varicella vaccine virus should be weighe d against the risk of acqu iring and transmitting wild - type varicella virus. Thrombocy topenia This vaccine sh ould be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any c oagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. In clinical trials, no cases were reported rega rding t he development o r worsening of thrombocytopen ia in individuals vaccinated with ProQuad. Ca ses of thrombocytopenia have been reported in post - marketing experience a fter primary vacci nation w ith ProQ uad. In addition, cases of thrombocytopenia have bee n repor ted af ter primar or and r ubella and experience with liv e measles, mumps, and rubella vacc ine indicates that individuals with current thromboc ytopeni a m ay develop mo re severe thrombocytopenia fo llowing vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia following the first dose of a live meas les, mumps, and ru bella va ccine ma y develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses. Serolo gic sta tus may be evalu ated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed. The risk -to- benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination with ProQuad in such cases (see section 4.8) . Febrile seizures In the 5 - to 12 -day timeframe af ter the administration of the first dose of quadrivalent measles, mumps, r ubella and varicella vaccines in children, an increased risk of f ebrile s eizure was observe d compar ed to co ncomitant administration of measles, mumps, rubella and var icella vaccines (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Other Vaccination may be considered in patien ts with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits outweigh the risk s (asymptomatic HI V e, and complement deficiency diseases). Immunocompromised patients who ha ve no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may not res pond as well as im munocomp etent pa tients; therefore, some of these patients may acquir e 6measl es, mumps, rubel la, or varicella in case of c ontact, despite appropriate vaccine administr ation. These patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, rubell a, and v aricella. Post- exposure prophylaxis No clinical data are av ailable fo r ProQuad adm inistered af ter easles, or However , post - f or varicella and measles has been demonstrat ed with Varicella Vaccine live (Ok a/Merck) and the measles - containing vaccines manufac tured b y Merck & Co., I nc., respectively. Sodium Th is medicinal product contains les s than 1 mmo l (23 mg) sodium per dose and is c onsidere d to be essentially sodium -f ree. Potassium This medicin al product contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) potassium per dose and is considered to be essentially potassium -f ree. Sorbitol The additive eff ect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or f ru ctose) s hould be taken into account. Interference with labora tory tests: see se ction 4.5. 4.5 Inter action with other medicinal products and other forms of interact ion At least 1 month should elapse between receipt of a live virus vacc ine and ProQuad . Vaccine r ecipients should avoid use of salicy lates f or 6 weeks a fter vaccination with ProQuad (see section 4.4). Do not give immunoglobulin (IG ) or Varicella -Zoste r Imm une Globulin of immune gl obulins conc omitantl y with ProQuad may interfere with the expected immun e response. Vaccination shou ld be deferred for at least 3 months f ollowing bloo d or plasma transf usion s, or administration of immune globulins (IG). However, t he app ropriate suggested interval between tra nsf usion or IG administration and vaccination will v ar y with the type of transfu sion or indication for, and dose of, IG (e.g. 5 mon ths for VZIG). Adminis tration of varicella in cluding VZ IG or other immune g lobulin preparations, within 1 month following a dos e of ProQuad may reduce the immune response to the vaccine and hence reduce its protective efficacy. T herefore, administration of any of these products should be avo ided with in 1 month after a dos e of Pro Quad unless considered to be essential. It has been r eported that live attenuat ed measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity . Ther ef ore, if a tubercu lin test is to be do ne, it should be administered either any time before , simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks after immunization with ProQuad . Concomitant use with other vaccines: Clinical studies have demonstrated that ProQua d can be given simu ltaneously ( but at separate injection sites) with Prevenar and/or hepati ti s A vaccine, or with monov alent or combination vaccines comprised of diphther ia, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyel itis, or hepatitis B antigen. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immun e 7 responses were unaf f ected. The safety profiles of the administered vaccines were comparable (see section 4.8). There are insuff icient data to support the us e of P roQuad wi th any oth er vaccines. 4.6 Fe rtility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Pregnant w omen should not be vaccina ted with ProQuad. Studies have not been conducted with ProQuad in pregnan t women. It is not known whether ProQuad can cause f oetal harm when admi nistered t o a pregnant woman o r aff ect reproduction capacity. Pregnancy should be a voided for 1 month followi ng vaccination. Women who intend to become pregnant should be advised to d elay. Breast -f eeding Studies have shown that breast -f women vacc inated with live att enuated rubella vaccine may secrete the virus in bre as t milk and transmit it to breast - f ed inf ants. In the inf ants with serological evidence of rubella in fection, none had symptomatic disease. There is no eviden ce tha t varicel la vaccine virus is ex creted i n breast milk. It is not known whether measles or mu mps vaccine virus is secrete d in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exerc ised when considering w hether to administer ProQuad to a breast - feeding woman. Fertil ity Anima l reproduc tion studies have no t been conducted with ProQuad. ProQuad has not been evaluated f or potential to i mpair fertility. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive a nd use machines No stu dies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machin ery ha ve been p erf ormed. ProQuad is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to d rive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects a. Summary of the safety p rof ile In 5 clinical trials, ProQuad was administered without concomitant vacci nes to 6038 children 12 through 23 months of age. The children in these studies received either t he current refrigerator -stable formulation or an earlier formulation of ProQuad . Children in these st udies were monitored for six weeks post vaccination. The s af ety prof iles were compa rable f or th e two di f f erent f ormulations af ter a single dose. The only v accine- related systemic adve rse reactions reported at a signif icantly greater r ate in individuals who received the earlier formulation of ProQuad compared to i ndivid uals who received t he measles, mumps, a nd rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) were fever (39.4\u00b0C rectal equivalent o r abnormal) and measle s-like rash. Both fever and measles - like rash usually occu rred within 5 to 12 days f oll owing th e vaccination, were of short duration and resolved with no l ong- term sequelae. Pain/tend erness/soreness at the injection site was reported at a statistically lower rate in individuals who received ProQuad. The only vac cine related injection site a dverse r eaction that was more frequent among recipients of ProQuad t ha n among recipients of Vari cella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mum ps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Inc. was rash at the injecti on site. Foll owing ProQuad g iven alo ne in 7 clinical trials, the observed rates of fever (39.4\u00b0 C rectal equivalent) ranged from 10.1% to 39.4%. In comparison, following ProQuad given concomitantly8 with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine in 3 clinical tr ials, the obse rved rates of r eported f ever ( 39.4\u00b0C rectal equivalent) range d from 15.2% to 27.2%. In a clinical trial of ProQuad administered concomitantly with Infanrix Hexa, the rates of f ever ( 38.0\u00b0C rectal equivalent) were 69.3% following concomita nt administrat ion, 61.1% f oll al one, and 57.3% following Infanrix Hexa alone; the rates of fever (39.4\u00b0C rectal equivalent) were 22.6% following concomitant administration, 20.5% following ProQuad alone, and 15.9% following Infanrix Hexa alon e. The overal l saf ety prof il e of Pro Quad was comparable whether it was administered concomitantly or alone. Children who received a second dose of ProQuad In eight clinical studies, the overall rates of adverse reactions after a second dose of ProQuad we re generally s imilar to, or l ower tha n, those seen with the first dose. In three of these studies, the rates of injection site erythema and swelling were statistically signif icantly higher after the second dose than after the first dose; however, in the re maining five s tudies, the rat es of ea ch of th ese reactions were similar after the first and second dose. The fever rate in all eight studies was lower after the second dose than af ter the first dose. Children who received ProQuad intramuscularly The gener al saf ety prof iles of the IM and SC a dministr ation routes were comparable; however, f ewer subjects experienced injection site adverse reactions in the IM group after each dose (see section 5.1 f or study description). Children who received ProQuad at 4 thr ough 6 years o f age af ter pri mary imm unization with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. The rates and types of adverse reactions seen in the study group that received ProQuad were generally similar to those s een in t he group s that received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (see section 5.1 f or study description). No specif ic studies have been conducted in individuals f rom 2 years o f age wh o had not previously received measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines. The most common adverse events reported with the use of ProQuad were: injection site reactions including pain/tenderness/soreness, redness, swelling or b ruising; f ever (39.4\u00b0C rectal equivalent ); irritability; rash (including measles - like rash, varicella - like rash, and injection site rash); upper respiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea. b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The f oll owing adverse reactions were r eporte d as vacc ine related by the investigator in individuals after a single dose of ProQuad. Several adverse events were solicited in the clinical studies and are designated with the symbol ( ). Additionally, other adverse events h ave been reported with p ost- marketing u se of ProQuad and/or in clinical studies and post - marketing use of either the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., the monovalent component vaccines of the measles, mumps, and r ubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., I nc., or Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). The frequency of these adverse events is qualified as \"not known \" when it cannot be estimated based on the available data .

Description of selected adve rse reactio ns Aseptic meningitis Cases of aseptic mumps, and rubella vac cination. Altho ugh a causal relationship between oth er strai ns of mumps vaccine an d aseptic meningitis has been shown, there is no evi dence to link Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis. Complications associated with varicella Complications of v aricella f rom v accine strain including herpes zoster immunocompetent in dividu als. Febrile seizures Febrile seizures have been reported in child ren re ceiving P roQuad. Consistent with clinical stud y data on the timin g of f ever and measles -like rash, a post - marketing observation al study i n children 12 to 60 months of age revealed an approxi mate two - f old increase (0.70 per 1000 vs. 0.32 per 1000 chil dren) in the ri sk of f ebrile seizures in the 5 - to 12-day ti mef rame af ter a f irst d (N=31,2 98) compared with adminis mumps, and rubella vaccine man uf actured by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine li ve (Ok a/Merck) (N=31,298).These data suggest one add itional case of f ebrile seizur e per 2600 children vac cinated with ProQuad compare d with se parate administration of the measles, mumps, and rubel l a vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varice lla Va ccine liv e (Oka/Merck). These data were confir med by a post-marke ting observ a tional study sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Dis ease Cont rol and Prevention. In the 30 -day timeframe following v accination, no increased risk of f ebrile seizures was obser ved (s ee sectio n 5.1). 11 Encephalitis and encephalop athy In severely im munocomprom i inadve with measles inclusion body encephalitis, pn e umonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of diss eminat ed measle s vaccine virus infection have been r eported (see sectio n 4.3); dis seminated mumps and rub vaccine virus inf ection has also been reported. SSPE There is no evidence that measl e s vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE i n children who did not have a history of infection w ith wild -type measl es but did r eceive measles vaccine . Some of these cases may ha ve result ed from unrecognized measles in the first year of lif e or possibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retros pective c ase- controlled study conducted by the US Cent ers for Dis ease Contro l and Prevention show t hat the overall effect of me asles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing me a sles with its inherent risk of SSPE. Arthralgia and/or ar thritis Arthral gia and/or arthritis (usually transie nt and r arely chron ic), and po l yneuritis are features of inf ection with wild -type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and gender , being greatest in adult f emales and least in prepubertal c hildren. Follow ing vaccination in children, reaction s in joi nts are gen erally unco m mon (0 to 3%) and of b rief duration. In women, inc idence rates f or arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher t han those seen in children (12 to 20%), and the reactions t end to be more marked and of longer duration. Sympto ms may p ersist f or a matter of months or on rare occa sions for years. In adolesce nt girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence b etween those seen in children and adult women. Even in olde r wome n (35 to 45 years), these reactions are genera lly well tolerated and rarely i nterfere with normal a ctivities. Chronic arthriti s Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild -type rubella i nf ection and has been related to persistent virus and/or vi ral an tigen iso lated from body tissues. Only rarely have vac cine recipi ents develo p ed chronic joint sympt oms. Cases of herpes zoster in clinical studies In a clinical trial, 2 cases of herpes zos t er were reported in 2108 healthy subjects 12 through 23 months of age who were vaccinated with one dose of ProQ uad and followed f o r 1 year. Both cases were unremark able and no sequelae were re ported. Active surveillance data in children vaccinated with V aricella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and followed for 14 years af ter vaccinat ion showed no increase in the frequen cy of he rpes zoster compared t o children with prior w ild- type varicella during th e pre-vac cine era. These surveillance data actually suggest tha t varicella - vaccinated children may have a lower risk of her pes zo ster. How ever, the long term effect of varicel la vacci nation on the incidenc e of herpes zoster is u nknown at present. There are no long- term data currently available with ProQuad (see sectio n 5.1). Transmission Based on post- marketing surveillance , the po ssibility exists that varicella v accine virus (Oka /Mer ck strain) may rarely be tra nsmitted to contacts of recipients of ProQuad who deve lop or do not develop a varicella - like rash (see secti on 4.4). d. Other special populations Immunocompromised i ndivid uals (see section 4.3) N ecrotizing retinitis has been reported post-marketin g in i mmunocompromised individuals . Reporting o f suspe cted adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactio n s af ter authorisation of the medicinal product is important . It allows con tinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal prod uct. H ealthcare 12 prof essionals are aske d to report any su spected adve rse reactions via the national reporting syste m listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Administration of a higher than recommended dose of ProQuad was reported rarely and the adverse reaction p r ofile was comparable to that observed with the recommended d ose o f ProQuad. 5. PHAR MACO LOGICAL PROPER TIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic J07BD 54. Ef f icac y Formal studies to evaluate the ef ficacy of ProQuad have not b een per f ormed. However, the efficacy of Varicella V accine live (Oka/Me rck) a nd the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. has been demonstra ted in num erous studie s. ella componen ts of ProQuad previously established in a series of d ouble -blind control led f i eld trials with the monovalent vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., In c., which demonstrated a high degr ee of protec tive efficacy. In these studies ser oconversi on in respons e to v accinat i on against measles, mumps, and r ubella para lleled protection f rom th ese diseases. ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against measl es, mumps, and rubella s imilar to those observ ed after with mumps , and rubella vacci ne manu Merck & Co., Inc. More than 518 millio n doses of t he mea sles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. have been distributed worldw ide (1978 to 2007). Wi despread use of a 2 - dose vaccinatio n schedul e in the United Sta tes and countries such as Finland and Sw eden has le d to a >99% reducti on in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases. In combined clinica l trials of a single dos e of Varic ella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) in healthy childr en, the p rotective ef ficacy of the v accine against all severities of varicella disease ranged f rom 81% t o 100%. In a large case - control study, the vaccine was estimated to be 85% effective against al l f orms of varicella a nd 97% effective against moderately severe a nd severe disease. In a s tudy comparing 1 dose (N=1114) t o 2 doses ( N=1102) of Varicell a Vacc ine live (Oka/Merck), the estimated vaccine efficacy against all severi ties of varicella diseas e f or the 10-year obse rvation period was 94% for 1 dose a 98% f o r 2 doses (p< 0.001) . Over the 10 - year observation period, t he cumulati ve rate of varicell a was 7.5% af ter 1 dose and 2.2% after 2 doses. Most cases of varicella repor ted in recipients of 1 dose or 2 doses of vacc ine were mild. Antibody responses against v aricella virus gpELISA a highly sensitive assay which is not commercially available) have been shown to be highly correlated with long - term protection. Clinical studies have shown that immuniza tion w ith Pro Q uad elicits rates of antibody re sponses aga inst varice lla virus 5 gpELISA Units/ mL similar to those observed after vaccination with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). Immunogenicity Immunogenicity was studied in children 12 th rough 23 mo nths of age wi th a negative clinical history of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 randomized clinical trials. The immunogenicity of the current refrigerator - stable f ormulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenic ity of the earlier f ormul ation of ProQuad six weeks after a single dose of the vacci ne. The immunogenicity of a single dose of an earlier formulation of ProQuad was comparable to the 13 immunogenicity of a single dose of its individual component vaccines (Var icella Vacc ine live (Oka/ Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufact ure d by Merck & Co., Inc.), currently used in routine vaccination in some countries. Clinical trials involving 6987 subjects who received ProQuad demonstrated detectable i to measle s, mumps, rubella, a high proportion of in div iduals. The presence of detectable antibody was assessed by an appropriately sensitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measles, mumps (wild - type and vaccin e-type strains), and rube lla, and by gpELISA for varicella. Following a single dose of ProQuad, the vaccine response rates were 97.7% for measles, 96.3% to 98.8% for mumps, rubella. While the seroconversion rate for varicella was uniformly hi gh (97 .9% t o 99.8% across all studies), seroconversion has not been shown to correla te well with protection. The vaccine response rate was 90.9% (range 80.8% to 94.5%) for varicella based on a post - vaccination antibody tit re 5 gpELISA units/ mL (an antibody tit re that has been shown to be highly correlated with long - term protection). These results were similar to the immune response rates induced by concomitant administration of a singl e dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka /Me rck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at separate injection sites. Evaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of f irst dose A clinica l study was conducted with ProQuad ad ministered with a 2 - dose schedule, the doses being given 3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose . The safety prof ile post - dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for a ll age cohorts. In the Full Analysis Se t (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high seroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps, rubella, and varicella post - dose 2, regardless of the age of the vaccinees at the firs t dose. Af ter 2 doses, the seroprotec tio n rates against measles were 98.1% when the first dose was given at 11 months, compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months (non - inf eriority study objective met). Af ter two doses, the seroprotection r ates against measles were 94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months, compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given at 12 months (non - inferiority study objective not met). The seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 6 weeks post- dose 1 and 6 weeks post-dose 2, for the Full Analysis Set are given in the following table. 14Valence (seropro tection level)Time point Dose 1 at 9 months / Dose 2 at 12 months N = 527 Dose 1 at 11 months / Dose 2 at 14 months N = 480 Dose 1 at 12 mon ths / Dose 2 at 15 months N = 466 Ser oprotection rates titres (GMTs) against mumps, rubella, and varicella were comparable across all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who received the first dose at 9 mont hs of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or 12 months of age. Children who received a second dose of ProQuad In 2 clinical trials, 1035 subjects were administered a second dose of ProQuad app roximately 3 months af ter the first d ose . The vaccine response rates were 99.4% for measles, mL ). The geometric mean tit res (GMTs) following the second dose of ProQuad increased approximately 2 fold each for measl es, m umps, and rubella, and approximately 41 f old f or varicella (f or saf ety inf ormation, see section 4.8). Children who received 2 doses o f ProQuad intramuscularly or subcutaneously In a clinical trial, 405 children r ece ived 2 doses of ProQuad, either by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route of administration. Two doses of ProQuad administered by the IM route of administration were as immu nogenic as two doses administered by the SC route in terms of antibody response ra tes and antibody titres to measles , mump s, rubella, and varicella. Children who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary vaccination with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by M erck & Co., Inc. The immunogenicity a nd saf ety of ProQuad were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 799 subjects 4 through 6 years of age who had received Varicella Vaccine l ive (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Mer ck & Co., Inc. at least 1 month prior to study entry. Following the dose of ProQuad, GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were similar to those following a second dos e of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vac cin e manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc . admi nistered concomitantly at separate injection sites. Additionally, GMTs for measles, mumps, and rubella were similar to those following a second dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. given concomitantly with place bo (f or safety information, see section 4.8). 15Persistence of immune response The persistence of antibody at 1 year after vaccination was evaluated in a subset of 2108 subjects who were involved in 1 clinical tria l. The antibody persistence rates 1 year po stvaccination in recipients of a single dose of ProQuad Experience with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrates that antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in most individuals 11 to 13 years after primary v accination. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects who received 1 dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), detectable varicella antibodies were present in most individuals tested for up to 10 ye ars postvaccination. Observational studies of lo ng- term effectiveness of varicella vaccine Surveillance data from two U.S. observational ef fectiveness studies confirmed that widespread varicella vaccination reduces the risk of varicella by approximately 9 0% and that protection is maintained over at leas t 15 years both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. These data also suggest that varicella vaccination may reduce the risk of herpes zoster in vaccinated individuals. In the first study, a long -term prospective cohort study, approximately 7,600 ch il dren vaccinated in 1995 with varicella vaccine in their second year of life were actively followed for 14 years in order to estimate the occurrence of varicella and herpes zoster. Over the entire follow -up , the incidence of varicella was approximately 10 -f old lower among vaccinees than among children of the same age in the pre - vaccine era (estimated vaccine effectiveness over the study period was between 73% and 90%). Regarding herpes zoster, there were few er zoster cases among varicella vaccinees during the f ollow - up period than expected from rates in children of the same age with prior wild -type varicella during the pre - vaccine era (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 - 0.89). Breakthrough varicella a nd zoster cases were usually mild. In a second l ong- term surveillance study, five cross - sectional surveys on varicella incidence, each from a random sample of approximately 8,000 children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age, were conducted over 15 years, from 1995 (pre - vaccine) through 2009. Results sh ow ed a gradual decline of varicella rates by an overall 90% to 95% (approximately 10 - to 20 - fold) from 1995 to 2009 in all age groups, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. In additio n, a decrease by approximately 90% (approximately 10- f old) in varicella hospitalization rates was observed in all age groups. Post-marketing observational saf ety surveillance study Safety was evaluated in an observational study that included 69,237 childr en vaccinated with ProQuad 12 months to 12 yea rs ol d and 69,237 matched children in a historical comparison group who were vaccinated concomitantly with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine li ve (Oka/Merck). In addition to assessing the i ncidence of f ebrile seizures occurring within 30 days af ter the first dose (see section 4.8), the study also assessed the general saf ety of ProQuad in the 30 - day period after the first or second dose. Other tha n the increase in f ebrile seizure af ter the fi rst d ose, no saf ety concerns af ter the first or second dose were identif ied. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable . 5.3 Preclinical safety data Traditional non - clinical studies were not perf ormed, b ut there are no non - clinical concerns consider ed re levant to clinical saf ety beyond data included in other sections of the S ummary of Product C haracteristics (SmPC) . 166.

How to sto re ProQuad 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What ProQuad i s and wha t it is used for ProQuad is a vaccine co ntaining mea s les, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (varicella ) viruses that h ave been weakened. When a person i s given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural def ences ) will make rubella, and varicella viruse s. The antibo dies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses. P roQuad is given to help protect yo u r child against measles, mumps, rubella , and be adminis tered to perso ns from 12 months of age. ProQuad ma y also be adm inistered to infants f rom 9 months of age under special circum stances (to co nform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situatio ns, or trave l to a region with high prevalence of measle s). Although ProQuad contains liv e viruses, they a re too weak t o cause measles, mumps, rubella, or chickenpox (varicel la) in healthy people. 2. What you need to know before you receive ProQ uad Do not use ProQuad If the person to be vaccinated is aller gic to any var icella vaccine or mea sles, mum ps, or r ubella vaccin e or to any of the ingredients of this vacc ine (listed in section 6 ) includi ng neomycin . If the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or a ny type of cancer that affec ts the immune system. If the pers on to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taki ng medications that may weaken the immune system (exc ept low -dose c orticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy). If the person to be vaccinated has a weakened im m une system be cause of a di sease (including AIDS). If the person t o be vaccinated h as a family history of congenital or hereditary immun odef icien cy, u nless the immune competence of this person is demonstrated. 40 If the person to b e vaccinated has active untr eated tubercul osis. If the person to be vaccinated ha s any illness with f ever highe r than 38.5\u00b0C; however, low - grade fever itself is not a reason to d elay vaccination. If the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pr e gnancy should be avoided for 1 month af ter vaccination, see P regnancy and breast -f eeding ). Warnings and precau tions If the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of th e f o llowing, talk to the doctor or pharmacist before ProQuad is given: An allerg i c reaction to eggs or anythi ng that contai ned e gg. A history or family history of allergies or of co nvulsions (f i ts). A side eff ect after vaccination with measles, mumps, and/or rubella-containing vaccines that involved eas y bruising or bleeding for longer than usual. An inf ection with Human Immunode f iciency Vi rus (HI V) without showing symptoms of HIV disease. Howeve r, vacci n ation may be less ef fectiv e than f or uninf ected perso ns (see Do not use ProQuad ). If you ha ve a bloo d clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be given under the skin. In rare circumstances, it is possible t o catch chickenpox, including sever e chickenpox, from a person who has been vaccinated with ProQuad . This m ay occu r in persons who have not previously been vaccinated against chickenpox or had chicke npox , a s well as persons who fall into one o f the f ollowi ng categ ories: Individuals w ith a lowered resistance to diseas es. Pre gnant women who have either not had chickenpox o r have not been vaccinated against chickenpox. Newborn inf ants of mothers who have either not had chickenpo x or have not been vaccinated ag ainst chickenpox. Whenever possible, individuals who have bee n vacci nated with ProQuad should attempt to avoid close contact, f or up to 6 weeks following the vaccinat ion, with anyon e who f a lls into one of the categories abo ve.
