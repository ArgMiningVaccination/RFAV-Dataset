Herein, we report two cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax after acupuncture. These points indicate that physicians should be aware of these risk factors through history-taking before acupuncture. Chronic pulmonary diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, lung cancer, pneumonia, and thoracic surgery, may be associated with a higher risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax after acupuncture. Even if the incidence of pneumothorax should be low under caution and fully evaluated, it is still recommended to arrange further imaging examinations to rule out the possibility of iatrogenic pneumothorax.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-07", "cleaned_text": "[1](#B1-medicina-59-01100), [2](#B2-medicina-59-01100)]. Some physicians use electro-acupuncture to enhance this effect. Acupuncture, an ancient healing practice originating in China, has become widely used as a complementary and alternative medicine globally [ [3](#B3-medicina-59-01100), [4](#B4-medicina-59-01100), [5](#B5-medicina-59-01100)]. This technique involves the insertion of fine needles made of gold, silver, or stainless steel into specific acupoints on the body to alleviate symptoms [ [3](#B3-medicina-59-01100), [4](#B4-medicina-59-01100)]. Acupuncture points commonly used to treat shoulder and these points are the gallbladder, bladder, and small intestine meridians located in the shoulder and neck areas [ [6](#B6-medicina-59-01100), [7](#B7-medicina-59-01100)]. [8](#B8-medicina-59-01100), [9](#B9-medicina-59-01100)]. Pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air or gas in the pleural space, which is the space between the lungs and chest wall. Pneumothorax is classified, based on its etiology, primarily into two categories: spontaneous and acquired, which are further subcategorized as traumatic or iatrogenic [ [10](#B10-medicina-59-01100)]. According to the previous statistical data, the proportion of pneumothorax caused by acupuncture in \"at-risk\" anatomical areas is twice as high as that of acupuncture in safe areas [ [11](#B11-medicina-59-01100)]. This result indicates that performing acupuncture on the shoulder is dangerous. However, there is still the possibility of spontaneous pneumothorax while performing acupuncture in other areas. Serious and potentially life-threatening adverse events associated with acupuncture are rarely reported. These include pneumothorax, cardiovascular damage, bleeding, or bruising of the central nervous system [ [9](#B9-medicina-59-01100)]. Prospective studies have reported approximately 0.001% incidence of pneumothorax following acupuncture [ [12](#B12-medicina-59-01100), [13](#B13-medicina-59-01100)]. In a large study conducted in Taiwan, the rate was 0.87 per million sessions; even at high-risk sites, it was 1.75 per million sessions, indicating that the occurrence of pneumothorax is extremely rare [ [11](#B11-medicina-59-01100)]. However, pneumothorax is relatively common among serious adverse events such as organ damage and death. Here, we report two cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax after acupuncture. We will focus on imaging studies and discussions. 2. Case Presentation 2.1. Case 1 [Figure 1](#medicina-59-01100-f001)A). A bilateral pneumothorax was suspected, and thoracic surgery was performed. During hospitalization, left thoracic catheter drainage and nasal inhalation of pure oxygen were performed. After 5 days, CXR showed improvement in the pneumothorax ( [Figure 1](#medicina-59-01100-f001)B). The patient was discharged without chest discomfort and with stable vital signs. 2.2. Case 2 [Figure 2](#medicina-59-01100-f002)A). Chest computed tomography removal of bullae (bullectomy) were arranged the next day, as the CT scans showed lung tissue with later, the CXR showed improvement in the pneumothorax, and vital signs were stable ( [Figure 2](#medicina-59-01100-f002)C). There was no chest tightness or discomfort, and the patient was discharged. 3. Discussion [14](#B14-medicina-59-01100)]. Due to relying on the recommendations of traditional acupuncture books for needle insertion depth, female patients may experience greater susceptibility to pneumothorax following GB21 acupuncture than male patients [ [14](#B14-medicina-59-01100)]. The acupuncture needles commonly used in GB21 (Jianjing) points were 1 (2.5 cm) and 1.5 inches (4 cm), and the diameter is between 0.2 to 0.27 mm [ [8](#B8-medicina-59-01100)]. According to current research reporting on the safe depth using the GB21 (Jianjing) acupoint, the average depth of the GB21 acupoint is approximately 3.7-7 cm according to different body weights [ [15](#B15-medicina-59-01100), [16](#B16-medicina-59-01100)]. However, in clinical practice, judging the depth of acupuncture based on body weight is challenging, and a misdiagnosis may occur. Furthermore, a safe depth is related to posture. For acupuncture at GB21, the prone position is safer than sitting [ [17](#B17-medicina-59-01100)]. [11](#B11-medicina-59-01100)]. The rest is required in most cases, and no specific therapeutic intervention is required. Therefore, Chinese medicine practitioners should consider these two cases as warnings. Although there was no clear evidence from the imaging studies, the acupuncture needles in these two cases could not break through the muscle layer. However, because the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown, there is a considerable risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. [18](#B18-medicina-59-01100)]. Pneumothorax may require invasive intervention and ongoing monitoring because it has the potential to develop into a critical condition that may compromise cardiovascular function. Prompt medical recognition and intervention are crucial to achieving the best possible patient outcomes [ [19](#B19-medicina-59-01100)]. Spontaneous pneumothorax is commonly observed in underweight young males and patients with lung abnormalities. Risk factors include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, malignancy, infections, cystic lung disorders, catamenia (endometriosis), architectural abnormalities (Marfan syndrome), anorexia, exercise, and illicit or immunosuppressant drug use [ [20](#B20-medicina-59-01100)]. Associated with the conditions of the lungs and thorax, patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, lung cancer, pneumonia, and thoracic surgery may have a higher incidence of pneumothorax after acupuncture [ [11](#B11-medicina-59-01100)]. Subpleural emphysematous bullae were found in case 2 after thoracoscopic surgery. Although the patient had not been previously diagnosed with lung disease, an abnormal lung is often an important risk factor for pneumothorax. For patients who are at risk, such as those with a history of acupuncture treatment, it may be advisable to include this information in the medical history assessment of those who present with symptoms such as chest pain and/or breathing difficulty. [21](#B21-medicina-59-01100)]. An ancient Chinese medical reference described atopomenorrhea, which means coughing up or vomiting blood during menstruation, similar to intrathoracic endometriosis in modern medicine. Case 1 experienced menstrual pain and underwent acupuncture during menstruation. However, judging from the imaging of the bilateral collapse of her lungs, she possibly had medical pneumothorax caused by acupuncture. In most cases (95%), the right hemithorax is involved, while the left hemithorax is involved in only 5% of the cases, and bilateral involvement is quite rare [ [22](#B22-medicina-59-01100)]. However, attention should be paid to the history of menstruation because endometriosis is a risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax [ [23](#B23-medicina-59-01100)]. [24](#B24-medicina-59-01100)]. Cupping is also a good alternative if patients select a more conservative treatment method [ [25](#B25-medicina-59-01100)]. Cupping causes local hyperemia, promotes blood circulation, regenerates local tissue, and relieves pain. Cupping has become popular since many international sporting events have introduced it to treat athletes. Additionally, some physicians choose distal acupoints to treat the shoulder, such as the ear and scalp [ [26](#B26-medicina-59-01100)]. According to bioholography theory, many parts of the body have corresponding regions. Other manual treatments and physical therapies can also help relieve shoulder pain. Therefore, needles should be avoided in high-risk areas that are not completely secure. 4. Conclusions [11](#B11-medicina-59-01100)]. Patients with such medical histories should avoid chest and back acupuncture. Acupuncture applied to parts other than the chest and back should also be arranged in a prominent position so that physicians can detect any discomfort in patients at any time.
