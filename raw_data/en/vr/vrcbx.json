[According to the Anxiety and Depression Association](https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics), depression is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for people ages 15 to 44. It affects more than 16.1 million American adults, and nearly one-half of those diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. If you'd like to treat your depression naturally, there are a number of foods, vitamins, and supplements that can help reduce the effects of stress on your health, help you to sleep better, and yes, even fight depression. Here are 35+ super foods, vitamins, and supplements that help treat depression naturally: Lentils, chickpeas, beans, and quinoa are rich in B vitamins, which have a calming effect on the body and can enhance our mood and help reduce anxiety. They are also healthful boosters of [both dopamine and norepinephrine, aka the \"stress hormone](http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Neurotransmitters.html),\" which are both neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters coordinate communication between neurons, which in turn influences every cell, tissue, and system in our body. What you eat affects the formation of these neurotransmitters, and some diet-related neurotransmitters have a significant effect on your mood, appetite, and cravings. Dopamine, in particular, can affect the pleasure-reward center of your brain, which can have substantial effects on your mood, your happiness, and even whether or not you become addicted to drugs. Romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, collard greens, broccoli, cauliflower, beets, citrus fruits, lentils, basil, sunflower seeds, and mushrooms all contain the nutrient folate, which helps you attain a calmer mood. Enjoy yellow, orange, and red fruits and vegetables. Papayas, beets, apples and red bell peppers have Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and folate, which enhance mood, energize, and repair cells damaged by stress.

These foods contain anthocyanin antioxidants, which can help reduce inflammation which contributes to bad moods. In a fully controlled double-blind study, [wild blueberries were shown to prevent low mood and depression](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/2/158). Purple potatoes have skins that contain iodine, which is the main nutrient that supports your thyroid and helps stabilize hormone levels. This will help prevent mood swings. Maca root, in the form of a raw powder, [supports your adrenal glands, which regulate your body's response to stress](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-maca-root#section1). It contains more than fifty-five beneficial phytochemical nutrients that help our bodies regulate hormones, relieve the symptoms of depression, elevate mood, and increase stamina. (Raw organic red or black maca root powder is best because the raw root is not processed over 118\u00b0F, and therefore it retains the live enzymes necessary to feed the cells of the body.) [ Tulsi tea (also known as \"holy basil\")](https://www.teamindbody.com/blogs/healthy-tea-info/9885490-15-insane-health-benefits-of-tulsi-tea-de-stress-with-this-super-herb), is a member of the mint family and has been shown to help regulate hormones and relieve stress, as well as other health benefits.

A banana is a natural food source of tyrosine. Tyrosine is the amino acid neurons turn into norepinephrine and dopamine. Norepinephrine and dopamine are neurotransmitters that are important in creating our ability to be motivated, concentrate, and have a more effective memory. Beets contain the amino acid betaine, which is an antidepressant. Betaine acts as a stimulant for the production of SAM-e, [which is directly related to the production of certain hormones](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-sam-e#1) such as dopamine and serotonin. Watermelon juice and watermelon rind are both rich with vitamins A, B6, and C. Vitamin B6 is used by the body to manufacture neurotransmitters such as serotonin, melatonin, and dopamine. It's easy to put the rind into a blender and have a healthy smoothie, too! Make sure you are not low in Vitamin D. Vitamin D is prohormone and helps prevent inflammation. A deficiency of vitamin D can cause depression and has also been linked to cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and some autoimmune diseases.
