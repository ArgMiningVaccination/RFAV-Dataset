It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for using in adults with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is the only diseasemodifying therapy (DMT) approved for PPMS. In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also approved ocrelizumab as the first drug for people with early PPMS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with MS. Objectives To assess the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with RRMS and PPMS. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and two trials registers on 8 October 2021. We screened reference lists, contacted experts, and contacted the main authors of studies. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with RRMS or PPMS according to the McDonald criteria, comparing ocrelizumab alone or associated with other medications, at the approved dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks for any duration, versus placebo or any other active drug therapy. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results Four RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 2551 participants; 1370 treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg and 1181 controls. Among the controls, 298 participants received placebo and 883 received interferon beta1a. The treatment duration was 24 weeks in one study, 96 weeks in two studies, and at least 120 weeks in one study. One study was at high risk of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel; all four studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. For RRMS, compared with interferon beta1a, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. lower relapse rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval to 0.73; participants; moderatecertainty evidence); 2. a lower number of participants with disability progression (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; 2 studies, 1656 participants; lowcertainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any adverse event (RR 1.00, 95% 0.96 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1651 participants; evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11; evidence); 5. a lower number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91; 2 studies, 1651 participants; 6. a lower number of participants with gadoliniumenhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35; 2 studies, 1656 participants; lowcertainty evidence); 7. a lower number of participants with new or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions on MRI (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1656 participants; lowcertainty evidence) at 96 weeks. For PPMS, compared with placebo, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. a lower number of participants with disability progression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; 1 study, 731 participants; lowcertainty evidence); 2. a higher number of participants with any adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 725 participants; moderatecertainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23; 1 study, 725 participants; lowcertainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.75; 1 study, 725 participants; lowcertainty evidence) for at least 120 weeks. There were no data for number of participants with gadoliniumenhancing T1 lesions on MRI and number of participants with new or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions on MRI. Authors' conclusions For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a large reduction in relapse rate and little to no difference in adverse events when compared with interferon beta1a at 96 weeks (moderatecertainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a large reduction in disability progression, treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events, number of participants with gadoliniumenhancing T1 lesions on MRI, and number of participants with new or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions on MRI, and may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (lowcertainty evidence). For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a higher rate of adverse events when compared with placebo for at least 120 weeks (moderatecertainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a reduction in disability progression and little to no difference in serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (lowcertainty evidence). Ocrelizumab was well tolerated clinically; the most common adverse events were infusionrelated reactions and nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections. PICOs Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis? Key messages - Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsingremitting MS (where people experience flareups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flareups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. - Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. - We need more, betterdesigned studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects. What is multiple sclerosis? MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking. There are several types of MS. In relapsingremitting MS, people have 'flareups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time. What is ocrelizumab? Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsingremitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a diseasemodifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsingremitting MS and primary progressive MS. We were interested in how many people: - had symptom flareups; - had worsening symptoms; - experienced unwanted effects; and - stopped treatment due to unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsingremitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta1a in people with relapsingremitting MS. Interferon beta1a is an older type of diseasemodifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. Main results Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta1a for people with relapsingremitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: - probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flareups; - may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; - probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and - may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: - may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; - probably increases unwanted effects; and - may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. How uptodate is this evidence? The evidence is "}
