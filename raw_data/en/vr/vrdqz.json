Symptoms of tooth decays or dental caries include black, yellow or brown stains on the crevices of teeth, toothaches, holes in teeth and swelling and inflammation. What causes tooth decays are bacterial breakdown of the teeth which happens when the bacteria feed on food debris stuck on the teeth. These bacteria produce acid which wears down teeth and cause tooth decays. High risk factors of tooth decays include: poor oral hygiene, eating a diet high in sugary foods, certain medications such as antihistamines and antidepressants that reduce saliva production, receding gums and certain health conditions such as diabetes mellitus that also cause less saliva production which makes bacteria thrive.
