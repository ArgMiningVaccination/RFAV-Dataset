I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I went in for lower back pain management. I completed the extensive questionnaire ahead of time by downloading online. I met with them in an office to discuss my injuries and diet and insurance coverage. The 15-20 minute consultation, 10 minutes of cupping, and 20 minutes of electroacupuncture was awesome. They explained their treatment philosophy and appointment frequency options, and laid out dietary changes that would be good to heal myself from the inside. I have food intolerances and injuries and by my own report, nothing structurally wrong with my spine (based on previous MRI's). I have never had acupuncture before and have no fear of needles. The cupping helped get the blood flowing in pain areas and I was so soothed by the electro pulses of the needles I fell asleep. I still have pain but I do have relief and look forward to appointments 2 or 3 times a week. They were friendly and down to earth and the office is quiet. - 5/24/2023 I came here looking for a new acupuncturist for my bell's palsy since I moved across states. I met and completed one session with Dr Chapa. Let me tell you, I've had plenty of acupuncture before and with different acupuncturists. I'm 90% recovered and he tried to upsell me to get acupuncture 3-4x a week. Other acupuncturists have told me I only needed to get acupuncture once a week at the stage where my bell's palsy is at. He also came off cocky and arrogant. Just the tone of his voice turned me away. I'm sure he's good at what he does but he's not a genuine person. He's a business man first. I was able to find someone who I feel much more comfortable with. Business owner information Carlos C. 5/28/2023 We are sorry we were not a fit for you, however we recommended our treatment plan based on our training and experience for best results. We are experts and specialize treating Bell's palsy and facial paralysis and we treat this EVERY SINGLE DAY. Most patients want results as soon as possible and our success rates amazing. In Asia for example, patients are treated every single day for best and fast results. Sometimes it takes 2-3 treatments / 1 week and other times it takes several weeks. Thank you for the opportunity and we only with you the best. - 11/17/2021 I got Bells Palsy for the 1st time November 1st, and I booked my acupuncture appointments by the third day. Been going for two weeks straight and seen a 30% improvement in my Bell's Palsy!! I've done about 10-12 treatments and plan on doing more!! I'm very hopeful the treatment & herbs will help me fully heal. So thankful to have found this clinic. The staff is super friendly and nice. Can't wait to continue to see improvements!! Dr. Chapa & his Korean female practitioner have been treating me. - 5/10/2021 I have been coming here for a while and I usually get cupping on my back and the Acupuncture on my hips. I told the doctor this and she only did the cupping and when I mentioned it they got angry with me therefore I will longer come here for this service. - 12/7/2018 I got to see Dr. Chapa while I was visiting in Dallas from Austin. Great bedside manner; he truly listens to you, asks the right questions, and lets you know he wants to get down to the root of your problem, not just cover up the symptom! Excellent choice for someone new to trying naturopathy / Eastern medicine, because he explains everything so clearly. If you're afraid of needles, he also takes that into consideration- so don't let that deter you from seeking his help. His staff was kind and attentive as well, greeted me right as I walked in, which I appreciate. - 10/12/2018 My wife and I have been treated by Dr Chapa for over six years now. He is hands down one of the valuable healers we have found to compliment wellness and health. Dr Chapa not only listens and takes the time to understand the total patient he is constantly educating himself. This constant effort gives him the knowledge and skill to help dig down to the core of a health imbalance. His front office staff is professional and courteous. I always appreciate appointment reminders and follow-up calls from the staff, which truly make a patient understand they are heard and valued. I recommend Dr Chapa and his staff they are an absolute asset to anyone looking to truly find health and vitality. - 9/11/2017 My Labor Day started off a little scary. My husband grabbed a box out of my car and pulled a muscle in his lower back. He had a previous back injury from years ago but today it was worse. Even with the pain he still carried the box inside the house. He walked in and told me he pulled a muscle in his back and he was in pain. I immediately grabbed the phone and called over a dozen Acupuncturist in several Cities but of course by it being a holiday everyone was closed. I continued to call and finally a live person answered and I asked the receptionist if they were open and she said yes. She told me that Dr. Chapa had a full schedule but that she could squeeze my husband in at 3:00. When we arrived we were greeted and I grabbed the forms to fill out. My husband could not sit down in a low chair so he stood. The receptionist spoke with the doctor and explained to him that my husband could not sit comfortably so he allowed her to bring my husband into one of the rooms to lay down until his appointment time. She had so much compassion and it really meant a lot to me that she wanted to make sure my husband was comfortable. While waiting for the doctor, I stayed in the room with my husband and completed the paperwork. The tech came in and started the cupping method. She suctioned about 10 cups all over his back and I thought it was cool that some areas were darker than other areas to help the doctor determine the trouble areas. Dr. Chapa walked in the room and immediately I liked him. He is very compassionate, funny and he spoke with my husband in great detail about the treatment for his back. He started the Electro-acupuncture and adjusted the level for my husband. Dr. Chapa came in every ten minutes to check on him to make sure he was ok. About thirty minutes later he removed the needles and placed a few disposable heat wraps on the injured areas. He also gave my husband herbs to take twice a day and told him to get plenty of rest and keep a heating pad on his back. While there I made appointments for my husband for the next two days. After his first visit he felt a little better but after the third visit he had improved by 80%. He is able to sit down and get out of bed without pain and he is back to work. I am so glad I found Dr. Chapa and thankful that he was open on Labor Day and fit my husband in his schedule. I highly recommend Dr. Chapa to anyone in pain. He is very professional and he has a great team. Excellent customer service and compassion. He also has an office in Mesquite. We went to the Mesquite office for the third visit. - 5/16/2017 I came to AIMC as a visiting extern practitioner about 2 weeks ago. This is what I have to say about AIMC: Dr. Chapa is very knowledgeable and well-read. He incorporates different detox modalities for patients that need it. For instance, I witnessed a man that had a limp and needed a cane, become virtually limp-free. Gua sha therapy for neck and shoulder pain, cupping for back and hip pain. Electro-acupuncture for muscle injury, and herbal therapy for everything else. Dr. Chapa also utilizes iridology to help gleen into a patient's health to prevent any impending illness from manifesting. At the end of my externship, Dr. Chapa gave me an iridology reading. It is really fun to see my iris. My iris revealed that I had kidney issues. I can agree to this since I had chronic kidney infections when I was a child. My brother also has lupus, which generally affects the kidneys, and it was helpful to see that perhaps my kidneys needed strengthening. Dr. Chapa is very passionate about what he does. Elisha is a hard-worker and is also very knowledgeable in Western and Eastern Medicine. Irving is so lucky to have 2 caring capable practitioners that help people heal naturally. I am very grateful that I decided to visit AIMC for my doctoral externship. Any practitioner who is looking for a preceptor should definitely look into visiting AIMC and Dr. Chapa. The clinic space is very beautiful, modern, and clean. I only mention this because cleanliness is very important to me in a clinic space. Their herbal inventory is extensive and complete. AIMC is a well-oiled healing machine. - 2/3/2020 I came in, they listened and help me with my healthcare needs, all without prescription medications! They have eased my pain and stress. Have helped me with my digestive issues and I went from a size 10 to a size 4!! All the doctors are great, but Miranda is my personal favorite. She was not only my doctor but my personal accountability partner!!! Listening, and guiding me every step of the way. She answered all my questions and gave me excellent guidance!! Would recommend to all my friends and family!!! - 10/22/2017 I went here to give acupuncture a try. I was having tension headaches and neck pain. I had been to many doctors and tried many different alternative treatments including physical therapy and massage therapy. As a pharmacist, after meeting with the dr I was so intrigued by this herbal method of treatment. I have it a try and had a few sessions with herbal treatment. I don't know if this is the sole cause of my improvement as I was still doing other things as well. But overall it was a good experience and I did ultimately end up getting relief You Might Also Consider [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=sA91mD_2WzoIbl_cy26FuQ&campaign_id=5Riam-Mfu4nQ2lui7wK5Rg&click_origin=read_more&placement=below_biz_review&placement_slot=1&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fultimate-bariatrics-irving-3%23atb_alias%3AAboutThisBizSpecialties&request_id=c3effe5af67cbdd5&signature=f7913fab5936ddf3a07bfb3336e0e54147e2cc4177c59936960ef9f6157827d0&slot=0) in Surgeons, Weight "}
