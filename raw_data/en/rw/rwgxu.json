However , some patients are diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent disease after treatment of localized disease. Treatment Androgen ablation is the standard treatment for metastatic or recurrent disease. Most patients who survive long enough eventually develop androgen -independent (castration -resistant) prostate cancer. At this stage of metastatic disease, docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent, has demonstrated a survival benefit of 1.9 to 2.4 months in randomized clinical trials.2,3, Chemotherapy with docetaxel causes adverse events in large proportions of patient s, including alopecia, fatigue, neutropenia, neuropathy, and other symptoms. Trials evaluating docetaxel included both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, and results have suggested a survival benefit for both groups. Because of the burden of treatment and its adverse events, most patients defer docetaxel treatment until cancer recurrence is symptomatic. Cancer immunotherapy has been investigated as a treatment that could be instituted at the point of detection of androgen -independent metastatic disease before significant symptomatic manifestations have occurred. The quantity of cancer cells in the patient during this time is thought to be relatively low, and it is thought that an effective immune response to cancer during this interval could effectively delay or prevent progression. Such a delay could allow a course of effective chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, to be deferred or delayed until necessary, thus providing an overall survival benefit. Summary Sipuleucel -T (Provenge) is a class of therapeutic asymptomatic -or minimally symptomatic -castration prostate cancer. The agent comprises specially treated dendritic cells obtained from the patient through leukapheresis. The cells are then exposed in vitro to prote ins that contain prostate antigens and immunologic -stimulating factors and reinfused into the patient. The proposed mechanism of action is that treatment stimulates the patient's own immune system to resist cancer spread. For individuals who have asymptom atic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic, castration -resistant prostate cancer receive sipuleucel -T (Provenge), the evidence includes 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a systematic review of these RCTs. Relevant outcomes are overall survival ( OS), disease -specific survival, change in disease status, and treatment -related morbidity. The 2 earlier RCTs of sipuleucel -T were not specifically designed to demonstrate a difference in overall mortality but did show 3 a survival difference. The third RCT, which was designed to demonstrate a mortality difference, showed a similar improvement in OS. All 3 studies were consistent in demonstrating that sipuleucel -T does not delay time to a measurable progression of the disease. A meta -analysis of the 3 RCTs fo und significantly improved OS but not the time to progression, with sipuleucel -T compared with placebo. Serious adverse events did not increase in the sipuleucel -T group. However, the available data suggested, but did not confirm, an increase in stroke ris k; this risk is being evaluated in a postmarketing study. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have nonmetastatic, androgen -dependent prostate cancer who receive sipuleucel -T (Provenge), the evidence includes an RCT. Relevant outcome are OS, disease -specific survival, change in disease status, and treatment -related morbidity. The RCT did not find a statistically significant difference between sipuleuce l-T and control in time to biochemical failure. The RCT was not designed to evaluate the impact of sipuleucel -T on mortality. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes.
