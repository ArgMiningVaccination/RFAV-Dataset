But do they really work? By working with an integrative medicine specialist such as Yuliya Litvak of Brooklyn, New York, you can learn more about the various vitamins and supplements used in maintaining a healthy immune system. Below are just some of the more typical solutions: Vitamin C Vitamin C is one of the most popular supplements for boosting immunity. It's an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage, and it's thought to play a role in stimulating the natural production of white blood cells, which are key players in the immune system. There is evidence that vitamin C can help reduce the severity and duration of cold symptoms. Echinacea Another popular supplement for boosting immunity is echinacea. This herb stimulates the immune system and helps fight off infections. By integrating echinacea into your supplement and vitamin regimen, you can improve your body's ability to fend off colds, cases of flu, and other infections. Multivitamins Patients can also ask about using multivitamins to ensure they are getting all their nutrients each day. These are available over-the-counter or through our office to use with a healthy lifestyle. Multivitamins may also include higher levels of specific nutrients. For example, patients who are low in iron may benefit from multivitamins and supplements that are higher in iron and offer a balance of the remaining vitamins and minerals to ensure better health and wellness. How do I learn more about supporting my immune system health? So, while there's no magic bullet for boosting immunity, eating a healthy diet and getting enough rest are still the best ways to keep your immune system strong.
