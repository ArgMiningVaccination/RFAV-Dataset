As an inspector for over 10 years, I never understood just how important my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was to my career. Now that I'm on the recruiting/BD side, I get a front row seat to witnessing the recruiting process and how a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is usually the deciding factor between the haves and have nots. I hope this video helps and, if well receieved, I look forward to making my dog, Gauge, costar in a few more. I want to be clear. I am not an export and my advice is very industry specific. Just trying to help my fellow inspectors land that next project. Cheers! [Thays@nees.us.com](mailto:Thays@nees.us.com?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare-text) - 4 Non "}
