Cosmetic acupuncture, also known as facial acupuncture, is an ancient beauty secret and is used by both men and women as a non-toxic way to minimize fine lines and wrinkles from the face. It reduces the signs of aging by renewing the glow of the skin and providing a youthful look to the face. Cosmetic acupuncture needles create stimulation to areas of facial tissue by increasing the circulation of blood flow to the wrinkles and thus producing more collagen production, resulting in less wrinkle formation. Cosmetic acupuncture is an ancient healing art that has been practiced in China for emperors and empresses as a beauty ritual for at least 5,000 thousand years. The treatment involves inserting tiny, hair-like needles into the face and others into the body in order to increase the blood circulation and collagen production within the skin. This allows the skin to be nourished, oxygenated and moisturized from the inside out. Additionally, the increased production of collagen tightens the skin. Hence, the treatment improves the complexion and elasticity of the skin. During each treatment, medical acupuncture is used, meaning that body needles are placed to work on stress levels, pain, insomnia or anything else that is currently bothering the patient. This helps immensely in the outcome of radiant skin as the body is all connected. Cosmetic acupuncture is currently all the rage among Hollywood's elite, and its popularity is understandable. It promises a more youthful appearance with no downtime, no anesthesia, no harmful chemicals or toxins injected and no going under the knife. What Results Are Seen With Cosmetic Acupuncture? Cosmetic acupuncture treatments help the youth stay looking youthful and those with wrinkles to look many years younger. It minimizes fine lines and softens the deeper lines making them less noticeable. The treatment can also minimize dark circles and puffiness under the eyes, and aids in the tightening of the jowls, that tend to sag as we age. Most importantly, acupuncture provides overall rejuvenation, allowing the whole body to feel less stressed and more energized. Wrinkles that are minimized include: - Marionette Lines.......the lines framing the mouth. - Glabellar Lines.........the vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows (the frown lines aka, \"the 11's). - Crow's Feet.............the wrinkles at the corner of the eyes. - Smile lines...............the deep folds between the nose and the mouth (the laugh lines or \"nasolabial\" folds) - Forehead Lines..........the horizontal wrinkles across the forehead - Vertical lip lines.........the small wrinkles around the mouth - Chin lines - Neck lines - Eyelid Lines - Under eye lines To be more specific, other than the various areas of the face that have wrinkles, this treatment has many other beneficial results for rejuvenating the skin including: - Renewing facial glow - Oxygenating the skin - Regulating acne prone skin - Balancing oily/dry skin - Firming facial skin - Diminishing skin discoloration - Brightening dark circles under eyes - Tightening pores - Brightening sallow complexion - Tightening sagging eyelids - Temporarily plumping lips Who Benefits From Cosmetic Acupuncture? Three groupings of women and men between the ages of 20 to 70 benefit from these treatments: I. Women and men in their 20's and 30's who are looking to prevent the early onset of wrinkles. II. Women and men in their 40's and 50's who are looking to minimize the appearance of fine to medium lines and maintain a youthful glow to the skin. III. Women and men in their 60's and 70's who are looking for an overall facial rejuvenation effect that will soften the appearance of deep wrinkles, minimize the dull complexion and bring back the glow that has been lost over the years. All three groups will gain a dewy and fresh appearance, delay the aging process and look and feel younger. Does It Hurt? No, it is nothing that you would expect. The most popular question asked of this treatment is the assumption of discomfort because \"needles\" are used. But there is no need to worry since these needles are not anything like the ones you are used to seeing at the doctor's office. They are so tiny and thin that it's hard to even refer to them as \"needles\". They are about the width of a thread and feel like a hair or a thin bristle on a brush. Due to their size, they are barely felt by the patient. In fact, 41 acupuncture \"needles\" can easily fit into the tip of one single needle used by a doctor. Of course, the skill of the acupuncturist is important. Jason Richard has refined his gentle technique by spending many years of training in the field. Are There Any Side Effects? No, there are no side effects. This is so because cosmetic acupuncture is natural and uses no fillers or harsh chemicals. Actually, the patient is left feeling relaxed, fresh and wonderful with a strengthened immune system. There is no downtime, no puffiness, no swelling, no drugs, no allergic skin reactions and no injections. In fact, directly after the treatment, the patient can do just about anything and there are no marks or redness upon leaving the office. Other treatments used to reduce wrinkles, such as fillers, surgery, chemical peels and laser treatments usually always do have many side effects. It is suggested to do your research when thinking about various skin treatments. Our skin is extremely thin and delicate and we should be as gentle as possible with any treatment as well as products used on the skin. You could end up causing faster aging by not doing your research and finding out what is in the best interest of your delicate skin. As we get older, our skin begins to thin and side effects from harsh chemical fillers and lasers damage the skin much more quickly. Why Choose Cosmetic Acupuncture Over Other Treatments? Long-term radiant health of your body is the most important reason to go with cosmetic acupuncture. With Botox, some of the risks may include allergic reactions, possibly paralysis of surrounding nerves, which impair natural facial expressions. With fillers, patients commonly experience puffiness, swelling, bruising and extended bed rest and downtime. The same commonly holds true with chemical peels and laser treatments. With cosmetic surgery, many risks are involved such as anesthesia complications, a long recovery with days to weeks of discomfort, nerve damage to the face, allergic reactions to the drugs and scarring just to name a few. Cost is a large factor to consider. Botox and fillers are usually in the ballpark of $1,000's over a few years and the same with expensive peels and lasers because they have to be done on a continual basis to keep up the results. Facial surgical procedures can cost $30,000 or more after all is said and done. The key point to remember is that cosmetic acupuncture is not a \"band-aid\" approach to your skin; It is the opposite in that the body is rejuvenating from the inside out. With fillers and the like, a patient must go in every 6 weeks up to 8 months to keep up the results. With cosmetic acupuncture your results will last for longer periods, since the collagen built has been produced by your body. With Cosmetic acupuncture your health is never at risk and the cost is minimal in the long run since you will not have to keep repeating treatments years on end. Lastly, you will never have to worry about the long-term adverse side effects that are not known yet from injecting your face with harsh chemical fillers and toxins. How Many Treatments Do I Need? A general course of 10 treatments is done for best effect. Usually after a few treatments a patient notices some changes. Around the 7th or 8th treatment, the collagen starts to kick in and wrinkles start diminishing. After this, a maintenance of one treatment a month is done depending on the age of the patient. Can You Explain Why Acupuncture Is Done On Other Parts Of The Body Too? To explain acupuncture in a nutshell; it looks at every part of your body as a whole. So when your face is getting acupuncture, your body needs to as well, to enhance the results. By placing needles into other body points such as your ankles or forearms, that will balance your hormones, stress, digestion, sleep and immune system, your skin will start to glow. That means that treating the face is part of it and treating the rest of the body completes it. When your entire body is in balance, so is your skin. This idea differs when you go to most doctor's visits in that one part of your body is being treated only and is looked at as separate to everything that is going awry inside of you. Will It Affect My Current Botox Treatments? Many patients choose to use cosmetic acupuncture to take care of those pesky fine to medium wrinkles and may possibly choose to go the route of Botox or other fillers to take care of those stubborn deep wrinkles. In fact, the cosmetic acupuncture treatments will help to prolong the life of the Botox. So this means that a patient will be able to make fewer trips to the doctor a year. The patient will be saving time, money and fewer possible side effects.
