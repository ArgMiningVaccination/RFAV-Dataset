Also, many things that we do every day support our health. Here are updates from the research world to keep in mind as we start the New Year. Have a nice warm relaxing cup of tea: Let's face it -this time of year can be hectic and anxiety -provoking for many of us. L -Theanine, an ingredient found in green tea, was found to reduce heart rate, anxiety, and stress levels as well as blunt the body's immune reaction to a stressful task. So find time to sit down and enjoy a cup of green tea.1 Get in touch with your spiritual side: We've known for a long time that religious observance is health promoting, but it's not clear why. Gary Bernston, PhD and colleagues from Ohio State found that spirituality helps to regulate heart rate and the cardiovascular system and may have a protective effect against heart disease.2 Better nutrition, better mental health: A healthy diet quality score was inversely related to depression and anxiety, in other words, the healthier a person eats, the less anxiety and depression a person has. A healthy diet was defined as one that includes fruits and vegetables as \"core food groups\" and includes two or more servings of fruit per day and four or more servings of vegetables, and avoids processed foods as much as possible.3 Eat your fruits and vegetables for better health: Diets high in fruits and vegetables have been shown to be associated with improved survival in two groups of cancer patients. Improved diet was protective for women with early stage breast cancer (in combination with exercise) and people with Stage 3 colon cancer (in combination with low fat, low red meat and low refined carbs).4,5 Managing stress can help your health: A review of mindfulness intervention studies for patients with cancer found that people reported improvement in stress levels, anxiety, and depression. Several studies measured immune system function and found improvement in serum cortisol as well as cytokines (chemicals that produce inflammation). While we don't know how this will affect the cancer, helping the immune system to work better can't hurt.6 \"Ess, ess, mein kind \" (Eat, eat, my child) \u2014 chicken soup is good for you. Chicken soup has long been hailed as a cure -all during cold and flu season. Bringing a bowl of homemade chicken soup to a sick patient is comforting, to be sure, and in recent years scientists have come up with research to prove that it has measurable health benefits by the standards of modern medicine, not just Grandma's wisdom. Researchers Stephen Rennard, MD, Barbara Rennard, BA, and colleagues at the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Section at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha found that homemade chicken soup (as opposed to commercial, canned soup) inhibited neutrophil migration \u2014 meaning it reduced inflammation, a common characteristic of colds and the flu. In an older study, Kiumars Saketkhoo, MD, and colleagues revealed that chicken soup, even more than plain hot water, increased nasal mucous velocity \u2014 meaning that it enhanced mucous secretions which can help in the management of upper respiratory Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S.
