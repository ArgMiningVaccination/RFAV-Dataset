It is a vital component of the individual's and communit y health, as nutritional well-being of the population is consider ed as an economic asset and a pre-requisit e for national development. Most of maladies develop due to the impr oper dietary practices and cookery procedur es. The accent of Ayush system is the preservation of health and it can be attained in two ways, rst of all prevention of disease and health promotion by due observation of such advoc acies as would keep away the maladies; secondly by managing the diseases which may invade the body . The advoc acies are no less import ant than the treatment of diseases and method of cure. The prerequisit es to attain this include wholesome diet, conservation of envir onment, congenial social and cultur al atmosphere. Diet (ahara) is an essential factor for the maint enanc e of life. Though the scienc e of nutrition at the present times evolved as an elabor ate and organized subjec t of study, contemporary perspective dwell on certain gross component s , while Ayush emphasizes on diver sied aspec ts of dietetics and nutrition viz. quality, quantity, processing methods, rationale of combination of food articles, emotional aspec ts, natur e of the consumer , geogr aphic al & envir onment al conditions etc. which are pivot al in preservation and promotion of health and prevention of disease.MessageSecr etary Government of India Ministr y of A yushVaidya Rajesh K otecha Ayush therapeu tics; specic diet and lifestyle guidelines are always prescribed along with the drugs and therapies to facilit ate restoration of homoeost atic bio-mechanisms and wellbeing.

India is well known for its diverse food varieties with regional diversity . Behavioural changes, dietar y modications and medications as per practices and principles of Ayurveda aid in health promotion, prevention of diseases and reducing prevalence of malnutrition. The ultimate goal of traditional medicinal systems is the promotion and preservation of health. It can be attained in two ways, rstly by eradicating the diseases, secondly , by abiding to the codes of conduct in order t o prevent diseases. These codes of conduct are very essential in safeguar ding health. Nutrition is a vital component of the individual and community health as nutritional well being of the population is regar ded as an economic asset and an impor tant indicat or for the development of the nation. Nutrition is progressiv ely being perceived as a signicant epitome of advancement at public and worldwide level. Nutrition has consistently been an essential need of humanity. Inappropriate nutrition has resulted in certain diseases which have existed even befor e the dawn of modern science. Malnutrition has remained an important concern in the countr y despite various substantial impr ovements brought about in health and well being and acts as a major barrier in overall socio-economic progress of the countr y. Malnutrition is highest among children and women, primarily due to inappropriate food intake because of food insecurity, diseases, inadequate health services and insufcient awar eness about the proper care.Preamble7Malnutrition among childr en, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers is an important public healthcare challenge. It is associated with increased prevalence of anaemia in target population, complicated pregnancy, increased rates of Intra Uterine Growth Retar dation (IUGR), Low Birth Weight Baby, protein ener gy malnutrition (PEM), increased Infant Mortality , and poor adult health. Malnourishment lowers cognitiv e development in childr en. Nutritional anemia results into reduced physical and mental performances in women. Although various programs such as Public Distribution System (PDS), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), National Mid-day meal Program (NMMP) and various schemes for providing work and food are operational, further effective implementation, tar geting and co verage will help in combating malnutrition successfully . Nutritional science evolved in an elaborated and organiz ed way. The contemporary perspective of diet comprises of macr onutrients like carbohy drates, fats, proteins, minerals, water etc. and micr onutrients like vitamins and trace minerals. Ayurveda focuses on diversied aspects of dietetics and nutrition viz. quality , quantity , processing methods, rationale of combination of food articles, emotional aspects, natur e of the consumer , geographical and envir onmental conditions etc. Ayurveda lays great emphasis on ensuring holistic nutrition. Health-pr omoting regime (Pathy a vyavastha featur e of Ayurvedic therapeutics. Various diet and lifestyle guidelines specic to individuals are prescribed along with the drugs and therapies for facilitating restoration of homoeostatic bio-mechanisms (Dhatu-samy ata) and well-being. Healthy living requir es conduciv e and balanced diet which can be achie ved by adopting the Ayurveda dietar y advocacies, healthy eating beha viour and attitude through an Ayurveda way of living. Ayurveda strongly emphasiz es on promotiv e and preventiv e aspects of health giving prime importance to \"Ahara\" (wholesome diet) or \"Anna\" (wholesome food) as a means to good life, health and wellness. It advocates basic dietary guidelines in terms of appropriate food, incompatibile food combinations, methods of cooking, storage, dining atmosphere, hygiene and etiquette for maintenance of health. Ayurveda has laid down the concepts of dietetics such as Ashta non- consumable food items), Bhojana Krama (sequence of food) and sequence of eating food as per Rasas (tastes) for a healthy living. Such Ayurveda adv ocacies should be followed for impr ovement in nutrition, quality of life and adoption of positiv e beha viour change through judicious application of these advocacies. General Dietary Advisory 8Based on the Principles of Ayurveda, one should follow 5 'Rights ' of AYURPOSHAN i.e. Recommendations The Right Time , The Right Quantity , The Right Quality , The Right Methods and The Right PlaceOne should inculcate the habit of having meal on time (Kale bhojana ) only on feeling of hunger and after digestion of previous meal. One should take minimum three meals (Breakfast, Lunch and dinner) per day with gap of atleast Two & half hour in each meal. One should consume the optimum quantity of food based on signs of fullness to avoid overeating/ under eating. Imagine 3 parts of stomach (Trividh kukshi) - To ll one par t with solid, one par t with liquid & k eep the third part empty . So one should consume food less than one's satiety . One should have easy to digest, pleasant to mind and freshly cook ed food. One should consume food comprising of six rasa (tastes). Ayurveda mentions about 6 tastes i.e. Shad-rasa-yukta- aahar [Madhur (Sweet), Amla (Bitter), Kasha ya (Astringent). One should consume food with due respect One should consume food with concentration (Avoid watching T.V. & Talking while eating). Ingest food calmly , neither too slow nor too fast. One should maintain proper hygiene at the culinar y place. One should prefer regional fruits, vegetables, food articles in daily diet regimen. One should practice traditional food processing techniques. Use Iron Utensils preferably for cooking of food except sour food items, garlic etc, if available.Time Quantity Components Mental state during intak e Methods & Place 9Circadian rhythms are biological clocks found in every cell of the body that harmonize the timing of our daily behaviors (e.g., sleep/wak e, feeding/fasting) and physiology (e.g., hormone release, heart function). Changing our mealtime from day to day may distr ess the physiology of the body . Ther efore, consuming food at proper time is impor tant for maintaining circadian rhythms thereby promoting health. Mindful eating habits help to impr ove taste perceptions and proper digestion of ingested food through gut brain axis connections. Thus it is essential to eat with concentration. Seasonal and regional food articles remain fresh, thus taste better and they are also rich in nutrients. Ther efore, eating seasonally cultiv ated regional food items are benecial for health. Traditional household food-processing, preparation methods, utensils (Iron kadhai/tawa) may (Black pepper) etc., as appr opriate, in small quantity while preparing food. It will enhance flavour and aroma and also add therapeutic value to the meal. It will help to optimiz e the digestion so that body will be able to absorb and assimilate the nutrients fr om the foods one eats. It further boosts natural immunity . 10Include Spices in daily diet:Food cooked in non-iron utensil have less iron content as compar ed to food cook ed in iron utensil. Regular intak e of food cooked in iron utensil increases appreciable amount of iron content and preferably food items except garlic, pepper , egg and sour food items etc should be cook ed in iron utensils. Spices are certain food ingredients that have been used as flavoring and coloring agents and as preser vatives for thousands of years. Apar t from this, Spices also possess medicinal proper ties and their use in traditional systems of medicine has been on recor d for a long time. Including spices in food preparation has many health benets like- digestiv e xidant potential, anti-inflammat ory proper ty etc. 11Drink warm water (preferably) daily as per your body 's need. Use Copper utensils for storage of drinking water if possible. Avoid drinking too much water immediately befor e and after meals.Drink water for good healthFrom monotonous food to variety of food Avoid eating the same dishes several times a week. Break out of that rule and experiment with new foods and flavours. Try preparing vegetable or grain you like to eat often, distinctly (saute, steam, boil, roast, or bake), or combine it with other grains, vegetables or herbs for variety . Variety of articles from maximum food groups (Cereals, Pulses, Fruits, Vegetables, Milk & Milk Products) in the diet be incorporated. Non-v egetarian may include Fish, Meat and Meat products as per the requir ement. 12 Oil for cooking Preferably use cold pr essed nonr ened (Kacchi ghani) oil for cooking. Use r egionally a vailable and traditionally used oils for (Mustar Oil).Region specific Millets Apart and Chaaval (Rice), include aata of Jowar (Sorghum), Bajra (Pearl (Finger in diet intermittently . Fruits and Vegetables: Use seasonal fruits and Vegetables available in your region. Gehoon (Wheat), Chaval (Rice), Jowar (Sorghum), Bajra Sanwa Moong (Green (Black Chickpeas), Urad Lentils), Chole (Chickpeas), Hari matar (Green peas), Safed matar (White peas) Phala-Shaka Varga: Lauki (Sorr el Leaves) etc. Include item from Milk group in daily diet, viz, Milk (preference to cow, goat and buffalo), Ghee (Claried butter), Makkhan (Butter), Paneer (Cottage cheese), Chhaach (Buttermilk), Dahi (Curd), Shrikhanda (Sweet dish made of strained curd) etc. (Milk and milk products mixed with any fresh fruit is consider ed as Viruddha anna i.e. incompatible food, hence it should be avoided) If appr opriate, include Maans (Meat), Murgi (Chick en), Anda (Egg), Macchli (Fish) and Kekada (Crabs) in diet (Dry salted sh causes digestive problems hence better to avoid. Pork in excess should be avoided.) Cereals (Anna V arga): Kela (Banana), Khajoor oor (Dried dates), Amla (Fresh and Dried). * Use only region specic seasonal fruitsPulses (Shimbi V arga): Vegetables (Shaka V arga) & foods (Mamsa V arga) Fruits: Fruits y Anaar Sharifa (Custar d Aadoo Ber (Pear) va), (Pomegranate), Chikoo (Sapodilla), (Sweet Kela (Banana), Strawberr Seb (Apple), Amar ood (Gua va) , Mousambi (Sweet Lime), Anaar (Pomegranate), Kela (Banana), Strawberr y etc.Avoid Staying empty stomach for a prolonged period. Avoid eating late at night. Avoid eating preferably within three hours of previously eaten meal or snack. Avoid deserts after food; instead have sweet items at the beginning. Avoid eating Curd at Night. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and carbonated soft drinks, and switch to locally prepar ed healthy , vitality-boosting fruit juices, soups, fresh beverages etc.. Avoid use of non-stick utensils for cooking: Most nonstick pans are coated with polytetrafluor oethylene, also known as Teflon. When exposed to heat, cookwar e becomes a sour ce of perfluor o- octanoic acid (PFO A), which has been linked to a range of health problems including thyroid disease, infertility in women, organ damage and developmental and reproductive problems. Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have also been declar ed as \"likely carcinogens\". Avoid re-heating of food: Reheating may cause loss in nutritional value and often leads to the chemical change in food which may cause food poisoning and food-borne diseases.Dietary Don'ts 15 Women have special dietar y needs during every stage of their life, viz. adolescence, pregnancy , lactation and menopause. Ayurveda emphasiz es on special care to be taken in women 's health at every phase in terms of Rajaswala Parichar ya (Menstrual care), Garbhini parichar ya (Antenatal Sutika Parichar ya (Post-natal care). During pregnancy , the mother 's nutrition bears a great impact on the foetal growth and development. Ayurveda highlights the impor tance of holistic nutrition right from pre-conception to 6 months after delivery for maintenance of healthy pregnancy, offspring and optimal lactation for achie ving requir ed growth and development of the baby. Ayurveda species comprehensive dietary guidelines to be followed during pregnancy . It changes in accor dance with the growth of the foetus in the womb and at the same time ensur es excellent health of the mother . The food taken by a pregnant woman: Nourishes and helps the growth of the fetus. Nourishes the mother 's own body . Nourishes the breasts to facilitate proper lactation. Therefore, Garbhini (Pregnant women) should follow specic dietar y advice during pregnancy . i.e. \"Garbhini Parichar ya\". It will help in reducing risks during pregnancy thereby safeguar ding optimal growth of the foetus.Specific Dietary Recommendations for Pregnant women 1617vThe Ahara (daily diet) of pregnant women should be- pleasant to the mind, it should be preferably liquid to semi solid, sweet and unctuous in nature, (Hridya Dravam Madhura Snigdham Prayam) (Pudding) Chawal (Rice) / Ragi (Finger millet) / Daliy a (Crushed wheat). vCook ed food should include Jeeraka (Cumin seed) , Shunthi (Dry ginger) powder for better digestion and assimilation (Deepaniy am Samskritam) vApar t from routine diet, if possible, Pregnant women should also include milk (minimum 1 glass-200 ml) or Ghee (Under guidance of Ayush Medical Ofcer) in daily regimen as mentioned below-Apart from general dietary recommendations, pregnant women should follow the specific dietary recommendations as mentioned below :18Month Regimen st 1 Month Normal milk (Anupsanskrit kshira ) (Boiled and cooled at room temperatur e) *If milk intolerance, then it is advised to take Laja/ Mudga (Mung bean) Soup 200mL twice or thrice ad ay nd 2 Month Milk medicated by adding herbs like Shata vari (Asparagus racemosus Willd.), Bala Beeja (Sida cordifolia L.). rd 3 Month Milk with Madhu (Hone y) and Ghee (Claried butter) (Milk 200ml with 5 ml Hone y and Ghee 10 ml) *Hone y and claried butter shall be in unequal quantity th 4 Month Kshir Navneet Milk 200 mL with 10g home-made Makkhan (Butter) - extracted from cow milk] OR Milk 200mL with 10 mL of Ghee (claried butter) th 5 Month Ksheer sarpi Milk 200 mL with 10 mL of Ghee twice a day th 6 Month Medicated Ghee (Claried butter processed with herbs) eg.

Yoga can be helpful in maintaining normal health during pregnancy , reduction of maternal stress anxiety , reduction of physical ailments and good foetal outcomes. Meditation facilitates a reduction in maternal stress and thus ensuring healthy growth of foetus. Pregnant W omen should avoid following dietary habitsThe transformation of female, from a woman to a mother is the happiest lifetime event, but this happiness is gained only after undergoing tremendous physical exertion during labour. The women become extremely debilitated physically & mentally after the deliv ery & there are more incidences of backache, weakness etc. Lactation starts from this phase of sutika . Breast milk is the optimal food for almost all infants in the rst year of life. In Ayurveda stany a (Breast milk) is formed from aahar rasa (digested food juice) Ther efore, to revert to the normal body tissues appr oximately to a pre- pregnant state and for successful lactation, apar t from general dietar y rules, lactating mother should follow certain specic dietar y conducts during rst 45 days after the deliv ery. Considering the strength and digestiv e power of Sutika (Recently deliv ered mother), she should take easy to digest, liquid diet like gruels (Yavagu) made up of Chaval soup of Mung bean/gr een gram) with sufcient amount of Ghee/Oil during the rst 7 days. Food of Sutika shall be processed with Deepaniy a dravya like Jeera (Cumin seeds), Maricha (Black peeper), (Dry soup and diet can be practiced.Dietary Recommendations for Lactating Mother 20For maintenance of mother's nutritional status and optimum lactation, traditional recipes (having galact ogogue proper ties) can be used (Methi Laddoo or Shunthi (dry ginger) Laddoo.

It has classied childr en on the basis of diet into 3 categories viz. Ksheerapa (from birth to 1 year) who predominantly breastfeed, Ksheerannada (from age 1-2 year)- who take both breast milk and food and the Annada (abo ve 2 years of age)- who take food similar to an adult. Ayurveda recommends for exclusiv e breastf eeding up to 6 months of age and advises for complimentar y feeding, thereafter (after 6 months) in the form of Annaprashan/Phalaprashana samskara (rst time food/fruit eating ceremony in childr en). Early initiation of breast feeding, exclusiv e breastf eeding, avoiding of the bottle feeding, hygiene and appr opriate complementar y feeding are impor tant factors for the maintenance of the nutritional wellbeing of childr en. 0-6 Months Childr en: Exclusiv e Breast feeding up to the age of 6 months Mother should follow the dietary recommendation as described already , for optimum milk production. In any unavoidable circumstances or in the absence of Mother 's Milk, goat milk or cow milk may be given in appr opriate quantity , without dilution and with proper hygiene. Practice of Abhyanga with sesame/ coconut/ olive oil and Suryadarshan (exposur e to Sun). 6 months- 2 years: Rapidly growing baby needs extra ener gy and caloric food and only breast milk can't sufce this need. Failur e to which may lead to denite nutritional problems. Ther efore-Dietary Recommendations for children 22Breast milk should be continued as a main food along with complimentar y food in the beginning. Minimum three complimentar y foods along with Breast-f eeding and ve complimentar y food in non-br childr en should be given. Phalaprashan and Annaprashan ceremony should be done after completion of 6 months. After 6 months, easy to digest and nutrition rich (Brimhana) complimentar y foods comprising of fruits, liquid, semisolid, and solid food should be given in sequential order by considering digestion (Agnibala) , demand, tolerance of the baby and teeth eruption. Include variety of food articles (diversied) in diet for complimentar y feeding to impr ove micr onutrients status. Various regional foods can be used as complimentar y food kheer , Khichadi etc. 2 -10 years: After two years of age, baby should be given the well-cook ed food prepar ed at home.

During pregnancy , increased maternal iron is needed as a result of the demands of the growing foetus, placenta and expanded maternal blood volume. The developing foetus is entir ely dependent on mother for nutritional requir ements. All iron deliv ered to the baby comes from either maternal iron stores or absorption of iron from the maternal diet.Dietary and Ayush Advisory for Anaemia in pregnancy Increased risk developing perinatal infection Pre-eclampsia Post-par tum Haemorrhage (PPH) Puerperal Maternal deaths Intrauterine gr owth retardation Preterm Bir th Low bir th weight babies Stillbir th and Neonatal DeathImpact of Anaemia on Health Outcomes in pregnancyNearly 50% of pregnant mothers develop anaemia in IndiaKNOW ...?YOUDID 25Major Causes of Anaemia quantity of iron-rich foods and \"iron enhancers\" in the diet. Low bioa vailability of dietar y iron due to gastr ointestinal issues affecting absorption. Increased demand of iron during pregnancy. How to know? Pregnant women with hemoglobin (Hb) concentration less than 11g/dL. Symptoms like fatigue, general weakness, Headaches, loss of appetite, loss of hair, Breathlessness, Pedal Edema, Numbness or a cold feeling in hands and feet, Pale Skin/Lips/Nails etc. Management Iron Deciency Anaemia (IDA) is managed with the supplementation of external iron containing one or the other types of iron salts. Howe ver, it has been repor ted that the long-term treatment of IDA with these drugs is mostly associated with constipation, heart burn, nausea, gastric discomfor t etc. Ther efore, mild to moderate cases can be prevented and effectiv ely managed with dietar y modications and Ayush medicines, as it is a nutritional disor der. 26Mild Anaemia (Hb of 10-10.9 g/dl) (Definition by WHO) Iron supplements are a part of routine antenatal care and management of mild anaemia includes ensuring the deliv ery of supplements in the advised dosage and correction of dietar y factors. As dietar y habits play a critica l role in the development of iron deciency and subsequent development of iron deciency anaemia. Food based appr oaches to increase iron intake through dietary modication/ fortication / diversication and provision of hygienic envir onment are impor tant sustainable strategies for preventing IDA in the general population. Management of anaemia should be based on the gestational age of woman and nutritional status. High dietar y diversity can lead to adequate nutrient intak e and thus help in prevention of nutritional deciency anaemia. Evidences also suggests that intak e of diversied diets is a reliable measur e to assess the micr o- and macr onutrient adequacy of intak es of women of reproductiv e ages. . Dietar y Modication Follow 5 'Rights' of AYURPOSH AN i.e. the right Time, the right Quantity , the right Quality , the right Methods and the right Place. . Food Fortication Include spices in small quantity like Jeera etc. while preparing food. 27Drink milk processed with Shatawari (Asparagus racemosus Shigru (Drumstick) Leaves, Fruits, Powder with milk) in diet. .

Infants, childr en, and adolescents are at particular risk of malnutrition. Optimizing nutrition early in life\u2014including the 1000 days from conception to a child' s second birthda y\u2014ensur es the best possible start in life, with long-term benets. Immediate Causes of Malnutrition Malnutrition is caused by one or more of these factors. Apar t from inadequate food intak e, regular faulty dietar y habits, intak e of non- nutritious food items, unhy gienic conditions, incorr ect Infant & Young Childr en Feeding (IYCF) practices are some of the impor tant preventable causes of malnutrition. These factors are inter dependent. For instance, a child with inadequate & faulty dietar y intak e is more susceptible to diseases, which in turn reduces appetite, inhibits the absorption of food nutrients, and competes for a child' s ener gy. Mal- nutrition Inadequate Food Intak eDiseases 35 Mal- nutritionImpact of Malnutrition on Health Poor physical development, Poor mental growth and impair ed cognitiv e function, Poor school performances, Weakening of the immune system and increased susceptibility to infections, Ill health, and Prone to death due to respirat ory infections and diarrhea. Impact on Productivity Malnutrition negatively influences human productivity- Most malnourished childr en attain low levels of education, affecting their ability and oppor tunities to get good jobs, thus lowering their earning potential. This contributes to poverty by impeding the ability of an individual to live a productiv e life.
