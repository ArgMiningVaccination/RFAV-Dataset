DBH is an integral part of this work group and is sharing its Person -Cente red Planning development; web -based information portal; and care coordination efforts for individuals in need of long-term supportive services. While this service is for all elderly and disabled in need, the majority of the population that it will benefit will be the elderly. Adult Reviews - The Community Services Review (CSR) Unit initiated a targeted review of older adults receiving day rehabilitative treatment that began in July 2015. This population was chosen by DBH Adult Services staff to further e xplore the previous Applied Research and Evaluation (ARE) Unit data analysis findings that indicated older adults are the costliest users of day services. The CSR Unit focused review outcomes may:1) provide answers about the day services utilization cost r elationship for older adults; 2) uncover service needs for this demographic that are not obvious; and 3) inform behavioral health service planning for this population. Preliminary activities included reviewing the literature about older adults with psychia tric illness and day service utilization in order to generate focused questions to supplement the Quality Service Review for an Adult Participant: Field Use Version 1. While 87 consumers were identified only eight (8) met the sampling criteria . The review process involves obtaining their written consent and scheduling interviews with all members of their treatment team and key natural supports. Following the development of narrative reports and data analysis, it is anticipated that a report will be dissemin ated at the end of September 2015.

The next step involved a review of the overall Departmental Day Treatment Service programs. The on - site technical consultation with Dr. Bartels occurred August 22 -23, 2013. The first day involved site visits to the day treatment facilities. On the second day, Dr. Bartels facilitated a meeting with providers to discuss: 1) positive aspects of program service delivery; 2) areas for improvement in program service delivery; and 3) curricula and/or other things that might be helpful for the programs. The day ended with a meeting with the Department Director. The summary of findings included specific observations about each program and a general finding that \" given the short amount of time that these programs have been implemented, the programs have all achieved remarkable (though varied) progress and would benefit from working together to share successes, challenges, and \"lessons learned\". Such a group effort would also be beneficial in working with the Department to c ollaborate in defining clear goals and benchmarks consistent with age - appropriate, high quality integrated rehabilitative services targeting older adults with serious mental illness.\" R.

They include: 1) improved access to mental health services; 2) parent and youth peer support; 3) functional assessment utilizing the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) and the Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale (PECFAS) ; 4) inte gration of behavioral health and primary c are; and 5) reinvestment strategies to promote sustainability . A description of some of the initiatives follows. DC Mental Health Access Project (DC MAP) - DBH awarded a contract to Children's National Health Syste m in March 2015 to support ongoing development of behavioral health screening by primary care providers (pediatricians), that includes the DC MAP mental health consultation project. It provides pediatricians with immediate access to mental health and/or p sychiatric consultation as children/youth are identified as potentially needing behavioral health services. This project supports pediatricians in competently providing behavioral health care within their practice if appropriate or supports the timely link age to the right behavioral health services. The education of primary care providers through the learning collaborative also continues as well as educational presentations within the primary care provider's office. This contract also supports the developme nt of a psychiatric medication monitoring committee to the review children/youth prescribed multiple psychotropic medications. Collaboration Across Grants - The c ollaboration across the three (3) DBH grants (DC Gateway Project SOC grant, State Youth Treatment grant (SYT), and Now is the Time - Healthy Transitions grant (NITT - HT)) continues. The staff from all three (3) grants are District of Columbia Page 29 of 36 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 39 of 23029 actively involved with the youth driven work group developing the Yout h Peer Specialist training program. SYT and NITT -HT staff attend the SOC Management and Implementation/Roundtable meetings and a SYT Transition Age Youth (T AY) Council meeting includes DC Gateway Project staff. This combined advisory council has broad family and youth involvement along with various community organizations. The DC Gateway Project and the NITT Healthy Transitions Grant collaborated with youth Technical Assistance providers and Youth MOVE National to provide a youth \"kick -off\" in January 2015. At the M & I /Roundtable meeting the development of culturally appropriate behavioral health programming for the LG BTQI population was discussed. Now a work group is developing recommendations for serving LBGTQI TAY behavioral health needs and will be repo rting these recommendations to the SYT/TAY Council. CAFAS/PECFAS - The Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) implemented the CAFAS/PECFAS for all children/youth in July 2015. This includes children in out -of- home care (foster care, group settings, psychi atric residential treatment facilities, and supervised return to the biological home), and children/youth who remain in their biological home but are receiving servic es and monitoring through CFSA. The Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) adm inisters the CAFAS when a Notice of Intent to Commit is filed and then administers it every 90 days for all committed youth. It is used in the quarterly Team Decision Making (TDM) meeting to identify needs for the plan of care and illustrate change and im provement over time. The Department of Human Services (DHS) utilizes the CAFAS for all youth actively enrolled in the Parent and Adolescent Support Services (PASS) and in the Alternatives to Court Experience (ACE) diversion program. DHS utilizes the CAFAS data to measure outcomes of both of these short -term programs. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) continues to utilize the CAFAS/PECFAS across all 25 c hild serving providers. Between January 1 and March 20, 2015, 2 ,123 assessments were completed an d from April 1 through June 22 , 2015, 1,952 assessments were done. The CAFAS/PECFAS total score is used to inform the types and quantity of services that are automatically approved for inclusion in the child/youth's plan of care. O. Transition Age Youth Initiatives: Youth and young adult initiatives are coordinated within the DBH Child and Youth Services Division by the Transition Age Youth Coordinator. Now Is The Time (NITT): Healthy Transitions: The purpose of this SAMHSA grant is to develop a system of care for transition age youth (TAY) and young adults. DBH is the lead agency for this initiative to design and implement a transition age youth (TAY) focused system of care in partnership with key District agencies (CFSA, DYRS, DCPS , Department of Employment Services), core service agencies (CSAs), community -based organizations, health care providers, and family and youth networks. This system of care, called the DC Transition Age Youth Initiative, is for ages 16 - 25 with services pr ovided by the DBH CSAs. They will provide TAY specific care planning, wraparound, evidence -based practices and recovery supports, and will employ Transition Specialists specifically trained to diagnose and assess TAY clients and provide customized, individ ual plans of care to successfully transition them to adulthood. The evidence -based and informed practices and recovery supports to be expanded during this initiative include: 1) a combined Transitions to Independence Process (TIP) and Assertive Community T reatment (ACT) program known as TACT; 2) Adolescent Community District of Columbia Page 30 of 36 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 40 of 23030 Reinforcement Approach (A -CRA); 3) Supported Employment; and 4) Supportive Housing. This Initiative will also broaden and improve outreach to, and early identification and screening of, TAY wi th mental health conditions, substance use disorders and co -occurring disorders. Initially the program will target youth, young adults and their families in Wards 7 and 8 (though not to the exclusion of TAY throughout the District) and lessons learned from these wards will be applied as the program systematically expands to other wards. Youth, young adults and their families will inform all aspects of the Initiative including planning, education, outreach and identification, social marketing, and evaluation , and transition age youth will be represented on the key oversight body for the initiative. Transition Age Youth Housing Initiative: On March 26, 2015, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser and Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Brenda Donald opened Wayne Place, a transition age youth transitional housing facility. Wayne Place is the result of a partnership between DBH and the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) to help young men and women between the ages of 18 -24, who might otherwise be ho meless, build the skills they need to be self -sufficient. This initiative include s life skill training for youth and young adults who need support to live independently and succeed. Wayne Place, a complex of six (6) buildings with 22 two -bedroom apartments , provides the opportunity for 44 young people to live at this facility. Half of the beds are being utilized by youth linked to CFSA and half are linked to DBH. As of July 13, 2015, DBH interviewed 34 applicants and approved 20. CFSA reviewed 22 applicants and approved 17. A total of 56 applications were received and 37 (66%) were approved. Also, a total of 34 transition age youth (20 DBH and 14 CFSA) had moved into Wayne Place. This initiative received partial Mental Health Block Grant funding in FY 2015. P. Youth Services Survey for Families (YSS -F): The YSS -F survey gives parents and/or guardians an opportunity to share their perception of services provided to their children and/or adolescents. The DBH FY 2015 YSS -F survey is in the data collection phase th at is expected to be completed by the end of September 2015. The data reported is for the DBH FY 2014 YSS -F survey. The parents/guardians of children/adolescents sample size was 416. The findings are reported across the seven (7) domains. Access to Care - 77% of respondents reported positively about access. Participation in Treatment P lanning - 83% of respondents reported participation in this domain. Cultural Sensitivity of Provider - 93% of respondents reported high cultural sensitivity of staff. Social C onnectedness - 89% of respondents reported positively to this domain. Functioning - 64% of respondents reported positively to this domain. Outcomes - 66% of respondents reported positively about outcomes for their children. Satisfaction with S ervices - 75% of respondents reported positively about general satisfaction for their children. Q. Youth Mental Health First Aid: Primarily designed for adults including family members, caregivers, school staff, health an d human services workers, etc., who work with young people 12 -25, and is also appropriate as a peer support program for older adolescents. The curriculum spans mental health challenges for youth, review of normal adolescent District of Columbia Page 31 of 36 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 41 of 23031 development, and intensive guidance through the action plan for both crisis and non -crisis situations. Topics include anxiety, depression, substance use, disorders in which psychosis may occur, disruptive behavior disorders (including AD/HD), and eating disorders. As of June 2015, DBH and community certified Youth MHF A trainers conducted 18 courses training 459 individuals. The trainee affiliations included: D.C. public and public charter schools, faith -based organizations, universit y, DBH staff and providers, family organizations, District agencies, prevention cente rs, health alliances, housing, services for children with special needs, and community organizations. R. Child and Youth System of Care Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) Funded Projects: Several MHBG projects were impleme nted during FY 2015 that focus on chil dren/ youth and families. Maternal Mental Health Initiative - The Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care, Inc. Maternal Mental Health (MMH) Program goal was to establish a formal MMH program to expand upon the detection, referral and treatment of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) that is already in place at the two (2) clinics in the District. The target population is 1,500 unduplicated pe rinatal patients .

Youth Well -Being Initiative - The One Common Unity Fly By Light: Discover Your True Nature (FB L) Project goal is to address the pervasive culture of psychological and physical violence that surrounds youth in the District. This is achieved by developing high impact programming for youth that provides clear alternatives to violence, increases the se lf-esteem of participants and helps them to lead mentally stable and emotionally balanced lives. The target group is 80 high risk youth, ages 14 -18 that includes students from four (4) high schools whose issues include chronic depression, re -occurring substance use, previous incarceration, foster care, victims of domestic violence, and discrimination based on sexual orientation. Youth and Caregivers Support Initiative - The Fihankra Akoma Ntoaso (FAN) Positive Youth Development (PYD) Alumni and Caregiver Support Programs: Expanding Support for Emotional Health Amongst Teens in Foster Care provide s: 1) targeted case management and structured peer group activities to support the emotional health o f youth and young adults; 2) e xtend s and expand s alumni and ca regiver support services ; and 3) build s a community based resource system that supports enhanced mental health outcomes for young people who might not take advantage of more traditional mental health services. The target group is 25 current or former foste r youth 18 -21 who have graduated from FAN's youth programs; and 25 caregivers of teens currently or formerly in foster care to help these family members better support the emotional health of the youth in their care. V. Behavioral Health Data Summary The Behavioral Health Barometer District of Columbia, 2013 (first edition) is one of a series of state and national reports that provide a snapshot of behavioral health in the United States.

Narrative Question: This step should identify the unmet services needs and critical gaps in the state's current systems, as well as the data sour ces used to identify the needs and gaps of the populations relevant to each block grant within the state's behavioral health system, especially for th ose required populations described in this document and other populations identified by the state as a priority. This step should also add ress how the state plans to meet these unmet service needs and gaps. The state's priorities and goals must be supported by a data -driven process. This could include data and information that are available through the state's unique data system (including community -level data), as well as SAMHSA's data set including, but not limited to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services , the annual State and National Behavioral Health Barometers , and the Uniform Reporting System (URS). Those states that have a State Epidemiological and Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) should describe its composition and contribution to th e process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with SMI and children with SED, as well as the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses, and profiles to establish mental health treatment, substa nce abuse prevention, and substance abuse treatment goals at the state level. In addition, states should obtain and include in their da ta sources information from other state agencies that provide or purchase behavioral health services. This will allow states to have a m ore comprehensive approach to identifying the number of individuals that are receiving behavioral health services and the services they are rec eiving. SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Barometer is intended to provide a snapshot of the state of behavioral health in America. This report presents a set of substance use and mental health indicators measured through two of SAMHSA's populations - and treatment facility -based survey data collection efforts, the NSDUH and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and other relevant data sets. Collected and reported annually, these indicators uniquely position SAMHSA to offer both an overview reflecting the behaviora l health of the nation at a given point in time, as well as a mechanism for tracking change and trends over time. It is hoped that the Nation al and State specific Behavioral Health Barometers will assist states in developing and implementing their block grant programs. SAMHSA will provide each state with its state -specific data for several indicators from the Behavioral Health Barometers . States can use this to compare their data to national data and to focus their efforts and resources on the areas where they need to improve. In addi tion to in -state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available to states through various federal agencies: CMS, the A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and others. Through the Healthy People Initiative18 HHS has identified a broad set of indicators and goals to track and improve the nation's health. By using the indicators included in Healthy People, states can focus their efforts on priority issues, support consistency in me asurement, and use indicators that are being tracked at a national level, enabling better comparability. States should consider this resource in their planning. 18 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 1 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 47 of 230Step Two: Identity the unmet needs and critical gaps within the current system. The three (3 ) initiatives below have been DBH priorities since the Department's inception on October 1, 2013. They require significant planning, system transformation, and development. 1. Health Homes: The District has long recognized the need for more integrated behavioral and physical care to improve the overall health status of individuals with serious mental illness. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the Health Home model as a systems approach to allow providers to coordinate and provide access for behavioral and primary health care to these vulnerable individuals. DBH (formerly DMH) determined that using the Health Home model would best en able the provider system to support these individuals in a sustainable and effective way in the community. The agency expects that implementation of Health Homes will lead to greater overall health and compliance with both behavioral and primary care, whic h will in turn lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits and an overall enhancement in the quality of life. 2. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Services DBH was created from the merger of the District's mental health and addic tion systems (the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Health/Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration/APRA). At that time DOH/APRA had been trying to implement a State Plan Amendment (SPA) approved in 2012 called Adult Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Services (ASARS), which would allow Medicaid reimbursement for certain substance use disorder treatment services. After the merger the decision was made to create new certification standards that would incorporate the requirements of the AS ARS SPA and would also reflect the new American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria and the differing Levels of Care. These changes, as well as aligning the certification application with other programs offered by DBH, will allow a higher quality , more person -centered substance use disorder treatment and recovery system in the District of Columbia. Additionally being able to receive Medicaid reimbursement for most of the treatment services will enable DBH to offer additional recovery support services, which were previously funded through a grant, without interruption in services. 3. Prevention DBH prevention continues discussions with the DBH Children and Youth Division, the service area that has a strong program of school -based education and mental health assessment services for both public and charter schools. DBH substance use prevention services are directed to community settings and do not include support for school -based services. SUD's historical role with school -based initiatives has been to serve on District level advisory committees and provide technical guidance for substance use prevention as part of an overall health and wellness strategy. District of Columbia Page 2 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 48 of 230A second need is to redefine \"evidence -based preventive interventions\" in ways that address SAMHSA requirements but align with the needs of an urban area with culturally diverse populations. DBH prevention plans to address this need through the PFS Evidence -Based Workgroup and subsequently identify a broader mix of preventive interventions that have a plausible connection to the DC EOW data and target outcomes. DBH prevention currently uses the following Center for the Application of Prevention Technology approach to defining \"evidence -based\": \"Strength of evidence is critical to selecting appro aches that are likely to work. But not all evidence -based approaches or interventions are right for communities. Best fit interventions are those approaches or interventions that 1) most clearly impact the substance abuse or related behavioral health probl em in your community and 2) are most appropriate, given the community needs, resources, and readiness to act. DBH prevention began addressing gaps in services for selective and indicated populations. A risk reduction assessment was completed with 500 comm unity -based agencies, parents, and youth to identify barriers, gaps and population needs. Following the assessments, the Department developed and piloted a curriculum . The Department is creating a risk reduction code (pre -engagement) and working with the DC Department of Health Finance with the goal to support evidence -based selective and indicated population services through Medicaid funds. This will also diversify the funding base for prevention. There remains a need to integrate three levels of preven tion outcomes and measures (changes in risk and protective factors, community changes, and behavioral outcomes) in grant and contract Request for Applications and scope of work requirements. This change places greater emphasis on the prevention programs gr ants management process and implementation of the online DIRS system. DBH prevention program grants management staff will have a broader role in FY 2016 and 2017 that includes development of prevention spending plans and tracking fiscal operations. These shifts require strengthening current management and staff roles and responsibilities, developing more detailed process steps and timelines and monitoring measurable data outcome indicators in prevention grant and contract scopes of work. The goal is to mo nitor population -based primary prevention grant progress, address compliance and corrective action if needed. Strengthening grants and contract program management functions will require adding and monitoring baseline outcome indicators in sub -grants (e.g. risk and protective factors, community changes in policies/programs and practices, and behavioral outcomes for District youth). The program grants management and contract function will also oversee grant program management of Partnership for Success sub -recipients including a Proposition 71 Public Education campaign, DC EOW and Evaluation, DC Prevention Center PFS Coordinators, and the High Need Communities Grants. District of Columbia Page 3 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 49 of 230DBH Prevention identified the need to expand and develop the District's prevention workfo rce. DBH is exploring a role in credentialing the prevention workforce and establishing prevention program standards in new Chapter 63 Behavioral Health Standards. In addition, the Department is exploring options for a sustainable workforce capacity buildi ng strategy that includes levels of training, technical assistance and coaching. DBH prevention continues to promote and seek funding for the Prevention Leadership Center as a resource for coordinated and sustainable capacity building services. District of Columbia Page 4 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 50 of 230Planning Steps Quality and Data Collection Readiness Narrative Question: Health surveillance is critical to SAMHSA's ability to develop new models of care to address substance abuse and mental illne ss. SAMHSA provides decision makers, researchers and the general public with enhanced information about the extent of substance abuse an d mental illness, how systems of care are organized and financed, when and how to seek help, and effective models of care, including the outcom es of treatment engagement and recovery. SAMHSA also provides Congress and the nation reports about the use of block grant and other SAMHSA f unding to impact outcomes in critical areas, and is moving toward measures for all programs consistent with SAMHSA's NBHQF . The effort is part of the congressionally mandated National Quality Strategy to assure health care funds - public and private - are used most effectively and efficiently to create better health, better care, and better value. The overarching goals of this effort are to ensure that services are evi dence -based and effective or are appropriately tested as promising or emerging best practices; they are person/family -centered; care is coordinated across systems; services promote healthy living; and, they are safe, accessible, and affordable. SAMHSA is currently working to harmonize data collection efforts across discretionary programs and match relevant NBHQF and N ational Quality Strategy (NQS) measures that are already endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) wherever possible. SAMHSA is al so working to align these measures with other efforts within HHS and relevant health and social programs and to reflect a mix of outcomes, processes, and costs of services. Finally, consistent with the Affordable Care Act and other HHS priorities, these efforts will seek to unde rstand the impact that disparities have on outcomes. For the FY 2016 -2017 Block Grant Application, SAMHSA has begun a transition to a common substance abuse and mental health client -level data (CLD) system. SAMHSA proposes to build upon existing data systems, namely TEDS and the mental health CLD system develope d as part of the Uniform Reporting System. The short -term goal is to coordinate these two systems in a way that focuses on essential data elements and minimizes data collection disruptions. The long -term goal is to develop a more efficient and robust program of data collection about behavioral health services that can be used to evaluate the impact of the block grant program on prevention and treatment services perfo rmance and to inform behavioral health services research and policy. This will include some level of direct reporting on client -level data from states on unique prevention and treatment services purchased under the MHBG and SABG and how these services contribute to overall outcomes. It should be noted that SAMHSA itself does not intend to collect or maintain any personal identifying information on individuals served wi th block grant funding. This effort will also include some facility -level data collection to understand the overall financing and service delivery process on client -level and systems -level outcomes as individuals receiving services become eligible for services that are covered under fee -for-service or capitation systems, which results in encounter reporting. SAMHSA will continue to work with its partners to look at current facility col lection efforts and explore innovative strategies, including survey methods, to gather facility and client level data. The initial draft set of measures developed for the block grant programs can be found at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/quality -metrics/block - grant -measures . These measures are being discussed with states and other stakeholders. To help SAMHSA determine how best to move forward with our partners, each state must identify its current and future capacity to report these measures or measures like them, types of adjustments to current and future state -level data collection efforts necessary to submit the new streamlined performance measures, technical assistance needed to make those adjustments, and perceived or actual barriers to such data collection and reporting. The key to SAMHSA's success in accomplishing tasks associated with data collection for the block grant will be the collaborat ion with SAMHSA's centers and offices, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), the National Assoc iation of State Alcohol Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), and other state and community partners. SAMHSA recognizes the significant implication s of this undertaking for states and for local service providers, and anticipates that the development and implementation process will take several years and will evolve over time. For the FY 2016 -2017 Block Grant Application reporting, achieving these goals will result in a more coordinated behavioral health data collec tion program that complements other existing systems (e.g., Medicaid administrative and billing data systems; and state mental hea lth and substance abuse data systems), ensures consistency in the use of measures that are aligned across various agencies and report ing systems, and provides a more complete understanding of the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services. Both goals can only be achieved through continuous collaboration with and feedback from SAMHSA's state, provider, and practitioner partners. SAMHSA anticipates this movement is consistent with the current state authorities' movement toward system integration and wil l minimize challenges associated with changing operational logistics of data collection and reporting. SAMHSA understands modifications to data collection systems may be necessary to achieve these goals and will work with the states to minimize the impact of these chan ges. States must answer the questions below to help assess readiness for CLD collection described above: Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e. g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels).1. Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients , or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., M edicaid, child welfare, etc.).2.

Please use the box below to indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section: Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 2 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 52 of 230Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e.g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels). The Department has the current capability to generate extensive custom data reports using SSRS (a SQL Server statistics program fully incorporated into DATA). This capability has already been used in FY 2013 to inform strategic planning, monitoring activities and qualit y improvement planning. SSRS is sufficient for the majority of APRA's data needs. There are more sophisticated reports which are beyond the capacity of SSRS to complete and these reports are purchased from FEI (the developer of the DATA System). These repo rts are procured out of the system enhancement budget which is housed under the Organizational Development and Office of Programs and Policy. However, DBH recently implemented a new electronic health record (iCAMS) that allows for clinical documentation, as well as billing. Information can be extracted at the client, program, and provider level. Because not all contracted providers are entering information directly into iCAMS, the data has to be combined in an SQL server data warehouse. Because the data from the previous billing system already resides in this warehouse, this will minimize the recoding needed to continue reporting on CLD. Unlike the previous system, iCAMS allows for historical information to be pulled, so DBH will now be able to report o n status at intake and at discharge (or at the time of reporting). Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients, or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., Medicaid, child welfare, etc.). As a result of the newly implemented health record, iCAMS will now be able to collect data from the SUD and Mental Health data system, as well as Medicaid and other claims based data. Is the state currently able to collect and report measures at the individual client level (that is, by client served, but not with client -identifying information)? Yes, DBH is currently able to collect and report on client level data. DBH used the SUD TEDS and NOMS format in FY14 and FY15 to report client level data out of our previous data system. DBH will continue to report on TEDS and NOMS out of iCAMS. If not, what changes will the state need to make to be ab le to collect and report on these measures? DBH will work to report on more measures than in the past, including status at intake and discharge/time of report, now that iCAMS allows for this history.

The HIV Surveillance Report, Volume 24, will be used to determine the states and jurisdictions that will be required to set -aside 5 percent of their respective FY 2016 SABG allotments to establish one or more projects to provide early intervention services for HIV at the sites at which individuals are receiving SUD treatment services. In FY 2012, SAMHSA developed and disseminated a policy change applicable to the EIS/HIV which provided any state that was a \"designated state\" in any of t he three years prior to the year for which a state is applying for SABG funds with the flexibility to obligate and expend SABG funds for EIS /HIV even though the state does not meet the AIDS case rate threshold for the fiscal year involved. Therefore, any state with an AIDS case rate below 10 or more such cases per 100,000 that meets the criteria described in the 2012 policy guidance would be allowed to obligate and expend FY 2016 SABG funds for EIS/HIV if they chose to do so.

The Health Care System and Integration Narrative Question: Persons with mental illness and persons with substance use disorders are likely to die earlier than those who do not have the se conditions.26 Early mortality is associated with broader health disparities and health equity issues such as socioeconomic status but \"[h]ealth system factors \" such as access to care also play an important role in morbidity and mortality among these populations. Persons with mental illness and substance use disorders may benefit from strategies to control weight, encourage exercise, and properly treat such chronic he alth conditions as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.27 It has been acknowledged that there is a high rate of co - occurring mental illness and substance abuse, with appropriate treatment required for both conditions.28 Overall, America has reduced its heart disease risk based on lessons from a 50 -year research project on the town of Framingham, MA, outside Boston, where researchers followed thousands of residents to help und erstand what causes heart disease. The Framingham Heart Study produced the idea of \"risk factors\" and helped to make many connections for predicting and preventing heart disease. There are five major preventable risks identified in the Framingham Heart Study that may impact people who live with mental i llness. These risks are smoking, obesity, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, and hypertension. These risk factors can be appropriately modified by implementing well - known evidence -based practices29 30 that will ensure a higher quality of life. Currently, 50 states have organizationally consolidated their mental and substance abuse authorities in one fashion or anothe r with additional organizational changes under consideration. More broadly, SAMHSA and its federal partners understand that such factors as education, housing, and nutrition strongly affect the overall health and well -being of persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.31 Specific to children, many children and youth with mental illness and substance use issues are more likely to be seen in a health care se tting than in the specialty mental health and substance abuse system. In addition, children with chronic medical conditions have more than two times the likelihood of having a mental disorder. In the U.S., more than 50 percent of adults with mental illness had symptoms by age 14, and three - fourths by age 24. It is important to address the full range of needs of children, youth and adults through integrated health care approaches across prevention, early identification, treatment, and recovery. It is vital that SMHAs' and SSAs' programming and planning reflect the strong connection between behavioral, physical and pop ulation/public health, with careful consideration to maximizing impact across multiple payers including Medicaid, exchange products, and com mercial coverages. Behavioral health disorders are true physical disorders that often exhibit diagnostic criteria through behavior and patient r eports rather than biomarkers. Fragmented or discontinuous care may result in inadequate diagnosis and treatment of both physical an d behavioral conditions, including co -occurring disorders. For instance, persons receiving behavioral health treatment may be at risk for developing diabetes and experiencing complications if not provided the full range of necessary care.32 In some cases, unrecognized or undertreated physical conditions may exacerbate or cause psychiatric conditions.33 Persons with physical conditions may have unrecognized mental challenges or be at increased risk for such challenges.34 Some patients may seek to self -medicate due to their chronic physical pain or become addicted to prescribed medications or illicit drugs.35 In all these and many other ways, an individual's mental and physical health are inextricably linked and so too must their health care be integrated and coordinated among providers and programs. Health care professionals and consumers of mental illness and substance abuse treatment recognize the need for improved coord ination of care and integration of physical and behavioral health with other health care in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative care settings in the community. For instance, the National Alliance for Mental Illness has published materials for members to assist them in coordinating pediatric mental health and primary care.36 SAMHSA and its partners support integrated care for persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.37 Strategies supported by SAMHSA to foster integration of physical and behavioral health include: developing models for inclusion of behavioral health treatment in primary care; supporting innovative payment and financing strategies and delivery system reforms such as ACOs, health homes, pay for performance, etc.; promoting workforce recruitment, retention and training efforts; improving understanding of financial sust ainability and billing requirements; encouraging collaboration between mental and substance abuse treatment providers, prevention of teen pr egnancy, youth violence, Medicaid programs, and primary care providers such as federally qualified health centers; and sharing with consumer s information about the full range of health and wellness programs. Health information technology, including electronic health records (EHRs) and telehealth are examples of important strategies to promote integrated care.38 Use of EHRs - in full compliance with applicable legal requirements - may allow providers to share information, coordinate care and improve billing practices. Telehealth is another important tool that may allow behavioral health prevention, care, a nd recovery to be conveniently provided in a variety of settings, helping to expand access, improve efficiency, save time and reduce costs. Dev elopment and use of models for coordinated, integrated care such as those found in health homes39 and ACOs40 may be important strategies used by SMHAs and SSAs to foster integrated care. Training and assisting behavioral health providers to redesign or implement new provider billing practices, build capacity for third -party contract negotiations, collaborate with health clinics and other organizations and provider networks, and coordinate benefits among multiple funding sources may be important ways to foster integrated care. SAMHSA encourages SMHAs and SSAs to communicate frequently with stakeholders, including policymakers at the state/jurisdictional and local levels, and State Ment al Health Planning Council members and consumers, about efforts to foster health care coverage, access and integrate care to ensure beneficial o utcomes. District of Columbia Page 1 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 80 of 230The Affordable Care Act is an important part of efforts to ensure access to care and better integrate care. Non-grandfathered health plans sold in the individual or the small group health insurance markets offered coverage for mental and substance use disorders as an esse ntial health benefit. SSAs and SMHAs also may work with Medicaid programs and Insurance Commissioners to encourage development of innovative demonstration projects and waivers that test approaches to providing integrated care for persons with mental illness and subs tance use disorders and other vulnerable populations.41 Ensuring both Medicaid and private insurers provide required preventive benefits also may be an area for collaboration.42 One key population of concern is persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.43 Roughly, 30 percent of dually eligible persons have been diagnosed with a mental illness, more than three times the rate among those who are not dually eligible.44 SMHAs and SSAs also should collaborate with Medicaid, insurers and insurance regulators to develop policies to assist those individuals who exper ience health coverage eligibility changes due to shifts in income and employment.45 Moreover, even with expanded health coverage available through the Marketplace and Medicaid and efforts to ensure parity in health care coverage, persons with behavioral health conditions stil l may experience challenges in some areas in obtaining care for a particular condition or finding a provider.46 SMHAs and SSAs should remain cognizant that health disparities may affect access, health care coverage and integrated care of behavioral health conditions and work with partners to mitigate regional and local variations in services that detrimentally affect access to care and integration. SMHAs and SSAs should ensure access and integrated prevention care and recovery support in all vulnerable populations includi ng, but not limited to college students and transition age youth (especially those at risk of first episodes of mental illness or substan ce abuse); American Indian/Alaskan Natives; ethnic minorities experiencing health behavioral health disparities; military families; and, LGBT individuals. SMHAs and SSAs should discuss with Medicaid and other partners, gaps that may exist in services in the post -Affordable Care Act environment and the best uses of block grant funds to fill such gaps. SMHAs and SSAs should work with Medicaid and other stakeholders to facilitate reimbursement for evidence -based and promising practices.47 It also is important to note CMS has indicated its support for incorporation within Medicaid programs of such approaches as peer support (under the supervision of mental health professionals) and trauma -informed treatment and systems of care. Such practices may play an important role in facilitating integrated, holistic care for adults and children with behavioral health conditions.48 SMHAs and SSAs should work with partners to ensure recruitment of diverse, well -trained staff and promote workforce development and ability to function in an integrated care environment.49 Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, preventionists, therapists, technicians, peer support specialists and others will need to understand integrated care models, concepts and practices. Another key part of integration will be defining performance and outcome measures. Following the Affordable Care Act, the Dep artment of Health and Human Services (HHS) and partners have developed the NQS, which includes information and resources to help promote health, good outcomes and patient engagement. SAMHSA's National Behavioral Health Quality Framework includes core measures that may b e used by providers and payers.50 SAMHSA recognizes that certain jurisdictions receiving block grant funds - including U.S. Territories, tribal entities and those jurisdictions that have signed compacts of free association with the U.S. - may be uniquely impacted by certain Affordable Care Act and Medicaid provisions or ineligible to participate in certain programs.51 However, these jurisdictions should collaborate with federal agencies and their governmental and non-governmental partners to expand access and coverage. Furthermore, the jurisdiction should ensure integration of prevention, treatment and recovery support for persons with, or at risk of, mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Numerous provisions in the Affordable Care Act and other statutes improve the coordination of care for patients through the c reation of health homes, where teams of health care professionals will be charged with coordinating care for patients with chronic conditions. States that have approved Medicaid State Plan Amendments (SPAs) will receive 90 percent Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for healt h home services for eight quarters. At this critical juncture, some states are ending their two years of enhanced FMAP and returning to their regular state FMAP for health home services. In addition, many states may be a year into the implementation of their dual eligible demonstration projects. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the healthcare system and integration within the state's system: Which services in Plan Table 3 of the application will be covered by Medicaid or by QHPs as of January 1, 2016?1.

In a collaborative partnership with the Department of Health (DOH), and its provider network, DBH is piloting the use of care Navigators. This process is responsive to the unique needs of individuals with behavioral health conditions and the challenges to getting and keeping the individuals enrolled. This model, if successful, will be beneficial to our HBx Navigator partnership, and can be rolled out more broadly across the network. The District through its Electronic Health Record (EHR), ICAMS, conducts eligibility and enrollment screenings of all clients entering into treatment programs and a (270/271); which is Medicaid's eligibility screen is done to ensure benefit verification and maximization The District is currently developing a comprehensive inclusion plan for community behavioral health provider participation in the networks of the QHPs. This will include adequate training, TA and assisting its providers in enrolling in the networks. Under the SABG grant, about 311 individuals served are uninsured. This amount is based on the maximum number of clients the block grant is funding for mostly medication management under Opioid treatment services. In 2013, 311 individuals served under the SABG. DBH anticipates serving more individuals CY 2016 and C2017 as the services provided more clients be paid for under the Medicaid State Plan Amendment (SPA) which therefore made available more SABG fund which means more were clients served. These 5 providers represent only a subset of the Department's Substance Use Disorder portfolio of about 40 treatment providers. All of DBH Substance Use Disorder treatment providers are required by DCMR Chapter 63 standards to be Medicaid certified by the appointed timeframes. By May 2016, all of the SUD providers will be Medicaid providers or participating in a QHP. By this date, the recertification process will improve access to care, increase adherence to treatment and follow-up on referrals, increase collaboration among providers, decrease use of unneeded emergency services and develop the integration of individualized care plan.

Health Disparities Narrative Question: In accordance with the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities52, Healthy People, 202053, National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity54, and other HHS and federal policy recommendations, SAMHSA expects block grant dollars to support equity in access, services provided, and behavioral health outcomes among individuals of all cultures and ethnicities. Accordingly, grantees should collect and use data to: (1) identify subpopulations (i.e., racial, ethnic, limited English speaking, tribal, sexual/g ender minority groups, and people living with HIV/AIDS or other chronic diseases/impairments) vulnerable to health disparities and (2) implement str ategies to decrease the disparities in access, service use, and outcomes both within those subpopulations and in comparison to the general popula tion. One strategy for addressing health disparities is use of the recently revised National Standards for Culturally and Linguisticall y Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS standards).55 The Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which the Secretary released in April 2011, outlines goals an d actions that HHS agencies, including SAMHSA, will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Agencies are required to assess the impact of their policies and programs on health disparities. The top Secretarial priority in the Action Plan is to \"[a]ssess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, proces ses, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. HHS leadership will assure that program grantees, as applicable, will be required to submit health disparity impact statements as part of their grant applications. Such statements can inform future HHS investments and policy goals, an d in some instances, could be used to score grant applications if underlying program authority permits.\"56 Collecting appropriate data is a critical part of efforts to reduce health disparities and promote equity. In October 2011, in accordance with section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act, HHS issued final standards on the collection of race, ethnicity, primary language, a nd disability status.57 This guidance conforms to the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive on racial/ethnic categories with the e xpansion of intra-group, detailed data for the Latino and the Asian -American/Pacific Islander populations.58 In addition, SAMHSA and all other HHS agencies have updated their limited English proficiency plans and, accordingly, will expect block grant dollars to support a reduction in disparities related to access, service use, and outcomes that are associated with limited English proficiency. These three de partmental initiatives, along with SAMHSA's and HHS's attention to special service needs and disparities within tribal populations, LGBT populations, and women and girls, provide the foundation for addressing health disparities in the service delivery system. States provide behavioral hea lth services to these individuals with state block grant dollars. While the block grant generally requires the use of evidence -based and promising practices, it is important to note that many of these practices have not been normed on various diverse racial and ethnic populations. States should strive to implement evidence -based and promising practices in a manner that meets the needs of the populations they serve. In the block grant application, states define the population they intend to serve. Within these populations of focus are subp opulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in i nsurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific to that subpopulation. For instance, lack of Spanish primary care services may contribute to a heightened risk for metabolic disorders among Latino adults with SMI; and American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the Ame rican Indian/Alaska Native community. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the block grant, they may be predominant among subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is being ser ved or not being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to implement appropriate outreach and engagement strategie s for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services, and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcome s of care for diverse groups. For states to address the potentially disparate impact of their block grant funded efforts, they will address access, use, and outcomes for subpopulations, which can be defined by the following factors: race, ethnicity, language, gender (including transgender), tribal connection, and sexual orientation (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual). Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the healthcare system and integration within the state's system: Does the state track access or enrollment in services, types of services (including language services) received and outcomes by race, ethnicity, gender, LGBT, and age?1.

The Electronic Health Record (EHR) System identifies and tracks each of these categories and is able to generate reporting as needed for specific programmatic decision-making. DBH has the ability through the EHR to track and document each client's primary language. The largest cohort of non-English speaking clients DBH sees is Spanish-speaking, and contracted with DBH are two adult providers and one youth provider with the capacity to offer services entirely in Spanish. DBH's Assessment and Referral Center currently employs 5 full-time staff members who are fluent in Spanish. Describe the state plan to address and reduce disparities in access, service use and outcomes for the above subpopulation. In accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between DBH and the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), CFSA provides services and family stabilization resources to families and children alleged to be abused and/or neglected through the coordination of public and private partnerships. CFSA personnel conducts screenings on selected cohorts of youth and adults with child welfare involvement using the Global Assessment of Individual Needs Short Screener (GAIN-SS). Those whose screening results indicate that a full assessment is indicated are referred electronically to the appropriate location for a full assessment and, subsequently, treatment services as appropriate. The screening, referral and information sharing processes all take place electronically using the EHR System. The MOA lays out rules and policies regarding access to the EHR System, data sharing, and protections for confidential information and ongoing communication between the two agencies at the administrative level to monitor and improve the quality of coordination. This collaboration reduces disparities for some of the District's most vulnerable residents. CFSA serves residents who are disproportionately low income African-American women, many of whom are single parents, and their children. Those with child welfare involvement are particularly vulnerable to health disparities. The collaboration has already improved the capacity to identify substance use disorders through screening with the GAIN-SS, and the training of CFSA front line staff in Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT). Treatment access has been improved through a dedicated assessor in the Assessment and Referral Center specifically for child welfare-involved clients. This has already had a demonstrable effect in reducing call-to-appointment time at the Center for CFSA-affiliated clients significantly. The Office of Quality Assurance has also undertaken a targeted project to build capacity around HIV education, testing, and case management within the treatment network. Building upon the new internal capacity to conduct HIV testing in the Assessment and Referral Center through the Minority AIDS Initiative, this initiative will provide programs with technical assistance around facilitating access to HIV testing, educating clients in the most current information on HIV and providing effective case management to those who are HIV positive (e.g. linkage to primary and specialty medical care). DBH is also in the process of working with two providers that have agreed to provide services for women with children: SOME and Samaritan Inns. Thea Bowman House for Women and Children is SOME's new inpatient substance abuse treatment program where mothers can get help without being separated from their children. Thea Bowman House provides treatment for up to 14 homeless and low-income mothers, each with one or two children 10 years old or younger. The program also accepts pregnant women. Samaritan Inns Women with Children Program will create a safe home, housing up to 12 women and 16 children, where mothers recovering from substance abuse can receive treatment and family services while establishing a foundation for long-term independent living. Are linguistic disparities/language barriers identified, monitored, and addressed? DBH has the capability through the EHR System to document every client's primary language. This information can be easily aggregated to assess any trends in primary language entering the system. The largest and most specific cohort of non-English speakers DBH sees in the treatment system is Spanish-speakers. DBH currently contracts with three adult providers and one youth provider with the internal capacity to offer services entirely in Spanish. As of this writing, the Assessment Page 1 District of Columbia Page 3 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 87 of 230and Referral Center employs two full-time staff members who are fluent in Spanish. The EHR System also keeps profile information of all provider staff with accounts in the system. Among the EHR System points in this profile is language capacity. Users are required to document which languages they speak and their degree of fluency. This information can be aggregated at will by DBH and clients seeking services at the Assessment and Referral Center, or other DBH intake location, can be matched with programs employing culturally compatible staff. Describe provisions of language assistance services that are made available to clients served in the behavioral health provider system. Clients that enter the behavioral health provider system are provided access to services that are culturally appropriate, including the use of adaptive equipment, sign language, interpreter, or translation services as appropriate. Is there state support for cultural and linguistic competency training for providers? The District provides support for cultural and linguistic competency training through: The DBH Training Institute: Assesses the needs of the network for training Provides training to providers for special needs population The DBH Language line. Included into all DBH contracts, providers must service all non-English speaking and hearing impaired.

Use of Evidence in Purchasing Decisions Narrative Question: There is increased interest in having a better understanding of the evidence that supports the delivery of medical and specia lty care including mental health and substance abuse services. Over the past several years, SAMHSA has received many requests from CMS, HRSA, SM As, state behavioral health authorities, legislators, and others regarding the evidence of various mental and substance abuse preventio n, treatment, and recovery support services. States and other purchasers are requesting information on evidence -based practices or other procedures that result in better health outcomes for individuals and the general population. While the emphasis on evidence -based practices will continue, there is a need to develop and create new interventions and technologies and in turn, to establish the evidence. SAMHSA supports states use of the block grants for this purpose. The NQF and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommend that evidence play a critical role in designin g health and behavioral health benefits for individuals enrolled in commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. To respond to these inquiries and recommendations, SAMHSA has undertaken several activities. Since 2001, SAMHSA has sponsored a National Registry of Evidenced -based Programs and Practices (NREPP). NREPP59 is a voluntary, searchable online registry of more than 220 submitted interventions supporting mental health promotion and treatment and substance abuse prevention and treatment. The purpose of NREPP is to connect members of the public to intervention developers so that they can learn how to implement these approaches in their co mmunities. NREPP is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of all evidence -based practices in existence. SAMHSA reviewed and analyzed the current evidence for a wide range of interventions for individuals with mental illness and s ubstance use disorders, including youth and adults with chronic addiction disorders, adults with SMI, and children and youth with (SED). The evidence builds on the evidence and consensus standards that have been developed in many national reports over the last decade or more. These include reports by the Surgeon General60, The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health61, the IOM62, and the NQF.63 The activity included a systematic assessment of the current research findings for the effectiveness of the services using a strict set of evidentiar y standards. This series of assessments was published in \"Psychiatry Online.\"64 SAMHSA and other federal partners (the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR), and CMS) have used this information to sponsor technical expert panels that provide spe cific recommendations to the behavioral health field regarding what the evidence indicates works and for whom, identify specific st rategies for embedding these practices in provider organizations, and recommend additional service research. In addition to evidence -based practices, there are also many promising practices in various stages of development. These are services that have not been studied, but anecdotal evidence and program specific data indicate that they are effective. As these practices conti nue to be evaluated, the evidence is collected to establish their efficacy and to advance the knowledge of the field. SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs)65 are best practice guidelines for the treatment of substance abuse. The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to p roduce the TIPs, which are distributed to a growing number of facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPs is expanding beyond public and private substance abuse treatment facilities as alcohol and other drug disorders are increasingly recognized as a major p roblem. SAMHSA's Evidence -Based Practice Knowledge Informing Transformation (KIT)66 was developed to help move the latest information available on effective behavioral health practices into community -based service delivery. States, communities, administrators, practitioners, consumers of mental health care, and their family members can use KIT to design and implement behavioral health practices that work. KIT, part of SAMHSA's priority initiative on Behavioral Health Workforce in Primary and Specialty Care Settings, covers getting started, building t he program, training frontline staff, and evaluating the program. The KITs contain information sheets, introductory videos, practice demonstration videos, and training manuals. Each KIT outlines the essential components of the evidence -based practice and provides suggestions collected from those who have successfully implemented them. SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or s upporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers' decisions regarding mental health and substance abuse services . Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: Describe the specific staff responsible for tracking and disseminating information regarding evidence -based or promising practices. 1. How is information used regarding evidence -based or promising practices in your purchasing or policy decisions? 2.

Through the collaborative work of APRA's Divisions of Prevention, Treatment, Recovery, and Performance Improvement evidence -based and promising practices are tracked, vetted, disseminated, and implemented. The Divisions collectively recommend Evidence Based Practices for Substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery that are emerging at the national level which are determined to be best practices for the local demographic. The Divisions work closely together to continuously improve the quality of services under their purview. The Divisions generate status reports that disseminate information regarding formularies of evidence based practices, and recommend trainings, provide technical assistance and guidance, and construct policy according to best practices for substance abuse standards. All providers that the District purchases services from are required to utilize interventions that are registered or approved by SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices (NREPP). All Substance Abuse treatment and recovery programs are required to be certified through APRA's Certification and Regulation Division (CRD), including private, non-contracted substance abuse treatment and recovery programs. In conjunction with the Office of Quality Assurance and the Treatment Division, the District's training department seeks promising practices and evidence based practices and makes this information available to the provider network. 2) Did you use information regarding evidence -based or promising practices in your purchasing or policy decisions? a) What information did you use? b) What information was most useful? The District requires by policy and per contract that all substance abuse treatment providers implement evidence based practice that is registered or approved by SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices (NREPP). For the adult treatment system, the District does not specify which EBP that a treatment provider must use. The District, however, will only purchase services that adhere to an EBP. Adult substance abuse treatment providers within the network must use an evidence based screening and assessment tool. Currently, the District is using the Global Assessment of Individual Need - Short Screener (GAIN-SS) for both the adult and adolescent system. The District uses the Treatment Assignment Protocol (TAP) as the standardized assessment tool for level of care (LOC) assessment using the American Society for Addictions Medicine's Patient Placement Criteria (ASAM). The District requires the adolescent system to use the GAIN-I as the standard evidence based assessment tool for substance use disorders. The most useful resources the District relies on when gathering EBP information is the NREPP website. Our State Subject Matter Experts utilized various aspects of the information on the website such as EBP reviews, summaries, and effectiveness measures. This information helps direct our Quality Assurance process, treatment outcome expectatio ns, and training needs. APRA Division of Prevention base information for identifying Evidence-Based Program (strategies) is from federal databases, the Institute of Medicine 's Preventing Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders Among Young People, SAMHSA's Leading Change plan, Center for Disease Control s and the Society of Prevention Research. EBP's that address the unique needs of an urban environment and culturally diverse populations are integrated into APRA Prevention Request for Applications as requirements. This information guided the development of four DC Prevention Centers in 2010. The Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant is the catalyst for pilot strategies that are funded and evaluated to determine long term r utility in the District of Columbia. Pilot projects include: four Parent Partnership Grants for selective and indicated populations; 7 Community Evidence -Based Prevention Grants; four CORE Coordinators to assess the need for I Prevention across the 8 wards; and a Synthetic Marijuana public awareness and community action initiati ve.

As stated in the previous question, the District uses EBP reviews, summaries, and effectiveness measures to direct our Quality Assurance process, treatment outcome expectations, and training needs. APRA is the clearinghouse for our State Medicaid Program. The District demonstrates the thoughtfulness of purchasing treatment services by designing our State Plan Amendment (the District plan to pay for substance abuse services through Medicaid) to compliment a variety of services implemented in several EBP's. Acting as the clearinghouse, APRA ensures that treatment funds spent for substance abuse treatment, both federal and local dollars, are only spent on services that are implemented under an evidence based practice. APRA plans to use evaluation data from the Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant to make decisions on leveraging using Medicaid funds for evidence -based universal, selective, and indicated prevention strategies.

Prevention for Serious Mental Illness Narrative Question: SMIs such as schizophrenia, psychotic mood disorders, bipolar disorders and others produce significant psychosocial and econo mic challenges. Prior to the first episode, a large majority of individuals with psychotic illnesses display sub -threshold or early signs of psychosis during adolescence and transition to adulthood.67 The \"Prodromal Period \" is the time during which a disease process has begun but has not yet clinically manifested. In the case of psychotic disorders, this is often described as a prolonged period of attenuated and nonspecific thought, mood, and perceptual disturbances accompanied by poor psychosocial functioning, which has historically been identified retros pectively. Clinical High Risk (CHR) or At -Risk Mental State (ARMS) are prospective terms used to identify individuals who might be potentially in the prodromal phase of psychosis. While the MHBG must be directed toward adults with SMI or children with SED, including early intervention after the first psychiatric episode, states may want to consider using other funds for these emerging practices. There has been increasing neurobiological and clinical research examining the period before the first psychotic episode in or der to understand and develop interventions to prevent the first episode. There is a growing body of evidence supporting preemptive interventions that are successful in preventing the first episode of psychosis. The National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) funded the North Ame rican Prodromal Longitudinal study (NAPLS), which is a consortium of eight research groups that have been working to create the evidence base for early detection and intervention for prodromal symptoms. Additionally, the Early Detection and Intervention for the Prevention of Psychosis (EDIPP) program, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, successfully broadened the Portland Identification and Early Referral (PIER) program from Portland, Maine, to five other sites across the country. SAMHSA supports the development and implementation of these promising practices for the early detection and intervention of individuals at Clinical High Risk for psychosis, and states may want to consider how these developing practices may fit within their system of care. Without intervention, the transition rate to psychosis for these individuals is 18 percent after 6 months of follow up, 22 percent after one year, 29 percent after two years, and 36 percent after three years. With in tervention, the risk of transition to psychosis is reduced by 54 percent at a one -year follow up.68 In addition to increased symptom severity and poorer functioning, lower employment rates and higher rates of substance use and overall greater disability rates are more prevalent.69 The array of services that have been shown to be successful in preventing the first episode of psychosis include accurate clinical identification of hig h-risk individuals; continued monitoring and appraisal of psychotic and mood symptoms and identification; intervention for substance use, suicida lity and high support; and psychotherapeutic techniques.70 71 This reflects the critical importance of early identification and intervention as there is a high cost associated with delayed treatment. Overall, the goal of early identification and treatment of young people at high clinical risk, or in the early stages of ment al disorders with psychosis is to: (1) alter the course of the illness; (2) reduce disability; and, (3) maximize recovery. ****It is important to note that while a state may use state or other funding for these services, the MHBG funds must be dire cted toward adults with SMI or children with SED.

These services include: 1) Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement Program (comprehensive services to children and families that focus on supporting cognition, language, motor skills, adaptive skills and social emotional functioning; 2) Healthy Start Project (addresses the medical and mental health challenges of women of childbearing age to reduce infant mortality by improving the emotional, mental and physical health of pre- and postnatal women); 3) Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation Program - Healthy Futures (center-based and child and family-centered consultation services to the staff and family members at child development centers); 4) Primary Project (evidence-based, early intervention/prevention program for identified children in Pre-kindergarten through 3rd grade who have mild problems with social-emotional adjustment in the classroom); and 5) School Mental Health Program (addresses psycho-social and mental health problems that become barriers to learning by providing prevention, early intervention, and treatment services to youth, families, teachers and school staff). Also, the child and youth services program implements a number of evidence-based practices. They include: Child Parent Psychotherapy for Family Violence- for ages 0-6 with a history of trauma exposure or maltreatment and their caregivers; 2) Trauma Systems Therapy- for ages 0-19 who have experienced traumatic events and/or who live in environments with ongoing traumatic stress; 3) Parent Child Interaction Therapy- for ages 2-6 who experience extreme behavioral difficulties with emphasis on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship and changing parent-child interaction patterns; 4) Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy- for ages 4-18 and helps children, youth, and their parents overcome the negative effects of traumatic life events and address feelings; 5) Multi-Systemic Therapy- for ages 10-17 with emphasis on empowering parents/caregivers effectiveness as they assist the child/youth in successfully making and sustaining changes in individual, family, peer and school systems; 6) Multi-Systemic Therapy for Youth with Problem Sexual Behavior- for ages 10-17 and is an intensive family and community based program that addresses factors that influence problem sexual behavior, focusing on the offender's home/family, school, neighborhood and peers; and 7) Transition to Independence Process- an evidence supported model for ages 14-29 that also engages their families and other informal key players in a process that facilitates their movement towards greater self-sufficiency and successful achievement of their goals.

NIMH has released information on Components of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for First Episode Psychosis. Results from the NIMH funded Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative73, a research project of the NIMH, suggest that mental health providers across multiple disciplines can learn the principles of CSC for First Episode of Psychosis (FEP), and apply these skills to engage and treat persons in the e arly stages of psychotic illness. At its core, CSC is a collaborative, recovery -oriented approach involving clients, treatment team members, and when appropriate, relatives, as active participants. The CSC components emphasize outreach, low -dosage medications, evidenced -based supported employment and supported education, case management, and family psycho -education. It also emphasizes shared decision -making as a means to address individuals' with FEP unique needs, preferences, and recovery goals. Collaborative treatment planning in CSC is a respectful and effective means for establishing a positive therapeutic alliance and maintaining engagement with clients and their family members over time. Peer supports can also be an enhancement on this model. Many also braid funding from several sources to expand service capacity. States can implement models across a continuum that have demonstrated efficacy, including the range of services and principle s identified by NIMH. Using these principles, regardless of the amount of investment, and with leveraging funds through inclusion of services reimb ursed by Medicaid or private insurance, every state will be able to begin to move their system toward earlier intervention, or enhance the services already being implemented. It is expected that the states' capacity to implement this programming will vary based on the actual funding from the five pe rcent allocation. SAMHSA continues to provide additional technical assistance and guidance on the expectations for data collection and reportin g. Please provide the following information, updating the State's 5% set -aside plan for early intervention: An updated description of the states chosen evidence -based practice for early intervention (5% set -aside initiative) that was approved in its 2014 plan.1.

SAMHSA increased the state's Mental Health Block Grants by 5% to provide funds for this initiative. The Model: The District of Columbia Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) used an existing service delivery program that combines the Transition to Independence (TIP) model (an evidence supported model) with the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model for transition aged youth and young adults (an evidence-based practice), which is called the TACT Program. The Providers: There are two (2) DBH mental health rehabilitation services (MHRS) providers, Community Connections and Family Preservation Services of DC that operate TACT Programs. The Target Population: The target population is youth and young adults age 18-29 served by the two (2) TACT Programs. The Budget: The amount of funds available to the District from the SAMHSA Mental Health Block Grant for evidence-based projects for early intervention (5% set-aside) was $46,696.00. The Planned Activities: The primary activities include: 1) a focus group with TIP and TACT programs; 2) first psychosis episode and related training; and 3) a pilot study with the two (2) TACT programs. Focus Group: DBH program staff decided to convene a focus group with the providers in lieu of conducting a survey (the original plan). The purpose of the focus group with the TIP and TACT Programs was to obtain information about services and supports including non-traditional and person-centered services that would enhance successful implementation of these program models and the lives of the youth and young adults served. This activity was convened on August 15, 2014 at the DBH Child and Youth Services Division (CYSD) community site. The co-facilitators were the designated CYSD Program Manager for this initiative and the Program Manager for the Mental Health Block Grant. The discussion topics included: 1) traditional services and supports provided and those most utilized by transition age youth (TAY); 2) non-traditional services and supports provided and those most utilized by TAY; 3) non-traditional services and supports the agencies would like to provide TAY but are not currently available; 4) non-traditional services and supports not currently available that TAY have requested; 5) non-traditional services and supports available through community or other resources that are needed and/or TAY have requested; 6) partnerships developed to access some of the non-traditional services and supports that are available; 7) methods used to routinely assess TAY level of satisfaction with the services and supports provided; 8) methods routinely used to obtain input from TAY about improving the services and supports provided; 9) access to person-centered funding for TAY and the funding priorities; and 10) process to confirm that TAY agree with agency priorities. The focus group discussions generated important ideas and issues that were summarized. First Psychosis Episode Training: DBH partnered with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to provide a first episode psychosis (FEP) educational and training event for Department staff, consumers/clients, providers and other community partners. On November 10, 2014 Drs. Amy B. Goldstein and Susan T. Azrin from NIMH conducted a presentation on Prevention and Early Intervention of Psychosis: Lessons Learned from the NIMH RAISE Project. The presentation topics included: 1) schizophrenia overview; 2) rationale for early intervention in psychosis; 3) NIMH Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative; 4) Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) model; 5) financing CSC programs; and 6) next steps. The presentation was quite informative and well received. The event was attended by 52 individuals. Social Workers and Addiction Counselors received continuing education units. DBH staff also participated in a series of webinars on FEP and related topics.

The project activities involve: 1) developing a project report that includes a participant profile (onset of FEP and/or other mental health disorders, behavioral and social characteristics); 2) including peer input into the project through focus groups, other forms or activities; and 3) providing project participants with traditional and non-traditional supports, opportunities and experiences that enhance positive growth and development. The projects are underway and will be completed at the end of September 2015. Other Related Initiatives: DBH is involved in two (2) other initiatives related to the pilot study that are described below. National Council Community of Practice (CoP) on Early Onset Schizophrenia (EOS)- DBH was accepted into the National Council's CoP on EOS in February 2015 and joined the National Council in early March 2015. The DBH/DC team completed a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify opportunities and barriers to the development of a strategic plan for the implementation of early intervention services in late March 2015. The team has attended all learning opportunities, including the monthly mandatory webinars and one-on-one office hours calls with early onset experts. The DBH/DC team recently partnered with the Washington Community Mental Health Council (another member of the CoP on EOS) to begin peer-to-peer calls focusing on the development of a strategic planning tool that will help each team build capacity and knowledge about first episode psychosis that will ultimately result in more funding from our respective state/District legislatures. Develop RAISE-like or Other Program- Inspired by the RA1SE project, DBH set out to develop a local program for early onset schizophrenia. In December 2014, DBH reached out to community partners who share this interest. By January 2015, a working group was created that now includes representatives from the Green Door, Psychiatric Institute of Washington, Children's National Health System, the District's Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), and DBH. This group has been reviewing prodromal schizophrenia and first episode psychosis initiatives across the country, with the intention of tailoring a program that best meets the needs of the District's at-risk population. The DBH/DC team has reached out to core services agencies (CSAs) and local hospitals in search of a clinical home for an EOS program. The current and planned activities include: 1) the Green Door and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) have agreed to pool resources and house the program between their sites; 2) the Green Door and PIW are currently conducting internal needs assessments to determine the amount of start-up money required to bring in requisite staffing, training, and possibly architectural changes to launch a RA1SE-inspired EOS program; 3) upon completion of the needs assessment, the DBH/DC team will seek the start-up money through a Block Grant; and 4) DBH has also begun to receive technical assistance from SAMHSA on identifying funding mechanisms for Page 2 District of Columbia Page 3 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 98 of EOS program services. Technical Assistance through SAMHSA- In May 2015, DBH developed a technical assistance request through the SAMHSA TA Tracker to support its collaboration with public and private community partners in developing an Early Onset Schizophrenia initiative. Specifically, this partnership would most benefit from technical assistance in identifying viable mechanisms for funding and financially sustaining this initiative in the District. The TA request was approved in June 2015. There have been follow-up discussions with the SAMHSA contractor and the DBH/DC team about the best way to proceed. The DBH/DC team is trying to determine the model that will be implemented. The goals and outcomes that the DBH/DC team would like to achieve as a result of the technical assistance include: Goal 1: Assess the current status of the Early Onset Schizophrenia initiative financing and sustainability strategies nationwide. Outcome: The DBH/DC team will identify the strategies that can be successfully implemented in the District. Goal 2: Assess the pros and cons of public-private partnerships in financing and sustaining Early Onset Schizophrenia initiatives. Outcome: The DBH/DC team will run a cost-benefit analysis of partnering in the up-front and ongoing financial support of a local Early Onset Schizophrenia initiative. Goal 3: Assess the extent to which Early Onset Schizophrenia services are Medicaid reimbursable in other cities/states. Outcome: All Medicaid reimbursable services will be appropriately billed.

Participant Directed Care Narrative Question: As states implement policies that support self -determination and improve person -centered service delivery, one option that states may consider is the role that vouchers may play in their overall financing strategy. Many states have implemented voucher and self -directed care programs to help individuals gain increased access to care and to enable individuals to play a more significant role in the development o f their prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The major goal of a voucher program is to ensure individuals have a genuine, free, and inde pendent choice among a network of eligible providers. The implementation of a voucher program expands mental and substance use disorder trea tment capacity and promotes choice among clinical treatment and recovery support providers, providing individuals with the ability to secure the best treatment options available to meet their specific needs. A voucher program facilitates linking clinical treatment with other authorized services, such as critical recovery support services that are not otherwise reimbursed, including coordination, childcare, motivational development, early/brief intervention, outpatient treatment, medical services, support for room and board while in treatment, employment/e ducation support, peer resources, family/parenting services, or transportation. Voucher programs employ an indirect payment method with the voucher expended for the services of the individual's choosing or at a provider of their choice. States may use SABG and MHBG funds to introduce or enhance behavioral health voucher and self -directed care programs within the state. The state should assess the geographic, population, and service needs to determine if or where the voucher system will be mos t effective. In the system of care created through voucher programs, treatment staff, recovery support service providers, and referral org anizations work together to integrate services. States interested in using a voucher system should create or maintain a voucher management system to support vouchering and t he reporting of data to enhance accountability by measuring outcomes. Meeting these voucher program challenges by creating and coordinating a wide array of service providers, and leading them though the innovations and inherent system change processes, results in the buil ding of an integrated system that provides holistic care to individuals recovering from mental and substance use disorders. Likewise, every effort should be made to ensure services are reimbursed through other public and private resources, as applicable and in ways consistent with the goals of the voucher program Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Participant Directed Care The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) Person-Centered Project was initially launched in FY 2012 and continues to grow. The goal has been to provide a recovery -oriented and person-centered approach to care by supporti ng person-centered assessment and treatment planning throughout the system. The initial phase included assembling a person-centered committee of peers and representatives from DBH and community behavioral health provider agencies to plan a comprehens ive launch strategy. Additional accomplishments included partnering with Diane Grieder and Neal Adams, national experts in person-centered care and authors of \"Treatment Planning for Person-Centered Care,\" the development of person-centered practice guidelines and the delivery of person-centered instructor training to the entire DBH provider network. As of June 2015, more than 4,500 classroom attendees were trained in behavioral health concepts, and over 7,500 continuing education contact hours were awarded to over 1,000 licensed attendees.

Program Integrity Narrative Question: SAMHSA has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that block grant funds are expended in a manner consistent with the statutory and regulatory framework. This requires that SAMHSA and the states have a strong approach to assuring program integrity. Currently, the primary goals of SAMHSA program integrity efforts are to promote the proper expenditure of block grant funds, improve block grant program compliance nationally, and demonstrate the effective use of block grant funds. While some states have indicated an interest in using block grant funds for individual co -pays deductibles and other types of co -insurance for behavioral health services, SAMHSA reminds states of restrictions on the use of block grant funds outlined in 42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 300x -5 and 300x -31, including cash payments to intended recipients of health services and providing financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity. Under 42 USC \u00a7 300x - 55, SAMHSA periodically conducts site visits to MHBG and SABG grantees to evaluate program and fiscal management. States will need to develop specific policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the funding requirements. Since MHBG funds can only be used for authorized services to adults with SMI and children with SED and SABG funds can only be used for individuals with or at risk for substance abuse, SAMSHA will release guidance imminently to the states on use of block grant funds for these purposes. States are encouraged to review the guidance and request any needed technical assistance to assure the appropriate use of suc h funds. The Affordable Care Act may offer additional health coverage options for persons with behavioral health conditions and block grant expenditures should reflect these coverage options. The MHBG and SABG resources are to be used to support, not supplant, individuals and services that will be covered through the Marketplaces and Medicaid. SAMHSA will provide additional guidance to the states to assist them in complying with program integrity recommendations; develop new and better tools for reviewing the block grant application and reports; and train SAMHSA staff, including Regional Administrators, in these new program integrity approaches and tools. In addition, SAMHSA will work with CMS and states to discuss possible strategies for sharing data, protocols, and information to assist our program integri ty efforts. Data collection, analysis and reporting will help to ensure that MHBG and SABG funds are allocated to support evidence -based, culturally competent programs, substance abuse programs, and activities for adults with SMI and children with SED. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for behavioral health services funded by the SA BG and MHBG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. These strategies may include :(1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to ensure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including essential health benefits ( EHBs) as per the state benchmark plan; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered mental health and substance abuse benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of substance abuse and mental health services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical informat ion; and (4) monitoring use of behavioral health benefits in light of utilization review, medical necessity, etc. Consequently, states may have to reevaluate their current management and oversight strategies to accommodate the new priorities. They may also be required to become more proactive in ensuring that state -funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible t o enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibili ty and enrollment. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Does the state have a program integrity plan regarding the SABG and MHBG funds?1. Does the state have a specific policy and/or procedure for assuring that the federal program requirements are conveyed to int ermediaries and providers?2. Describe the program integrity activities the state employs for monitoring the appropriate use of block grant funds and overs ight practices: 3. Budget review;a. Claims/payment encounter/use/performance analysis data; ande. Audits.f. Describe payment methods, used to ensure the disbursement of funds are reasonable and appropriate for the type and quantity o f services delivered. 4. Does the state provide assistance to providers in adopting practices that promote compliance with program requirements, inclu ding quality and safety standards?5. How does the state ensure block grant funds and state dollars are used for the four purposes?6.

Mayor's Office of Partnerships and Grant Services (OPGS): This Office serves as the District government's grants clearinghouse in order to effectively administer mandatory policies and procedures that govern the solicitation of competitive grant funds among District agency grant seekers and their prospective grantees and/or sub-grantees. The City-Wide Grants Manual and Source Book establishes best practices policies and procedures for the application for, acceptance of, and disbursement of private, federal and local grant funds. The Sourcebook also provides an overview of the minimum requirements for the programmatic and financial operation of grants and sub-grants awarded by the District and any of its covered agencies. Department of Behavioral (DBH) Health Policy 716.6 Screening for Eligibility to Participate in Federal Health Care Programs and to Contract with the District of Columbia Government: The Department will not contract with or employ individuals or entities that are ineligible to participate in federal health care programs or are ineligible to contract with the government of the District of Columbia. Section 4d. Exclusion List contains three (3) lists that provide information on any individual or entity excluded from participation in any federal health care program or from contracting with the District of Columbia. They include: 1) the List of Excluded of Individuals/Entities (LEIE) database maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Inspector General, (OIG) of individuals or entities excluded by the OIG; 2) the General Services Administration (GSA) Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), which contains debarment actions taken by various Federal agencies, including exclusion actions taken by the OIG; and 3) the District of Columbia Excluded Party List maintained by the District's Debarment and Suspension Panel. The Mental Health Block Grant sub-grantee organizations are screened against these lists. SAPT- Block Grant DBH and Sub-Grantee Awards: The process begins with the notice of funding availability (NOFA) and request for applications (RFA) announcement, which widely distributed and follows the OPGS and Sourcebook requirements. The proposals are reviewed that will include the DBH Behavioral Health Council input. The review panel recommendations are forwarded to the DBH Director for review and final approval. DBH SAPT- Block Grant Program and Fiscal Monitoring: The fiscal grant monitors conduct an orientation that addresses issues related to: 1) use of grant funds; 2) administrative requirements; 3) board of directors; 4) audits; 5) reporting requirements; 6) fund disbursement plan; 7) advance invoice submission; 8) expenditure report submission; 9) allowable and unallowable costs; 10) food costs; 11) travel procedures; 12) budget modifications; 13) interest checks; and 14) program close-out. They also collect fiscal information from the sub-grantees, enter the financial information into the DBH financial management system, monitor fiscal activity and reporting, and conduct payment processing. The Mental Health Block Grant Program Manager oversees the programmatic aspects of the DBH programs and sub-grantee awards. This includes: 1) review and approve the sub-grantee progress and other reports; 2) review and approve sub-grantee requests for program and budget modifications prior to implementing the proposed changes; 2) review the Mental Health Block Grant weekly expenditure report; and 3) work with the sub-grantee and fiscal monitors to resolve any issues related to the project.

Tribes Narrative Question: The federal government has a unique obligation to help improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the various health and human services programs administered by HHS. Treaties, federal legislation, regulations, executive orders, and Presidenti al memoranda support and define the relationship of the federal government with federally recognized tribes, which is derived from the pol itical and legal relationship that Indian tribes have with the federal government and is not based upon race. SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation74 to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Improving the health and well -being of tribal nations is contingent upon understanding their specific needs. Tribal consultation is an essential tool in achieving that understanding. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision -making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. In the context of the block grant funds awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government -to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off t ribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees and by the highest possibl e state officials. As states administer health and human services programs that are supported with federal funding, it is imperative that they cons ult with tribes to ensure the programs meet the needs of the tribes in the state. In addition to general stakeholder consultation, states should establish, implement, and document a process for consultation with the federally recognized tribal governments located within or governi ng tribal lands within their borders to solicit their input during the block grant planning process. Evidence that these actions have been pe rformed by the state should be reflected throughout the state's plan. Additionally, it is important to note that 67% of American Indian and Alaska Natives live off - reservation. SSAs/SMHAs and tribes should collaborate to ensure access and culturally competent care for all American Indians and Alaska Natives in the state. States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or for services to be provided for tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should make a declarative statement to that effect. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Describe how the state has consulted with tribes in the state and how any concerns were addressed in the block grant plan. 1. Describe current activities between the state, tribes and tribal populations.2.

Primary Prevention for Substance Abuse Narrative Question: Federal law requires that states spend no less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention programs, althou gh many states spend more. Primary prevention programs, practices, and strategies are directed at individuals who have not been determined to require treatment for substance abuse. Federal regulation (45 CFR 96.125) requires states to use the primary prevention set -aside of the SABG to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub -groups that are at high risk for substance abuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: Information Dissemination provides knowledge and increases awareness of the nature and extent of alcohol and other drug use, abuse, and addiction, as well as their effects on individuals, families, and communities. It also provides knowledge and increases awareness of available prevention and treatment programs and services. It is characterized by one -way communication from the information source to the audience, with limited contact between the two. Education builds skills through structured learning processes. Critical life and social skills include decision making, peer resistance, coping with stress, problem solving, interpersonal communication, and systematic and judgmental capabilities. There is more interaction between facilitators and participants than there is for information dissemination. Alternatives provide opportunities for target populations to participate in activities that exclude alcohol and other drugs. The purpose is to discourage use of alcohol and other drugs by providing alternative, healthy activities. Problem Identification and Referral aims to identify individuals who have indulged in illegal or age -inappropriate use of tobacco, alcohol or other substances legal for adults, and individuals who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs. The goal i s to assess if their behavior can be reversed through education. This strategy does not include any activity designed to determine if a person is in need of treatment. Community -based Process provides ongoing networking activities and technical assistance to community groups or agencies. It encompasses neighborhood -based, grassroots empowerment models using action planning and collaborative systems planning Environmental Strategies establish or changes written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes. The intent is to influence the general population's use of alcohol and other drugs. States should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk. Specifically, prevention str ategies can be classified using the IOM Model of Universal, Selective, and Indicated, which classifies preventive interventions by targeted population. The definitions for these population classifications are: Universal: The general public or a whole population group that has not been identified based on individual risk. Selective: Individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing a disorder is significantly higher than average. Indicated: Individuals in high -risk environments that have minimal but detectable signs or symptoms foreshadowing disorder or have biological markers indicating predispositions for disorder but do not yet meet diagnostic levels. It is important to note that classifications of preventive interventions by strategy and by IOM category are not mutually exc lusive, as strategy classification indicates the type of activity while IOM classification indicates the populations served by the activity. Federal regulation requires states to use prevention set -aside funding to implement substance abuse prevention interventions in all six strategies. SAMHSA also recommends that prevention set -aside funding be used to target populations with all levels of risk: universal, indicated, and selective populations. While the primary prevention set -aside of the SABG must be used only for primary substance abuse prevention activities, it is important to note that many evidence -based substance abuse prevention programs have a positive impact not only on the prevention of substance use and abuse, but also on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. This reflects the fact that substance use and other aspects of behavioral health share many of the same risk and protective factor s. The backbone of an effective prevention system is an infrastructure with the ability to collect and analyze epidemiological d ata on substance use and its associated consequences and use this data to identify areas of greatest need. Good data also enable states to identify, implement, and evaluate evidence -based programs, practices, and policies that have the ability to reduce substance use and improve health and well -being in communities. In particular, SAMHSA strongly encourages states to use data collected and analyzed by their SEOWs to help make data - driven funding decisions. Consistent with states using data to guide their funding decisions, SAMHSA encourages states to look closely at the data on opioid/prescription drug abuse, as well as underage use of legal substances, such as alcohol, and marijuana in those states w here its use has been legalized. SAMHSA also encourages states to use data -driven approaches to allocate funding to communities with fewer resources and the greatest behavioral health needs. SAMHSA expects that state substance abuse agencies have the ability to implement the five steps of the strategic prevention f ramework (SPF) or an equivalent planning model that encompasses these steps: District of Columbia Page 1 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 107 of 230Assess prevention needs;1. Build capacity to address prevention needs;2. Plan to implement evidence -based strategies that address the risk and protective factors associated with the identified needs; 3. Implement appropriate strategies across the spheres of influence (individual, family, school, community, environment) that re duce substance abuse and its associated consequences; and4. Evaluate progress towards goals.5. States also need to be prepared to report on the outcomes of their efforts on substance abuse - related attitudes and behaviors. This means that state -funded prevention providers will need to be able to collect data and report this information to the state. With limited resources, states should also look for opportunities to leverage different streams of funding to create a coordinated data driven substance abu se prevention system. SAMHSA expects that states coordinate the use of all substance abuse prevention funding in the state, including the primary p revention set-aside of the SABG, discretionary SAMHSA grants such as the Partnerships for Success (PFS) grant, and other federal, state, an d local prevention dollars, toward common outcomes to strive to create an impact in their state 's use, misuse or addiction metrics. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: Please indicate if the state has an active SEOW. If so, please describe: 1. The types of data collected by the SEOW (i.e. incidence of substance use, consequences of substance use, and intervening variables, including risk and protective factors); The populations for which data is collected (i.e., children, youth, young adults, adults, older adults, minorities, rural communities); and The data sources used (i.e. archival indicators, NSDUH, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Monitoring the Future, Communities that Care, state -developed survey). Please describe how needs assessment data is used to make decisions about the allocation of SABG primary prevention funds.2. How does the state intend to build the capacity of its prevention system, including the capacity of its prevention workforce? 3. Please describe if the state has: 4. A statewide licensing or certification program for the substance abuse prevention workforce;a. A formal mechanism to provide training and technical assistance to the substance abuse prevention workforce; andb. A formal mechanism to assess community readiness to implement prevention strategies.c. How does the state use data on substance use consumption patterns, consequences of use, and risk and protective factors to id entify the types of primary prevention services that are needed (e.g., education programs to address low perceived risk of harm from mar ijuana use, technical assistance to communities to maximize and increase enforcement of alcohol access laws to address easy access t o alcohol through retail sources)?5. Does the state have a strategic plan that addresses substance abuse prevention that was developed within the last five years? If so, please describe this plan and indicate whether it is used to guide decisions about the use of the primary prevention set -aside of the SABG.6. Please indicate if the state has an active evidence -based workgroup that makes decisions about appropriate strategies in using SABG primary prevention funds and describe how the SABG funded prevention activities are coordinated with other state, local or fe derally funded prevention activities to create a single, statewide coordinated substance abuse prevention strategy.7. Please list the specific primary prevention programs, practices and strategies the state intends to fund with SABG primary pr evention dollars in each of the six prevention strategies. Please also describe why these specific programs, practices and strategies were selected.8. What methods were used to ensure that SABG dollars are used to fund primary substance abuse prevention services not funded th rough other means? 9. What process data (i.e. numbers served, participant satisfaction, attendance) does the state intend to collect on its funded prevention strategies and how will these data be used to evaluate the state's prevention system?10. What outcome data (i.e., 30 -day use, heavy use, binge use, perception of harm, disapproval of use, consequences of use) does the state intend to collect on its funded prevention strategies and how will this data be used to evaluate the state's prevention syste m?11.

Please use the box below to indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section: Footnotes: Please revise the District's response to Narrative 9 (Primary Prevention for Substance Abuse) (1) to indicate whether the Dis trict has an active evidence -based workgroup that makes decisions about appropriate strategies in using SABG primary prevention funds and (2) to confirm t he District's understanding that inclusion in the National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices (NREPP) does not in itself District of Columbia Page 2 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 108 of 230constitute status as an evidence -based program. Response: The DC EOW, co -chaired by Research Triangle International, acts as an evidence -based work group designed to utilize risk and protective factor data, incidence and prevalence data to inform prevention on estimating service needs, what prevention resources to target, selecting the most appropriate preventive interventions and best practices, and evaluating the effects of the prevention system. Thank you for your response to the earlier revision request on Narrative 9 regarding specific programs, practices, and strate gies funded by the SABG primary prevention set -aside. Additional information is needed with respect to education strategies. The District's description of education strategies appears to be largely focused on training and technical assistance for DBH, DC Prevention Center, and su b-recipient staff as opposed to other members of the public such as youth, parents, and the general public. As noted in the application i nstructions, education is described as follows: \"Education builds skills through structured learning processes. Critical life and social s kills include decision making, peer resistance, coping with stress, problem solving, interpersonal communication, and systematic and judgme ntal capabilities.\" Please revise the District's response to include a description of any additional education strategies the District intends to fund with the SABG primary prevention set -aside. Please note that it appears that certain of these activities might be described by the District as \"community education\" under community -based process strategies. RESPONSE: DBH staff will continue to educate the community on ATOD specific information from non -SABG funded public education campaign materials as the primary tools. DBH staff will work closely with DC Prevention Center staff to support community education through District and National Camp aigns. In Narrative 9, the District describes a number of Synar related activities as environmental strategies. However, Table 5a indicates that SABG funds will not be used in connection with the Synar program. Please revise the District's response to specify which activities will be funded by the SABG primary prevention set -aside. RESPONSE: DBH will revise tables 5a, and 5b. to accurately reflect the projected expenditure under 1926 Tobacco and not environmental. In addition the Synar activities cited within the narrative under environmental should be re -categorized as such. Please revise the District's response to Narrative 9 to describe specific problem identification and referral programs, pract ices, and strategies the District intends to fund with the SABG primary prevention set -aside. Please note that the application instructions state that \"problem identification and referral aims to identify individuals who have indulged in illegal or age -inappropriate use of tobacco, alcohol or other substances legal for adults, and individuals who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs. The goal is to assess if th eir behavior can be reversed through education. This strategy does not include any activity designed to determine if a person is in need of treat ment.\" RESPONSE: DBH will make the necessary modifications to the SABG funded DC Prevention Centers scope of work in 2016 and 2017 to support the Partnership for Success as a mechanism to establish a DBH workgroup on youth behavior health issues across prevention treatme nt and recovery. The focus is on high need communities and populations with identified disparities. In addition, the DC Prevention Centers will support the development/implementation of an individual Risk Reduction strategy/c urricula that uses the five step SPF process to identify indicated and selective adolescent populations and assess if there are best practi ces/resources available to change their current behavior.

DBH is also working with the DC EOW sub-recipient to build internal prevention capacity and achieve the following DCEOW goals: Continue to update District and Ward alcohol, tobacco, and other drug databases that include consumption patterns, consequences, risk and protective factors, and demographics. Develop a collaborative effort to build a common, systematic methodology for conducting prevention needs assessment based upon a risk assessment system to guide prevention policy, program planning, and resource allocation. Utilize risk and protective factor data, incidence and prevalence data to estimate service needs, target prevention resources, select and/or or development appropriate preventive interventions and evaluate the effects of the prevention system. Develop District and Ward reports for policy and program planners and community stakeholders. DC EOW consumption, consequences, and risk and protective factor data is gleaned from: District's Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) administered every two years to both public and Charter schools District's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System SAMHSA survey and special sub-state reports DBH youth and adult treatment data system (i.e., age of first use; young adults; adults and older adults; number of children living at home that may be at higher risk; and primary drug) Archival and social indicator from District agency partners Demographic data from the District Office of Planning Community Changes in policies, programs, and prevention practices resulting from DC Prevention Center Community Prevention Network SPF strategic plans Implementation of a readiness survey to be piloted through SPF-Partnership for Success and then taken to scale through SABG funded services Implementation of a revised customer satisfaction survey Community Conversations serve as an additional and timely data source on local conditions (e.g., neighborhoods, populations, disparities, and emerging drug issues). In 2015, DBH revised the Community Conversations protocol and expanded the work into a guidance document, templates for data collections, and key findings. This information is entered into the online DIRS as part of the monthly DC Prevention Center program report process. In addition to these standard data sets, DBH planned a 2015 pilot random sample telephone survey through Braun Inc. (Princeton, New Jersey) to gather Ward level data not available through YRBS or NSHU. Based on the results, DBH may seek additional funding to administer this survey in alternate YRBS years. Representative DC EOW demographic findings such as the following are used for District and Ward prevention planning: The overall population of the District has grown to more than 601,423 residents, a rapid growth of more than 5.2% since the 2000 U.S. Census. Of the total residents, approximately 51% are Black, 38% White, and 9% Hispanic. Each Ward has a relatively similar population size (70,000-80,000); however, the demographic make-up differs greatly among the Wards. The number of youth under age 18 has decreased across the District whereas the number of young adults 18 to 25 ha increased substantially. The Washington Metropolitan Area is a primary recipient of new immigrants, ranking fifth among the top immigrant-receiving communities. Since 2000, the region has received 3.5% of all new immigrants into U.S. communities. About 20% of residents in the Washington Metropolitan Area are foreign-born, compared with 12% nationwide. The residents include: Hispanic/Latino (3.95); Asian (36%) with the next largest group coming from India, Korea, China, Mexico, and Vietnam. While African immigrants make up about 4% of the foreign-born population in the U.S., they make up three and a half times that proportion (14%) in the Washington Metropolitan Area. The top 10 DC EOW findings from 2006-2013 also focus population based prevention planning at District and Ward levels: Underage youth (age 12 to 20) past-month binge drinking decreased from 23% Page 1 District of Columbia Page 4 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 110 of 230to 18%. Perception of great risk from binge drinking among District youth (age 12 to 17) remained stable for the first five years then increased significantly from 43% between 2011 and 2012 to 48% between 2012 and 2013. Consistently over the past six years, fewer youth in Ward 3 perceived a great risk from binge drinking compared to District youth overall. A lower percentage of District public high school students reported first trying alcohol before age 13 in 2012 (22%) than in 2007 (25%). A lower percentage of District public high school students reported that they had ever had a drink of alcohol 2012 (58%) than in 2007 (67%). Additionally, a lower percentage of students reported drinking alcohol in the past month in 2012 (31%) than in 2007 (34%). These trends mirror trends among U.S. high school students overall. Among District young adults (age 18 to 25), the percentages using alcohol, binge drinking, or perceiving a great risk of binge drinking did not change significantly. A higher percentage District public high school students reported first trying marijuana before age 13 in 2012 (18%) than in 2007 (11%). This percentage increased at a faster rate in the District than among U.S. high school students overall (from 8% in 2007 to 9% in 2012). A higher percentage of District high school students reported using marijuana in the past month in 2012 (32%) than in 2007 (21%). Only 23% of their U.S. counterparts reported using marijuana in the past month in 2012. The percentage of District youth (age 12 to 17) reporting great perceived risk from monthly marijuana use decreased (from 27% to 22%). The percentage of District young adults (age 18 to 25) reporting great perceived risk from monthly marijuana use decreased (from 17% to 12%); however there was no significant change in reported past-month marijuana use among young adults. The percentage of District youth that disapprove of someone their age using marijuana at least once a month has declined since 2006-2007 (from 79% to 72% in 2012-2013). Sample copies of 2015 DC EOW Highlights and the 8 DC EOW Ward Reports are in Attachment C. The needs assessment data is used for SABG District and Ward Strategic Prevention Framework planning purposes. The four DC Prevention Centers receive annual DC EOW data reports on priority needs within their two Wards along with District data and findings across all 8 Wards. In addition, the data drives information for DBH strategic planning documents and quarterly reports submitted to the Executive Office of the Mayor. DBH prevention has continued to develop the prevention system and build the capacity of its prevention workforce. As noted in Step One of this application, DBH has supported ongoing Strategic Prevention Framework capacity building trainings, technical assistance and coaching opportunities. In 2015, DBH supported trainings for DBH prevention staff, and DC Prevention Center staff in all required ICRC credentialing trainings. The national exam will be provided onsite in October 2015 and participants will have an additional testing opportunity if they do not pass the first exam. This support is expected to result in a minimum of 25 DBH certified prevention specialists. DBH prevention is currently developing a work plan to continue the IC&RC core trainings and testing to other target District and community partners in FY 2015-2016. In preparation for integrating prevention into Medicaid in 2016-2017, DBH is working on a seven step process to prepare the workforce: 1. Identify/design and price an array of universal, selective and indicated preventive interventions that address the identified needs of an urban area and culturally diverse populations; 2. Expand and build the capacity of qualified prevention provider networks; 3. Develop continuous quality improvement and performance-based outcomes and review systems; 4. Design the mechanism to process prevention claims and pay providers; 5. Determine effective dosages of prevention for whole populations; 6. Retool the prevention field by finding more efficient and cost effective ways to deliver prevention, improve access to services, and fully integrated the behavioral health research into practice; and 7. Support the ongoing development of prevention program standards and provider Page 2 District of Columbia Page 5 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 111 of 230certification. DBH prevention has one Full-time employee that is the point person for coordination of capacity building services. This includes training, technical assistance, social marketing development, website and social media services. Two new locally funded community coordinators FTE's were in the FY 2015 Mayor's Budget; however, due to FY 2016 funding constraints, the positions will not be hired until FY 2017. Through the SAMHSA Strategic Prevention Enhancement (SPE) discretionary grant, DBH completed four mini-plans and a Five Year Strategic Prevention Plan in August 2012. The plan has been used to guide the overall prevention direction but needs to be updated in FY 2016. The extensive DBH SUDS leadership changes and merger into the Department of Behavioral Health has been a challenge in fully developing a new prevention plan. That being said, the SSA prevention infrastructure and general direction has been consistent since 2010. The SABG Prevention Set-Aside funds in FY 2016-2017 will address priorities designed to strengthen and sustain the infrastructure and community prevention system: Funds for four DC Prevention Center sub-grantees that serve two wards each (Wards 1 and 2; Wards 3 and 4; Wards 5 and 6; Wards 7 and 8). Their grant scope of work involves three primary functions (community education. community leadership; and community changes) and approximately 20 flexible strategies in order to address whole population prevention. The three functions and flexible strategies align with the SABG six core strategies: information dissemination, education, community-based processes, alternatives, environmental, problem identification and referral. DC Prevention Centers will continue to submit monthly program progress report information through the online DIRS system. DIRS was enhanced in 2015 to capture the same process data required in the SABG prevention set-aside data tables, demographic information, people served, strategies implemented). DBH will continue to fund prevention FTE's (six full-time DBH Full-Time Employees that includes a program manager that oversees program grants and contract management functions, certification and program standard operations and three FTE's); one Public Health Analyst that administers the Synar Program; and one Public Health Advisor that coordinates Strategic Prevention Framework capacity building and community partnership development services. A sub-grant to recruit, train, and manage youth for Synar compliance checks. Integrate PFS funds for DC EOW efforts and system evaluation to determine measurable progress on three levels: 1) Changes in priority risk and protective factors (e.g., age of initiation, perceptions of risk, peer disapproval, community laws and norms); 2) Community changes (policies, programs and practices); 3) Distal/behavioral health outcomes (frequency of use including 30 day and lifetime). Collaboration with DBH financial services to develop and track sub-grantee spending plans. There are different District funding codes for tracking prevention expenditures (local, SABG Prevention Set-Aside, federal discretionary funds). DIRS also has separate program reporting modules for SABG prevention-aside funds and federal discretionary grants. Page 3 District of Columbia Page 6 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 112 of 230The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG) Prevention Set-Aside funds will continue to support: Four DC Prevention Centers that serve two Wards each, focus on data-driven community-based processes, address the six core strategies and the spectrum of preventive populations (universal, selective, indicated). Six District agency full-time prevention employees that provide SABG funded system -wide planning, program grants management and accountability, data and evaluation, workforce development and capacity building services. This work provides needed infrastructure and context for building capacity of the community prevention system. DC Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (DCEOW) goals will be sustained through local and Strategic Prevention Framework Partnership for Success funds: Continue updating District and Ward alcohol, tobacco and other drug data that that includes consumption, consequences, risk and protective factors, demographics and health disparities. Develop a collaborative effort to build a common, systematic methodology for conducting prevention needs assessment based upon a risk assessment system to guide prevention policy, program planning and resource allocation. Utilize risk and protective factor data, incidence and prevalence data to estimate service needs, target prevention resources, select appropriate preventive interventions, and evaluate the effects of the prevention system. Develop District and Ward reports and resources for policy and program planners and community stakeholders. The emphasis on risk and protective factors increases an understanding that substance use and other aspects of behavioral health share many of the same risk and protective factors. Common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems including substance use, anxiety and depression, delinquency, violence school dropout and teen pregnancy. Because common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems, it is important to insure that prevention efforts reach those young people exposed to many risk factors during their development. The DC EOW will be expanded in FY 2016 beyond current representatives: Department of Health Department of Behavioral Health Child and Family Services Agency DC Metropolitan Police Department Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Alcohol Beverage Regulatory Agency Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Children's National Health System DC Pretrial Services Agency Department of Transportation DC Hospital Association The Children's Trust Legacy Foundation DBH DC Prevention Center representative DBH supports the SAMHSA premise that the backbone of an effective prevention system is an infrastructure with the ability to collect and analyze epidemiological data and to use this data to identify areas of greatest need. DC EOW data sources will continue to include the DC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, NSDUH, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and archival indicators. A new DC Ward level telephone survey will be piloted to address Ward gaps in youth and adult data, especially risk and protective factors. The District also supports a comprehensive approach to prevention and will continue to use SABG funds to target the general public and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance use disorders. DC EOW data underscores the need to prevent new users and to reduce risk in all areas of a young person's life at early ages of development. More intensive and costly preventive interventions are needed for older youth and young adults as documented by behavioral health assessment and treatment data. DBH plans to maximize SABG prevention set-aside funds over the next two years by leveraging Medicaid dollars for selective and indicated populations. Page 1 District of Columbia Page 7 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 113 of 230This requires drafting prevention standards and practice guidelines for new Chapter 63 regulations. It will also require DBH to: 1. Expand and build the capacity of qualified behavioral health prevention provider networks; 2. Strengthen continuous quality improvement and performance-based outcomes and review systems; 3. Identify the online mechanism to process prevention claims and pay providers; 4. Identify, design and price selective and indicated preventive interventions that address the identified needs of an urban areas with culturally diverse populations; 5. Find more efficient and cost effective ways to deliver prevention services, provide access to services and fully integrate prevention research into practice; 6. Continue to support ICRC Certification as part of the Chapter 63 Standards. In Fiscal Year 2016 and 2017, SABG Prevention Set-Aside funds will be directed toward the following primary prevention and six core strategies that include the spectrum of populations: universal, selective and indicated. 1. Information Dissemination The Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) supported development of a new Department of Behavioral Health Prevention website (www.drugfreeyouthdc.com), the \"There's a Reason\" Underage Drinking Campaign (www.theresareasondc.com) website and the Synthetic Marijuana Campaign website (www.K2Zombie.DC.com). The Synthetic Marijuana website will be expanded to synthetic drugs and sustained through local funding. SABG Prevention Set-Aside resources will expand DBH Prevention Website operations beginning in FY 2016. The DBH Prevention Public Health Analyst will serve as lead for information dissemination. The goal is to disseminate targeted prevention messages and resources to DC youth and adults via the four DC Prevention Centers, website, digital engagement, social media events, and other communication channels. Digital measures are to: 1) increase the reach of synthetic drug, underage marijuana use, and underage drinking prevention messages by 20%, segment by local and acquisition channel; 2) increase the level of primary and target audiences by 1-2% each month; 3) maintain steady engagement with youth influencers (parents/caregivers, other adults); 4) maintain steady engagement with youth. DBH prevention staff will collaborate with DC Prevention Centers (DCPC) to: Update drug facts each month using the best evidence from SAMHSA, NIDA, NIAAA, and ONDCP; Update new information and calendar/event notices from District , Ward and community leaders; Include resource request sections and make available digital versions of DC substance use prevention campaign materials; Add contact forms for questions and suggestions from the public who do not frequently use social media or are needing immediate assistance; Check social media pages (Facebook and Twitter) on a regular basis and respond to immediate requests; Issue proactive posts describing events and activities, new resources, and digital campaign information; Use and create hashtags to identify new users and expand prevention messaging; Repost follower and non-follower related prevention messages as appropriate. Through non-SABG funds, DBH will expand the Synthetic Marijuana/Drug campaign for youth and young adults in FY 2016. Local funds are supporting a new Preventing Underage Marijuana Use Campaign to be launched in December 2015. That initiative is being planned and coordinated with the Director of the Department of Health, a co-chair for the Mayor's Initiative 71 Task Force. The public education campaign is a component of the broader comprehensive Initiative 71 work plan. DBH prevention staff and DCPC will continue to disseminate \"There's A Reason\" Campaign resources this fiscal year. That campaign was adapted from the SAMHSA \"Talk.They Hear You\" Public Education Campaign and documenting measurable results. Digital engagement, campaigns, and DBH prevention branding will be updated on a quarterly basis. Content is based on formative evaluation designed to reach target audiences and segments for targeting. These social marketing campaigns include community engagement components supported by the four DC Prevention Centers. Page 2 District of Columbia Page 8 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 114 of 230DBH will continue to brand prevention as an integral component in achieving the agency mission. In 2015, new resources were developed are being disseminated in FY 2016. The resources include: a DCPC Ward and DBH graphic design with the Mayor's logo; DCPC signage, banners, table top exhibits, letterhead and business cards, newsletter templates, flyer templates, and stock photos for use in flyers . Information dissemination data is collected, analyzed and reported through the online Program Grant monitoring and evaluation system, Data Infrastructure Resource System (DIRS). The DBH prevention staff DIRS report module and the DCPC block grant program module include data requirements in the SABG strategic plan and annual report. Non-SABG funds will support the evaluation of digital media strategies through a web metric tool. 2. Education DBH prevention staff and DC Prevention Center staff will continue to support education strategies that are based on DC EOW data findings, emerging community trends, and approaches that have a plausible connection to target outcomes. DBH has invested SABG, SPF SIG and local funds for ongoing education delivered to DBH prevention staff, DC Prevention Centers and other sub-recipients. Educational strategies included: Sponsoring trainings and technical assistance on the DBH prevention conceptual and operational framework (cultural humility, risk and protective factors Institute of Medicine Classification System, and the Strategic Prevention Framework five step planning process). Developing data driven logic models with culturally appropriate evidence-based preventive interventions for use in SPF planning. Using District and Ward data and Community Conversation findings to make policy, program, and resource decisions. Supporting the development of the prevention workforce through ICRC Prevention Specialist trainings and testing for certification. Trainings and technical assistance tailored to effective prevention approaches in working with selective and indicated populations. Trainings and technical assistance in using the online DIRS system for submitting and monitoring monthly prevention program grant reports. Increasing awareness and educating District and Ward stakeholders on priority drug issues (underage drinking, underage marijuana use, synthetic drug use and Initiative 71 laws.) The next two years, SABG funds will support development of a more comprehensive and sustainable education strategy that builds needed workforce skills through structured learning processes. The priority audiences are: 1) DBH prevention staff; 2) DC Prevention Centers that reach and educate more than 35,000 community stakeholders annually; 3) other DBH substance use prevention sub-recipients; 4) targeted District agency partners that are addressing risk and protective factors for anxiety and depression, violence, delinquency, and poor school performance. Focused education strategies are to: Continue core trainings and certification testing that will target more than 50 new certified prevention associates or prevention specialists by September 30, 2017; Plan with the DBH Training Institute to offer and sustain core prevention certification trainings trainings online or onsite; Develop a policy, program, and business plan to implement the DC Prevention Leadership Center that supports education and technical assistance for an expanded prevention workforce. DBH prevention staff and the DCPC will continue to support educational events that are based on identified substance use prevention need; in high need communities with low capacity; and with populations that have documented disparities. 3. Community-Based Process DBH will continue to allocate SABG prevention set-aside funds for four DC Prevention Centers, dynamic hubs that engage, support and help connect the many community elements needed to for promoting healthy drug-free youth. Each Center serves two Wards each (Wards 1 and 2; Wards 3 and 4; Wards 5 and 6; Wards 7 and 8). Through their grants, DCPC focus on three core functions: 1) community education; 2) community leadership; 3) community changes. These functions provide a consistent strategy but have the flexibility to address the unique characteristics and Page 3 District of Columbia Page 9 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 115 of 230priorities of the geographic area and populations in their designated Wards. Flexibility in this community prevention system allows partnerships across Ward boundaries to address shared and emergent substance use problems. The FY 2016 scope of work includes the following requirements: Administrative Leadership: Ensure staffing patterns that include one full-time Project Director/Coordinator and two Community Mobilizer FTE's that share responsibilities for the three core functions. Attend DBH required roundtables, technical assistance and trainings. Submit and revise as needed monthly program reports through the online Data Infrastructure Reporting System. Submit quarterly financial reports and revise as needed. Participate in at least one DCPC grant site visit in cooperation with DBH. Attend the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Directors Prevention Research Conference and the SAMHSA Prevention Day. DCPC funds to attend other conferences require written permission from DBH. Allocate a maximum of 10% of the grant funds for indirect or overhead costs. Community Education: This function is designed to provide current, comprehensive and relevant information for a wide range of audiences within the Prevention Center's respective geographic areas. Market as a DCPC using DBH provided templates (logo, business cards, letterheads, etc.) Provide an \"early warning system\", track and recommend actions to address new drug trends within the two Wards Disseminate science-based substance abuse prevention education materials within with two Wards Coordinate and support District and National campaigns (e.g. SAMHSA Week, \"Talk. They Hear You.\", Synthetic Drug Campaign, and the Underage Marijuana Campaign) Use the Community Conversation Guidance document for implementing Community Conversations and submit findings and recommendations in the monthly program progress report Community Leadership: This function is designed to identify, engage, and strengthen the capacity of community prevention partnerships in order to address the areas placing youth at risk for substance use disorders. Strengthen and maintain an accessible database of prevention partners involved in the DCPC scope of work Strengthen and maintain an accessible database of prevention strategies that are currently being implemented by prevention partners within the two Wards Identify and support the develop of community prevention networks that broaden the reach of DCPC Community Changes: This function increases opportunities for pro-active prevention action planning around Ward specific DCEOW data and measurable changes in prevention policy, programs and practices. Use the Strategic DC Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) to mobilize and facilitate data-driven planning with community prevention networks Support community prevention networks in the implementation of the implementation of the SPF logic model and action plan Document community changes by tracking changes in policies, programs, and practices related to implementation of the action plan DCPC SABG scope of work and work plan will continue to target three levels of measurable outcomes: 1) priority risk and protective factors; 2) community changes in policies, programs and practices; 3) distal or behavioral outcomes. DCPC grants are competitive every three years and a FY 2017 Request for Application will be posted in spring 2016. DBH will modify the existing scope of work based on DCEOW data and evaluation findings. Within the community-based process strategy, DCPC will continue to address the spectrum of prevention interventions: universal, selective and indicated. DIRS program reports collect information on IOM categories and demographics. DBH has built on the DCPC core services for other discretionary grants such as SPF SIG and now the Strategic Prevention Framework Partnership for Success Grant. Each funding source requires a separate grant and grant scope of work. There are also separate DIRS modules for submitting online program grant reports to better ensure SABG dollars are used to fund primary substance abuse prevention services not funded Page 4 District of Columbia Page 10 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 116 of 230through other means. 4. Alternatives Alternative strategies will continue to be supported at the District level through DBH prevention staff and through DCPC at the Ward level. These activities coincide with the Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), a locally funded initiative sponsored by the Department of Employment Services that provides District youth ages 14 to 21 with enriching and constructive summer work experiences through subsidized placements in the private and government sectors. In 2015 SYEP expanded the program to include youth ages 22-24 years old. While the emphasis is on earning money and learning skills to succeed in the work world, the program provides an array of opportunities to involve youth in healthy, alternative activities that exclude alcohol and other drugs. Illustrative of that, DBH prevention staff and DCPC staff were recruited by the Executive Office of the Mayor to provide information and hold Community Conversations on synthetic drugs and underage drinking with SYEP youth across the 8 Wards. They sponsored or supported youth health fairs, drug-free l events and activities that involved the prevention Mobilzer. DCPC collaborates with community-based organizations and agencies on alternative activities as part of their community education and community prevention network action plans. This fiscal year, DBH prevention will be more intentional in planning and supporting alternative activities for the SYEP Program during summer months and with District agency partners and DCPC year round. DBH will be pro-active in planning structured alternative strategies across the 8 Wards with the following partners: DBH DOES SYEP program planners DC Parks and Recreation and Roving Leaders Program After school activities DCPC Community Prevention Networks Alternative activities will focus on increasing awareness of prevention and substance use disorder resources, risks of underage alcohol and marijuana use, ward level data that lead to structured alternates at high risk times (e.g. summer months, holidays, school breaks, after school). This approach will be data-driven, pro-active opposed to reactive requests, provide consistency across Wards, and have potential for evaluation. 5. Environmental DBH prevention will continue to focus on the Synar requirements as a priority prevention strategy. In FY 2016 this includes: Improving the 4.3% non-compliance rate achieved in 2015. Posting, reviewing and awarding a $60,000 competitive grant award to recruit, train, and manage qualified youth for Synar compliance checks. Working with the DCPC and their community prevention networks to distribute new Synar Merchant Education materials to more than 950 licensed tobacco vendors. Materials include two-pocket folders with the updated DC underage sales to youth law, store front signs with the DC law, palm cards, and counter mats with the law. Materials were developed in three different languages, a response to stakeholder recommendations. Collaborating with the District's regulatory agency on tobacco licensee related issues. This involves receipt of periodic updates on the tobacco licensee list in order to improve accuracy of the list. Continuing a partnership with the Legacy Foundation on Synar and tobacco-related studies. DBH prevention staff and DCPC will disseminate underage drinking social marketing materials in FY 2016 to increase understanding of District laws pertaining to youth. The preventing underage marijuana use social marketing campaign will also focus on the laws pertaining to passage of Initiative 71 and the behavioral health risks associated with underage use. The Prevention Chief and the Prevention Public Health Analyst will continue to serve on the Initiative 71 Public Education Campaign workgroup that includes the DBH Director, Department of Health Director, DBH Chief of Staff, and the Substance Use Disorders Interim Deputy Director. The underage marijuana use campaign creative plan will be reviewed and approved and a Mayor's launch is scheduled for early FY 2016. DCPC and their community prevention networks will be actively involved in both campaigns this fiscal year to increase awareness of the behavioral health risks and need for compliance with the laws. DBH prevention staff will continue to serve on District task forces such as the Page 5 District of Columbia Page 11 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 117 of 230Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Synthetic Drug Workgroup to identify policy and program environmental changes needed to address synthetic drug issues. The DBH Prevention Chief will continue to participate on the Heroin Task Force chaired by the Director of the Department of Health and attended by the DBH Director and other executive leadership. The DCEOW and SAMHSA Barometer data documents the need to continue our focus on underage drinking, underage marijuana use, and synthetic drugs. 6. Problem Identification and Referral While the District has documented positive changes in some DC EOW data, the age of first use among middle school youth (cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana) remains on average age 10. For DC high school youth the average age is 13. There is also a decline in the number of youth being assessed and treated through the four youth substance use disorders treatment programs while behavioral health needs of transitional age youth continue to increase. The FY 2016 DBH Performance Plan includes substance use disorder objectives for prevention, treatment and recovery. The first objective, \"Reduce priority risk factors that place District children, youth and families, and communities at risk for substance use and interrelated problems\", will help focus DBH efforts toward earlier problem identification and referral to services. SPF SIG funds allowed DBH and DCPC to assess 500 individuals, community-based organizations, youth and parents/caregivers on challenges related to early risk reduction that results in delayed problem identification. One challenge is that consumers are not aware of how to fully access behavioral health services due to the merger of mental health and substance use disorders. The DBH Office of Policies and Programs has scheduled a Senior Leadership Retreat for November 2015 to plan around integration of prevention, treatment and recovery for behavioral health. The retreat will allow prevention to identify a more strategic role in planning and leveraging resources for universal, selective and indicated populations. Other FY 2016 plans included: A public education campaign through treatment funds to increase consumer awareness of DBH system services; Broader awareness of the 24 hour DBH Access Help Line that provides immediate information and assistance for prevention, treatment and recovery behavioral health services; Inclusion of prevention standards in Chapter 63, a first step in accessing Medicaid funds for selective and indicated populations; Using Partnership for Success as a mechanism to establish a DBH workgroup on youth behavior health issues across prevention treatment and recovery. The focus is on high need communities and populations with identified disparities. Revising and developing a Risk Reduction strategy/curricula that uses the five step SPF process for indicated and selective adolescent populations.

The emphasis on risk and protective factors increases an understanding that substance use and other aspects of behavioral health share many of the same risk and protective factors. Common risk factors predict diverse behavior problems including substance use, anxiety and depression, delinquency, violence school dropout and teen pregnancy. Because c ommon risk factors predict diverse behavior problems , it is important to insure that prevention efforts re ach those young people exposed to many risk factors during their development. The DC EOW will be expanded in FY 2016 beyond current representatives: District of Columbia Page 13 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 119 of 230 Department of Health Department of Behavioral Health Child and Family Services Agency DC Metropolitan Police Department Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Alcohol Beverage Regulatory Agency Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs Children's National Health System DC Pretrial Services Agency Department of Transportation DC Hospital Association The Children's Trust Legacy Foundation DBH DC Prevention Center representative DBH supports the SAMHSA premise that the backbone of an effective prevention system is an infrastructure with the ability to collect and analyze epidemiological data and to use thi s data to identify areas of greatest need. DC EOW data sources will continue to include the DC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, NSDUH, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and archival indicators. A new DC Ward level telephone survey will be piloted to a ddress Ward gaps in youth and adult data, especially risk and protective factor s. The District also supports a comprehensive approach to prevention and will continue to use SABG funds to target the general public and sub -groups that are at high risk for substance use disorders. DC EOW data underscores the need to prevent new users and to reduce risk in all areas of a young person's life at early ages of development. More intensive and costly preventive interventions are needed for older youth and young adults as documented by behavioral health assessment and treatment data. DBH plans to maximize SABG prevention set-aside funds over the next two years by leveraging Medicaid dollars for selective and indicated populations. This requires drafting preventi on standards and practice guidelines for new Chapter 63 regulations. It will also require DBH to: 1. Expand and build the capacity of qualified behavioral health prevention provider networks; 2. Strengthen continuous quality improvement and performance -based out comes and review systems; 3. Identify the online mechanism to process prevention claims and pay providers; 4. Identify, design and price selective and indicated preventive interventions that address the identified needs of an urban areas with culturally diverse populations; District of Columbia Page 14 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 120 of 2305. Find more efficient and cost effective ways to deliver prevention services, provide access to services and fully integrate prevention research into practice; and 6. Continue to support ICRC Certification as part of the Chapter 63 Standards. In Fiscal Year 2016 and 2017, SABG Prevention Set -Aside funds will be directed toward the following primary preventi on and six core strategies that include the spectrum of populations: universal, selective and indicated. 1. Information Dissemination The Strategic Pr evention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) supported develop ment of a new Department of Behavioral Health Prevention website ( www.drugfreeyouthdc.com ), the \"There's a Reason\" Underage the Marijuana Campaign website ( www.K2Zombie.DC.com ). The Synthetic Marijuana website will be expanded to synthetic drugs and sustained thr ough local funding. SABG Prevention Set -Aside resources will expand DBH Prevention Website operations beginning in FY 2016. The DBH Prevention Public Health Analyst will serve as lead for information dissemination. The goal is to disseminate targeted pr evention messages and resources to DC youth and adults via the four DC Prevention Centers, website, digital engagement, social media events, and other communication channels. Digital measures are to: 1) increase the reach of synthetic drug, underage marij uana use, and underage drinking prev ention messages by 20%, segment by local and acquisition channel; 2) increase the level of primary and target audiences by 1 -2% each month; 3) maintain steady engagement with youth influencers (parents/caregivers, other adults); 4) maintain steady engagement with youth. DBH prevention staff will collaborate with DC Prevention Centers (DCPC) to : Update drug facts each month using the best evidence from SAMHSA, NIDA, NIAAA, and ONDCP; Update new information and calendar/event notices from District , Ward and community leaders; Include resource request sections and make available digital versions of DC substance use prevention campaign materials ; Add contact forms for questions and suggestions from the publi c who do not frequently use social media or are needing immediate assistance; Check social media pages (Facebook and Twitter) on a regular basis and respond to immediate requests; District of Columbia Page 15 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 121 of 230 Issue proactive posts describing events and activities, new resources, and d igital campaign information ; Use and create hashtags to identify new users and expand prevention messaging; Repost follower and non -follower related prevention messages as appropriate . Through non -SABG funds, DBH will expand the Synthetic Marijuana/Drug c ampaign for youth and young adults in FY 2016. Local funds are supporting a new Preventing Underage Marijuana Use Campaign to be launched in December 2015. That initiative is being planned and coordinated with the Director of the Department of Health , a co -chair for the Mayor's Initiative 71 Task Force. The public education campaign is a component of the broader comprehensive Initiative 71 work plan. DBH prevention staff and DCPC will continue to disseminate \"There's A Reason\" Campaign resources this fisc al year. That campaign was adapted from the SAMHSA \"Talk. They Hear You\" Public Education Campaign and documenting measurable results. Digital engagement, campaigns, and DBH prevention branding will be updated on a quarterly basis . Content is based on form ative evaluation designed to reach target audiences and segments for targeting. These social marketing campaigns include community engagement component s supported by the four DC Prevention Centers. DBH will continue to brand prevention as a n integral c omponent in achieving the agency mission . In 2015, new resources were developed are being disseminated in FY 2016. The resources include: a DCPC Ward and DBH graphic design with the Mayor's logo ; DCPC signage, banners, table top exhibits, letterhead and business cards, newsletter templates, flyer templates, and stock photos for use in flyers . Information dissemination data is collected, analyzed and reported through the online Program Grant monitoring and eva luation system, D ata Infrastructure Resource System (DIRS) . The DBH prevention staff DIRS report module and the DCPC block grant program module include data requirements in the SABG strategic plan and annual report. Non -SABG funds will support the evaluat ion of digital media strategies through a web metric tool. 2. Education SABG funded DBH prevention staff and DC Prevention Center staff will continue to support education strategies that are based on DC EOW data findings, emerging community trends, and approaches that have a plausible connection to target outcomes. DBH has invested SABG, SPF SIG and local funds for ongoing education delivered to DBH prevention s taff, DC Prevention Centers and other sub -recipients . Educational strategies include d: Sponsoring t rainings and technical assistance on the DBH prevention conceptual and operational framework (cultural humility, risk and protective factors Institute of District of Columbia Page 16 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 122 of 230Medicine Classification System, and the Strategic Prevention Framework five step planning pro cess ). Developing d ata driven logic models with culturally appropriate evidence -based preventive interventions for use in SPF planning. Using District and Ward data and Community Conversation findings to make policy, program, and resource decisions . Supp orting the development of the prevention workforce through ICRC Prevention Specialist trainings and testing for certification. Trainings and technical assistance tailored to effective prevention approaches in working with selec tive and indicated populatio ns. Trainings and technical assistance in using the online DIRS system for submitting and monitoring monthly prevention program grant reports . Increasing awareness and educating District and Ward stakeholders on priority drug issues (underage drinking, underage marijuana use, synthetic drug use and Initiative 71 laws. ) The next two years, SABG funds will support development of a more comprehensive and sustainable education strategy that builds needed workforce skills through structured learning processe s. The priority audiences are: 1) DBH prevention staff; 2) DC Prevention Centers that reach and educate more than 35,000 community stakeholders annually ; 3) other DBH substance use prevention sub -recipients; 4) targeted District agency partners that a re addressing risk and protective factors for anxiety and depression, violence, delinquency, and poor school performance. Focused education strategies are to: Continue core trainings and certification testing that will target more than 50 new certified prevention associates or prevention specialists by September 30, 2017; Plan with the DBH Training Institute to offer and sustain core prevention certification trainings online or onsite ; and Develop a policy, program, and business plan to implement the DC Prevention Leadership Center that supports education and technical assistance for an expanded prevention workforce. DBH prevention staff and the DCPC will continue to support educational ev ents that are based on identified substance use prevention need; in high need communities with low capacity; and with populations that have documented disparities. 3. Community -Based Process District of Columbia Page 17 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 123 of 230DBH will continue to allocate SABG prevention set -aside funds for four DC Prevention Centers , dynamic hubs that engage, support and help connect the many community elements needed to for promoting healthy drug -free youth. Each Center serves two Wards each (Wards 1 and 2; Wards 3 and 4; Wards 5 and 6; Wards 7 and 8). Throu gh their grants, DCPC focus on three core functions: 1) community education; 2) community leadership; 3) community changes. These functions provide a consistent strategy but have the flexibility to address the unique characteristics and priorities of the g eographic area and populations in their designated Wards. Flexibility in this community prevention system allows partnerships across Ward boundaries to address shared and emergent substance use problems. The FY 2016 scope of work includes the following re quirements: Administrative Leadership: Ensure staffing patterns that include one full -time Project Director/Coordinator and two Community Mobilizer FTE's that share responsibilities for the three core functions. Attend DBH required roundtables, technical a ssistance and trainings. Submit and revise as needed monthly program reports through the online Data Infrastructure Reporting System . Submit quarterly financial reports and revise as needed . Participate in at least one DCPC grant site visit in cooperation with DBH . Attend the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Directors Prevention Research Conference and the SAMHSA Prevention Day. DCPC funds to attend other conferences require written permission from DBH. Allocate a maximum of 10% of the grant funds for indirect or overhead costs . Community Education: This function is designed to provide current, comprehensive and relevant information for a wide range of audiences within the Prevention Center's respective geographic areas. Market as a DCPC using DBH provided templates (logo, business cards, letterheads, etc.) Provide an \"early warning system\", track and recommend actions to address new drug trends within the two Wards Disseminate science -based substance abuse prevention education mater ials within with two Wards Coordinate and support District and National campaigns (e.g. SAMHSA Week, \"Talk. They Hear You.\", Synthetic Drug Campaign, and the Underage Marijuana Campaign) Use the Community Conversation Guidance document for implementing Com munity Conversations and submit findings and recommendations in the monthly program progress report District of Columbia Page 18 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 124 of 230Community Leadership: This function is designed to identify, engage, and strengthen the capacity of community prevention partnerships in order to address the areas placing youth at risk for substance use disorders. Strengthen and maintain an accessible database of prevention partners involved in the DCPC scope of work Strengthen and maintain an accessible database of prevention strategi es that are currently being implemented by prevention partners within the two Wards Identify and support the develop of community prevention networks that broaden the reach of DCPC Community Changes: This function increases opportunities for pro -active pre vention action planning around Ward specific DCEOW data and measurable changes in prevention policy, programs and practices. Use the Strategic DC Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) to mobilize and facilitate data -driven planning with community preventi on networks Support community prevention networks in the implementation of the implementation of the SPF logic model and action plan Document community changes by tracking changes in policies, programs, and practices related to implementation of the action plan DCPC SABG scope of work and work plan will continue to target three levels of measurable outcomes: 1) priority risk and protective factors; 2) community changes in policies, programs and practices; 3) distal or behavioral outcomes. DCPC grants are co mpetitive every three years and a FY 2017 Request for Application will be posted in spring 2016. DBH will modify the existing scope of work based on DCE OW data and evaluation findings. Within the community -based process strategy, DCPC will continue to addr ess the spectrum of prevention interventions: universal, selective and indicated. DIRS program reports collect information on IOM categories and demographics. DBH has built on the DCPC core services for other discretionary grants such as SPF SIG and now the Strategic Prevention Framework Partnership for Success Grant. Each funding source requires a separate grant and grant scope of work. There are also separate DIRS modules for submitting online program grant reports to better ensure SABG dollars are use d to fund primary substance abuse prevention services not funded through other means. 4. Alternatives District of Columbia Page 19 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 125 of 230Alternative strategies will continue to be supported at the District level through DBH prevention staff and through DCPC at the Ward level . These activit ies coincide with the Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), a locally funded initiative sponsored by the Department of Employment Services that provides District youth ages 14 to 21 with enriching and constructive summer work experiences through subsidized placements in the private and government sectors. In 2015 SYEP expanded the program to include youth ages 22 -24 years old. While the emphasis is on earning money and learning skills to succeed in the work world, the program provides an array of opportunities to involve youth in healthy, alternative activities that exclude alcohol and other drugs. Illustrative of that, DBH prevention staff and DCPC staff were recruited by the Executive Office of the Mayor to provide information and hold Community Conversations on synthetic drugs and underage drinking with SYEP youth across the 8 Wards. They sponsored or supported youth health fairs , drug -free l events and activities that involved the prevention Mobilzer. DCPC collaborate s with community -based organizations and agencies on alternative activities as part of their community education and community prevention network action plans. This fiscal year, DBH prevention will be more intentional in planning and suppor ting alternative activities for the SYEP Program during summer months and with District agency partners and DCPC year round. DBH will be pro -active in planning structured alternative strategies across the 8 Wards with the following partners: DBH DOES SYEP program planners DC Parks and Recreation and Roving Leaders Program After school activities DCPC Community Prevention Networks Alternative activities will focus on increasing awareness of prevention and substance use disorder resources, risks of underage alcohol and marijuana use, ward level data that lead to structured alternates at high risk times (e.g. summer months, holidays, school breaks, after school) . This approach will be data -driven, pro -active opposed to reactive requests, provide consistency across Wards , and have potential for evaluation. 5. Environmental SABG funded DBH prevention staff and DCPC s will disseminate underage drinking prevention, underage marijuana prevention, synthetic narcotics prevention and tobacco prevention social marketing materials in FY 2016 to increase understanding of District laws pertaining to youth and adults . The preventing underage marijuana use social marketing campaign will focus on the laws pertaining to passage of Initiative 71 and the behavioral health risks associated with underage use. The Prevention Chief and the Prevention Public Health Analyst will continue to District of Columbia Page 20 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 126 of 230serve on the Initiative 71 Public Education Campaign workgroup that includes the DBH Director, Department of Health Director, DBH Chief of Staff, and the Substance Use Disorders Interim Deputy Director. The underage marijuana use campaign creative plan will be reviewed and approved and a Mayor's launch is scheduled for early FY 2016. DCPC and their community prevention networks will be actively involved in both campaigns this fiscal year to increase awareness of the behavioral health risks and need for compliance with the laws. SABG funded DBH prevention staff will continue to serve on District task forces such as the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Synthetic Drug Workgroup to identify policy and program environmental changes needed to address synthetic drug issues. The DBH Prevention Chi ef will continue to participate on the Heroin Task Force chaired by the Director of the Department of Health and attended by the DBH Director and other executive leadership. The DCEOW and SAMHSA Barometer data documents the need to continue our focus on underage drinking, underage marijuana use, and synthetic drugs. 6. Synar (1926 Tobacco) DBH prevention will continue to focus on the Synar requirements as a priority prevention strategy. In FY 2016 this includes: Improving the 4.3% non -compliance rate achie ved in 2015 . Posting, reviewing and awarding a $ 60,000 competitive grant award to recruit, train, and manage qualified youth for Synar compliance checks . Working with the DCPC and their community prevention networks to distribute new Synar Merchant Educati on materials to more than 950 licensed tobacco vendors. Materials include two -pocket folders with the updated DC underage sales to youth law, store front signs with the DC law, palm cards, and counter mats with the law. Materials were developed in three different languages, a response to stakeholder recommendations. Collaborating with the District's regulatory agency on tobacco licensee related issues. This involves receipt of periodic updates on the tobacco licensee list in order to improve accuracy of the list. Continuing a partnership with the Legacy Foundation on Synar and tobacco -related studies. 7. Problem Identification and Referral District of Columbia Page 21 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 127 of 230While the District has documented positive changes in some DC EOW data, the age of first use among middle school youth (cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana) remains on average age 10. For DC high school youth the average age is 13. There is also a decline in the number of youth being assessed and treated through the four youth substance use disorders treatment programs whi le behavioral health needs of transitional age youth continue to increase. The FY 2016 DBH Performance Plan includes substance use disorder objectives for prevention, treatment and recovery. The first objective, \"Reduce priority risk factors that place Di strict children, youth and families, and communities at risk for substance use and interrelated problems\", will help focus DBH efforts toward earlier problem identification and referral to services. SPF SIG funds allowed DBH and DCPC to assess 500 individ uals, community -based organizations, youth and parents/caregivers on challenges related to early risk reduction that results in delayed problem identification. One challenge is that consumers are not aware of how to fully access behavioral health services due to the merger of mental health and substance use disorders. The DBH Office of Policies and Programs has scheduled a Senior Leadership Retreat for November 2015 to plan around integration of prevention, treatment and recovery for behavioral health. Th e retreat will allow prevention to identify a more strategic role in planning and leveraging resources for universal, selective and indicated populations. Other FY 2016 plans included: A public education campaign through treatment funds to increase consu mer awareness of DBH system services; Broader awareness of the 24 hour DBH Access Help Line that provides immediate information and assistance for prevention, treatment and recovery behavioral health services; Inclusion of prevention standards in Chapter 63, a first step in accessing Medicaid funds for selective and indicated populations; Using Partnership for Success as a mechanism to establish a DBH workgroup on youth behavior health issues across prevention treatment and recovery. The focus is on high need communities and populations with identified disparities. Revising and developing a Risk Reduction strategy/curricu la that uses the five step SPF process for indicated and selective adolescent populations. District of Columbia Page 22 of 22 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 128 of 230Environmental Factors and Plan 10. Quality Improvement Plan Narrative Question: In previous block grant applications, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on pri nciples of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, consistent with the NBHQF, which will describe the health and functio ning of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that they continue to reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state's CQI process should also track programmatic improvem ents using stakeholder input, including the general population and individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints, and grievances. In an attachment to this application, states should submit a CQI plan for FY 2016 -FY 2017. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Please use the box below to indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section: Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 1 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page CQI Plan for FY 2016/2017 In addition to becoming a data driven agency, DBH has adopted a focus of continuous quality improvement. The Department recognizes that it must create a structured process for identifying gaps, analyzing and improving service delivery. The Department has instituted a number of internal and external workgroups that informs the CQI process and helps to promote a Total Quality Management (TQM) environment. Adopting the TQM philosophy will establish a new culture for behavioral health that will promote growth and longevity, build partnerships and meaningful collaborations with community agencies. This will also allow the agency to thrive in the changing healthcare environment and provide personal job satisfaction for internal and external staff by allowing for their input, creativity and efficiency in the work that they do. There are at eight major principles of the TQM. They include: customer focused mission; strong leadership; recruitment of stakeholders as change agents; system wide process approach; promoting efficient and effective systems; data driven decisions; continual improvement; and, fostering mutually beneficial relationships. Since 2013, the Department has been developing a foundation of CQI/TQM that will continue in 2016/17. Our focus is to become a customer focused agency that creates a team of change agents that will be instrumental in accomplishing our goals to improve the system of care for our clients. Our customers consist of: clients who are seeking treatment or recovery services; providers that look toward the SSA for oversight, guidance and support; community partners that also serve our clients; and, internal staff. In effort to learn more about these stakeholders and become more customer focused, the Department has begun to address the needs of our customers by instituting a process for client satisfaction surveys, provider meetings that illicit structured feedback and creating meaningful partnerships with community agencies. The Department has also created a Clinical Director's Practice Guideline work group that facilitates the improvement of clinical practice by fostering peer leadership and encouraging the clinical directors to become change agents within their agency. In 2016/17, the focus of the Department has also created a Clinical Director's Practice Guideline work group is be to assist them in incorporating CQI tools into their clinical process and help them to create a culture of quality improvement with their staff. The Department has developed an internal provider review roundtable to create efficient and effective systems that will move us towards achieving our goals. This is done through a review of all departments' data on provider performance. DBH has also instituted monthly staff meetings that focus on creating teams that are energized and feel like they are actively contributing towards achieving goals. Responsibilities related to the CQI/TQM process will be included in employee performance plans are created to make sure that every person in the agency is working towards achieving the goals for their department that also feed into the overall goal for the agency. In effort to engage our external stakeholders the Department has created a CQI Council comprised of internal and external staff to identify problems and use CQI tools (e.g., flowcharting, statistical process control, Pareto analysis, cause and effect diagrams, etc.) to improve service delivery. Additionally, DBH has created a Recovery Advisory Council (RAC) comprised of stakeholders and consumers that advise on long term planning, create a community voice for recovery and participate in creating a recovery oriented system of care in the District of Columbia. Also, Department has engaged other government partners in the CQI process to improve access and services for the clients we share. A component of the CQI process is the development of a comprehensive plan to monitor the delivery of all services that provider network delivers. This plan will identify target areas where resource allocation is necessary to align the quality of service with core strategic objectives and maximize the probability of desired outcomes. There are certain data sources the Department has consistently utilized for planning purposes such as the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) and National Outcome Measures (NOMS). As Recovery Support Services are fully integrated into the network's continuum in the District, similar measures will be refined accordingly to reflect the new landscape. More recently, the Department has developed core metrics to evaluate performance and outcomes achievement. These measures have been informed by; the Department's strategic objectives, programmatic priorities and available staff and IT resources. The measures are as follows: Page 1 District of Columbia Page 2 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 130 of 230Treatment : 1) Discharge Type Distribution: The distribution of, specifically, successful completions, dropouts, treatment terminations and referrals to other services. 2) Length of stay: The number of days between the admission date and the last date of service. This information is consolidated into clusters unique to the facility's level of care. Facility-level aggregates are collected as well as level of care aggregates (all residential, all detox, etc.) 3) Continuum of Care Usage: The number of clients successfully completing each residential provider who are connected to outpatient follow-up services as well as the number referred to Recovery Support Services. This metric is presented as a 2 X 2 matrix with the quadrants representing treatment only, recovery support only, both services, neither service. This measure is aggregated at the facility level as well as a combined measure for all residential facilities. 4) Service Type Distribution: The number of billed sessions of every service type within a given time frame (group counseling, individual counseling, family counseling, case management, assessment, and treatment plan development and/or modification). Due to the current billing format, this metric can only be applied to outpatient programs. 5) Encounter Note Turnaround Time: The number of days that pass between the date of the service and the date the note is created. This metric has been developed to give providers feedback on their adherence to the Medicaid requirement of documenting service within 48 hours. These data are presented visually in a column chart with each column corresponding to a specific range of turnaround time. Presented in this manner, the program can learn not only the degree to which it is in compliance of the future rule, but also how close it is to compliance with the rule. Recovery: 1) What percentage of clients have had new arrests since the onset of services? 2) What percentage of clients are in independent living at discharge? 3) What percentage of clients are employed at discharge? 4) What percentage of clients are attending self-help (e.g. 12-step meetings) in the community at discharge? Finance: 1) Does the program have a documented 90-day cash reserve? 2) What is the current asset-to-liabilities ratio? Target for this indicator is 1:1. 3) Does the program have a current Clean Hands Status? This status indicates the program is in compliance with all tax obligations. 4) Is the Triennial audit current? The Management Letter Comments and provider responses must be included in the documentation for this requirement to be satisfied. These are APRA's current metrics for evaluating critical outcomes and measuring the effectiveness of services. APRA will monitor these core metrics for every provider regularly over the course of five years. This plan will be revised after one year and the secondary set of metrics will be revisited to match our new improvement initiatives. At that point, metrics may be added if there is a gap in the information necessary to monitor outcomes effectively or if changes in the strategic plan of the agency necessitate new measurements of performance. An existing metric may be eliminated or replaced if that action is justified by revisions to the agency strategic plan and/or improvements in collection methodology. The data that emerges from these metrics, trended over time, will give APRA/DBH the information it needs to determine the programmatic improvements occurring within the system. The Department will take this information into account when developing: priorities for training; technical assistance; staffing; enhancements to the EHR; and, procurements of new software for monitoring purposes. Additionally, these metrics will inform the process of developing the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for DBH. The KPIs are a set of agency-wide measurements submitted to the City Council and the Office of the Mayor to provide ongoing feedback to the public on the performance of District Government agencies. The Department will conduct Customer Service Surveys in the Assessment and Referral Center and at contracted treatment providers to evaluate the client perspective on services rendered within the public substance abuse system. This information will inform decisions and priorities in training, technical assistance and further exploration through monitoring. The ARC will re-examine the survey content annually and make necessary revisions. This process will: remove any items that are no longer relevant; revise items that require refined wording or clarity; add items that Page 2 District of Columbia Page 3 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 131 of 230reflect emergent focus areas in customer service; and, take into account client feedback. The data from previous rounds of surveying, and feedback from personnel conducting the survey, will be taken into account when revising the survey items. Complaints are documented and submitted on Unusual Incident/Grievance Report Form. The Office of Accountability reviews the information and a Notice of Investigation is sent to the provider or administration. The facility or administration will have a 10-day period to respond to the Notice of Investigation. The facility or administration must: confirm or deny each stated allegation; provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances relevant to each allegation; take actions to address any allegation for which there is a factual basis; and, take steps to decrease the likelihood of recurrence (both immediate and long-term). In addition, the response must include the documents identified in the attached Request for Documents. If necessary, the facility or administration may request an extension of up to 10 calendar days in order to complete the investigation. Written findings of the investigation must be submitted to the Department within 24 hours of completing the investigation. As part of the CQI process, the Department has adopted a standard grievance investigation process. Every person that files a grievance receives a receipt that acknowledges that his or her grievance has been entered in a formalized process. The Risk Manager identifies the issues and makes a determination if actions are needed to prevent additional harm before the investigation begins. The investigative team then gathers and analyzes information to develop recommendations. The Department has developed a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) plan in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency. The COOP is initiated in the case of a critical incident. Emergency planning exercises are conducted regularly as practicing is essential to ensure effective execution of the COOP during actual critical incidents.

Trauma Narrative Question: Trauma 75 is a widespread, harmful and costly public health problem. It occurs as a result of violence, abuse, neglect, loss, disaster, war and other emotionally harmful experiences. Trauma has no boundaries with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, geography, or sexual orientation. It is an almost universal experience of people with mental and substance use difficulties. The need to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an important component of effective behavioral health service delivery. Additionally, it has become evident that addressing trauma requires a multi -pronged, multi -agency public health approach inclusive of public education and awareness, prevention and early identification, and effective trauma -specific assessment and treatment. To maximize the impact of these efforts, they need to be provided in an organizational or community context that is trauma -informed, that is, based on the knowledge and understanding of trauma and its far - reaching implications. The effects of traumatic events place a heavy burden on individuals, families and communities and create challenges for publi c institutions and service systems 76. Although many people who experience a traumatic event will go on with their lives without lasting negative effects, others will have more difficulty and experience traumatic stress reactions. Emerging research has documented the relationships among exposure to traumatic events, impaired neurodevelopmental and immune systems responses, and subsequent health risk behaviors resulting in chronic physical or behavioral health disorders. Research has also indicated that with appropriate supports and intervention, people can overcome traumatic experiences. However, most people go without these services and supports. Individuals with experiences of trauma are found in multiple service sectors, not just in behavioral health. People in the juvenile and criminal justice system have high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders and personal histories of trauma. Children and families in the child welfare system similarly experience high rates of trauma and associated behavioral health problems. Many patients in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative health care similarly have significant trauma histories, which has an impact on their health and their responsiveness to health interventions. In addition, the public institutions and service systems that are intended to provide services and supports for individuals a re often themselves re - traumatizing, making it necessary to rethink doing \"business as usual. \" These public institutions and service settings are increasingly adopting a trauma -informed approach guided by key principles of safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, empowerment, collaborat ion, and sensitivity to cultural and gender issues, and incorporation of trauma -specific screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery practices. To meet the needs of those they serve, states should take an active approach to addressing trauma. Trauma screening matched with trauma - specific therapies, such as exposure therapy or trauma -focused cognitive behavioral approaches, should be used to ensure that treatments meet the needs of those being served. States should also consider adopting a trauma -informed approach consistent with \"SAMHSA 's Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma -Informed Approach \". 77 This means providing care based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional service delivery approaches may exacerbate, so that these services and programs can be supportive and avoid traumatizing the individuals again. It is suggested that the states uses SAMHSA 's guidance for implementing the trauma -informed approach discussed in the Concept of Trauma 78 paper. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Does the state have policies directing providers to screen clients for a personal history of trauma and to connect individual s to trauma - focused therapy?1.

As part of the screening and assessment process with DBH, whether through the agency's Assessment and Referral Center (ARC) or one of its contracted detox service providers, there is a thorough biopsychosocial assessment conducted on each individual entering our system. This process consists of a GAIN SS screen to identify the severity of need for further substance use or mental health challenge assessment. If further assessment is identified, the individual is then assessed using the Treatment Assessment Protocol (TAP), which is a combination of the American Society of Addictions Medicine Patient Placement Criteria (ASAM-PPC) and the GAIN-I. The TAP includes several trauma assessment questions, which directly correlates to the identified problems and subsequent goals on the individual treatment plan. All individuals receiving District funded substance use treatment services are assessed using the TAP, either at the ARC, or at one of the two designated detox entry sites into the treatment system. The Department is reviewing its Chapter 63 regulations, the foundation for District substance abuse service provision, to include more explicit policies in support the use of specific EBP's including those to address trauma issues. The Department is also currently reviewing its policies around trauma screening, to incorporate screens for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), to better inform individual treatment plans Describe the state's policies that promote the provision of trauma-informed care. All District funded substance use providers are governed by the agency's Title 22A, Chapter 63 Certification Standard, which clearly speaks to the need for providers to coordinate individualized care for the population seeking services, by connecting them to services matched to their identified problem and treatment goals. This policy incorporates the need to match individuals in care with trauma histories, to the appropriate trauma-focused care. This is the only way to ensure that individuals with histories of trauma recognize and acknowledge the role that trauma played in their lives, in order for them to work on changing any negative behaviors associated with the trauma. How does the state promote the use of evidence-based trauma-specific interventions across the lifespan? DBH, working with our contracted provider network has identified the initial implementation costs of EBP development as a barrier to greater dissemination of such practices in the District. The Department is prioritizing seeking out a diverse funding stream and community partnerships to assist the providers in overcoming this obstacle. The Department has trained some providers in Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment. Our partnership with the Child and Family Services Agency will create opportunities for providers to be trained in Trauma Systems Therapy. What types of trainings do you provide to increase capacity of providers to deliver trauma-specific interventions? The Department has partnered with Child and Family Services (CFSA) the District's child welfare agency to provide trauma informed care training to the adolescent substance abuse providers. National research has shown that childhood trauma injures a children's brain and impairs physical development and function. The result is that these adverse childhood experiences (ACE) have a negative impact have a conservative estimate of 70 percent of the population. If there's one trauma, there is 95 percent likelihood that there are other types of trauma. ATOD are often the way children and adolescents cope with trauma. When they are adults, the trauma experienced as a child can become legal or social problems including chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, depressing and lung cancer. The Department's Office of Prevention is focusing the DCEOW on collecting and analyzing ACE data to identify early childhood risk and protective factors that can be used to target early preventive interventions. DCEOW representatives include a cross-cutting team of District leaders from: the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, Child and Family Services Administration, Youth Rehabilitation Services, Metropolitan Police Department, Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Department of Health, and the Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation. This work will set the stage for a renewed look at the risk and protective factor model especially in urban areas and culturally diverse populations. As the developers of the Social Immunization Approach to Public Health and Substance Abuse stated in an editorial published in the Journal of the National Medical Association: Overall data on illicit drug use hides the fact that residents of some communities are at greater Page 1 District of Columbia Page 2 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 134 of 230risk than those living elsewhere. For example, we know there is substantially higher prevalence of illicit drug use among inner-city residents than among those who reside in suburban or rural areas. It is essential that these high-risk communities be specifically identified so that the available drug control resources can be provided to them on a priority basis. The editorial also supported an analysis of epidemiological and census data the zip code level in order to clearly identify affected areas. While ACE is generally considered a tool to assess individual adult trauma, APRA is focusing prevention efforts on universal, selective and indicated strategies that prevent and reduce the effects of trauma in stressful and high risk community environments. Does the state provide trainings to increase capacity of providers to deliver trauma-specific interventions? CFSA has been awarded a $3.2 million ($640,000 per year for five years) federal grant, which will be used to make trauma-informed care the foundation of serving children and youth in the District's child welfare system. In collaboration with other youth serving community agencies, CFSA chose the Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) Model. The TST model focuses on addressing trauma in two ways (1) a traumatized child or youth who cannot regulate his/her emotional state and (2) a social environment/system of care that cannot help contain this regulation. TST focuses on the child and on his/her relationships and surroundings.

Criminal and Juvenile Justice Narrative Question: More than half of all prison and jail inmates meet criteria for having mental health problems, six in ten meet criteria for a substance use problem, and more than one third meet criteria for having co -occurring substance abuse and mental health problems. Successful diversion from or re - entering the community from detention, jails, and prisons is often dependent on engaging in appropriate substance use and/or mental health treatment. Some states have implemented such efforts as mental health, veteran and drug courts, crisis intervention training and re -entry programs to help reduce arrests, imprisonment and recidivism.79 The SABG and MHBG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre -adjudication or pre -sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. Communities across the United States have instituted problem -solving courts, including those for defendants with mental and substance use disorders. These courts seek to prevent incarceration and facilitate community -based treatment for offenders, while at the same time protecting public safety. There are two types of problem -solving courts related to behavioral health: drug courts and mental health courts. In addition to these behavioral health problem -solving courts, some jurisdictions operate courts specifically for DWI/DUI, veterans, families, and reentry, as well as court s for gambling, domestic violence, truancy, and other subject -specific areas.80 81 Rottman described the therapeutic value of problem -solving courts: \"Specialized courts provide a forum in which the adversarial process can be relaxed and problem -solving and treatment processes emphasized. Specialized courts can be structured to retain jurisdiction over defendants, promoting the continuity of supervision and acco untability of defendants for their behavior in treatment programs.\" Youths in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high -risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient use of community -based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow -up or supervision; therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.82 Expansions in insurance coverage will mean that many individuals in jails and prisons, who generally have not had health cove rage in the past, will now be able to access behavioral health services. Addressing the behavioral health needs of these individuals can reduce recidivism, improve public safety, reduce criminal justice expenditures, and improve coordination of care for a population that disproportionatel y experiences costly chronic physical and behavioral health conditions. Addressing these needs can also reduce health care system utilization and improve broader health outcomes. Achieving these goals will require new efforts in enrollment, workforce development, screening for risks and needs, and implementing appropriate treatment and recovery services. This will also involve coordination across Medicaid, criminal and j uvenile justice systems, SMHAs, and SSAs. A diversion program places youth in an alternative program, rather than processing them in the juvenile justice system. State s should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing to divert persons with menta l and/or substance use disorders from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as a lack of identifica tion needed for enrollment; loss of eligibility resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for individuals with chronic health condi tions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are present to advocate for alte rnatives to detention. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: Are individuals involved in, or at risk of involvement in, the criminal and juvenile justice system enrolled in Medicaid as a part of coverage expansions? 1. Are screening and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing for individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders? 2.

Yes. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) enrolls individuals involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems in Medicaid as a part of coverage expansion. Through the establishment of DBH, we have focused public awareness and policy attention on the implementation of behavioral health by further investigating each client's insurance posture and engaging and enrolling people into Medicaid with substance use and/or mental health disorders who are in the justice system. We know that treatment is effective and recovery is possible, even with criminal justice involvement. Therefore, we have devised a system that best supports Medicaid participation, healthy individuals and a strong community, which includes extensive partnership with the criminal justice community. The criminal justice community benefits from DBH which integrates treatment and mental health services for District of Columbia residents, as well as residents within the criminal justice system, with both mental health and substance use disorders. DBH provides integrated care that provides SUD treatment and supports for individuals with mental health care for the dually diagnosed. A significant number of the criminal justice population has both mental health and substance use disorders at the same time. In the past treatment and supports were delivered separately, which required people seeking help for both illnesses to navigate two separate agencies, this was particularly onerous for individuals with criminal justice involvement. Therefore, with integrated treatment, any combination of needs is addressed properly. Our integrated system effectively serves individuals involved in the criminal justice system with co-occurring disorders whether they are seeking help for substance use disorders or mental health conditions. Are screening and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing for individuals with mental health and/ or substance use disorders? Yes. DBH consists of 86 providers that treat approximately 35,000 residents for one or the other disorder, with a number of providers being dual diagnose capable. DBH ensures that pre-trial providers are competent to assess for both mental health and substance use disorders at the same time so we can design the proper treatment. DBH implements a process that sustains clinical services and maintains an infrastructure within the mental health and substance abuse systems to support integrated pre-trial service delivery. Currently, DBH pre-trial services include: D GAIN Short Screener (GAIN SS): The Short Screener essentially provides a screening to determine level of substance abuse severity and MH severity. A positive result will initiate a referral for a full assessment using the Treatment Assignment Protocol (TAP). Treatment Assignment protocol (TAP): The TAP provides the court with the appropriate placement into substance abuse treatment. Many Courts will rely on DBH's assessment and this can be incorporated into an order or probation requirement. With Client consent we release the assessment and drug screens to the court with appropriate referral information. D Court Urgent Care Clinic (CUCC): Individuals receive immediate access to mental health services in the court house. CUCC provides screenings and mental health assessments for Pre-trial Services Agency (PSA), which recommends release conditions and makes referrals for mental health services to DBH and contacts CSAs for mental health information, screens candidates for Options Program. Individuals are referred from Traffic Court, PSA, Judges, community agencies and others. D Options Program: Individuals who are not currently linked and have a history of non-compliance with court dates are referred to Options. D Competency Assessments and Restoration Services: Competency Restorations occurs on an inpatient or outpatient basis, based upon the specific needs profile of the client, here in D.C. Do the SMHA and SSA coordinate with the criminal justice system with respect to District of Columbia Page 3 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 138 of 230Page 2 diversion of individuals with mental health and/or substance use disorders, behavioral health services provided in correctional facilities and the reentry process for those individuals? Yes. To better serve District residents who have become involved with the criminal justice system, substance abuse system, and/or the mental health system, DBH and it's criminal justice partners have been incorporating policies put in place by the Substance Abuse Treatment and Mental Health Services Integration Taskforce (SATMHSIT, 2009-2015). These policies were developed to improve treatment options available to defendants and ex-offenders. Through the services of the Court Urgent Care Clinic (CUCC) and the District of Columbia Superior Court (DCSC) diversion policies, the clinic provides court-based services for defendants with mental health disorders. Initially, the CUCC was incorporated to provide mentally ill defendants of the District's Misdemeanor and Traffic Community Court with immediate access to mental health services and connecti on to a DBH mental health provider. The CUCC has since expanded service delivery to accept referrals from the Pre-Trial Services Agency (PSA) and other courtrooms in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. As well the CUCC expanded their array of services available by offering assessments and referrals to substance abuse treatment programs for individuals with substance use disorders. As it relates to juveniles, The Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program (JBDP) was established as a problem-solving court. In order to participate in the program, the juvenile or status offender must have an Axis I mental health disorder or be at significant risk of receiving an Axis I diagnosis. The respondent may also have an Axis II developmental disability as long as he or she is able to participate in the program, but they cannot solely have an Axis II diagnosis. The Program is an intensive non-sanction based program designed to link juveniles and status offenders to, and engage them in, appropriate mental health services and supports in the community in order to reduce behavioral symptoms that result in contact with the court and to improve the juvenile's functioning in the home, school, and community. Are cross trainings provided for behavioral health providers and criminal/juvenile justice personnel to increase capacity for working with individuals with behavioral health issues involved in the justice system. Yes. DBH has a Training Institute that provides high-quality learning opportunities to employees, consumers, providers, criminal justice partners and other partners who support mental health services in the District. The Training Institute mission is to continually strengthen the knowledge, technical skills and the quality of services and supports through the development of a dynamic, culturally and linguistically responsive, performance -based and data-driven learning environment. As well there is a specific training course the Co-Occurring Certification Training (COD) which emphasizes dual diagnosi s and co-occurring competent applications of service delivery. With the assistance of DBH the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) has trained to over 730 MPD officers since the program's inception in April 2009. Approximately 125 new CIOs are trained every year, including people from other law enforcement agencies in the District such as the Capital Police, Protective Services Division, and the Metropolitan Police. In addition to these specially -trained officers, every MPD officer will receive mental health training to learn appropriate techniques to use when responding to calls-for-service involving mentally ill residents.

State Parity Efforts Narrative Question: MHPAEA generally requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to ensure that financial requirements and treatment limitations applied to M/SUD benefits are no more restrictive than the requirements or limitations applied to medical/surgical benefits. The legislation applies to both private and public sector employer plans that have more than 50 employees, including both self -insured and fully insured arrangements. MHPAEA also applies to health insurance issuers that sell coverage to employers with more than 50 employees. The Affordable Care Act extends these requirements to issuers selling individual market coverage. Small group and individual issuers partici pating in the Marketplaces (as well as most small group and individual issuers outside the Marketplaces) are required to offer EHBs, which are required by statute to include services for M/SUDs and behavioral health treatment - and to comply with MHPAEA. Guidance was released for states in January 2013.83 MHPAEA requirements also apply to Medicaid managed care, alternative benefit plans, and CHIP. ASPE estimates that more than 6 0 million Americans will benefit from new or expanded mental health and substance abuse coverage under parity requirements. However, pu blic awareness about MHPAEA has been limited. Recent research suggests that the public does not fully understand how behavioral he alth benefits function, what treatments and services are covered, and how MHPAEA affects their coverage.84 Parity is vital to ensuring persons with mental health conditions and substance use disorders receive continuous, coordinated , care. Increasing public awareness about MHPAEA could increase access to behavioral health services, provide financial benefits to individuals and families, and lead to reduced confusion and discrimination associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. Block grant recipients should continue to monitor federal parity regulations and guidance and collaborate with state Medicaid authorities, insurance regulators, ins urers, employers, providers, consumers and policymakers to ensure effective parity implementation and comprehensive, consistent communication w ith stakeholders. SSAs, SMHAs and their partners may wish to pursue strategies to provide information, education, and technical assistance on parity -related issues. Medicaid programs will be a key partner for recipients of MHBG and SABG funds and providers supported by these funds. SMHAs and SSAs should collaborate with their state's Medicaid authority in ensuring parity within Medicaid programs. SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to improve consumer knowledge about parity. As one plan of action, states ca n develop communication plans to provide and address key issues. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: What fiscal resources are used to develop communication plans to educate and raise awareness about parity? 1. Does the state coordinate across public and private sector entities to increase consumer awareness and understanding about be nefits of the law (e.g., impacts on covered benefits, cost sharing, etc.)?2. Does the state coordinate across public and private sector entities to increase awareness and understanding among health plan s and health insurance issuers of the requirements of MHPAEA and related state parity laws and to provide technical assistance as n eeded?3.

State Parity Efforts The Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), the state Medicaid agency, conducted a preliminary analysis of mental health services offered through DBH. The DHCF determined that the District was in parity with the physical health benefits offered through Medicaid. However, an analysis of the substance use disorder services is pending. DHCF anticipates additional technical assistance from the Centers from Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

Medication Assisted Treatment Narrative Question: There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of FDA -approved medications for the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment programs in the U.S. offer only abstinence -based treatment for these conditions. The evidence base for medication -assisted treatment of these disorders is described in SAMHSA TIPs 4085, 4386, 4587, and 4988. SAMHSA strongly encourages the states to require that treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use disorders be required to either have the capacity and staff ex pertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other providers such that these MATs can be accessed as clinically indicated for patien t need. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA -approved medication treatment should have access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs. SAMHSA strongly encourages states to require the use of FDA -approved MATs for substance use disorders where clinically indicated (opioid use disorders with evidence of physical dependence, alcohol use disorders, tobacco use disorders) and particularly in cases of re lapse with these disorders. SAMHSA is asking for input from states to inform SAMHSA's activities. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: How will or can states use their dollars to develop communication plans to educate and raise awareness within substance abuse treatment programs and the public regarding medication -assisted treatment for substance use disorders? 1. What steps and processes can be taken to ensure a broad and strategic outreach is made to the appropriate and relevant audien ces that need access to medication -assisted treatment for substance use disorders, particularly pregnant women?2. What steps will the state take to assure that evidence -based treatments related to the use of FDA -approved medications for treatment of substance use disorders are used appropriately (appropriate use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychosocial treatments with medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and/or dive rsion of controlled substances used in treatment of substance use disorders, advocacy with state payers)?3. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. 85 use the box below to indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section: Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 1 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 142 of 230Page 1 Medication Assisted Treatment The use of medications in substance use disorder treatment has a 40 year history. The medication used to treat SUD includes buprenorphine, methadone, disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone and injectable naltrexone. In the District, the four certified programs provide MAT services in four of the eight Wards for opioid addiction with the use of Methadone or injectable naltrexone medic ations. In addition, detoxification services are available in three certified programs which include a jail-based program and two detoxification programs. In providing MAT services, providers must act for the benefit of the patient by providing competent, timely, evidenced based treatment practices or Beneficence; respect the rights of the patient to decide their treatment modali ty or Autonomy; do no harm or injure the patient by monitoring and making dose adjust ments or Non-malfeasance ; and act with fairness and advocate for clients or Justice. In the DBH Intake, clients are given a choice of program for treatment services after the comprehensive assessment. With the provider being certified under the regulations, this ensures beneficence and non- malfeasance . Advocacy begins when the client enters the DBH Intake. The staff gives the information to the \"right\" client for the \"right\" program for the \"right\" services. Within the four Wards, treatment services are available for the poverty stricken individual to the most affluent individual as it relates to socio - economic status. How will or can states use their dollars to develop communication plans to educate and raise awareness within substance abuse treatment programs and the public regarding medication -assisted treatment for substance use disorder s? The District will develop a year plan with intense communications the first 90 days and established follow up scheduled. The communication avenues shall include PSA, billboards, social media, and television and fact sheets. The intent of the message is to de-stigmatize medication assisted treatment and strengthen the message of the positive outcomes of use of MAT such as family reunification and employment stability. Also, a visual campaign with a spoke person, either department heads or former or actual client to reinforce the message. Currently, DBH has on-going communications with the provider netwo rk. These are excellent venues to keep the message thriving. The provider meetings include the Monthly Provider Meetings, Meetings with MAT and emails. For community messaging, the Outreach Teams distribute flyers and postcards with informat ion on how to assess SUD services. What steps and processes can be taken to ensure a broad and strate gic outreach is made to the appropriate and relevant audiences that need access to medication -assisted treatment for substance use disorders, particu larly pregnant women? In the District, women with children and pregnant women have prior ity access to treatment. The Intake Center test for pregnancy and if positive the client is linked to SUD treatment and primary care for the unborn child and mother. Also, the Department has a Mobile Assessor (Social Worker) at the Child and Family Services Administration (CFSA), government agency focusing on women 's needs for SUD screening and assessments to refer to treatment. Thus, access to SUD treatment for women was increased in that the women can be screened in multiple locations. Access to MAT service for special population is achieved by removi ng any barriers to service. The District provides a mobile vehicle for outreach in communities in most need of servi ces. The services include on-site assessments and referral to SUD District of Columbia Page 2 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 143 of 230Page 2 services to pregnant women, post-partum and women with children. The District also a ssists and encourage s providers to operate MATs for special populations. The District f acilitate s collaborative efforts with other organiz ations and agencies that services women and children to provide assessments on demand with seamless entry into treatment. Women have unique circumstances which are distinct from other popu lations such as child care. Grants are offered assist programs with \"daycare\" for non-school age children. This helps the women to focus on the treatment regimen while in the program rather than caring for her children. Women are pre-occupied with feeding their family. Thus the programs providing services to this population incorporate resources such as TANF to purchase food and other necessities for their children. Women have gynecology care needs. Programs have trained staff or MOU s with OB-GYN facilities for this service. Having a physician or medical staff trained in OB-GYN and SUD prove s helpful in servicing the wom en needs during treatment. Transportation is another concern for women with childr en. Again, assistance with fare cards or tokens are offered as an incentive in treatment. What steps will the state take to assure that evidence -based treatments related to the use of FDA -approved medications for treatment of substance use disorders are used appropriately (appropriate use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychosocial treatments with medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and/or diversion of controlled substances used in treatment of substance use disorders, advocacy with state payers)? In the District, the FDA -approved medications used in SUD treatment are Methadone and injectable naltrexone medication. The programs provide SUD treatment to almost two thousand clients. The evidence based models used by the provid ers are designed to address their addictions and the impact on their lives, family and communities. Some of the programs have peer supports incorporated in SUD treatm ent services. The District's regulations require the MAT clinics to provide SUD treatment (group , individual , and counseling) in conjunction with MAT dosing. The outcomes are better when co-morbidities and social services are addressed in treatment. The Department focus es on the well-being of the individual to include SUD treatment, utilization of evidence based treatments models and primary health care of clients in MAT programs. The Department implements policy to ensure a quality improvement process and scheduled inspections. Providers are required to have a diversion policy that include s a \"call back\" or having clients to return to the program with bottles to ensure accountability of the medica tion. Advocacy starts at the point of entry into the SUD system from self-advocac y, family, staff and peers. The Department continues to raise advocate and raise awareness and remove the stigma of addiction. This involves influencing laws, sponsoring supportive r ecovery events, and disseminating materials.

Crisis Services Narrative Question: In the on -going development of efforts to build an evidence -based robust system of care for persons diagnosed with SMI, SED and addictive disorders and their families via a coordinated continuum of treatments, services and supports, growing attention is being pai d across the country to how states and local communities identify and effectively respond to, prevent, manage and help individuals, famili es, and communities recover from behavioral health crises. SAMHSA has taken a leadership role in deepening the understanding of what it means to be in crisis and how to respond to a cr isis experienced by people with behavioral health conditions and their families. According to SAMHSA's publication, Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises89 , \"Adults, children, and older adults with an SMI or emotional disorder often lead lives characterized by recurrent, significan t crises. These crises are not the inevitable consequences of mental disability, but rather represent the combined impact of a host of additional factors, including lack of access to essential services and supports, poverty, unstable housing, coexisting substance use, other health problems, discrimination and victimization.\" A crisis response system will have the capacity to prevent, recognize, respond, de -escalate, and follow -up from crises across a continuum, from crisis planning, to early stages of support and respite, to crisis stabilization and intervention, to post -crisis follow -up and support for the individual and their family. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the emerging and growing body of evidence for effective community - based crisis -prevention and response systems. Given the multi -system involvement of many individuals with behavioral health issues, the crisis system approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs and better invest resourc es.

These are c alled \"crisis services .\" These services are designed to stabilize individu als in psychological distress and engage them in the most appropriate course of treatment. In contrast to inpatient -based care, these services are designed to reach people in their own communities. The continuum of services includes telephone hotlines, peer crisis services, crisis intervention teams, mobile crisis services, crisis stabilization beds, short -term residential services, and more. The evidence that crisis services work is growing. The District has implemented guidelines to improve services for people with serious mental illness or emotional disorder who are in mental health crises. Trainings are available to persons and community to identify the values, principles, and infrastructure to support appropriate to the responses to mental health crises in various situations to be protected. The research shows, for example, that short - term reside ntial stabilization services, which use 24-hour observation and supervis ion to prevent or resolve crises are as effective at improving symptoms as longer psychiatric inpatient care. Plus, patients report strong satisfaction with these services. In the District 's Assessment and Referral Center (ARC) , there are 3-4 crises occurring week ly. The Intake Staff responds to behavioral health crises by quickly recognizing, intervening and de-escalating the client. The brief interventions along with evidence driven strategies includes a visual assessment, calming the client follow ed by the appropriate interventions. The ARC is equipped with oxyg en, AED and vital signs monitoring machines to obtain baseline data with a progress note for a warm hand off to ambulance, hospitals and psychiatric services. The Social Workers, Counselors , and Nurse s are crossed - trained with the emergency psych iatric division to recognize symptoms and to care for clients experiencing a psychiat ric crisis. In addition, the staff received additional trainings in substance use disorder and mental health crisis and hold certifications in the courses. The District collaborates with the Police and emergency psychiatric division/Mo bile Crisis for emergency crisis in the facility. To preempt a crisis response , the nursing assessment includes linking clients to primary care and urgent care systems for services prior to going into treatment. The nursing assessment also includes a careful review of medications and ensuring a sufficient amount of medications, 30 day supply with refills, accompany the client into treatment. Medical and psychia tric components are addressed during the assessment. In addition, the ARC has a designated room for short term isolations from the general population until outside support system arrives and for health outbreaks such as Ebola . This room provides privacy, maintains the confident iality and dignity of the client during the isolation. Staff remains with the client during the isolation, if needed. Most often, clients report to the Intake Center unaccompanied. When they are accompanied with family or Case Workers, after allowing permission and signing the consent, these persons are allowed to be a part of the screening. The Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) is a twenty -four hour/seven day a week operation that provides emergency psychiatric services, mobile crisis services and extended observation beds for individuals 18 years of age and older. Mobile crisis services teams respond to adults throughout the District who are experiencing a psychiatric crisis whether in the homes or on the street and who are unable or unwilling to travel to receive mental health services. Clinicians also are available to provide counseling support after traumatic events whether personal or community wide. The teams provide crisis stabilization including dispensing medication and perform assessment for voluntary and involuntary District of Columbia Page 3 of 4 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 147 of 230Page 2 hospitalizations and linkages to other services, such as crisis beds and substance abuse detoxification and treatment. The teams work with family members and the community based mental health provider, if appropriate, to help with follow up. The Crisis Intervention Officer initiative (CIO) is a partnership between the Department of Behavioral Health and the Metropolitan Police Department (M PD) to strengthen the District's ability to support people with Behavioral Health issues who come to the attention of law enforc ement but do not meet the threshold for arrest. Officers are trained to recognize the signs of mental illness, determine the most appropriate response, and use de-escalation techniques that build on their skills and training. CPEP provides emergency psychiatric services 24 hours a day, seven days a week to evaluate patients who have a mental health concern or crisis. The psychiatric team works in consultation with emergency room physicians to provide specialized behavioral health assessments, including c omprehensive psychiatric assessments , crisis intervention , recommendations for level of care including inpatient psychiatric hospitalization , and r eferrals to appropriate behavior al health resources . One of the District's services providers, t he Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) , provides comprehensi ve behavioral healthcare for children, adolescents, adults and senior adults who have mental health and addictive illnesses. The short -term, acute care hospital offers inpatient, partial and intensive outpatient programs, as well as specialized treatment programs for chemical dependency.

Recovery Narrative Question: The implementation of recovery -based approaches is imperative for providing comprehensive, quality behavioral health care. The expansion in access to and coverage for health care compels SAMHSA to promote the availability, quality, and financing of vital services a nd support systems that facilitate recovery for individuals. Recovery encompasses the spectrum of individual needs related to those with mental disorders and/or substance use disorders. Recovery is supported through the key components of health (access to quality health and behavioral health treatment), home (housing with needed supports), purpose (education, employment, and other pursuits), and community (peer, family, and other social supports). The principles of recovery guide the approach to person -centered care that is inclusive of shared decision -making. The continuum of care for these conditions includes psychiatric and psychosocial interventions to address acute episodes or recurrence of symptoms associated with an in dividual 's mental or substance use disorder. This includes the use of psychotropic or other medications for mental illnesses or addictions to a ssist in the diminishing or elimination of symptoms as needed. Further, the use of psychiatric advance directives is encouraged to provide an individual the opportunity to have an active role in their own treatment even in times when the severity of their symptoms may impair cognit ion significantly. Resolution of symptoms through acute care treatment contributes to the stability necessary for individuals to pursue their on going recovery and to make use of SAMHSA encouraged recovery resources. SAMHSA has developed the following working definition of recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders: Recovery is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. In addition, SAMHSA identified 10 guiding principles of recovery: Recovery emerges from hope; Recovery is person -driven; Recovery occurs via many pathways; Recovery is holistic; Recovery is supported by peers and allies; Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks; Recovery is culturally -based and influenced; Recovery is supported by addressing trauma; Recovery involves individuals, families, community strengths, and responsibility; Recovery is based on respect. Please see SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery from Mental Disorders and Substance Use Disorders . States are strongly encouraged to consider ways to incorporate recovery support services, including peer -delivered services, into their continuum of care. Examples of evidence -based and emerging practices in peer recovery support services include, but are not limited to, the following: District of Columbia Page 1 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 149 of 230employment SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services, and is seeking input from states to address this position. To accomplish this goal and support the wide -scale adoption of recovery supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TAC S assists states and others to promote adoption of recovery -oriented supports, services, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers and their family members. States should work to support and help stre ngthen existing consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery organizations; and community peer support and advocacy organizations in expanding self-advocacy, self -help programs, support networks, and recovery support services. There are many activities that SMHAs and SSAs can undertake to engage these individuals and families. In the space below, states should describe their efforts to engage indivi duals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state mental health and substance abuse treatment system. Please consider the following items as a guideline when preparing the description of the state's system: Does the state have a plan that includes: the definition of recovery and recovery values, evidence of hiring people in recove ry leadership roles, strategies to use person -centered planning and self -direction and participant -directed care, variety of recovery services and supports (i.e., peer support, recovery support coaching, center services, supports for self -directed care, peer navigators, consumer/family education, etc.)?1. How are treatment and recovery support services coordinated for any individual served by block grant funds?2. Does the state's plan include peer -delivered services designed to meet the needs of specific populations, such as veterans and military families, people with a history of trauma, members of racial/ethnic groups, LGBT populations, and families/significant others ?3. Does the state provide or support training for the professional workforce on recovery principles and recovery -oriented practice and systems, including the role of peer providers in the continuum of services? Does the state have an accreditation program, cer tification program, or standards for peer -run services?4. Does the state conduct empirical research on recovery supports/services identification and dissemination of best practices in recovery supports/services or other innovative and exemplary activities that support the implementation of recovery -oriented approaches, and services within the state 's behavioral health system?5.

Does the state have a plan that includes: the definition of recove ry and recovery values, evidence of hiring people in recovery leadership roles, strategies to use person -centered planning and self-directed and participant -directed care, variety of recovery services and supports? The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) does not have a formal Recovery Plan. There is a draft proposed plan. However, the department is providi ng recovery support services. These services include: recovery evaluation; care coordination; life skills support; spiritual support; recovery coaching & mentor ing; education support services; transportation support; parenting support; family support; recovery social activities; and environmental stability. The depar tment under the training institute workforce development plan offers a two day training on client centered planning and participant - directed care. The Department has documented evidence of hiring and recruiting people in recovery in leadership roles as program staff, program directors, supervisors and program monitors through the Office of Consumer and Family Affairs. Through the Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistan ce Center Strategy (BRSS TACS) grant DBH has assisted in the development of a consumer (mental health & substance use disorders) run advocacy group DC Recovery Advisory Council (DC RAC) 2013 to present. The goal of the council is to set up a frame work for a Recovery Oriented System of Care (ROSC) in the District of Columbia to include all disciplines, individuals and families. The DC RAC will recommend recovery based strategies to the Department of Behavioral Health and other Govern ment agencies to improve, promote, prevent, and provide intervention, treatment and recovery support services in the District. Technical Assistance Needs: The development of a behavioral health system -wide Recovery Plan. How are treatment and recovery support services coordinated for any individual served by block grant funds? The treatment and recovery support services are truly integrated in to the treatment continuum in the District. The District has recently finalized its regulatory chapter, Title 22A, Chapter 63 of the DCMR. These regulations gove rn treatment and recovery support services. Any individual eligible for care will receive an assessment to determine the intensity of treatment and recovery services. Individuals eligible for care will receive a recovery support evaluation which guides service planning. Recovery support services are offered as an alternative to treatment, in conjunction with treatment, and/ or as a continuation in the recovery process. The recovery support services include: Recovery Support Evaluation; Recovery Support Management; Recovery Coaching; Life Skills Support Services; Education Support Services; Social Activities; and Transp ortation Services (Public);Spiritual Support Services; and Environmental Stability.

Community Living and the Implementation of Olmstead Narrative Question: The integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), provide legal requirements that are consistent with SAMHSA's mission to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illne ss on America's communities. Being an active member of a community is an important part of recovery for persons with behavioral health conditions. Title II of the ADA and the regulations promulgated for its enforcement require that states provide services in t he most integrated arrangement appropriate and prohibit needless institutionalization and segregation in work, living, and other settings. In re sponse to the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the Coordinating Council on Community Living was created at HHS. SAMHSA has been a key member of the council and has funded a number of technical assistance opportunities to promote integrated services for people with behavioral health needs, including a policy academy to share effective practices with states. Community living has been a priority across the federal government with recent changes to Section 811 and other housing progr ams operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD and HHS collaborate to support housing opportunities for person s with disabilities, including persons with behavioral illnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) cooperate on enforcement and compliance measures. DOJ and OCR have expressed concern about some aspects of state mental health systems inc luding use of traditional institutions and other residences that have institutional characteristics to house persons whose needs could b e better met in community settings. More recently, there has been litigation regarding certain supported employment services such as sheltere d workshops. States should ensure block grant funds are allocated to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services in community set tings whenever feasible and remain committed, as SAMHSA is, to ensuring services are implemented in accordance with Olmstead and Title II of the ADA. It is requested that the state submit their Olmstead Plan as a part of this application, or address the following when descri bing community living and implementation of Olmstead: Describe the state's Olmstead plan including housing services provided, home and community based services provided through Medicaid, peer support services, and employment services.1.

L.C ., 527 U. S. 581, that the unjust ified segregation or isolat ion of people with disabilities in instituti ons may consti tute discrimination based on disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Accordin gly, the Court held that the ADA re quires that States provide community-based treatment for persons with disabilities \" when the State's treatment professionals determine that su ch placement is appropr iate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonably acco mmodated, taking into acco unt the resources a vailable to the States and the needs of others with . . . disabilities.\" 5 27 U.S. at 607. In light of this decision, the Dist rict instituted a comprehensive working plan to serve qualified individuals with disabilities in ac cordance with the Supreme Court's ho lding in Olmstead. This pl an establishes certain goals of the Dist rict to en sure that community- based treatment is provided to persons with disabilities, when s uch treatme nt is appropriate. However, this plan does not create independent legal obligations on the part of the Dist rict. Mayor Vincent Gray and a wide range of District stak eholders including persons with disabilities directed and supported the Office of Disability Rights to develop the Olmstead C ommunity Integration Plan in accordance with policies a nd procedures outlin ed in D.C. Act 16-595 the Dis ability Rights Pro tection Act of 2006. The Dist rict values its reside nts with disabilities as c ontributing members of soc iety and understa nds the cost-effecti ve benefits of supporting them with int egrated, community -based services. The DC Ol mstead Community Integration Pla n, One Community for All is a policy document that details the rights of each person with a disability to self- determination in the Dist rict of Columbia. One Community for All endeavors to meet the needs and preferences of the individual while allowing him or her to c hoose where s/ he wants to live in t he community with the appropriate supports and services consis tent with the Olms tead decision and the resources available to the Dist rict to serve such indi viduals, taking into acco unt the needs of others. The Plan is a living document, providing specific goals, action steps, and tools, while allowing for better flexibility and impro ved services for indi viduals with disabilities. Nine (9) Dist rict agencies partic ipating in this initiati ve are res ponsib le for implementing the Plan. These Dist rict agencies inc lude: Office of the State Superintendent for ation ( OSSE), Office on Aging (DCOA), Depar tment of Youth Rehabilitation District of Columbia Page 2 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 2 Services ( DYRS), Depart ment of Disability Services ( DDS), Depart ment of Human Services ( DHS), Depart ment of Behavioral Health ( DBH), Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), DC Public Schools ( DCPS) and the Depar tment of Health Care Finance (D HCF). These agencies are collaborating in the hope that the Dist rict of Columbia will beco me a national model for providing comm unity services and s upports to persons with disabilities. The Fis cal Year (F Y) 2015 Plan For Fiscal Year 2 015 (FY '15), the Dist rict's Plan will focus on the programs, services, and outcomes of the following agencies: DC Office on Aging (DCOA); Department of Behavioral He alth (DBH ); Department on Disability Services (DDS); and Department of Healthcare Fin ance (DHCF). The above-named agencies provide direct service to a quantifiable population of District residents individually and with other District agencies a nd community partners. This year's Plan seeks to highlight col laboration among these agencie s, as well as the Plan's remaining five (5) p articipating agencies, to illustrate the wrap-around, holistic approach to support provided by the Dist rict to individuals with disabilities who are transitioning into the community of their choice. This year's Plan is designed to spec ifically address how these agencies car ry out the Primary Service A gency Priorities s et forth in the original iterat ion of DC\u2014One Com munity for All published in April 2012. .i The FY '15 P lan contains benchmarks for each of the above agencies. Each agency will report quarterly on the number of individuals with disabilities it has assisted in transition. Moreover, each agency will report on any qualitative measures it has tak en to promote and support suc cessful integration into community life for people with disabilities. These t ypes of measures will include, but are not limited to the following: Outreach and trainin g; Internal and external agency publications; Development of transition-relevant new community partnerships; Foster ing of existing transitio n-relevant community partnership s; and Opportunities for input from persons with disabilities being served. Last, the FY '15 Olm stead Plan will explore a venues to address the most prevalent barrier to successful, lasting transiti on for the disability community\u2014accessible, affordable housing.

In additio n, there is a screening done by the Transition Care Specialist for potential M oney Follows t he Person and Aging and Disability Resource Center Nurs ing Home Transit ion clie nts. The scre ening tool determines if the clie nt is eligible for either nursing home transition through Money Follows the Person (MFP) (c lient must be a Me dicaid beneficiary, be assess ed at a nursing home level of care, and have viable housing or a housing voucher) or Aging Disability Resource C enter (ADRC) (client does not meet the MFP eligibility requirements, but has expressed in terest in lea ving a nursing facility). If the clie nt is eligible for MFP, he/she will be assigned an MFP Transition Care Coordi nator. If the clie nt is not eligible for MFP, but expresses int erest in transiti oning out of a nursing facility, he/she will be assigned a Transition Care Specialist on the Nursing Home Transition team. 3. How do you communicate with your target population and t heir famili es/caregi vers/advocates/pro viders about communi ty-based op tions? DCOA has a community outreach team that conducts outreach at various sit es including S enior Wellness Cen ters, c hurches, and community events.

What procedu res or policies do you h ave in pl ace to all ow people with disabilit ies to assess the quali ty of the supports they receive? The procedures and policies for persons with disabilities, ages 18-59, is t he same as persons 60 and older. Once we have rec eived a case, reviewed options, and lin ked the individual with neces sary resources, we provide c ase management services f or 90 days. After 90 days, a customer satification survey is completed. 5. What m easur es has your agen cy taken to address the n eeds of the following: a. Children who receive residential services from District a gencies but live outside t he District of Columbi a. DC Office on Aging does not provide services to children who rec eive residential services from local DC agencies. b. Adults who receive residen tial services from Di strict agencies but reside outside t he District of Columbia. The Nurs ing Home Transition Team and the Hospital D ischar ge Team assists adults who have been in a hospi tal or nursing facility outside the Dis trict of Columbia if they have been in the hospi tals and nursing facility for 90 days or more, receive community-based Me dicaid, and desire to transition back into the Dist rict of Columbia. Ho wever, if a person does not have Me dicaid, both of these teams would work with staff, pro viding Options Coun seling to the individual to inform them of potential resources. Options Counsel ing provides perso n-centered counseling to indi viduals, family members and/or significant others with support in their long-term care decisions to determine appropr iate choices. Dur ing this p rocess, a written action plan for receiving community resources is developed based on an individual's needs, p references, values, and circ umstances. Follow-up is provided by option counse lors to ensure service del ivery and customer sati sfaction.

These policies incl ude: For youth in Ps ities (P RTFs), DBH Pol icy 200.7 requires a Continued Stay referral. The Conti nued Stay referral is a clinical packet submitted by the res ponsible Dist rict agency which descr ibes the opini on of the treatment team (to incl ude the youth with his/her parent(s)/guardian(s)) regarding whether or not the youth would b enefit from continued treatment within the PRTF or disc harge into the community. This p olicy supports the work of the DBH st aff assigned to work with the youth while they are in a PRTF. The staff partic ipates in monthly treatment team meetings for youth in the PRTF. DBH Pol icy 525.4 details the practice guidelines for community integration of cons umers in institutional se ttings. This policy provides guidance to community mental health providers who are required to participate in the discharge planning process for consumers who are in insti tutional settings. DBH Pol icy 511.3A TL-174 describes the procedures by which consu mers are screen ed for placement in a nursing facility (NF) using the P readmission Screening and Res ident Re view (PASR R), the review of level of care and appropriateness of a NF for those already in a NF, and the discharge and transition process when NF is no longer indi cated in the consumer's level of care. DBH Pol icy 200.2B TL-178 establishes specific guidelines to ensure the conti nuity of care for adult c onsumers who seek or receive urgent or emer gency mental health treatment and supports and/or transfer, as well as adults who are disch arged to different levels of care within t he me ntal health s ystem.

In additio n, the D epartment has the following activities: In FY09, the former Department of Mental health (D MH) throu gh its Office of Consumer and Family Affairs developed a program to utilize indi viduals who self- identify as mental health clients to assist long term inpatients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital (SEH) tr ansition into the community. The program involves peers in providing 1:1 support and in tervention, teaching skills needed to live in t he community and being active team members of the evidence-based Critical Time Intervention that assis ts consumers in their transitio ns to the community. Among the other s upports, ser vices, and resources offered by peers is working with consumers who have been admitted to psychiatr ic hospit als inc luding community hospitals, e.g.Psychiatr ic Instit ute of Washington, Providence, United Medical Cen ter, and SEH. Some of the key activities of t hese initi atives are as follows: Working with the hospital, community providers, and families to facilitate a smooth transition to the community. Providing the highly regarded Wellness Re covery Action Plan (WRAP) services for consumers hospitalized at SEH. WRAP helps i ndividuals who are ho spitalized ma nage their own rec overy and health. SEH uses trained peer specialists to facilitate recovery groups .SEH uses peer s pecialists on medication review panels. For youth at PRTFs, DBH works with the youth and his/her parent(s )/guardi an(s)/family within t he PRTFs monthly treatment team meetings. 4.

Addressing Barriers 7. How does your agen cy address any or all of the f ollowing barriers to successful pro vision of icable to your agen cy's mission and vision. a. Lack of comp rehen sive information on the supports and services available. DBH keeps its webpa ge up-to-date to inform the community on its supports a nd services. In addition, we work with community groups such as Co nsumer Acti on Network Natio nal All iance on Mental Illn ess-DC (NAMI), family groups, and peer operated services to provide information on services a nd supports available t hrough DBH's net work. b. Scarcity of accessib le, affordabl e, integr ated housing. DBH is co mmitted to the availability of access ible, affordable, integrated housin g. The agency provides over 800 housing subsidies a year to DBH cons umers which are consumer-based, i.e. the consumer can use it for any appropriate hous ing they choose. Additionally the agency works aggressively to develop access ible, affordable, integrated hous ing. It has had a partnership with DH CD for the past five years a nd made more than $26 million available for the development of new or renovated housing units for the exclusive use of our co nsumers. More th an 181 units have been built and are occupied and an additional 155 units are under development. This is an on-going initiati ve, and the agency requests additi onal funding for continued development in its annual budgets. c. Unavailabili ty of supp ort ser vices to a ssist with d aily life for individuals with severe di sabiliti es, such as education, transportation, and employment. Through a program called Supported Employment, DBH helps people with mental illness find and keep full or part-time jobs in the community.

When do es your agen cy consider an indi vidual to be \"i nstitutionalized\" under t he auspices of the Olmstead mandate? The De partment on Disability Services (\"D DS\"), Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"DDA\") uses 91 days or more for the purposes of the Money Follo ws the Pers on (\"MFP\") program. Ho wever, through policy and procedure, discuss ed below, every nursing facility referral for a person who re ceives supports from DDS/ DDA is re viewed by the DDS Hu man Rights A dvisory Com mittee (\"HRAC\"), and the agency begins to engage in tr ansition planning for the person to return back to the community immediately, starting from the day of admission. 2. What poli cies/proce dures do es your Agency utilize for identi fying individuals ready and invested for tran sition in to the communi ty? It is DDS's pol icy to ensure t hat all people who rec eive support from the DDA service system have access to and rec eive quality supports, services, and health care in the most integrated, least restr ictive community-based setting appropriate to their needs. This is reflected in a range of policies and proce dures including: Human Rights pol icy and H uman Rights Ad visory Com mittee (the Committee) procedure; Individual Support P lan (\"ISP\") policy and procedure; Most Integrated Community Based Setting policy; Out of State Placement policy; and the Nurs ing Facility Placement policy (all available o n-line at http://dds.dc.gov/page/policies-and-proce dures-dda.) As an example, the DDS Nurs ing Facility Placement policy defines accep table uses for nursing facilities for people with int ellectual disabilities who rec eive supports from DDA as follows: The person has a need for a time-limited stay following hospital ization and his or her rehabilitation re quires the availability of skilled nursing staff on a twenty-four (24) h our basis. The referral and placement must be directly related to a hospi talization discharge rec ommendation; or The person has a need for medical s upports that minimize deterioration in abi lities and maximize quality of life and cannot be provided in the individual's current level of care, nor can it be met in a more in tensive community-based alternati ve, such as an Intermedi ate Care Facility for Individuals with Int ellectual Disabilities ( \"ICF/I ID\"); and facility and District of Columbia Page 20 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 20 community-based in terventions are currently unavailable to address the person's medical s upport needs. Additi onally, the HRAC reviews each proposed nursing facility placement to determine whether it is the least re strictive and most appropriate setting to meet the person's needs. The Committee also establishes the schedule and recommendations for on-going revie w. All placement decisions are determined based upon the person's a ssessed needs and preferences. Developmental Disabilities Ad ministration (DDA) begins tra nsition planning as soon as the person is admitted to a facility to ensure that he or she can re turn to an integrated, community-based setting, preferably his or h er home, as soon as poss ible, given the person's heal th conditi on and need for ongoing medical tr eatment and therapies. At times, a person may be able to return to a more integrated community setting, but may not be able to return to his or her home becau se he or she needs an increased level of care, or, if given the length of stay in the nursing facility, the person's placement in a particular res idential facility is no lon ger available. Fe deral Me dicaid rules prohibit payment to the person's residential provider for any days when the person is in a nursing facility. To ensure that people are able to return to their homes, when appropr iate, the Medicaid H ome and Community-Based Services Waiver for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities ( \"HCBS IDD Waiver\") rates do include a vacancy factor so t hat providers are able to hold a perso n's place in the home for short-term s tays at a hospi tal, nursing facility, or ot her instituti on. Final ly, it is DDA's practice to use Perso n-Centered Thinking (\"PCT\") for all service and s upport plannin g. Michael Smull, one of the national experts on PCT, with whom DDS is working close ly, descr ibes PCT sk ills as follows: \"At their core all of these skil ls are about how we can help people who traditionally have led isolat ed lives, le ad ordinary, self-directed lives, within their own communities. The skil ls are about supporting people as ordinary citizens while reco gnizing (and accounting for) their unusual support needs.\" http://www.nasddds .org/pdf/import anceofpersoncenteredthinking5a.pdf. DDA is engaged in implementing PCT throughout not only the agency, but the entire IDD support and service del ivery system. DDA cur rently has five (5) certi fied PCT trainers on staff, and is train ing two (2) additio nal staff members; with additional trainers pla nned in FY 2015. These trainers offer District of Columbia Page 21 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 21 ongoing PCT training for DDA staff and provider agencie s, both on site at DDS and at provider agencies to facilitate attendance. Once the new trainers are certified, they will assist with providing PCT training to providers, families, and people served by DDA. 3. How do you communicate with your target population and t heir famili es/caregi vers/advocates/pro viders about communi ty-based options? DDS communicates with the people we serve and other sta keholders in a variety of ways; includ ing hosting community forums, attending community events, e-mails, the DDS website, a nd use of social media. We have a stakeholder outreach l ist that includes more than 700 people, many of whom are grass-top leaders who will help spread the word. As an example, in the spring, we hosted a series of forums to educate the community and receive feedback on proposed chan ges to the HCBS IDD waiver. We held a community forum at the Gateway Pavillion in Anaco stia, accessible to where many of the families of the people we support live. We also presented at Project A CTION!, D.C. 's advocacy group for people with int ellectual disabilities and the DC Coalition of Pro viders of Developmental Disabilities Services a mong other places. As a result, we rec eived extensive comments on the propo sed waiver amendments and made changes, accordin gly, to reflect community input. For people who rec eive supports from DDA, PCT tools and skills are now an integral part of the ISP pre-planning process. The tools id entify the interests, preferences, preferred environments, support requirements, and provide impor tant information for the development of ISP goals and programmatic activities t hat are meaningful to the person and lead to support delivery in the most integrated, least restrictive setting appropriate to the person's needs. DDA also offers home and community-based services to persons who reside in ICF/IID s ettings during annual planning meetings and at any other time a person or their support t eam expresses an interest in home and community- based services. 4. What procedu res or policies do you h ave in pl ace to all ow people with disabilit ies to assess the quali ty of the supports they receive? DDA has automated all of its performance metrics, and the data we collect is used to provide relevant information to assist consumers in choosing service providers. The system may also be used to evaluate our staff, pro viders, and District of Columbia Page 22 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 22 performance on a monthly basis for cor rective action and quality improvement initiati ves. Addit ionally, DDA the res ults of our Pro vider Cert ification Review process on our website, as well as provider reports cards, and listin gs of providers who are currently under sancti ons. For D istrict licens ed facilities, the Department of Health, He alth Re gulation and Licensing Administration also posts results of its surveys and in vestigations on its website. In FY 2014, DDA re-joined the N ational Core Indicators (NCI) project. NCI is a voluntary effort by public developmental disabilities agencies to measure and track t heir own performance. The core indi cators are standard measures used across states to assess the outcomes of services pr ovided to indi viduals and families. Indicators address key areas of concern inclu ding employment, rights, s ervice pla nning, community inclusion, choice, and health and safety. Results are drawn through interviews with people who rec eive services, and through res ponses from mailed surveys to f amilies a nd guardi ans. The results are prepared by the H uman Re search Instit ute (HSRI) and the Dist rict will be able to compare its pe rformance against forty (40) other participating states. RSA provides people or, as appropr iate, their represe ntatives with inf ormation and support ser vices to assist the person in exercising informed choice. Informed choice be gins when the person first contacts RSA to apply for Vocati onal R ehabilitation ( \"VR\") services and continues throughout the rehabi litation process. An applicant or a person eligible to receive VR services has the right to exercise informed choice in decis ions re lated to the provision of VR ser vices includin g: the provision of assessment services, choices among the methods used to procure VR ser vices, the selection of the employment outcome, the specific services needed to achieve the employment outcome, and the entities t hat will provide the services to help them achieve their employment outcome. To ensure that the availability and sc ope of informed choice is c onsistent, in accord ance with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 361.52 (c) (1), the information provided inclu des: Costs, ac cessibil ity, and duration of potential services; Consumer sati sfaction with those s ervices to the extent that information relating to cons umer satisfaction is available; Qualifications of potential service pro viders; Degree to which ser vices are provided in i ntegrated settings; and Outcomes achie ved by people working with services pro viders, to the extent that such i nformation is available. In FY 2013, DDS RSA added to the Office of Quality Assurance and Compliance t wo (2) new employees whose primary focus is to mo nitor the District of Columbia Page 23 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 23 quality and effecti veness of Supported Employment and Job Placement services pro vided by RSA's Com munity Rehabilitation Programs (\"CRPs\"). A robust monitoring tool was developed to better qualify each CRP's performance. Based on the data submitted to RSA by the CRPs, t he Agency develops a Provider Profile showing each provider's performance for the covered time period. Data presented includes: Number of referrals per service area; Number of referred persons re turned to the Agency; Number of people placed in employment; Number of employed people successfully employed for 90 days through DDS RSA; Average number of days between r eferral and employment; Average number of hours worked per week; Average hourly pay; Currently, this information is provided to the VR super visors and counselors for sharing with people receiving VR serv ices. The agency is developing a CRP module through which t his infor mation will be available ele ctronically. 5. What m easur es has your agen cy taken to address the n eeds of the following: a. Children who receive residential services from District a gencies but live outside the Distr ict of Columbi a. DDA works c losely with the Chi ld and Family Services A gency (\"CFSA\"), the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (\"OSSE\" ), the Dist rict of Columbia Public Schools (\"DCPS\"), the De partment of Youth Re habilitation Services ( \"DYRS\") and Health Services f or Chi ldren with Spec ial Needs (\"HSCSN\" ). Our mission is to identify children who have been placed in out of state residential facilities at least two to thr ee years prior to aging out of such services so that D DA can ensure timely submission and completion of applications for eligibility determinations for adult s ervices. If eligible for adult services, DDA works with the sist er agencies, families, guardia ns, and youth to prepare transitions back to the District for community-integrated supports as indic ated based on perso n-centered planning. DDS is guided by statute, policy, and best practi ces; it ensures that transitioning youth receive services in Medicaid funded community -integrated services. See D.C. Official Co de \u00a7 7-761.05(9). District of Columbia Page 24 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 24 RSA has worked with st aff from DCPS, CF SA, and DBH to identify DC youth, recei ving secondary educat ion outside of the District, to give them the opportunity to apply to RSA. RSA also provided train ing to all DBH super visory staff on the VR pro cess to facilitate effecti ve referral of cases when a youth is transition back to the Dist rict from an out-of-state facility. A presen tation to provide an overview of the RSA process is planned for DBH staff. RSA has also i nvited re presen tatives from DBH to provide input and feedback on the development of the RSA Youth in Transition Toolkit, which descr ibes the R SA process and expectations for when a youth applies for RSA s ervices. b. Adults who receive residen tial services from Di strict a gencies but reside outside t he District of Columbi a. Since 2007, DDA has returned 263 Dist rict residents to Dist rict based community-integrated services from o ut-of-state residential plac ements. Currently, eleven (1 1) people remain out-of-state in Me dicaid funded home and community-based settin gs as the DDA worked to honor their preference to remain with long -standing friends and service pro viders. F our (4) people conti nue to be served in local ly funded settings as a result of agreements with guardia ns to permit their family members to remain where they have lived, in some cases, for over thi rty years. T hree (3) people recei ve specialized, locally funded treatment ser vices ou t-of-state that are currently unavailable in the Dist rict. c. Individuals who are long-term homel ess and se eking per manent housing. For people who are homeless and seeking permanent hous ing, one of the most important issu es is lack of steady and adequate income. RSA's focus is to help them obtain employment, but the reality is that t he rehabilitation process c an be long, and the need for housing/shelter is ac ute. Housing stability is a challenge for many of the people RSA s erves because they have limited or no income. Currently, 1,874 RSA clients r eceive SSI or SSDI, while many of the other people ser ved are already relying on family or friends for support. RSA Co unselors pro vide information at intake about housing and homeless services, which includ es information about available p rograms; and if District of Columbia Page 25 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 All\" Page 25 neces sary, help c onnect people by making the call and providing transportation to get to the shelter. RSA also supports many of t he related issues that homeless people confront, including access to health c are, deficits/gaps in educati on/literac y, and transportation issues. RSA provides assistance with these services, e.g., health services t hat are necessary to accomplish a vocati onal goal can be funded with VR funds. Transpor tation is provided as an adjunct service with any other service pro vided. RSA also works with OSSE and adult li teracy programs to coordinate services. For people who are homeless and applying to DDA f or supports, DDA uses local funds to provide emergency respite for short-term housing until eligibility can be determined. Once determined, DDA uses person-centered planning to identify community-based resid ential and other supports that will meet the person's assess ed needs. If the person is found ineligible, D DA will con nect him or her with appropriate community resources. Oc casionally, a person who already receives supports from DDA may become homeless due to illness, ho spitalization, or death of his or her primary support person in the home, or because there is an allegation of abuse or neglect by the person's caregiver. In those instances, DDS also uses local or Medicaid funds to provide emergency respite and then uses person-centered planning for long term supports. d. Individuals who are soon to be r eleased from jail/juvenile detention faciliti es. DDA supports p eople eligible for services who are pending relea se with a full range of hous ing and supportive services based on person-centered planning. e. Individuals who are receiving services, b ut still ha ve significant unmet needs which put them at risk of placeme nt in non -communi ty-based settings. DDA currently does not experience challenges with meeting unmet needs that could place a person at risk of placement in non-community settings except as noted above. In cases where s peciali zed services are not available, it seeks to recruit specia lized providers from across t he country to develop services in t he Dist rict to avoid out-of-state placements. District of Columbia Page 26 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 26 f. Individuals who do not recei ve services but are known to have unmet needs that put them at risk for pl acement in no n-communi ty-based settings. DDS rec ently applied for a grant for \"Transforming State Long Term Services and Supports ( \"LTSS\") Access Pro gram and Functions into a No Wrong Door System for All Populations and All Payers. The proposal de velopment process brought together over 20 partners who are committed to working together to create more stre amlined and person-centered approac hes for people with disabilities and others in need of LTSS. The proposal will also make it easier for people of all ages, dis abilities a nd inc ome levels to learn about and access the services and s upports they need. If awarded, this grant will help facilitate access to c ommunity-based s ervices and person-centered planning for people with unmet needs who are at risk for placement in non- community based services. g. Individuals not recei ving formalized services but who live with a family member unab le to s upport them effectively. In May 2013, DDA, in partn ership with the Developmental Disabilities Co uncil Counci l\"), was awarded the Supporting Families Throu ghout the Lifespan\" grant. This grant is funded by the Administrati on on Intellectual and De velopmental Disabilities ( \"AIDD \") and is managed by a partnership between the N ational As sociati on of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Ser vices ( \"NASD DDS\"), University of Missouri Kansas City Instit ute for Human De velopment (\"UMKC-IHD\"), Human Services Research nstitute (\"HSRI\" ), and the Nati onal The Nati onal C ommunity of Practice: Supporting Families Throughout the Lifes pan grant provides funding and technical support to develop systems of support for families throughout the lifespan of their family member with an intellectual or developmental disability. \"The overall goal of supporting families, with all of their complexity, stre ngths, and unique abilities is so they can best support, nurture, lo ve, and facilitate opportunities for the achie vement of self-determination, interdependence, producti vity, inte gration, and inclusion in all facets of community life for their family members\"\u2014 Building a National Agenda for Supports to Families with Member with I/DD, 2011. District of Columbia Page 27 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 27 Through this five (5) year grant, DDA, in collaborati on with the DD Counci l, Project A CTION!, the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disa bilities, and the Georgetown Cen ter for Excellence in De velopmental Disabilities, has convened a team of family members, people with ID D, and other government and community partners, to develop and implement an action plan that ultima tely will shape policies and programs that support families. Throu gh our work with the S tate Team, we have strengthened two-way comm unications with people with developmental dis abilities and their families throughout the lifespan and have begun to identify and address gaps. As an example, a consist ent messa ge from families has been about the need for peer-support across disabilities a nd across t he lifespan. The DC Core Team has been working closely with Health Services f or Chi ldren with Spec ial Ne eds and the Natio nal Pare nt to Parent to plan the launch of a DC Parent to Parent chap ter. We have also identified many parent leaders in the community who partic ipate in the Community of Practice and will share information back and forth within t he community. We have seen increased partic ipation by family members at community meetin gs. Interagen cy Collabo ration 6. Explain specifically how your agen cy works with o ther part icipating istrict r identify the agency/agencies (Go vernment and C ommuni ty-based) and consider the following: a. Recommend comm unity services and supports that all ow an individual to select services and supp orts designed for their specific needs. DDA has extensive and established policies, proce dures, and pract ices that ensure people who apply for services are c onnected to government and community ser vices. For persons who apply but are found ineligible for services, the DDA intake service coordin ator provides information and referral resources based on the information and assessment mater ials gathered in the eligibility determination proce ss to the person and their allies. These res ources inclu de, but are not limited to: Department of Human Services, Econ omic Security Administrat ion (\"DHS/ESA\") for Medicaid, Temporary Aid Families Su pplemen tal Nutr ition Assis tance Program (\"SNAP\") and other social service benefits; RSA District of Columbia Page 28 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 28 Office on Aging, Aging and Dis abilities Res ource Ce nter (\"DCOA/AD RC\"); Department of Behavioral Department of Health Care Fin ance (\"DHCF\") for the Elderly and Person with Physical Disa bilities (\"EPD \") waiver; Housing Authority (\"DCHA\"); Mayors Liaison Services Ce nter ; Center for Independent Living (\"DCCIL\"); University Legal Services; The Quality Trust for Individuals with Disa bilities; Mary's Cent er; Consumer Act ion N etwork; Health Services for Children with Special Needs (\"HSCSN\" ); Rachel's Women's C enter; Bread for the City; Lifeline Partnership; and Columbia Hei ghts/Shaw Family Support Col laborati ve: Parent ing Program. . For persons found eligible, D DA completes numerous assessments and subse quently person-centered planning with the person and their support team. Based on identified needs, the person is provided with an extensive list of formal, informal, government and community services and s upports that can meet each need. For paid services, DDA has str ict policies and proce dures t hat govern c hoice of providers from an appro ved list of qualified providers under the Medicaid programs. b. Develop effective and time ly transition plans f or indi viduals who are placed in no n-community-based set tings. DDA participates in the MFP program and offers h ome and community- based services to persons who reside in ICF/ IID settings during annual planning meetings and at any other time a person or their allies re quest home and community -based services. DDA works col laborati vely with OSSE, DCPS, CFS A, and DBH to identify people with int ellectual disabilities who are placed in non-community-based settings and are or may be seeking transit ion to community-based services and supports. Once identified, DDA works with the person and sis ter agencies to District of Columbia Page 29 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 eligibility determin ations, asses sments, person-centered planning, and a transit ion plan to community services. DDA is also notified of all nursing home placements within t he District for persons who are s uspected to have an intellectual or developmental disability throu gh the Preadmission Sc reening and Resid ent Re view (\"PASR R\") process. Upon such notic e, DDA conducts a PASRR evaluation and (a) determines if such placement is appropr iate, (b) determines if supportive services are re quired to assist the person to assess the community or receive habilitative supports while in the nursing home, and/or (c) prepares to work on transitioning the person from the nursing home to comm unity support s, if not already known to DDA. Lastl y, DDA rec eives referrals from the AD RC and utilizes its intake service coordin ation team to assist eligible persons for DDA services to transition from nursing homes to community services. c. Conduct ou treach on your services or ot her participating age ncies' services specifically geared t oward your ser vice population. DDA regularly conducts outr each on services and supports available for people with int ellectual disabilities. Outreach venues include, but are not limited to: RSA HSCSN, including at the June Fair and Family and Community Health Expo DC City Wide Transit ion Fair Mayors Disability Awareness Expo Public and charter s chool fairs OSSE events su ch as the Transition Professional De velopment Series and the OSSE CIRCLES Transiti on meeting DC Super ior Court, Pretrial Ser vices, Drug Court Seeking Equality Empowerment and Community (\"SEEC \")/ Smithsonian Proje ct SEARCH Public Defender Service R e-entry Summit RSA c onducts outreach through a number of means: RSA has established Memoranda of Agreement with a number of District agencies a nd community based non-profit social s ervices a nd health providers. Through the se agreements, RSA currently accepts District of Columbia Page 30 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 30 referrals, c onducts intakes, and sees clie nts at a variety of sites across the Dist rict. These include: o 4 DOES si tes o 3 Unity Clinics o Project Empowerment o N Street Village, Inc. o Mayor's Liaison Office DC Super ior Court o Ethiopian C ommunity Center o Office of Asian Affairs o Salvation Army (Harb or Lights Treatment Program) o Aging and Disability Services o GW Acute Rehabilitation o Washington Literacy Cent er o Independent Living Services ( Urban League) o Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind o Providence Hospi tal o S.O.M.E. Veterans o Langston Lane Apartments o Com munity of Hope o S.O.M.E o Harvest Ho use o New Endea vor's for Women o Central Uni on Mission. VR coun selors from RSA's transiti on unit visit all District Publ ic High Schools, all Public Charter S chools, the Model Secondary School (Gallaudet Uni versity) and all non-public schools that serve transition-aged District youth. The counse lors con duct intakes and provide information about services to students, their families, and school s taff. RSA developed a number of materials to impro ve outreach. A printed application for services is widely available in the community. The application is also available on the agency's website. In additi on, as indicated above, the agency worked with Sch oolTalk, Inc., OSSE, DCPS, D BH, and The Arc to develop a Transiti on Tool Kit for youth and their families. Lastl y, the administrati on developed an orientation video regarding VR ser vices t hat is s hown at inta ke and is available on the agency's website. District of Columbia Page 31 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 31 The outreach efforts over the past year h ave been successful. RSA has seen continued growth in the number of new referrals. There was an increase from 2,380 referrals in FY 2012 to 3,141 in FY 2013. This increase continued in FY 2014. Addressing Barriers 7. How does your agen cy address any or all of the f ollowing barriers to successful pro vision of icable to your agen cy's mission and vision. a. Lack of comp rehen sive information on the supports and services available. As part of the 2014-2016 State Plan for Independent Living, the DC CIL plans to cre ate a Ho w-to Information Gui de for distr ibution to the community that will promote unders tanding of local housing requirements for persons with significant disabilities. The State Independent Living Council (\"DCSILC\") will advise the RSA and DCCIL in the se efforts through community outreach and advocac y, with the end goal of ensuring that the guide bridges the knowledge gaps c onsumers h ave on the array of Independent Living services and s upports available to them. The DCSILC will also advocate and provide testimony in reference to improved housing opportunities for people with disabilities before the Mayor and DC Council. b. Impa cts of tra nsition ing to life in the communi ty: discriminati on, fear, and stigma. DDS works c losely with its service pro vider com munity to ensure community and neighborhood relati ons are developed and maint ained to help mitigate stigma and negative perceptions among community members, es pecially as it perta ins to NIMBY issues. DDS also presents at community meetings, ANC meetings, and hiring events, for example, to advance education about the rights and contributions of people with disabilities. DDS supports fully community-integrated services a nd through those efforts has significantly increased the opportunities of persons with disabilities to receive services in settin gs where people without disa bilities l ive, work, and play, thus advancing the overall awareness and enrichment of our community at-large. DDS is now District of Columbia Page 32 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 32 working on other media campaigns that will continue to educate our community to embrace and value all members of our city. c. Unavailabili ty of support services to a ssist with d aily life for individuals with severe di sabiliti es, such as education, transpor tation, and employment. The most si gnificant deficit in the District's s ervices and support f or people with disabilities is for persons with developmental disabilities and brain injury who are not eligible for services from DDA or t he EPD waiver program. These are constit uents in the program operated by DHCF. Despite its name, DDA is only authorized to serve people with int ellectual disabilities, narrowly defined as persons with an IQ of 70 or below and deficits in at least two areas of adaptive func tioning such as communicatio n, self-care, home living, social skil ls, co mmunity use, self- direction, health and safety, functio nal ac ademics, leisur e, and work, established prior to the age of 18 years of age.ii Due to the nature of developmental disabilities a nd brain injuries, these persons require supports a nd may be at significant risk for ins titutio nalization but are not eligible for any services in t he Dist rict. The Dist rict re mains one of two jurisdictio ns in the nation to only provide services to people with ID a nd not DD. DDS has s upported expanding its statute to serve people with DD within a vailable a ppropr iations and previously met opposit ion by the advocacy community as it may lead to waiting lists for services where none existed in the past. Despite this, it is imper ative that the Dis trict again seek to expand its eligibility under DDA to serve this population to avoid u nneces sary institutional ization of persons with DD. A second under-served populat ion is perso ns who experience brain trauma and the injury results in si gnificant cognitive impai rments. Again, those persons are not eligible for services from DDA if the injury occurred after age 18. Additio nally, if they are not physically disabled, they are not eligible for services u nder the EPD program. The number of persons who experience brain injury is growing via serv ice relat ed injuries, vehicle accid ents, and gun violence. As a res ult, this is ano ther population that often must rely on nur sing facilities for support. District of Columbia Page 33 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 33 Another s ignificant barrier to c ommunity living is the absence of the Medicaid Buy-in Pro gram for Working People with Disa bilities ( \"MBI- WPD\") in the Dist rict. I-WPD is a program that allows indi viduals with disabilities to work a nd get or k eep M edicaid. Ma ny persons with significant disabilities are unable to obtain employer-funded private health insurance that pro vides coverage comparable to M edicaid. The fear of losing Medicaid and/or Medicare is one of the greatest barriers keep ing individuals with disabilities from maximizing their employment, earnings potential, and independence. For many Social Secur ity Disability Insuran ce (\"SSDI\") and Supplemental Secur ity Income (\"SSI\") beneficiaries, the risk of losing health care through work acti vity can be a greater work disinc entive than the risk of losing cash benefits through work act ivity. For people who rec eive supports from DDA, the DDS HRAC has id entified ventilator -use as a systemic barrier to community based li ving, albeit one that affects a small number of people D DA supports. The HRAC made a recommendation to the DDS De puty Director for DDA to re search barriers and propose solutio ns. DDS has begun discussions on this iss ue with DHCF and t he Department of Health (\"DOH \"). Final ly, the RSA Vocat ional R ehabilitation ( \"VR\") program is able to provide time limited supports to help people with significant disabilities move to employment. When people need extended supports to maint ain employment, RSA attempts to develop a plan including natural supports through its VR pro gram. Long term employment supports are currently available for people with int ellectual disabilities throu gh the Home and Com munity Based Services waiver for People with Int ellectual and Developmental Disabilities ( \"HCBS ID D\") waiver. Ho wever, lo ng term supports are more difficult to identify for people with physical or other disabilities, and the EPD waiver cur rently lacks lon g-term employment supports in its benefit packa ge. Ticket to Work does provide some job retention support, but for a person who needs ongoing supported employment, this le vel of support is not adequate. d. Insufficient numbers of compens ated, trained empl oyees to work with the popu lation of people with d isabilities. Currently, DDS is not experiencing significant probl ems with the ability to retain tra ined employees to work with the population of people with District of Columbia Page 34 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 34 disabilities. Our cur rent vacancy rate in k ey service positio ns working with individuals with int ellectual disabilities (ser vice coordination) is appro ximately 7%, which is a reasonable and expected rate allowing for normal turnover. The current vacancy rate for VR s pecialists is 13% and this is a bit higher than ideal, but during the recent year it has been very low and the 13% is not a long term ra te. DDS keeps the vacancy rates low throu gh active, targeted recr uiting. The ability of the disability service pro viders to recruit and retain trai ned individuals is a bit more of a concern particu larly in regards to clinical staffing. DDS has taken steps to assist the providers in their staffing by retaining professional services to develop a series of advertiseme nts to recruit cl inical professionals into the disability field in the District of Columbia. At this time, we are waiting for se rvice pro vider input pr ior to launching the advertising campaign. Additionally, working collaborati vely with DH CF, DDS is s ubmitting an amendment to the HC BS IDD waiver that would rai se the rates for a number of clinical s ervices in an effort to increase provider capacity in this cr itical area. e. Post -dischar ge into communi ty-based living with subs equent assessment that tra nsition is not meeting the needs of the individual. DDA provides ongoing service coordin ation for people with int ellectual disabilities who transit ion in to community-based services through the HCBS IDD waiver. Through our policy and procedure, there are re quired post-transition visits by a service coordi nator to ensure the transition has gone smoo thly. The service coordin ator will assess how the person is doing in both their new resident ial and day/vocatio nal setting and add additi onal s upports or make changes in supports as needed, based upon the person's asses sed needs and preferences. DDA has also retained a nurse via its quality assurance project contract with the Georgetown University Cent er for Excellence in De velopmental Disabilities ( \"UCEDD\") whose s ole function is to monitor the course of care a person re ceives while hospital ized or in a nursing home. The nurse then conducts follow- up with the community home setting post-disch arge to ensure that all health-related discharge orders are being followed. As part of the State Plan for Independent Living, the DCS ILC has taken on the charge of advocating for city-wide implement ation and education to support and campaign to impro ve transiti on planning for people who are District of Columbia Page 35 of 41 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \"DC\u2014One Community For All\" Page 35 on track for discharge from institutional or other restrictive settings. The DCSILC will monitor such planning to ensure that person-centered thinking is the focus of all such planning. The DCSILC will also ad vise RSA, o ther D istrict governme nt, and community agencies to achie ve an Independent Living services and s upports s ystem that ensures planning for independence across the l ifespan. Additi onally, the DC CIL provides advocacy and peer s upport ser vices to people with disabilities.

The MFP R ebalancing Demonstrati on, through its operating agencies, DCOA/AD RC and D DS/DDA, administers a Quality of Life survey immediately before transiti on from a long term care facility and at 11 and 24 months after disch arge from the long term c are facility to home and community-based services.

Children and Adolescents Behavioral Health Services Narrative Question: MHBG funds are intended to support programs and activities for children with SED, and SABG funds are available for prevention , treatment, and recovery services for youth and young adults. Each year, an estimated 20 percent of children in the U.S. have a diagnosable m ental health condition and one in 10 suffers from a serious mental disorder that contributes to substantial impairment in their functionin g at home, at school, or in the community.90 Most mental health disorders have their roots in childhood, with about 50 percent of affected adults manifesting such disorders by age 14, and 75 percent by age 24.91 For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death.92 It is also important to note that 11 percent of high school students have a diagnosable substance use disorder involving nico tine, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and nine out of 10 adults who meet clinical criteria for a substance use disorder started smoking, drinking, o r using illicit drugs before the age of 18. Of people who started using before the age of 18, one in four will develop an addiction compared to one in twenty -five who started using substances after age 21.93 Mental and substance use disorders in children and adolescents are complex, typically involving multiple challenges. These children and youth are frequently involved in more than one specialized system, including mental h ealth, substance abuse, primary health, education, childcare, child welfare, or juvenile justice. This multi -system involvement often results in fragmented and inadequate care, leaving families overwhelmed and children's needs unmet. For youth and young adults who are transitioning in to adult responsibilities, negotiating between the child - and adult -serving systems becomes even harder. To address the need for additional coordination, SAMHSA is encouraging states to designate a liaison for children to assist schools in assuring identified child ren are connected with available mental health and/or substance abuse screening, treatment and recovery support services. Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states a nd communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with more than 160 grants awarded to states and communities, and every s tate has received at least one CMHI grant. In 2011, SAMHSA awarded System of Care Expansion grants to 24 states to bring this approach to scale in states. In terms of adolescent substance abuse, in 2007, SAMHSA awarded State Substance Abuse Coordinator grants to 16 states to begin to build a state infrastructure for substance abuse treatment and recovery -oriented systems of care for youth with substance use disorders. This work has continued with a focus on financing and workforce development to support a recovery -oriented system of care that incorporates established evidence -based treatment for youth with substance use disorders. For the past 25 years, the system of care approach has been the major framework for improving delivery systems, services, and outcomes for children, youth, and young adults with mental and/or substance use disorders and co -occurring disorders and their families. This approach is comprised of a spectrum of effective, community -based services and supports that are organized into a coordinated network. This approach helps build meaningful partnerships across systems and addresses cultural and linguistic needs while improving the child's, y outh's and young adult's functioning in their home, school, and community. The system of care approach provides individualized services, is fa mily driven and youth guided, and builds on the strengths of the child, youth or young adult and their family and promotes recovery and resil ience. Services are delivered in the least restrictive environment possible, and using evidence -based practices while providing effective cross -system collaboration, including integrated management of service delivery and costs.94 According to data from the National Evaluation of the Children's Mental Health Initiative (2011), systems of care95: reach many children and youth typically underserved by the mental health system; improve emotional and behavioral outcomes for children and youth; enhance family outcomes, such as decreased caregiver stress; decrease suicidal ideation and gestures; expand the availability of effective supports and services; and save money by reducing costs in high cost services such as residential settings, inpatient hospitals, and juvenile justice se ttings. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the well -documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with serious behavioral health needs. Given the multi - system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The array of services an d supports in the system of care approach includes non -residential services, like wraparound service planning, intensive care management, outpatient therapy, intensive home -based services, substance abuse intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response; supportive servic es, like peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and supported education and emplo yment; and residential services, like therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization services, and inpatient medical detoxification.

Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children Narrative Question: Substance -abusing pregnant women have always been the number one priority population in the SAMHSA block grant (Title XIX, Part B, Subpart II, Sec.1922 (c)) . A formula based on the FY 1993 and FY 1994 block grants was established to increase the availability of treatment services designed for pregnant women and women with dependent children. The purpose of establishing a \"set -aside\" was to ensure the availability of comprehensive, substance use disorder treatment, and prevention and recovery support services for pregnant an d postpartum women and their dependent children. This population continues to be a priority, given the importance of prenatal care and sub stance abuse treatment for pregnant, substance using women, and the importance of early development in children. For families involved in the child welfare system, successful participation in treatment for substance use disorders is the best predictor for children remaining with t heir mothers. Women with dependent children are also named as a priority for specialized treatment (as opposed to treatment as usual) in the SABG regulations. MOE provisions require that the state expend no less than an amount equal to that spent by the state in a base fiscal year for tr eatment services designed for pregnant women and women with dependent children. For guidance on components of quality substance abuse treatment services for women, States and Territories can refer to the f ollowing documents, which can be accessed through the SAMHSA website at http://www.samhsa.gov/women -children -families: Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 51, Substance Abuse Treatment; Addressing the Specific Needs of Women; Guidance to States; Treatme nt Standards for Women with Substance Use Disorders; Family -Centered Treatment for Women with Substance Abuse Disorders: History, Key Elements and Challenges. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: The implementing regulation requires the availability of treatment and admission preference for pregnant women be made known and that pregnant women are prioritized for admission to treatment. Please discuss the strategies your state uses to accomplish t his.1. Discuss how the state currently ensures that pregnant women are admitted to treatment within 48 hours.2.

Please discuss the strategies your state uses to accomplish this. The Department of Behavioral Health's (DBH) SUD system in the District includes a comprehensive continuum ranging from more intense levels of care, such as Inpatient Withdrawal Management and Residential Treatment, to less intensive services such as Traditional Outpatient Programs and Intensive Outpatient Programs. During Fiscal Year 2014, the District provided comprehensive treatment and recov ery services to over 8,600 individuals in care. Individuals seeking services are 67% male and 33% female. Over 48% of the individuals seeking SUD services report having at least 1 dependent child. According to Medical News Today (2005) the national age range for childbearing is 20-35 years old. Likewise, Data from the Birth Data File, National Vital Statistics System (2006) records that the average age of first time mothers increased 3.6 years from 1970 to 2006, from 21.4 to 25.0 years. Average age at first birth increased in all states and the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia increased by 5.5 years making the average age for first birth 26.9 years old. Appro ximately 273 women (20% of the women's population) in Department of Behavioral Health's treatment system are between the ages of 21-26 years of age. Another 28% of the DBH female population is between 27 - 35 years of age. The total female popul ation between the ages of 21 - 35 is approximately 48%. The Assessment and Referral Center (ARC) is the main point of entry for adults seeking publicly funded treatment. The ARC is a walk -in and appoin tment-based facility which conducts nursing triages and comprehensive assessme nts for substance use disorders and other health disorders including HIV/AIDS and mental health. There are 5 other access points for any person seeking entry into treatment throughout the District. Pregnant women reporting to any intake site requesting treatment are assessed for the appropriate level of care and admit ted immediately to receive services. Currently, DBH awards and monitors contracts for certified treatme nt and recovery support services that are on a fee for service basis, The contract allow immediate access to three levels of services: Levels I and II outpatient; Level III inpatient, detoxification, outpatient opioid treatment, and recovery support. These contracts include specialized services such as: adolescents aged 20 and unde r, pregnant women and women with dependent children; medication assisted therapy; culturally and racially appropriate services for other special populations includ ing those who are HIV positive. Additionally, DBH, the Family treatment Court (FTC) and Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) collaborate to improve the quality of services for parents in the child welfare system that are in danger of having their parental rights terminated that also require assessment and intensive treatment and case mana gement for substance use issues. Through this collaboration, DBH, FTC and CFSA conduct subject matter trainings across agencies that promote a recovery focus for the parents and interagency partnerships that will ensure the systems interact as a recovery focused partnership. Discuss how the state currently ensures that pregnant women are admitted to treatment within 48 hours. Pregnant women reporting to any intake site requesting services are admitted to treatment on demand. Services are provided on the same day that includes; intake, asses sment, screening, evaluations, interventions, counseling, HIV testing, pre and post -natal care and linkages to other social services. Discuss how the state currently ensures that interim services are provided to pregnant women in the event that a treatment facility has insuffic ient capacity to provide treatment services. The DBH provider network is providing women only programming in the currently co-ed programs so women have a choice. DBH has created a supportive fiscal structure to meet the needs of pregnant women by enabling providers District of Columbia Page 2 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 198 of 230Page 2 to provide specialized services that will promote intensive case management and integrated health care during pregnancy and postpartum until the infant is three years old. The District has \"treatment on demand\" for any resident seeking services. A person seeking treatment can access care at any of the Districts 5 access points. However, the District has recently implemented gender specific treatment programs that provide services to Pregnant and Post - Partum and Women with Depend ent Children. The District is in the process of implementing direct access into those programs in an effort to link women with children into care without having to seek access at the traditional access points. The District also implemented a mobile access unit that provides interim care which includes HIV testing, counseling, TB and other infectious diseases service linkages for individuals who cannot immediately access care. Currently, the District has 32 residential treatment beds and 100 treatment slots specifically allocated for treating this special population. The District plans to expand outpatient services in FY 16-17 to 200 treatment slots. Discuss who within your state is responsible for monitoring the requirements in 1-3. The Department of Behavior Health's SUD system -Quality Assurance Office is responsible for ensuring that pregnant women have preference and priority admissions to the treatment program of their choice; pregnant women are admit ted within 48 hours of intake; and interim services are provided immediately upon assessment for appropriate level of care.

The DC Department of Health works to prevent youth suicide through its Capital CARES Program (C itywide Alliance to Reduce Risk for and Eliminate Youth Suicide) funded through SAMHSA. Capital CARES provides suicide and mental health screenings in schools and in the community with parental consent, trains adults to recognize when a youth is at risk, a nd funds community based suicide prevention programs for youth with demographic and/or behavioral risk factors for suicide. In addition, the Department of Mental Health (DMH) supports a 24/7 emergency crisis service for youth experiencing a psychiatric or emotional crisis. Teams of mental health clinicians respond to emergency calls whether in schools, the home or community. In addition, trained mental health counselors are available by phone 24/7 on the Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1 -800-273- 8255. APRA prevention staff participated in the Capital CARES citywide in order to learn more about dispelling myths and encouraging care for youth and their families may be struggling with depression, thoughts of suicide and other mental health issues. APRA is in th e process of merging with DMH to create the Department of Behavioral Health. During this juncture, the District plans to reassess the current suicide prevention plan and make revisions as ne In addition, APRA has met with the DC General of the National Gua rd followed by meeting with Drug Demand Reduction Program staff.

State Behavioral Health Planning/ Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/ Substance Abuse Block Grant Application Department of Behavioral Health Behavioral Health Council Comments on the District Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), formerly the Department of Mental Health, planning process to transition from a mental health planning and advisory council to a behavioral health planning council was supported by three (3) SAMHSA technical assistance (TA) initiatives. They included: 1) receiving general TA provided to state planning councils that included an on-site TA meeting with the existing planning council (FY 2012-2013 cycle); 2) participating in the state planning council intensive TA National Learning Community that involved monthly conference calls and individual state calls, and an on-site TA meeting with the mental health advisory councils, consumers/clients, family members, advocates, mental health and substance use disorder staff and providers (FY 2013-2014 cycle); and 3) participating in the Leadership Academy and on-site TA (FY 2014-2015 cycle) for the newly created Behavioral Health Council. On August 19, 2015 the DBH Behavioral Health Council orientation meeting was held. In addition to the council members, the new DBH Acting Director, Dr. Tanya A. Royster, M.D., and the DBH grant program staff participated in the meeting. The co-facilitators were Phillip Lubitz, M.S.W. and Angela Halvorson, M.P., M.S. The Page 1 District of Columbia Page 2 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 218 of 230presentations generated thoughtful questions, comments and discussion. DBH Behavioral Health Council Comments The DBH Behavioral Health Council reviewed and provided comments about the District of Columbia Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan. To facilitate their review, they were given a Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan Review Comment Guide. The comments below are organized by the document review sections. A. Overview of Adult Service System 1. Most important adult service system strengths: Accessibility/availability of mental health services. Health Homes Initiative, Evidence based practices, Supported Housing services. Having the ability to select providers of choice. Partnering with providers to develop recovery oriented treatment plans. Education, Employment, Housing. Evidence Based Practice/ACT. Mental Health Services Division-particularly multicultural services. 2. Most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the adult service system: Services for people with mental health issues and intellectual/developmental disabilities. Being re-traumatized by agencies that lack compassion, integrity and dignity for the individual's overall well-being. Lacking cultural competency to the population served (Missing the margin). Not enough peer lead groups/organizations. Therapy. Access to and more support of recovery oriented, integrated supported employment and vocational/educational opportunities. More (integrated) wheelchair/disability accessible housing within the entire continuum of supported housing services. B. Overview of Child and Youth Service System 1. Most important child and youth service system strengths: Comprehensive services. Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement (PIECE) Program has dedicated well trained (in several evidence-based practices) staff (intact team for several years) providing early intervention services to families of children under the age of 6. The Children Psychiatric Practice Group (PPG) has three (3) dedicated child psychiatrists that serve as the safety net for several DC core services agencies (CSAs). The PPG provides medication assessments, medication management, same day/urgent care services, and court evaluations. The DC Healthy Start program is designed to address the parent child dyad through the strengthening of attachment bonds and to reduce infant mortality. The program works with pre- and post-natal women residing in Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8. System of Care Expansion Implementation Project. School-based mental health services. Prevention and Early Intervention Services. Creating multiple access entrances to assess for mental health services. Therapy, Parent Education. Evidence Based services, ChAMPS, Same Day Urgent Care. 2. Most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the child and youth service system: Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Services. Substance abuse treatment options for single parents that enable families to remain together during treatment, if appropriate. Better coordination with other systems. Coordination with workforce system and provision of employment readiness and supported employment. Lack of quality outpatient therapy services for latency age youth. Lack of a dedicated mental health center/agency in DC to provide public mental health and behavioral health services for children with Autism Spectrum Page 2 District of Columbia Page 3 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 219 of 230Disorder (ASD). Uneven and inconsistent provision of Individualized Education Plan (IEP) stipulated services in DC Public Schools and Public Charter Schools. If the agency could provide tokens and/or fare cards families may be more able to access clinic based services. Lack of child psychiatrists at the DC CSAs to provide consistent medication management and psychiatric services to children and adolescents. Lack of nursing staff, and Community Support Workers (CSWs) to support the work of the PPG. Need for updated equipment to support the PIECE program's evidence-based practices and day to day operations, e.g., contemporary telephone instruments for conference calls, no intercom system to communicate with parents during coaching sessions. Programmatic consideration that more latency age children are using K2 and other substances as the focus of treatment. Financial support for the psychoeducational groups conducted by the DC Healthy Start program so that program staff do not have to pay out of pocket for meals/incentives for clients. Resources to help homeless services providers navigate the behavioral health system in order to connect and support families with children identified as in need of behavioral health services. Family-based integrated services for families that brings together all health and human service providers in support of an integrated plan for families with children receiving behavioral health supports. Prevention and Early Intervention Services need the resources to serve 100% of the need. Lack of psychiatrists available to meet the growing demand of children mental health needs. CSAs have an overload of cases, which only permits the kids to receive Car Wash Services (Which means in and out services just to meet billing expectations). Therapy, Family Education. Employment, wrap around services (Psychiatrist/Psychologist/PCP, therapy, education, housing) More community-based alternatives (therapeutic family-like settings) for youth in crisis that cannot stay with their families (e.g., therapeutic foster care without requiring entry into foster care setting). Therapeutic/recovery oriented after school programs that focus on positive youth development. Additional focus on continuity of care for hospitalized youth. C. Other performance indicators the Behavioral Health Council would like DBH to consider in the future: Improved interface between the Integrated Care Application Management System (iCAMS) and the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale/ Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS/PECFAS) in order to more accurately collect data on child/adolescent impairments. Addition of the evidence-based practices Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) to the iCAMs billing platform to reflect the utilization of these practices. Number of parents receiving substance abuse treatment through family based programs. Becoming innovative in allowing consumers to have virtual access to rate the services they receive. The number of youth with serious emotional disturbances that are diverted from the foster care system through use of community based therapeutic settings. The percentage of supported housing units that are integrated and accessible. The percentage of adults engaged in full or part-time employment or vocational/education activities. The percentage of youth with serious emotional disturbances engaged in structured or therapeutic activities between the hours of 3 pm and 7pm. D. Environmental Factors: Factor 5: Evidence-Based Practice for Early Intervention (5%) The continuing emphasis of DBH on investments in early intervention, such as Page 3 District of Columbia Page 4 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 220 of 230the TACT program, is essential to building a system of care that provides comprehensive, family-focused care starting at the early detection point. This is going in the right direction of reducing out-of-home and more intensive psychiatric interventions. Public Awareness of Plan and Public Comment It is the DBH custom to post the District of Columbia FY 2016-FY 2017 Mental Health Block Grant Application on the Department's website. This allows for ongoing review and comment. Also, if there are any major changes the revised document can be posted.

State Behavioral Health Planning/Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application Narrative Question: Each state is required to establish and maintain a state Mental Health Planning/Advisory Council for adults with SMI or child ren with SED. To meet the needs of states that are integrating mental health and substance abuse agencies, SAMHSA is recommending that states expand their Mental Health Advisory Council to include substance abuse, referred to here as a Behavioral Health Advisory/Planning Council (BHPC). SAMHSA encourages states to expand their required Council's comprehensive approach by designing and implementing regularly sc heduled collaborations with an existing substance abuse prevention and treatment advisory council to ensure that the council reviews issues and services for persons with, or at risk for, substance abuse and substance use disorders. To assist with implementing a BHPC, SAMHSA has created Best Practices for State Behavioral Health Planning Councils: The Road to Planning Council Integration.97 Additionally, Title XIX, Subpart III, section 1941 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 300x -51) applicable to the SABG and the MHBG, requires that, as a condition of the funding agreement for the grant, states will provide an opportunity for the public to comment on the state b lock grant plan. States should make the plan public in such a manner as to facilitate comment from any person (including federal, tribal, or o ther public agencies) both during the development of the plan (including any revisions) and after the submission of the plan to SAMHSA. For SABG only - describe the steps the state took to make the public aware of the plan and allow for public comment. For MHBG and integrated BHPC; States must include documentation that they shared their application and implementation report with the Planning Council; please also describe the steps the state took to make the public aware of the plan and allow for public com ment. SAMHSA requests that any recommendations for modifications to the application or comments to the implementation report that w ere received from the Planning Council be submitted to SAMHSA, regardless of whether the state has accepted the recommendations.

They included: 1) receiving general TA provided to state planning councils that included an on -site TA mee ting with the existing planning council (FY 2012 -2013 cycle); 2) participating in the state planning council intensive TA National Learning Community that involved monthly conference calls and individual state calls, and an on -site TA meeting with the ment al health advisory councils, consumers/clients, family members, advocates, mental health and substance use disorder staff and providers (FY 2013 -2014 cycle); and 3) participating in the Leadership Academy and on -site TA (FY 2014 -2015 cycle) for the newly c reated Behavioral Health Council. The Department notified the public that the SAPT Block grant was available for comment for 30 days by Public View via the DBH website. On August 19, 2015 the DBH Behavioral Health Council orientation meeting was held. In addition to the council members, the new DBH Acting Director, Dr. Tanya A. Royster, M.D., and the DBH grant program staff participated in the meeting. The co -facilitators were Phillip Lubitz, M.S.W. and Angela Halvorson, M.P., M.S. presentations gener ated thoughtful questions, comments and discussion. DBH Behavioral Health Council Comments The DBH Behavioral Health Council review ed and provided comment s about the District of Columbia Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan. To facilitate their review, t hey were given a Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan Review Comment Guide . The comments below are organized by the document review sections. A. Overview of Adult Service System 1. Most important adult service system strengths: Accessibility/availability of mental health services. Health Homes Initiative , Evidence based practices , Supported Housing services. Having the ability to select providers of choice. Partnering with providers to develop recovery oriented treatment plans. Education, Employment, Housing . Evidence Based Practice/ACT. Mental Health Services Division -particularly multicultural services. 2. Most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the adult service system: Services for people with mental health issues and intellectual/developmental disabilities . Being re -traumatized by agencies that lack compassion, integrity and dignity for the individual 's overall well -being. Lacking cultural compe tency to the population served (Missing the margin) . District of Columbia Page 2 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 223 of 230 Not enough peer lead g roups/ organizations. Therapy. Access to and more support of recovery oriented, integrated supported employment and vocational/educational opportunities . More (integrated) wheelchair/disability accessible housing within the entire continuum of supported housing services. B. Overview of Child and Youth Service System 1. Most important child and youth service system strengths: Comprehensive services. Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement (PIECE) Program has dedicated well trained (in several evidence -based practices) staff (intact team for several years) providing early intervention services to families of children under the age of 6. The Children Psychiatric Practice Group (PPG) has three (3) dedicated child psychiatrists that serve as the safety net for se veral DC core services agencies (CSAs). The PPG provides medication assessments, medication management, same day/urgent care services, and court evaluations. The DC Healthy Start program is designed to address the parent child dyad through the strengthenin g of attachment bonds a nd to reduce infant mortality. The program works with pre - and post -natal women residing in Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8. System of Care Expansion Implementation Project . School -based mental health services . Prevention and Early Intervention Services . Creating multiple access entrance s to assess for mental health services. Therapy, Parent Education. Evidence Based services, ChAMPS, Same Day Urgent Care . 2. Most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the child and youth service system: Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Services. Substance abuse treatment options for single parents that enable families to remain together during treatment, if appropriate. Better coordination with other systems. Coordination with workfo rce system and provision of employment readiness and supported employment. Lack of quality outpatient therapy services for latency age youth. Lack of a dedicated mental health center/agency in DC to provide public mental health and behavioral health servic es for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Uneven and inconsistent provision of Individualized Education Plan ( IEP) stipulated services in DC Public Schools and Public Charter Schools. If the agency could provide tokens and/or fare cards families may be more able to access clinic based services. District of Columbia Page 3 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 224 of 230 Lack of child psychiatrists at the DC CSAs to provide consistent medication management and psychiatric services to children and adolescents. Lack of nursing staff, and Community Support Workers (CSWs) to s upport the work of the PPG. Need for updated equipment to support the PIECE program's evidence -based practices and day to day operations, e.g., contemporary telephone instruments for conference calls, no intercom system to communicate with parents during coaching sessions. Programmatic consideration that more latency age children are using K2 and other substances as the focus of treatment. Financial support for the psychoeducational groups conducted by the DC Healthy Start program so that program staff do not have to pay out of pocket for meals /incentives for clients. Resources to help homeless services providers navigate the behavioral health system in order to connect and support families with children identified as in need of behavioral health services. Family -based integrated services for families that brings together all health and human service providers in support of an integrated plan for families with children receiving behavioral health supports. Prevention and Early Intervention Services need the resources to serve 100% of the need. Lack of psychiatrists available to meet the growing demand of children mental health needs. CSAs have an overload of cases, which only permits the kids to receive Car Wash Services (Which means in and out services just to meet billing expectations). Therapy, Family Education. Employment, wrap around services (Psychiatrist/Psychologist/PCP, therapy, education, housing ) More community -based alternatives (therapeutic family -like settings) for youth in crisis that c annot st ay with their families (e.g., therapeutic foster care without requiring entry into foster care setting). Therapeutic/recovery oriented after school programs that focus on positive youth development. Additional focus on continuity of care for hospitalized y outh. C. Other performance indicators the Behavioral Health Council would like DBH to consider in the future : Improved interface between the Integrated Care Application Management System (iCAMS) and the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale/ Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS/PECFAS) in order to more accurately collect data on child/adolescent impairments. Addition of the evidence -based practices Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and Child Parent Psychoth erapy (CPP) to the iCAMs billing platform to reflect the utilization of these practices. Number of parents receiving substance abuse treatment through family based programs. District of Columbia Page 4 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 225 of 230 Becoming innovative in allowing consumers to have virtual access to rate the servi ces they receive. The number of youth with serious emotional disturbance s that are diverted from the foster care system through use of community based therapeutic settings. The percentage of supported housing units that are integrated and accessible . The percentage of adults engaged in full or part -time employment or vocational/education activities . The percentage of youth with serious emotional disturbance s engaged in structured or therapeutic a ctivities between the hours of 3 pm and 7pm. D. Environmental F actors: Factor 5: Evidence -Based Practice for Early Intervention (5%) The continuing emphasis of DBH on investments in early intervention, such as the TACT program, is essential to building a system of care that provides comprehensive, family -focused care starting at the early detection point. This is going in the right direction of reducing out -of-home and more intensive psychiatric interventions. Public Awareness of Plan and Public Comment It is the DBH custom to post the District of Columbia FY 2016 -FY 2017 Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Application on the Department's website for a 30 day review period. Also, if there are any major changes the revised document is repo sted for an additional 30 day review .
