All such descriptions are further qualified in their entirety by reference to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforc ement of creditors' rights and general principles of equity. Copies of such documents are available for inspection at the offices of the Secretary of Finance of the State.

Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed to registered owners of th e Bonds not less than 20 days nor more than 60 days prior to any optional redemption date in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution. The State, so long as a book-entry system is used for determining ownership of Bonds, will send the notice of redemption to The Depository Tru st Company (\"DTC\"). Any failure of DTC -2-to mail such notice to any DTC participant will not affect the validity of the redemption of the Bonds. If at the time of mailing of a notice of redemption, the State shall not have deposited with the bank or depositary acting as refunding escrow agent money sufficient to redeem all Bonds called for redemption, the notice of redemption may state that it is conditional, i.e., that it is s ubject to the deposit of sufficient redemption money with a refunding escrow agent not later than the redempti on date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such money is so deposited. Authorization and Purpose The Bonds are issued pursuant to the State Constitution, statu tes of the State, in cluding acts of the General Assembly (the \"General Assembly\") authorizing the issua nce of the Bonds (the \"Authorization Acts\") and the Resolution. A portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be applied to pay for various capital facilities of the State and to provide financing for other capital projects, as authorized by the Authorization Acts.

The Government Securities are to be held in a trust fund (the \"Escrow Fund\") by U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow agent (the \"Escrow Agent\") pursuant to a n Escrow Agreement to be dated November 6, 2014 (the \"Escrow Agr eement\") between the State and the Escrow Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Refunded Bonds.

The Delaware Code provides that any funds borrowed pursuant to an Authorization Act and not exp ended for the purposes set forth therein shall be deposited in a special fund and applied with the appro val of the Issuing Officers to the remaining costs of any project authorized by any prior Authorization Act. SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS The sources and uses of funds to accomplish the purposes of th e Bonds are expected to be as follows: Sources: Total Par Amount: $ 306,870,000.00 Net Original Issue Premium 53,159,369.85 Total Sources: $ 360,029,369.85 Uses: Deposit to Escrow Fund $ 98,709,801.64 Capital Projects 260,811,107.19 Underwriters' Discount 303,514.54 Other Financing Expenses 204,946.48 Total Uses: $ 360,029,369.85 SECURITY FOR BONDS The Bonds are direct obligations of the State to which the ful l faith and credit of the State will be pledged. The payment of principal of and interest on debt obli gations of the State is made pursuant to appropriations by the General Assembly of the State. Historica lly, the State has appr opriated funds for and paid the principal of and interest on its debt obligations as t hey have come due. If the State fails to make sufficient provision to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds, or, at the time such amount is payable, sufficient funds are unavailab le for such payment, a sufficient sum to pay such principal and interest is required by State law to be set apart by the State Treasurer from the first revenues thereafter received by the State. The State Treasurer may be required to set apart and apply such revenue to the payment of such pr incipal and interest at the su it of any holder of the Bonds. In the event the State fails to make timely payment of the pri ncipal of or interest on the Bonds, the owner of the Bond on which default in payment has occurred may also sue the State for breach of contract. In the opinion of the Attorney G eneral of the State, the State may not successfully invoke the defense of sovereign immunity in an action alleging breach of contract by the State, and in the further opinion of the Attorney General, the Bonds pertaining thereto are such contrac ts. Any judgment against the State obtained in such an action, however, must be paid solely from funds appropriated by the General Assembly for the purpose of such payment. -5-DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS The following table sets forth the debt service requirements o f general obligation bonds of the State, prior to and after giving effect to the issuance of the Bonds.

(2) Outstanding gross debt service gross (excludes Federal Inte rest Subsidy on Build America Bonds and Qualified School Construction Bonds). -6-BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE STATE Authorization of General Obligation Debt General obligation bonds and bond anticipation notes of the St ate are issued and the proceeds thereof appropriated to vari ous purposes pursuant to the Authorization Acts. Under the State Constitution, Authorization Acts become law upon the approval of three-quarters of all the elected members of eac h house of the General Assembly and the concurrence of the Governor. The Governor may veto a bill by returning the bill to the house of the General Assembly in which the bill originated within ten days of receipt, Sunday excepted. The General Assembly may override the Governor's veto by a three-fifths vot e of all members in each house. No bill becomes law after final adjournment of the General Assembly unl ess previously approved by the General Assembly and approved by the Governor within 30 days after such adjournment. The Governor has veto power over line item appropriations. Once an Authorization Act is enacted, the Issuing Officers are authorized by State law to issue bonds and bond anticipation notes thereunder. Bond anticipation note s may be issued for a term of one year and may be renewed, but all such renewal notes must mature not later than four years after the date of original issuance of such notes. No bond anticipation notes have been outstanding since fiscal 1978. All bonds are required to mature within 20 years from their date of issuance. Other than bonds issued in fiscal years 2010 through 2015, bonds may not provide for principal payments higher in later ye ars than earlier years (except for refunding bonds, capital appreciation bonds, qualified zone academy bonds and retail bonds) and may have such other terms as the Issuing Officers may determine, subject to the lim itations of the Authorization Acts and other provisions of law. The Qualified School Construction Bonds iss ued in fiscal year 2011 provided for a single maturity of $59.6 million in fis cal year 2030, e xceeding princi pal due in earlier years. The Issuing Officers are authorized to issue bonds to refund b onds in advance of maturity provided that the refunding results in a prese nt value savings to the State. The Issuing Officers may also issue revenue anticipation notes , in an amount they determine necessary, to meet a casual deficiency of revenue in the budgetary General Fund to pay budgetary General Fund obligations or to pay existing debts. Revenue anticipation notes may be is sued at any time and from time to time prior to June 25 in any State fiscal year. There has not been a State i ssue of revenue anticipation notes since fiscal 1977. If at any time during the fiscal year prior to June 15 there is a casual deficiency of revenue in the budgetary General Fund to pay budgetary General Fund obligations or to pa y existing debts, the State may draw upon available balances in the State' s budgetary Special Funds to pa y such obligations or debts. Such draws are required to be reimbursed to th e appropriate budgetary Special Funds as soon as sufficient budgetary General Fund monies become available, and in any case, the budgetary Ge neral Fund cannot evidence a negative balance after June 15 of such fiscal year. Debt Limits There is no State Constitutional debt limit; however, the State has statutory debt limits as discussed herein. In 1991, the State enacted legislation to replace the previous statutory debt limits with a three-part debt limit, effective July 1, 1991, as follows: First, the aggregate principal amount of new \"tax-supported obl igations of the State\" (hereinafter defined) which may be authorized in any one fiscal year (exclud ing refunding bonds) may not exceed 5% of estimated net budgetary General Fund revenue for that fiscal ye ar, as determined by a Joint Resolution approved by a majority of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly and signed by the -7-Governor in conjunction with the adoption of the annual Budget Appropriation Bill for that fiscal year (the \"5% Rule\"). The June 2014 estimate of net general fund revenue s for fiscal year 2015 was $3,949.0 million, thus a total of $197.5 million of new tax-supported general obl igation debt was permitted under the 5% rule and was authorized. The level of tax-supported debt permitted under the 5% Rule for the current and next four (4) fiscal years is set out in the following table. The fiscal year 2015 figures are based on Senate Joint Resolution No. 14 which provides fiscal year 2015 official revenue, refund and unencumbered fund estimates. The revenue estimates for fiscal years 2016 through 2019 are estimated from the September 15, 2014 meeting of the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (\"DEFAC\"), See \"STATE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS \u2014 Revenue Summary-Fiscal Year 2015E-Fiscal Year 2017 E\" herein. DEFAC projections are dependent on a variety of economic factors affecting the St ate's projected revenues. See \"STATE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS - Revenue and Expenditure Forecasting\". The 5% Rule (in millions) Estimated Net Budgetary Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 General Fund Revenue $ 3,949.0 $ 3,883.2 $ 4,007.5 $ 4,113.2 $ 4,237.1 Debt Authorizations $ 197.5 $ 194.0 $ 200.4 $ 205. 7 $ 211.9 Second, no \"tax-supported obligations of the State\" and no \"Transportation Trust Fund (\"Trust Fund\" or \"TTF\") debt obligations\" (each as hereinafter defined) of the Delaware Transportation Authority may be incurred if the aggregate maximum annual payments on all such outstanding obligations (plus certain lease obligations) exceed 15% of the estimated aggregate budget ary General Fund revenue, plus Trust Fund revenue for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such obligation is incurred (the \"15% Test\"). Any such debt incurred would ha ve to comply with this test, as illustrated in the following table: The 15% Test (in millions) Fiscal 2016(1) General Obligation Debt Service ............................... ................................. $ 252.1 Less: Excluded Debt Service (2) .................................................................

See \"STATE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS - Revenue a nd Expenditure Forecasting.\" -8- \"Tax-supported obligations of th e State\" include a) all obliga tions of the State or any agency or authority thereof to which the State's full faith and credit is pledged; and b) all obligations of the State or any agency or authority thereof extending beyond one year with respect to the lease, occupancy or acquisition of property which are incurred in connection with debt financing transactio ns (for example, certificates of participation), and which are payable from taxes, fees, permits, licenses and fines imposed or approved by the General Assembly. Tax-supported obligations do not include a) obligations incurre d to acquire a like principal amount of full faith and credit obligations issued by a local school district to the extent such local school district obligations are not in default; b) any obligations of the Delaware Transportation A uthority; c) any tax or other revenue anticipation notes or bonds of the State; or d) obligations to the extent th at the debt service with respect thereto is reasonably expected to be offset (as determined by the Secretary of Financ e) by lease payments, user fees, federal grants or other payments from a non-budg etary General Fund source. \"Transportation Trust Fund debt obligations\" include all debt obligations of the Dela ware Transportation Authority, including all obligations extending beyond one year with respect to the lease, occupancy or acquisition of property which are incurred in connection with debt financing transactions (for example, certificates of participation), and which in any case are payab le from the Trust Fund. Trust Fund debt obligations do not include any obl igations to the extent that t he debt service with respect thereto is reasonably expected to be offset (as determined by the Secretary of Financ e) by lease payments, user fees, federal grants or other payments from a non-State source. Third, no general obligation debt (with certain exclusions) may be incurred if the maximum annual debt service payable in any fiscal year on all such outstanding obli gations will exceed the estimated cumulative cash balances (including all reserves) for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such obligation is incurred (the \"Cash Balances Test\"), as estimated by the Secretary of Fi nance. The Bonds also comply with the Cash Balances Test, as illustrated below: The Cash Balances Test (in millions) Fiscal 2016 (1) General Obligation Debt Service ............................... .................................... $ 252.1 Less: Excluded Debt Service (2) ....................................................................

General Obligation Debt On June 30, 2014, the outstanding general obligation debt of t he State, a portion of which was supported by budgetary General Fund revenue and a portion of which was su pported by budgetary Special Funds, was as follows: -9-Outstanding General Obligation Debt (in millions) General Obligation Debt Supporte d by Budgetary General Fund Rev enue State Facilities .............................................. .................... $ ....................................................................... $ 1,286.9 General Obligation Debt Supporte d by Budgetary Special Funds Highways and Other Transportation Improvements ........ $ 0.1 School Facilities (Local Share) ............................... .......... 538.4 ....................................................................... ..................... $ 1,825.3(1) __________ (1) Totals may not add due to rounding. The Trust Fund reimburses the budgetary General Fund for the pa yment of debt service on previously issued transportation-related general obligation debt and debt issued on behalf of the Division of Motor Vehicle. As of June 30, 2014, $0.1 millio n of such debt was outstanding. The State pays between 60% and 80% of the cost of capital improvements for public school districts upon approval of such cost by the State Board of Education. The public school districts pay the remaining percentage. In conjunction with aggregate construction spendin g of capital improvement projects, the State issues bonds for 100% of the cost of approved school district p rojects pursuant to Authorization Acts. Simultaneously, the school distri cts issue their own bonds (the \"School District Bonds\") to the State for their 20% to 40% share of capital costs at an interest rate not excee ding 1/4 of 1% above the interest rate on the corresponding State bonds. As de bt service payments on the Sta te's bonds become due, school districts are required to pay debt service on the School District Bonds from their tax receipts into the State's budgetary Special Fund, and the State pays t he total debt service from bo th the budgetary General Fund and Special Fund appropriations. This policy allows the local school districts to borrow capital funds at very competitive rates and to lessen the associated costs of issuance and market access. No public school district has ever defaulted on any such oblig ation to the State. Authorized but Unissued General Obligation Debt Prior to the issuance of the Bonds, statutory authorization ex ists for the issuance of additional general obligation debt of the State in the principal amount of $398.6 million. General Obligation Note Debt There are no outstanding State general obligation notes or any notes of any authority or agency for whose debt the State has a contingent liability as of the date of this Official Statement. -10-Debt Burden Comparisons The State's general obligation debt outstanding was $1,825.3 m illion on June 30, 2014 with approximately 70.2% scheduled to mature within ten years. The following chart further demonstrates the State's commitment to the rapid retiremen t of its general obligation de bt. General Obligation Debt Amortization as of June 30, 2014 0%20%40%60%80%100% 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Delaware's debt burden reflects the centralized role of the Sta te government in financing capital projects that are typically funded by local governments in other states, such as schools and correctional facilities. In the U.S. Census Bureau's Public Educ ation Finances survey of 2012 i ssued in May 2014, Delaware ranked 10th in state spending per pupil in ele mentary - secondary public schoo ls. Of the $1,825.3 million of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2014, $538.3 million or 29.5% was issued on beha lf of local school districts. This debt is fully supported by the property tax revenues of those districts. T h e S t a t e h a s i n s t i t u t e d a n u m b er of measures designed to mana ge and reduce its indebtedness, as outlined below. Aggressive Retirement of General Obligation Debt : The State voluntarily retires its general obligation debt rapidly. Approximately 70.2% of current genera l obligation debt is scheduled to mature within ten years, as noted above. Strict Debt Limitations : In 1991, the State instituted new debt limits, one of which restricts new debt authorizations to 5% of budgetary General Fund revenue as projected for the next fiscal year. The debt limit also effectively eliminates the use of any \"off bala nce sheet\" financing instruments, such as certificates of participation. See \"Bonded Indebtedness of the State - Debt Limits\" for further information concerning the State's debt limits. Significant \"Pay-As-You-Go\" Financing : Over the years, the State has appropriated surplus cash for \"pay-as-you-go\" financing. Revenue surpluses between fiscal years 1993 to 2001 allowed the State to appropriate cash on average at a rate of 52.6% of capital ex penditures. With more modest revenue growth, cash contributions in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were reduced. However, between fiscal years 2004 and 2015, the cash funding exceeded $1.6 billion or 24.9% of capita l expenditures. -11- Numerous Bond Refundings : The State has undertaken a ser ies of bond refundings which h ave lowered the overall debt service on outstanding State general o bligation debt. The savings identified in the following sentences reflect net present value savings. In fisc al year 2003, the State refunded over $167 million of its general obligati on bonds for a combined savings of $8.7 million. In fiscal year 2004, savings of $2.9 million were realized a fter the State refunded $74.6 mi llion of its general obligation bonds; in fiscal year 2005, savings of $1.9 million were realized after the Stat e refunded $48.3 million of its general obligation bonds; in fiscal year 2008, savings of $0.7 million were realized after the State refunded $16.4 million of its general obligation bonds; in fiscal year 2010, s avings of $26.4 million were realized after the State refunded $460.6 million of its general obligation bonds; in fiscal year 2011, savings of $3.4 million were realized after the State refunded $54.6 million of its gen eral obligation bonds; and in fiscal year 2013, savings of $14.4 milli on were realized after the State refunded $123.3 million of its general obligation bonds. With the issuance of the 2014B Bonds, the State will realize ne t present value savings of approximately $5.4 million after refunding $89.3 million of its general obligation bonds. The State continues to monitor opportunities to refund its outstanding bonds to lower future d ebt service requirements. T h e r e s u l t o f t h e s e i n i t i a t i v e s h a s b e e n t o r e d u c e t h e r a t e o f growth in Delaware's debt burden, as depicted on a fiscal year basis in the following three charts.

In calendar year s 2009 and 2010, the State issued $295,090,000 in aggregate principal amount of Build America Bon ds and elected to receive periodic payments from the United States Treasury on each interest payme nt date equal to 35% of the corresponding interest payable on such Build America Bonds (the \"BAB Subsidy Payments\"). \"Qualified School Construction Bonds\" are taxable general obli gation bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the State and could be issued to finance th e construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a facility is to be constructed. For calendar years 2009 and 2010, the State received Qualified Scho ol Construction Bond allocations of $29,784,000 and $29,797,000, respectively. The State carried f orward the entire $29,784,000 from 2009 and issued $59,580,000 in aggregate principal amount of Qualifi ed School Construction Bonds in 2010 and elected to receive periodic payments from the United States Treasury on each interest payment date equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of interest payable on t he such Bonds on such date; or (ii) the amount of interest that would have been payable on the such Bonds if t he interest were determined at the applicable tax credit rate pursu ant to Section 54A(b)( 3) of the Code publi shed by the United States Treasury on the sale date of such Bonds (the \"Q SCB Subsidy Payments\"). Subsequent acts of Congress have reduced direct-pay bond subsi dy payments by 7.3% in federal fiscal year 2015 and by rates that will be set from time to tim e through federal fiscal year 2024. Neither the BAB Subsidy Payments nor the QSCB Subsidy Payments were pledged to the payment of the Build America Bonds or the Qualified School Cons truction Bonds, respectively. Such subsidy payments are paid directly to the State and the holders of such Build America Bonds and Qualified School Construction B onds are not entitled to a tax c redit related thereto, and interest paid to holders of such bonds is subject to federal income tax. Sustainable Energy Utility, Inc. E nergy Efficiency Revenue Bond s In August, 2011, pursuant to the Delaware Energy Act, 29 Del. C. \u00a78059, Energy Utility, Inc. (the \"SEU\"), a Delaware nonprofit corporation created by and for the benefit of the State issued $67,435,000 of its Sustainable Energy Utility , Inc. Energy Efficiency Reven ue Bonds, Series 2011 (the \"SEU Bonds\"). The SEU has developed a program (the \"SEU Program\") to issue bo nds and utilize the proceeds to pay the costs of designing and implementing energy conservat ion measures (\"ECMs\") at the facilities of agencies (defined to include the State, municipalities and s tate and local governmental agencies and institutions of higher learning). The SEU Bonds were issued to finance the initial ECMs for several State agencies and departments particip ating in the SEU Program (the \"Agencies\" and each an \"Agency\"). Each Agency is obligated to make or cause to be made payments ( the \"Installment Payments\") to the SEU for the ECMs under an Installment Payment Agreement in accordan ce with the Energy Performance Contracting Act, 29 Del. C. \u00a76971. Each Installment Payment Ag reement is the several obligation only of the applicable Agency under wh ich Installment Payments are p ayable by such Agency out of funds appropriated to such Agency by the State and available for such purpose. The SEU Bonds are limited obligations of the SEU payable primarily from the Installment Payments to be made by, or on be half of, the Agencies. The Agencies' obligations to make Installment Payments are subject to appropriation by the State, and the State is not obligated to make any appropriation to an Agency. Neither the State nor any politica l subdivision thereof shall be obligated to -14-make payments on the SEU Bonds. Neither the faith and credit n or the taxing power of the State or of any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the SEU Bonds. The issuance of the SEU Bonds does not directly or indi rectly or contingently obligate the State or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any f orm of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for their payment. Qualified Zone Academy Bonds Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (\"QZAB\") are general obligation bo nds backed by the full faith and credit of the State for the repayment of principal, primarily t hrough the use of a sinking fund with a bullet maturity. QZABs are taxable bonds the proceeds of which are li mited to improving eligible public schools, such capital projects having been approved by the General Assem bly. In lieu of receiving periodic interest payments from the State, an eligible QZAB holder is generally a llowed annual federal income tax credits while the QZAB is outstanding. On December 8, 2006, the State issued $1,433,000 QZABs for the purpose of financing renovations of the following facilities in t he Cape Henlopen School Distric t, Sussex County, Delaware: the Lewes School, Milton Elementary School, Rehoboth Elementary School and H.O. Brittingham Elementary School. In conjunction with such QZAB, the State executed a forward del ivery contract requiring that the State establish an escrow account to be funded with annual sinking fu nd deposits and which will be guaranteed interest at a rate of 2.72% per annum. In 2004, the State issued $908,000 QZABs and, in fiscal year 2 005, issued $224,177 QZABs to finance the renovations of the Charlton School in the Caesar Ro dney School District, Kent County, Delaware. In fiscal year 2003, the State issued $760,000 QZABs and, in fiscal year 2002, issued $649,000 QZABs. The fiscal year 2003 QZAB proceeds funded the renovation of the Charlton School in the Caesar Rodney School District, Kent County, Delaware. The fiscal year 2002 QZAB proceeds assisted in the renovation of Georgetown and Show ell elementary schools in the Indian River School District, Sussex County, Delaware. State Revenue Debt There is currently no State reve nue debt outstanding, nor any plans to authorize any State debt other than State general obligation debt. Lease Obligations The State has entered into long-term leases with terms in exce ss of one year. At June 30, 2014, aggregate remaining lease payments total approximately $169.8 m illion with $122.8 million payable through fiscal year 2019. Real estate re ntals account for 85.3% of the aggregate payments and equipment rentals account for the remainder. All payments are subject to annual appropri ation. The State may not be held contractually liable for the payments in the event that such appropriations a re not made. See \"APPENDIX B - Notes to the Financial Statements - #8, Leas e Commitments\". Lease obligatio ns are subject to one of the State's debt limits, the 15% Test. See \"BONDED INDEBT EDNESS OF THE STATE - Debt Lim its\" for a further explanation. INDEBTEDNESS OF AUTHORITIES, UNIVERSITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS Oversight responsibility for the issuance of debt by the State and authorities deemed to be part of the State's financial reporting entity is centralized under the Sec retary of Finance. The following section sets forth certain indebtedness of State authorities, Delaware State University, the University of Delaware and political -15-subdivisions of the State. The State is not directly or contin gently liable for debt service for any of the following indebtedness: Authorities Delaware Transportation Authority The Delaware Transportation Authority (the \"Authority\") is a b ody corporate and politic constituting an instrumentality of the State. The Authority acts by resolution of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (the \"Department\"), the Director of Finance of t he Department and the Transportation Trust Fund Administrator. The Department has overall responsibility for coordinating and developing comprehensive, multi-modal transportation pla nning and policy for the State. The Authority assists in the implementation of this policy and has the power to develop a unified system of air, wa ter, vehicular, public and specialized transportation in the State, subject to oversight by the Depart ment and the State as hereinafter described. To assist the Authority in fina ncing a unified transportation system, the State created the Transportation Trust Fund (the \"Trust Fund\" or \"TTF\") within the Authority in 1987 to receive revenue and receipts of the Authority. The primary sources of funding of the Trust Fund ar e motor fuel taxes, motor vehicle document fees, motor vehicle registration fees, and other transportation-related fees, all of which are imposed and collected by the State and transferred to the Trust Fund. The State has irr evocably pledged, assigned and continuously appropriated these taxes and fees to the Trust Fund. The other major source of funding for the Trust Fund is toll and concession revenue of the Delaware Turnpike and the Route 1 Toll Road. The Authority may apply Trust Fund revenue for transportation projects, subject to the approv al of the State, and may pledge any or all of this revenue to secure financings for these projects. As of June 30, 2014, the Delaware Transportation Authority had outstanding $845.0 million in Transportation System Revenue Bonds and $94.1 million in Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle Bonds, or \"GARVEEs\", which were issued to finance a portion of the costs of completing the final design and right-of-way acquisition activitie s for a new U. S. 301. The Au thority may i ssue bonds to refund prior Authority obligations. Additional bonds secured on pari ty with the TTF's senior bonds may be issued subject to the satisfaction of debt service coverage tests a nd certain other requirements. Under certain circumstances, additional revenue may be pledged by the Authority to secure its bonds, in which c ase such revenue may be taken into account in determining satisfacti on of these debt service coverage tests. The Authority may also incur additional debt, which has a lien on revenue subordinate to the lien of other bo nds. See \"APPENDIX B - Notes to the Financial Statements - #6, Revenue Bonds\". In addition to debt service cove rage tests and certain other re quirements, future debt issues of the Authority are subject to one of the debt limits of the State. The debt limit mandates that the aggregate maximum annual payments on the State's t ax-supported obligations and th e TTF debt obligations of the Authority (plus certain lease obligations) may not exceed 15% of total budgetar y General Fund revenue, plus Trust Fund revenue for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such deb t is issued. See \"BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE STATE - Debt Limits\" f or a further explanation. The bonds of the Authority do not constitute a debt of the Sta te or a pledge of the general taxing power or the faith and credit of the State or any political subdivisi on, agency or instrumentality thereof other than the Authority. The State's pledge a nd assignment to the Authority of motor fuel tax revenue, motor vehicle document fees, motor vehicle regi stration fees and other revenu e pursuant to State law creates an obligation of the State, until there are no longer any Authority bonds remain ing outstanding, to continue to impose and collect these taxes and fees at least at the rates in effect on the dat e of issuance of the Authority bonds and to transfer -16-this revenue to the Authority. The State, however, has no obli gation to increase these taxes or fees to provide sufficient revenue to meet payments of debt service on the Auth ority's bonds. Delaware State Housing Authority The Delaware State Housing Au thority (\"DSHA\"), created in 1968, had outstanding on June 30, 2014, $430.6 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds and $53.1 million of taxable revenue bonds. The total $483.7 million of the outstanding bonds were issued to finance the pur chase of single-family h omes. The security for these bonds is mortgage loan r epayments, reserve funds, bond pr oceeds and other revenue. The taxable bonds have been issued primarily to fi nance second mortgages, providi ng down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. See \"APPENDIX B - Notes to the Financial Statements - #6, Revenue Bonds\". Bonds issued by DSHA (\"DSHA Bonds\") do not constitute a debt o r liability of the State. The enabling legislation, however, provides t hat the General Assembly may, b ut is not obligated to, make appropriations to restore the DSHA's capital reserve fund if such fund is drawn u pon to meet debt service payments on certain of the DSHA's Bonds. As of June 30, 2014, there were no DSHA Bond s outstanding which are entitled to the benefit of the capital reserve fund. To date, the General Asse mbly has not been requested to make any such \"moral obligation\" appropriations. The statutory debt limit of the DSHA is $350.0 million in bonds carrying the moral obligation of the State. The Delaware Economic Development Authority The Delaware Economic Development Authority and its predecesso rs had outstanding approximately $672.2 million in economic development revenue bonds on June 30 , 2014, none of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the State. The following two Authorities a re not part of the State's fina ncial reporting entity. The State, however, exercises oversight regarding their debt activities. Delaware Solid Waste Authority The Delaware Solid Waste Authority (the \"DSWA\") was created in 1975 and is the sole entity in the State responsible for the planni ng and administration of a comp rehensive statewide program for the management, storage, collection, transportation, utilization, p rocessing (including resource recovery), and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge. On June 30, 2014, DSWA had $100.5 million outstanding solid waste revenue bonds. Delaware Health Facilities Authority The Delaware Health Facilities Authority (the \"Health Faciliti es Authority\"), established in 1973, is authorized to issue revenue bonds and notes to finance projects for health care facilities located in the State. As of June 30, 2014, there were outstanding $639.5 million of reve nue bonds issued for the benefit of these facilities. The Health Facili ties Authority has no taxing powe r and no source of funds other than from the contractual obligations of partic ipating health care facilities . Universities Delaware State University There were outstanding on June 30, 2014, $91.3 million of reve nue bonds issued by Delaware State University. These bonds are secu red by the Delaware State Univ ersity's pledge of certain of its net operating -17-revenue and net non-operating revenue, exclusive of gifts, gran ts, bequests, contributions and donations to the extent specifically restricted to a particular purpose inconsis tent with their use for the making of debt service payments and any funds a ppropriated by the State. University of Delaware There were outstanding on June 30, 2014, $445.7 million of rev enue bonds issued by the University of Delaware for housing, dining a nd other auxiliary facilities. T hese bonds are secured by revenue generated by the facilities. Political Subdivisions The approximate aggregate principal amount of general obligati on bond indebtedness of the three counties, the City of Wilmington, the other cities and towns an d the school districts of the State, as of June 30, 2014, is outlined i n the following table: General Obligation Debt of Political Subdivisions (in millions) New Castle County .......................................... $ 380.8 Sussex County (1) Of $5.0 million in principal is supported by paymen ts from the Diamond State Port Corporation, an instrumentality of the State. Excludes $18.8 million of Wilmington Parking Authority bonds guaranteed by the City of Wilmington. (2) Excludes revenue bonds and anticipation notes. (3) Represents local shares sold by the State on behalf of the scho ol districts (as reported in the earlier chart entitled \"Outstanding General Obligation Debt\"). Source: Chief fiscal officers of respective governmental entiti es. Indebtedness of counties, towns, and cities, other than the Ci ty of Wilmington, has been incurred primarily for water and sewer pr ojects and general municipal pu rposes, subject to various debt limits. The State is not liable for any of this indebtedness. Unlike most other states, the State, rather than the local governments, is principally responsible for cap ital expenditures for schools an d correctional facilities. School districts may not issue bonds (excluding bonds sold to the State by school districts to fund the 20% to 40% share of capital costs), except to refund outstandin g bonds, in an aggregate amount causing bonded debt of the district, less sinking funds on hand for payment of such bonded debt, to exceed 10% of the assessed value of the real prop erty in the district. ECONOMIC BASE The State is located on the eas tern seaboard of the United Sta tes and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay, as well as by the states of New Jersey, P ennsylvania and Maryland. It has a land area of 1,955 square miles, ranking 49th in area in the United States. The State is 96 miles long and varies from 9 to 35 -18-miles wide, with elevations ranging from sea level to 442 feet. As the first state to ratify the United States Constitution on Decembe r 7, 1787, Delaware i s known as \"The Fir st State.\" Recent History During the most recent two business cycles, Delaware's economic performance has largely mirrored national trends in terms of employment and income growth. In this period, Delaware has consistently posted lower unemployment rates than the United States. More recently , however, Delaware has experienced an unemployment rate aligning more closely to the national average . The State's recent performance is due, in part, to the changing composition of its economic base. With a heavy concentration in financial services, the State's economy could not avoid the effects of recent industry turmoil. Despite this uncertainty , the State's major employers , Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Bank Delaware and Capital One, continue to mainta in a major presence in the State and demonstrate the State's importance as a financial center. In addition to purchasing a former MBNA America Bank facility, JP Morgan Chase purchased two of its previously leased facilities in downtown Wilmington as well as 58 acres of the AstraZeneca campus in Fairfax, Delaware further demonstrating its commitment to Delaware. The State's long-est ablished manufacturing sectors, oil-refining and fibers, have also suffered as a result of the worst economic dow nturn since World War II. In r esponse to these setbacks, however, the State has made important strides to reinvigorate and modernize its ma nufacturing base. The site of the former Chrysler plant was purchased by the University of Delaware to p ursue science, technology and advanced research. The \"STAR\" campus now houses a health sciences compl ex dedicated to advanced healthcare research, education and delivery. Bloom Energy now produces so lid oxide fuel cells, \"Bloom Boxes\", in a new, on-site manufacturing facility, and through a project with NRG Energy Inc., all-electric vehicles give and take power from an electric power grid using technology invented at the University of Delaware. Diversifying the State's economy has consistently ranked among State policymakers' highest priorities since the adoption of the Financial Center Development Act in 1 981. The State's ec onomic development efforts have followed a two-pronged approach. Broadly speaking, the State has continually improved its business climate using a combination of (i) prudent fiscal mana gement, including judicious tax policy, and (ii) strategic investments in public education and infrastructu re. When faced with specific challenges, alert and supportive policymakers have teamed with the business commu nity to develop effective policy responses to a changing economic landscape. To enhance its position in an increasingly competitive gaming m arket and to increase employment across the State, Delaware diversified its gaming portfolio to include sports betting and Keno at multiple retail venues, and in November 2013, introduced i-gaming to in- state consumers via the internet. In February 2014, Governor Jack Markell of Delaware and Governor Brian Sand oval of Nevada signed a multi-state internet agreement that will allow poker players from both stat es to participate in a combined player pool creating a larger marketplace. Delaware continues to explore a dditional gaming offerings and multistate compacts for online gaming. The State continues to pursue high technology industries, including life sciences research and development, pharmaceuticals, a gricultural biotechnology, human biotechnology, information technology and, more recently, alternative energy and other green industri es. The State has made a significant investment to establish the Dela ware Biotechnology Institute, a partnership involving State government, the State's higher education institutions and the private sector. T he Institute is designed to expand the State's scientific base and create opportu nities for the development of new technologies in the emerging life sciences field. -19-The State's business-friendly legal system continues to attract new incorporations. Even though initial public offering (\"IPO\") activity has suffered from econ omic and other factors, the State has continued to register a record number of business formations in the form of limited liability companies and limited partnerships. In 2013, more than 152,000 new business entities were formed in Delaware bringing the total number of business entities registered in the State to more tha n 1,051,000. Population Between 2012 and 2013, Delaware's population was estimated to h ave increased by 0.9 percent, to 925,749 inhabitants.

The partnership brings together Delaware's financial, accounting, legal and real estate communi ties, as well as the University of Delaware, Delaware State University, Dela ware Technical and Community Col lege and other institutions of higher education. -28-The University of Delaware's outstanding reputation for researc h in cooperation with industry is well recognized in many areas. Its innovative research efforts are illustrated through its partnerships with industry in composite materials, information science, biotechnology, alt ernative energy, virology and development of genetically engineered vaccines, and agrigenetics, including pl ant tissue culture research. Through its seven colleges, institutes and various centers, including the Center for Composite Materials, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, and Center for Climatic Research, the U niversity of Delaware has fostered growth and development in the chemical , computer, energy, food, agricu ltural and marine sciences industries. The University of Delaware's Institute of Energy Conversion, on e of the world's largest thin-film solar cell laboratories performing research and process develop ment for industry, has been designated by the U.S. Department of Energy as a national center of excellence in photovoltaic research and education. The University of Delaware's Center for Composite Materials is one of three partners in an Army Research Laboratory Materials Center of Excellence. Nemours Biomedical Research, the nation's largest group medical practice devoted to pediatric care, education, and research and headquartered at the Nemours Alfred I. DuPont Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, has more than 40 different research programs and labo ratories to support the medical and surgical staff in restoring and improving the health of acutely and chro nically ill children. Based on dollars received from the National Institutes of Health, Nemours Biomedical Rese arch would rank 16th in overall awards to freestanding children's hospitals. According to the American H ospital Association Guide, there are about 250 such children's hospitals. The Delaware Technology Park (\"DTP \") is part of Delaware's comm itment to attracting both established businesses and promising high-tech companies. With a combination of government, academic and industry partners, it is now home to 54 high-tech companies , including the Delaware Biotechnology Institute. The mission behind DTP is to promote economic devel opment and innovation and, to that end, has developed an integrated system of technology focused facilities and services. Since its inception, DTP has housed more than 75 companies, including 25 companies that have matured and graduated from DTP. There has been $300 million invested in DTP and an additional $300 mi llion given to DTP organizations through research grants. Biotechnology Delaware is one of a few states with a specialization in all fo ur bioscience subsections: (1) agriculture, feedstock and chemicals; (2) drugs and pharmaceuti cals; (3) medical devices and equipment; and (4) research and testing. With its roots in the research and d evelopment standards set by the DuPont Company more than 200 years ago, Delaware is currently home to life science firms ranging from incubator start-ups to multinational gian ts with a supportive environment for creativity and innovation. Delaware is uniquely positioned geographically and scientifica lly to maximize the biotechnology industry across all spectrums. Delaware's location at the center of the East Coast of the United States provides excellent access to world markets. Delaware lies in t he eastern megalopolis where approximately one-third of the United States' population resides. A 350-mile radius circle, drawn around the City of Wilmington, Delaware, encompasses every major population center from Boston, Massachusetts to Raleigh, North Carolina, and as far west as Cleveland, Ohio. Modern hig hways, railroads, airports, ports, and public transit systems facilitate the m ovement of produc ts and people. The Delaware Biotechnology Institute (\"DBI\"), located in DTP, i s an academic unit of the University of Delaware and a partnership among government, academia and industry to help establish Delaware as a center of excellence in biotechnology and the life sciences. DBI's mission is to build a biotechnology network of people and facilities to enhance acade mic and private sector research, catalyze -29-unique cross-disciplinary research and education initiatives an d to foster the entrepreneurship that creates high quality jobs. DBI's 72,0 00 square foot research facility is designed to house 140 faculty and student researchers and features 25 dedicated research laboratories, 10 common research laboratories, six state-of- the-art research instrumentation centers, and several large and small conference areas. Some of the companies launched at DBI are: the Fraunhofer Center for Molecu InfoQuest Systems, iB io, Occam BioLabs and Quantum Leap Innovations. DBI contributes at all levels to Delaware's innova tion in Science, Technology, Eng ineering and Math (STEM) by leading the State's annual BioGENEius Challe nge, by collaborating with the national Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and by augmenting k-12 biotechnology educati on with programs for teachers as well as students throughout the school year. DBI led Delaware's effort toward s gaining Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (\"EPSCoR\") status with the National Science Foundation 's Experimental Program Status Competitive Research. EPSCoR status provides Delaware and 22 o ther qualifying states and U.S. Territories with a better chance for federal funding dollars. Eight federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\") and the National Science Foundation (\"NSF\"), participate in this program. Over the past five years, DBI h as successfully built a capabili ty in plant molecular biology to better understand the basic processes that control plant development o n the genetic level. Combined with the highly regarded genomics-based poultry disease research located at DBI, this newly developed capability has direct applications to serve Delaware's agricultural industry. Leading-edge interdisciplinary research is at the core of DBI's work. Successful partnerships are already underway involving biology, biochemistry, engineering, marine, materials science and computational biology. Encompassing 12 academic departments at the Universit y of Delaware alone, collaborations are also state-wide, national and in ternational, with the participa tion of scientists from Delaware State University, DTCC, and Wesley College. DBI-affiliated researche rs are principal investigators in a growing portfolio of federal research grants from NSF, NIH, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") and numerous other government agencies and private foundations. In 2012, with support from the State, DBI launched The Bioscien ce Center for Advanced Technology (\"The Bioscience CAT\"), which synergizes efforts amo ng the academic and industrial community to address the technology innovation gap and promote economic development in Delaware. The Bioscience CAT links researcher s in Delaware institutions with Delaware bioscience companies with the goal of investing in the bioscience community to ensure Delawar e competes on the world stage in biotechnology innovation. The Bioscience CAT has three key com ponents: a grant program funded by the State, a technology access program, and an annual symposium. T he Technology Access Program (\"TAP\") provides Delaware bioscience businesses with access - at a redu ced fee - to high-end technology platforms available as part of the DBI ne twork. Many businesses routinely send samples to these facilities for analysis and pay a certain rate for this service. Under TAP, businesses will be able to continue to do their work, but receive a discounted rate that i s subsidized by Bioscience CAT. Delaware's investments serve as seed funding for private invest ments, as found in the example of Fraunhofer Center for Molecular Biotechnology (\"CMB\"). Establi shed in July 2001 as a partnership between the Fraunhofer Society in Germany and the State, CMB co nducts research in the area of plant biotechnology, developing cutting edge technologies to assist t he diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human and animal diseases. With the addition of CMB manufactur ing capability and the successful completion of two successful Phase I clinical trials, CMB's pla nt-based, protein production technology achieved several important developmental milestones. The advan cement of FhCMB's work, as measured by the U.S. Department of Defense, has evolved from Level 1- Basic technology research, through proof of feasibility, technology development and demonstration to level 8 - System and subsystem development, -30-which has made CMB eligible for new funding from various govern ment departments including the NIH. This is a major accomplishment which both externally validates CMB's innovative technology and enables the organization to move closer to the goal of improving sustai nability. After several rounds of funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against malaria, CMB recently received funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to advance development of candidate vaccine components and technologies that accelerate the immune response for use following intentional release of Bacillus anthracis or in response to naturally occurring outbre aks. Another new project, funded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reductio n Agency, will develop a cost- effective, high throughput, ex-vivo, lung tissue- based system for evaluating vaccine safety and immunogenicity directly in human tissue. This three year contr act will address one of the largest obstacles in the current system of evaluating vaccine safety and immunogenic ity - the lengthy testing in animal models that preceded clinical drug development. To ensure Delaware's continued voice in regional biotechnology industry opportunities, the Delaware BioScience Association (\"DBA\") was formed in 2006. DB A is a non-profit trade association dedicated to promoting and expa nding Delaware's bioscience indu stry by establishing a unified voice in order to accelerate the growth of human, animal, plant, and ind ustrial bioscience, advocating on behalf of the industry in support of public policies that advance bioscience in the State, supporting initiatives that help attract bioscience talent and enterprises to the State, as well as support their retention and growth, while developing and implementing programs that build local, regional , national, and international recognition of and support for Delaware's biosci ence industry. The membership has grown to include over 120 members including several global companies such as AstraZeneca, Endo Ph armaceuticals, QPS LLC, previously known as Quest Pharmaceutical Services and Siemens Healthcare. Delaware State University (\"DSU \") is another proud contributor to Delaware's biotechnology research and technology transfer. In 2009, DSU launched the Ce nter for Integrated Biological and Environmental Research designed as a regional faculty network h ub that includes DSU, Wesley College, DTCC and the University of Delaware. Major functions of the ce nter include: (1) identifying funding opportunities and assisting in bringing together groups of rese archers in order to secure grants; (2) communicating the availability of and training on the use of re search instrumentation and equipment across the network; (3) coordinating the use and maintenance of key co mmon research facilities at DSU; and (4) integrating research and outreach activities for partner instit utions. All students on the Biotechnology track at DSU complete an independent research project for their Senior C apstone course. D e l a w a r e i s a l s o h o m e t o a n u m b e r of healthcare-related, biotec hnology facilities such as: (i) Christiana Care's Health System's Helen F. Graham Cancer Center (one of only 34 National Cancer Institute's Community Oncology Research Program Community sites and one of only 12 Minority/Underserved Community sites that will implement the la test, most scientifically-advanced clinical research designed and led by NCORP under a 5-year, $8.2 million grant); (ii) The Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs (the U.S. Department of Defense's largest joint-service mortuary facility and the only one located in the continental United States); (iii) the 436th Medical Group at Dover Air Force Base; (iv) A.I. DuPont Hospital ( x ) S i e m e n s H e a l t h c a r e ; ( x i ) U P S Caulk; and (xiii) CD Diagn Industry Banks and other financial institu tions have been a major focus of Delaware's economic development activity since 1981. In that year, landmark legislation was pa ssed that opened Delaware to interstate -31-banking, modernized the State's banking laws, and permitted the creation of new types of special purpose intermediaries. The 1981 Financial Center Development Act crea ted strong economic incentives for the banking industry in Delaware, including a favorable state tax s tructure and a market based approach to lending that eliminated restrictive usury caps. These laws con tinue to create a favorable economic environment for banking. The Sta te subsequently enacted additi onal legislation in order to sustain the State's competitive advantage in banking. In 1989, the Bank and Trust Company Insurance Powers Act was signed into law which allowed State-chartered banks and trust companie s to underwrite and sell various types of insurance. In response to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking a nd Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, the State enacted legislation in 199 5 to keep Delaware's banking co mmunity competitive and to maintain Delaware's role as a financial services center. In 1995, the S tate Bank Commissioner issued the \"Incidental Powers Regulation\", which is designed to keep Delaware competit ive by allowing State-chartered banks and trust companies to exercise add itional powers incident to a ban king corporation. The State tax structure was modernized in 2006 by allowing banks to elect an alternative sy stem based on a three-factor income apportionment for multi-state opera tions, plus a location benef it tax reflecting the value of utilizing Delaware's banking laws and bank system. There are currently about 80 banks and trust companies in Delaw are, including full-service commercial banks, credit card ba nks, non-deposit and limited pu rpose trust companies, wholesale banks, and federal and state savings banks. Banking is one of the State's largest private industry sector employers, with over 26,000 employees as of December 2013, according to the Del aware Department of Labor. Credit cards are a major industry. Prominent credit card issuers in Delawar e include Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Discover Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware. Other m ajor bank employers include M&T Bank Corporation, PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Capital One, N.A., Citigroup and BNY Mellon. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, the bank franchise tax co ntributed $102.9 million, about 2.9% of the State's total revenues. Construction During 2013, Delaware's housing production totaled 4,693 units. The following table outlines total housing production in the State b y county for 2009 through 2013 . Housing production includes single- family and multifamily housing, public and private. In 2013, single-family housing (including condominiums) represented 83.0% of total production, and multif amily units represented 17.0%.

Incorporations As of December 2013 the total number of business entities regis tered with the Delaware Division of Corporations exceeded 1,051,000. More than 152,000 new busines s entities were formed in Delaware in 2013. The State continues to be the corporate home of over hal f of all publicly-traded firms in the United States. Delaware is the legal domicile of more than 65% of the companies listed in the \"Fortune 500\". Delaware leads the nation in per capita business entity filings and has ranked among the top five states in the nation for new business entity formations since 1989. The principal driver of this growth over the long term has been the popularity of alternative business entities, such as Delaware limited liability companies. -32-The Delaware General Corporation Law is widely regarded as the most modern and flexible corporate statute in the nation. In addition to the option of forming a Delaware corporation, the Delaware Code enables businesses to form as general partnerships, limite d partnerships, limited liability companies and statutory trusts. Businesses may also qualify as limited liabi lity partnerships or limited liability limited partnerships. Delaware's legal e ntity statutes, combined with a well-developed body of case law in important areas of corporate governance such as director liabil ity and takeovers; prompt resolution of commercial and corporate disputes by Delaware's Court of Chancery; and efficient service from the Delaware Division of Corporati ons have resulted in significant business formation activity. In order to sustain its competitive edge over other states and countries, Delaware continues to adopt statutes that respond to changing business conditions. Recent laws extend the corporate jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to include jurisdiction over commercial techn ology disputes and allows the Court to mediate many types of complex business disputes, providing a mo re cost-effective, confidential, and consensual method for resolving litigable disputes. Another re cent law permits corporations to form as public benefit corporations, a new kind of socially-conscious, for-profit corporation whose affairs are to be conducted for the benefit of stockholders as well as certain sp ecific public benefits and those affected by the corporation's activities. Delawar e law provides incentives for businesses to locate headquarter services and captive insurance operations in Delaware. The State's legal en tity laws provide a simple method for domesticating an entity in Delaware and converting from one typ e of business entity to another type of entity. The Division of Corporations continues to enhance its services by offering 1-hour processing service and expanding Internet services to allow businesses to reserve corporate names, access general corporate information and file annual tax returns. All of these enhancements provide further incentives for entrepreneurs, businesses and investors to make Delaware their legal home. Revised Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") took effect in most U.S. states in 2001 and provided that many UCC documents should be filed in th e debtor's state of incorporation. In July 2001, Delaware became one of the f irst states to allow for the filing of UCC information via the Internet. General Fund revenue from UCC tr ansactions totaled $17.1 million in fiscal year 2014. Agriculture Agriculture is a very significant industry in Delaware. In 20 13, there were 2,450 farms, and land in farms at 500,000 acres, accounted f or 40% of Delaware's total l and area. Farm size averaged 204 acres. In 2013, the total market value of agricultural land and buildi ngs was $4.09 billion, and the average value per farm was $1,667,000. T he average market value per acre of farmland and buildings in Delaware was $8,170, nearly three times the national average of $2,730. Only four states had a higher value per acre of farm real estate. The average value per acre was virtually unchanged from 2012. In 2012, the value of agricultural sector production was $1.38 billion and the Delaware agricultural cash receipts total was $1.18 b illion for all commodities. Cas h receipts in 2012 were up 11% from the 2011 level of $1.08 billion. Delaware's 2012 net farm income increased 17% from the 2011 level of $232 million to $272 million. Increased crop production, higher crop prices and a r ecord high broiler price were primarily responsible for the increase in net farm income. In 2012, agricultural production value per farm was $550,717 an d the value per acre was $2,810. Cash receipts per acre was at $2,409 and net farm income per a cre was at $556. -33- The cash receipts from Delaware farms as compared to the U.S. total in 2008-2012 are outlined in the table below.

The Port of Wilmington The Port of Wilmington (the \"Port\") is one of the two largest i mporters of containerized bananas and other fruit in the world and is a significant east coast import er of: break bulk fruit, juice and produce, particularly winter Chilean fruit, citrus products from Morocco , juice concentrate and fruit from Argentina, liquid bulk juice concentrate from Brazil, and liquid petroleum products. Other notable break bulk items moving over the Port's piers include: steel, paper liner board, dry bulk, and scrap metal. The Port has also established a niche in handling specialized cargo such as large wind turbines, dismantled distillation and chemical plants, generators, rocket booster cores, concrete rai lroad ties, and livestock export. The Port continues to be a major point of consolidation and export of ve hicles to the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South America. The Port has a central location on the east coast and excellent access to rail and highway transportation systems. Warehouse facilities include 250,000 s quare feet of dry and 750,000 square feet of modern temperature controlled refrigerated space. The combinat ion of relatively new facilities, operational experience, proximity to trans portation networks and a skilled labor force has made the Port among the most successful ports in the very competitive mid-Atlantic and North east region. Founded in 1923, the Port is own ed and operated by the Diamond State Port Corporation (\"DSPC\"). In June 1995, the General Assemb ly authorized the creation of t he DSPC, a membership c orporation with the Department of State as the sole member, for the purpose of acqu iring and operating the Port. On September 1, 1995, DSPC acquire d substantially all of the Port's assets from the City of Wilmington. Under the terms of that agreement, DSPC agreed to make payments to the City of Wilmington equal to $39.9 million over a 30-year period and to pay amounts equal to total debt service on approximately $51.0 million of indebtedness previously incu rred by the City of Wilmington f or Port related assets. The Delaware Transportation Authority's Transportation Trust Fund has loaned funds to the DSPC to enable it to restructure certain of the DSPC's debt and to fund certain capital projects. The Delaware River and Bay Authority has participated with DSPC to fund a refrigerated war ehouse in 2006. The total long-term debt of the DSPC outstanding as of June 30, 2013 was $26.7 million. DSPC does not have the power to pledge the credit of the State. In fiscal year 2013, a total of 5.2 million tons of cargo passe d through the Port's facilities, an increase of 2% compared to fiscal year 2012. The combination o f growth in cargo tonnage and changes to -34-the mix of cargo increased operating revenue by 8% from $34.0 million to $36.7 million. Petroleum liquid bulk imports decreased by 0.2 million tons in fiscal year 2013 to 1.3 million tons. Compared to fiscal year 2012, dry-bulk cargo tons increas ed by 8%, vehicle tons by 7%. Over $187 milli on has been provided by the State through fiscal year 2013 for Port infrastructure improvements and debt restructuring. The Port is not required to repay these funds. The Port is part of the State's financial reporting entity and is considered an enterprise fund for the State's GAAP (hereinafter defined) financial reporting purposes . See \"Appendix C - Notes to the Financial Statements-#6, Revenue Bonds\". Dover Air Force Base The federal government maintains a major U.S. Air Force Base ( the \"Base\") in Dover, Delaware. The 3,900 acre Base, established in 1941, is the nation's busiest military cargo terminal and a key airlift center. It is home to the 436th Airlift Wing, known as the \"Eagle Wing\" and t he 512 th Airlift Wing, referred to as the \"Liberty Wing\". The 436th Airlift Wing provides command and su pport functions for assigned airlift operations, permitting worldwide movement of outsized cargo (including the military's largest tanks and heaviest weapons and equipment) and personnel. The unit flies Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport planes, known as \"the free world's largest airlifter\" and C-17 Globemaster. Together with the 512th Airlift Wing, aircrews from Dover fly an air fleet that comprises 25% of the nation's strategic a irlift capacity. In addition, the Base hosts the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs, the defense depa rtment's largest joint-service mortuary facility and the only one located in the continental U.S. There are app roximately 6,400 military personnel - 3,900 active duty, 1,500 reservists, and 1,000 civilians - who work at the B ase. It is estimated that the economic impact of the Base on the lo cal economy is $466 million annually. STATE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS The State controls and records its financial transactions on a cash basis of accounting for its day-to- day operations in accordance with the various budgets and statu tes passed by the General Assembly and approved by the Governor. See \"FINANCIAL STRUCTURE Budgetary Control and Financial Management Systems\". The State's audited J une 30, 2013, Basic Financial S tatements as set forth in Appendix B, were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally acc epted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") using both the modified accrual basis and full accrual basis of accounting. The following discussion of State finances relates to the budgetary General and budgetary Special Funds of the State, as more fully set out in the financial statements included under Appendix A hereto. Revenue and Expenditure Forecasting The Delaware Economic and Financ ial Advisory Council (\"DEFAC\"), created in 1977, is comprised currently of 33 members appointed by the Governor. Current mem bers of DEFAC include five cabinet-level officials, the State Treasurer, the Controller General, one oth er governmental official, six legislators, and 19 private citizens from the business, financial and academic comm unities. DEFAC is mandated by executive or der to submit to the Governor and the General Assembly budgetary General Fund and Trans portation Trust Fund revenue fo recasts six times each fiscal year in September, December, March, April, May and June for the current fiscal year and the succeeding two fiscal years. A forecast for the current fiscal year and the succeedi ng four fiscal years is generated once each year, no later than October 1. Budgetary General Fund and Transportation Trust Fund expenditure forecasts are generated for the current fiscal year in December, March, April , May and June. The various DEFAC forecasts contained in this Official Statement were provided as of September 15, 2014. -35-These revenue and expenditure forecasts are used in the State b udget process to ensure compliance with the State's constitutional limits on spending and statutory debt limitations. See \"FINANCIAL STRUCTURE - Appropriation Limit\" a nd \"Debt Limits\". The subcom mittees of DEFAC are the Expenditure and Revenue subcommittees, which meet prior to the DEFAC meetings. The full DEFAC meetings are open to the public and provide a general forum for members of the private and public sectors to exchange views on matters of economic and fiscal concern for th e State. DEFAC relies on projections of national economic trends by IHS Global Insight, Inc. (formerly DRI- WEFA), the Department of Finance's econometric model, projectio ns generated by the Department of Transportation, its members' know ledge of the State's particula r economic strengths , and its members' understanding of the structure of the State's revenue system. A comparison of DEFAC's forecasts of budgetary General Fund revenue with actual year-end revenue is reviewed in the following table. These forecasts were generated 18 months and 9 months prior to the en d of each fiscal year. DEFAC does not project the revenue impact of legislation until after its enact ment.

The Master Settlement Agreeme nt (the \"Agreement\") entered into by the State and participating tobacco manufacturers in late 1998 has resulted in significant payments to the State. The size of payments to Delaware is subject to a number of poss ible offsets and adjustments outlined in the Agreement. Such offsets include, but are not limited to, the r eduction in sales of products from participating manufacturers. The State created a special fund called the \"Delaware Health Fu nd\" into which proceeds received as a result of the Agreement are deposited. The General Assembly and the Governor may authorize expenditure of these monies to expand access to health care and health insu rance, make long-term investments in State- owned health care infrastructure, promote healthy lifestyles in cluding tobacco, alcohol, and drug prevention, and promote preventive health care for Delawareans. The fund r equires an annual appropriation by the General Assembly and is administered by the Secretary of Financ e. As of June 30, 2014, approximately $413.4 million has been received by the State from participatin g manufacturers. At June 30, 2014, the balance in the Delaware Health Fund was $5.9 million, a portion of which was appropriated through the fiscal year 2015 budget process to various health related progr ams. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE General The State budgets and controls its financial activities on the cash basis of accounting for its fiscal year (July 1 to June 30). In compliance with State law, the State r ecords its financial transactions in either of two major categories, the budgetary General Fund or budgetary Speci al Funds. References to these two funds in this document include the terms \"budgetary\" or \"budgetary basis\" to differentiate them from the GAAP funds of the same name which encompass differe nt funding categories. The bu dgetary General Fund provides for the cost of the State's general operations a nd is credited with all tax and other revenue of the State not dedicated to budgetary Special Funds. All disbursements from the budgetary General Fund must be authorized by appropriations of the General Assembly. Budgetary Special Funds are desi gnated for specific purposes. The appropriate budgetary Special Fund is credited with the tax or other revenue allocated to such fun d and is charged with the related disbursements. Specific uses of the budgetary Special Funds include State park s operations and fees charged by the Public Service Commission and The Division of Professional Regulation. Federal payments and unemployment compensation are examples of non-appropriated budgetary Special Funds. Some budgetary Special Funds, such as the Delaware State Housing Authority and the State Pension O ffice, contain both appropriated funds for operations and non-appropriated f unds for specific programs, su ch as public housing and pension benefits. The Basic Financial Statements in APPENDIX B hereof have been prepared to conform to the standards of financial reporting set forth by the Governmental Accounting S t a n d a r d s B o a r d ( \" G A S B \" ) i n i t s v a r i o u s statements and interpretations. GAAP reporting standards allow the accurate assessment of financial condition and enable the State to present its total fiscal operation in c onformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In GAAP reporting, operations of the primary government and co mponent units are recorded under three main fund types - Governme ntal, Proprietary and Fiduciary , as defined by GASB. The fund types and account groups are described in Note 1 of the accompanying GAAP Basic Financial Statements in APPENDIX B. A reconciliation of budgetary General and Special Funds to GAAP is found in the Required Supplementary Information Section of the financial statements i n APPENDIX B. -49- Capital assets are defined by the State as assets which have a cost of $15,000 or more at the date of acquisition and have an expected useful life of one or more yea rs. All land and buildings are capitalized regardless of cost. Purchased and constructed capital assets a re valued at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Donated fixed assets are r ecorded at their fair market v alue at the date of donation. The State has elected to use the \"modified approach\" to accoun t for certain infrastructure assets, as provided by GASB Statement No. 34. Under this process, the Sta te does not record depreciation expense nor are amounts capitalized in connection with improvements to these as sets, unless the improvements expand the capacity or efficiency of an asset. Roads and bridges maintain ed by the Department of Transportation are accounted for using the modified approach. Budget Process As noted earlier, all disbursements from the budgetary General Fund and certain budgetary Special Funds must be authorized by appropriation of the General Assemb ly. In the fall of the fiscal year, each State agency submits to the Budget Office under the Office of Managem ent and Budget (\"OMB\") a request for operating and capital funds for the ensuing fiscal year. Publi c hearings on the requests are subsequently conducted. The Governor's prop osed operating and capital budge ts for the budgetary General Fund and budgetary Special Funds, including the Transportation Trust Fun d, are then drafted and presented by the Governor to the General Assembly in January. The General Assem bly's Joint Finance and Bond Bill Committees hold hearings and mark up the Governor's proposed op erating and capital budgets, respectively. As amended, the budgets are expected to be passed prior to July 1 and signed by the Governor shortly thereafter. State agencies currently participate in a uniform budgeting pr ocess whereby each agency submits with its budget request a department mi ssion, key objectives, background and accomplishments, and activities and performance measures. This fully integrated budget submission provides much information to the public as well as to State decision-makers. Federal funds are not appropriated but are subject to the revi ew and approval of OMB and the Delaware State Clearinghouse Committee for Federal Aid Coordination. Th e Committee is comprised of 10 members, including the Secretary of Finance, Director of OMB, Director o f the Delaware Economic Development Office, the Controller General, and six legislators. Appropriation Limit The State Constitution limits annual appropriations by majority vote of both houses of the General Assembly to 98% of estimated budgetary General Fund revenue, pl us the unencumbered budgetary General Fund balance from the previous year. An appropriation exceedin g this limit may be made in the event of a declared emergency, with the approval of a three-fifths vote of the members of each house of the General Assembly, but no appropriation may be made exceeding 100% of es timated budgetary General Fund revenue plus the unencumbered budgetary General Fund balance from the p revious fiscal year. In June 2014, the General Assembly authorized appropriations of $3,878.7 million for fiscal year 2015, within the projected 98% appropriation limit. -50-Budget Reserve Account The Budget Reserve Account (commonly referred to as the \"Rainy Day Fund\") is designed to provide a cushion against unanticipated re venue shortfalls. The State Co nstitution provides that the excess of any unencumbered budgetary General Funds at the end of a fiscal yea r must be placed in a reserve account (the \"Budget Reserve Account\") within 45 days following the end of t he fiscal year, provided that the amount of funds in the Budget Reserve Acco unt does not exceed 5% of the e stimated budgetary Gen eral Fund revenue used to determine the appropriation limit for that fiscal year. Tra nsfers are made in August based on June revenue projections, with consideration given to year-end operating res ults of the previous fiscal year. Transfers of $212.5 million have been made which fully funded the Budget Reserve Account for fiscal year 2015. Money from the Budget Reserve Account may be appropriated only with t he approval of a three-fifths vote of the members of each house of the General Assembly and only to fund an unanticipated budgetary General Fund deficit or to provide funds requir ed as a result of the enactme nt of legislation reducing revenue. No funds have been withdrawn from the Budget R eserve Account si nce its incept ion in 1980. Tax Limitations The State Constitution was amended in May 1980 to limit tax an d license fee increases or the imposition of any new taxes or fees. Any tax or license fee increase or t he imposition of any new tax or license fee must be passed by a three-fifths vote of each house of the General Asse mbly, rather than by a simple majority vote, except for tax increases to meet debt service on outstanding ob ligations of the State for which insufficient revenue is available when such debt service is due. The amendm ent requires the State t o appropriate, prior to each fiscal year of the State, sums sufficient to meet debt ser vice in the following fiscal year, a practice the State has always followed. Internal Control Structure The State has established and maintains an internal control str ucture designed to ensure that the assets of the State are protected from loss, theft, or misuse, and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements i n conformity with GAAP. The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a c ontrol should not exceed t he benefits likely to be derived and that evaluation of costs and benefits requires e stimates and judgments by State officials. Determination as to the adequacy of the internal control struct ure is made within the a bove framework. State officials believe the State's internal control structure adequa tely safeguards assets and provides reasonable assurance of proper recording of financial transactions. In th e beginning of fiscal year 2011, the State fully implemented and upgraded its financial systems to continue to s afeguard its assets and properly record its financial transactions. Disbursements from State funds are controlled by an encumbrance accounting system that is designed to provide information on the actual extent of the Sta te's obligations (as determined by purchase orders issued) and to guard against over-committing available funds. Disbursements are controlled through the encumbrance system in such a way that purchase orders issue d for goods and services cause a reduction in available appropriations. As a result, the amount of budget ary General Fund cash disbursements plus unliquidated encumbrances cannot exceed the amount appropriated by the General Assembly for any budget line. At fiscal year-end, cash is reserved to pay outstanding encumbr ances (orders for goods and services not yet received or for which payment has not been made). Budg etary General Fund encumbrances are carried over as encumbered appropriations and paid out and reco rded as disbursements in the succeeding fiscal year. All obligations created by purchase orders (encum bered amounts) are liquidated upon -51-satisfactory receipt of goods and services. Budgetary General Fund appropriations, which have not been disbursed, continued or encumbered at fiscal year-end, lapse. Such lapsed appropriations are referred to as reversions in the State's financial reports. The State restricts commitments for budgetary General Fund expenditures by State agencies. Commitments to incur expenditures in excess of an appropriation (to be funded from unused funds appropriated to other agencies) must be approved by the Directo r of the OMB and the Controller General. Although the majority of the Stat e's financial transactions are processed through the accounting system, certain budgetary Special Funds have financial activity , such as investments, outside the system. For example, the Transportation Trust Fund, the Delaware State Housing Authority, the deferred compensation programs and Delaware State University all maintai n certain financial activity outside the system. This activity is governed in adherence to legislative regulations as well as guidelines established by their respective boards. In addition, these entities are audit ed annually and produce published financial reports. The Auditor of Accounts is required to make audits of all agenc ies collecting State revenue or expending State funds in excess of $500,000 each year, and, to the extent possible, to make annual audits of the financial transactions of all other State agencies. The Au ditor of Accounts also reviews certain records of the Secretary of Finance and State Treasurer on a quarterly bas is to reconcile the State's bank accounts to such records. Tax Collection Procedures Most of the State's taxes are collected under a self-assessing system. Taxpayers prepare the tax forms and pay the amounts they determine are due. When the State det ermines that a payment is less than the amount due, assessments may be made which can include applicable penalties and interest as allowed by law. The State has continually instituted procedures to identify no n-filers and increase compliance with its tax statutes. The procedures include comparing federal income tax records with State income tax records, comparing State records for various years, and cross-referencing the license tax files to licensee lists from the State's various regulatory boards. Through the Attorney General's Office, the State employs legal procedures to effect payment of past due balances. These procedures include filing actions in the Justi ce of the Peace, Common Pleas and Superior Courts on bad checks received. Procedures have been instituted for the garnishment of wages and bank accounts and the sale of personal proper ty through the County Sheriffs. By statute, the State's accounts receivable may be removed fro m current active accounts only if the account is more than six years old and is determined to be unco llectible or if the potential recovery or administrative costs of collection would not warrant further co llection efforts. Recently enacted legislation allows the Division of Revenue t o write off the accounts of tho se who are deceased or bankrupt. Recently enacted legislation requires the Secretary of Finance to prepare, maintain and publish on the Division of Revenue's Internet Website two separate lists of th e top 100 business and personal taxpayers owing outstanding tax liabilities in excess of $1,000 in which a judg ment has been filed and who are not currently in bankruptcy or have not entered into and complied with the terms of an installment plan. -52-Risk Management The State is exposed to various risks and losses related to em ployee health and accident, worker's compensation, environmental and a portion of property and casua lty claims. It is the policy of the State to self- insure its exposures when cost e ffective and commercially insur e on the exposures that are specialized. Cash Management Created by State law, the Cash Management Policy Board (the \"B oard\") establishes policies for the investment of all money belonging to the State or put on deposi t with the State by its political subdivisions, except money in any State pension fund and money held for indiv iduals under the State deferred compensation program. The investment of such money belonging t o the State is executed by the State Treasurer in accordance with and pursuant to the Board's investment policies. The Board is comprised of nine members, including the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, the Controller General (all serving ex officio), and five members from the pri vate sector appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate. Currently, there is one vacancy on the Board. The current members of the Board are: John V. Flynn, Jr. (Chairman) . Managing Director, Healthcare Resource Solutions Thomas J. Cook Secretary of Finance Jeffrey W. Bullock Secretary of State Warren C. Engle Formerly Senio r Vice President, PNC Bank, ret ired Michael L. Morton Controller General David F. Marvin Partner, Marvin & Palmer Associates, Inc. Chipman Flowers, Jr. State Treasurer Mike Karia Chief Executive Officer, MK Consulting I Inc. T he S ta te has i ns ti t ute d a num ber of m eas ures t o a ugm ent i ts d ividend and interest earnings. Among these are the implementation of a commercial bank lockbox for collection of corporate franchise taxes, bank franchise taxes and insurance premium taxes. In addition, the State is also receiving tax payments electronically for the following taxes on a voluntary basis: employer withhol ding taxes, corporate franchise taxes and bank franchise taxes. The State's motor fuel/special fuels tax is c ollected electronically o n a mandatory basis. BUDGETARY GENERAL FUND SUMMARIES Principal Receipts by Category All revenue derived by the State, unless otherwise provided by law, is credited to the budgetary General Fund. The principal receipts not credited to the budgetary Gen eral Fund are unemployment insurance taxes, transportation-related taxes for the Transportation Trust Fund, certain taxes on insurance companies and property taxes levied by local school districts. Such taxes are deposit ed in budgetary Special Funds of the State. The State does not levy ad valorem taxes on real or pers onal property and does not impose a gener al sales or use tax. The taxes summarized below prod uce most of the budgetary Gener al Fund revenue. Personal Income Tax: Effective January 1, 2014, Delaware's rates on taxable income range from zero on the first $2,000 of net taxable income, to 6.60% o n taxable income in excess of $60,000. Taxable income consists of federa l adjusted gross income, with certain modifications, less itemized deductions (or a standard deducti on in lieu thereof). After th e application of the rates to taxable income, a -53-$110 non-refundable personal tax credit is subtracted for each taxpayer and dependent claimed, providing a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction in final tax liability. Since 1992, non-resident taxes have been computed as if the tax p a y e r w e r e a S t a t e r e s i d e n t , multiplied by the ratio of Delaware income to total income. Tax returns and payments are due April 30. Employers maintaining an office or transacting business within the State and making payment of any wages or other remuneration subject to withholding under the Un ited States Internal Revenue Code are required to withhold State income tax on such wages or remuneration at prescribed rates. Filing frequency is determined based on the amount of an employer's withholdings be tween July 1 and June 30, immediately preceding the calendar year: under $3,600 file quarterly; from $3,600 to $20,000 file monthly; and over $20,000 file up to eight times per month. Corporation Fr anchise Tax: An annual franchise tax is levied on business corporations or ganized under State laws, excepting banks and building and loan associa t i o n s . T h e t a x l e v y i s b a s e d o n e i t h e r t h e corporation's total number of authorized shares of capital stoc k or on i t s gross ass ets . T he bas is yi e ldi ng t he lesser tax revenue is applied. Effective January 1, 2009, the maximum tax was increased from $165,000 to $180,000. Applying the authorized s hare basis, th e tax is levi ed according to the fol lowing rate schedule: 5,000 shares or 10,000 shares: $250.00 $75.00 for each additiona l 10,000 shares or portion thereof Maximum annual tax is $180,000.00 Applying the gross assets basis, the tax is levied at a rate of $350 for each $1.0 million or fractional part thereof of the corporation's gross assets per authorized share. The maximum annual franchise tax is $180,000.00 and the minimum tax is $175.00. Tax payments for any corporati on whose annual franchise taxes exceed $5,000.00 are required to be made quarterly. Other companies p ay once each year, on March 1. Corporation Income Tax: This tax is levied at the rate of 8.7% on net taxable income of both foreign and domestic corporations derived from sources within the State . Investment and holding companies, insurance companies and domestic interna tional sales corporations, among others, are exempt. Fifty percent of the estimated tax for the taxpayer's current tax year and the balan ce due from the prior year is payable on the first day of the fourth month of the taxpayer's tax year, 20% of such estimated tax is payable on the 15th day of the sixth month, 20% on the 15th day of the ninth month and 10% on the 15th day of the twelfth month. Corporations with taxable income of $200,000 or more in any of the last three years must pay 80% of their current year's estimated tax on a current basis. B u s i n e s s a n d O c c u p a t i o n a l G r o s s R e c e i p t s T a x : The State imposes license requirements and related taxes on most occupations and businesses. License fees and taxes consist of a basic annual fee of $75 (in some cases an additional $25 per establishment is levied) p lus a tax on gross receipts. Effective for tax periods ending after December 31, 2013, tax rates include 0.647 2% for contractors (with a monthly deduction from gross receipts of $100,000); 0.3983% for wholesalers (with a monthly deduction of $100,000); 0.1260% for manufacturers (with a monthly deduction of $1,250,000); 0.1991% for food processors (with a monthly deduc tion of $100,000); 0.0996% for commercial feed dealers and farm machinery retailers (with a mont hly deduction of $100,000); 0.7 468% for general retailers (with a monthly deduction of $100,000); 0.6472% for restaurants (with a monthly deduction of $100,000); and 0.3983% of aggregate gross receipts on most occupational licenses (with a monthly deduction of $ 100,000).

Inheritance and Estate Tax: Effective January 1, 1999, the inheritance tax was eliminated . Since the inheritance tax was eliminated, the State has continued to levy its estate tax. Delaware's estate tax, sometimes referred to as a \"pick up\" tax, a pplies only to those estates r equired to pay the federal estate tax. Changes in federal law effectively phased- out Delaware's estate tax in 200 5. Effective July 1, 2009, however, the State chose to \"decouple\" fro m federal law effect ively reinstating th e tax essentially as it existed in 2001. Realty Transfer Tax: Generally, the State levies a realty transfer tax at a rate o f 1.5% of the consideration paid for any real property transferred. (Local g overnments are permitted to levy an additional 1.5%.)

Traditional Lottery: The traditional lottery consists of daily drawings, lotto, instant tickets, Keno, and multi-state games such as Powerball and Megamillions. Traditional lottery products are sold via a State-operated networ k of linked lottery terminals l ocated in approximately 600 retail locations throughout the State. Casino Operations : Casino operations consist of a video lottery, sportsbooks, t able games and i-gaming. o Video Lottery - The video lottery is a State-operated network o f linked video lottery or slot machines restricted to three locations authorized by State law. In addition, Delaware participates in a multi-jurisdictional, progressive vi deo lottery game (MegaHits) via a network operated under the auspices of the Mul ti-State Lottery Association (MUSL). This wide-area network currently consists of Delaware, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Ohio. o Sportsbooks - The State, in conj unction with the State's three casinos and approximately 70 retail establishments, operates a sports lottery, which cons ists of parlay-style betting on National Football League (\"NFL\") games. o Table Games - Delaware's three casinos operate table games, suc h as blackjack, craps, roulette and poker. Table games were operational at the end of fiscal year 2010 and have enhanced the State's position in an increasingly competiti ve gaming market, increased employment and added re venue to the State's coffers. o I-gaming - Beginning in November 2013, Delaware's i-gaming was made available to in-state consumers. Among other offerings, consumers may access peer-to-peer poker, and virtual blackjack, video lottery and roulette via the internet sites of the State's three casinos. In order to maximize i-gaming's revenue potential, De laware is exploring adding additional gaming offeri ngs and multistate compacts for online poker. DEFAC closely monitors an evolving regional gaming market and u pdates the State's revenue forecasts as conditions have evolved. By law, the lottery undertakes to provide an aggregate of at least 30.0% of the net revenue generated from traditional lottery pro ducts to the budgetary General Fund. The State retains 43.5% of video lottery profits (net of certain equipment costs), 29.4% of the net proceeds from table games, whether wagered by traditional means or via the in t e r n e t . T h e S t a t e r e t a i n s 5 0 % o f t h e n e t proceeds from sports lottery. Abandoned Property Abandoned property represents any debt or obligation, includin g securities, which have gone unclaimed or undelivered for three or more years. Such unclaimed property is reported to the state of the lost owner's last known address. If the owner's address is unknown or is in a fo reign country, the unclaim ed property is reported to the state of incorporation of the holder of the unclaimed pr operty. In addition, for those lost owners with a last known address that is in a state which does not have an applica ble statute for the type of property being reported, the unclaimed property is reporte d to the state of incorporatio n of the holder. -56- Budgetary General Fund Disbursements by Category of Expense The following table summarizes the budgetary General Fund disb ursements of the State for fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 th rough 2014. See \"STATE FINANCIAL O PERATIONS - Expenditure Summary - Fiscal Year 2012-Fiscal Year 2015E\" for a detailed explanation of the expenditure figures. Budgetary General Fund Disbursements (in millions) Fiscal 2010Fiscal 2011Fiscal Fund Disbursements by Purpose The State assumes substantial financial responsibility for a n umber of programs often funded by local units of government in other states, including public and higher education, social service programs and the correctional system. In addition, the State builds and mai ntains all roads and highways within the State except certain local streets within a municipality's corporate boundaries and certain private streets. See \"INDEBTEDNESS OF AUTHORITIES, UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE AND POLITI CAL SUBDIVISIONS - Authorities - Dela ware Transportation Authority\" for additional information. The major State programs are described in more detail below. Public Education Delaware is one of only four s tates in the country which has no t undergone a constitu tional challenge to its public education fundi ng. The State finances its public school operations from a combination of State, federal and local funds. In fiscal year 2013, the State provide d 58.6%, the federal government 10.5% and localities 30.9% of the cost for current operations and debt se rvice. For fiscal year 2011, the U.S. Department of Education, Nationa l Center for Educational Statistics, Institute for Education Sciences reported that Delaware was exceeded by five other states and Pu erto Rico in terms of the percentage of public school revenues financed by the State. Public education base salary scales are set by State law, but the base salary may be supplemented by local funds. The local supp lements vary in each school district in the State, depending on each district's contractual obligations with its employees and the district's ability and willingness to tax its constituents. For the 2013-2014 school y ear, the average State-local funded classroom teacher's salary was $60,286, of which $39,702 was paid from St ate funds and the balance paid from federal or local funds. The State share of public education costs is al located to the school districts, subject to a number of formulae based primarily on enrollment. The State fu nds between 60% and 80% of school construction costs, based on an index of an individual district 's ability to generate local share funding. The State also funds fringe benefits for school personnel in approx imate proportion to the budgetary General Fund contribution to salaries, with the exception of health ins urance which is 100% State funded for the basic plan. School districts rei mburse the State for fringe ben efit costs for personnel hired and paid under federally-funded programs and for the proportion of salary paid from local funds. -57-Budgetary General Fund expenditures for public education in fis cal year 2014 totaled $1,217.8 million. Appropriations of $1,267.6 million have been made for fiscal year 2015. The following table sets forth publ ic school enrollment (elementary and secondary), in September of the years indicated. Public School Enrollment(1) (1) Excludes children of military personnel living on Dover Air Force Base who attend Base schools and who se education is f ederally-funded. Higher Education The State's higher education system consists of eight instituti ons, which enrolled 59,237 students in the 2013-2014 academic school year based upon Fall 2013 student headcount (45,275 on a full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") basis). The three State-supported instituti ons are Delaware Technical and Community College which enrolled 14,490 st udents (8,876 FTE); Delaware St ate University, a land grant college located in the City of Dover which enrolled approximately 4,336 student s (4,087 FTE); and the University of Delaware, a land grant college located in the City of Newark, w hich enrolled 22,166 students (20,651 FTE). The five privately supported i nstitutions of higher education i n the State enrolled an additional 18,245 students in 2013-2014 (11,661 FTE). Budgetary General Fund expenditures for higher education in fis cal year 2014 were $227.3 million. The State provides approximately 13.0% of the operating budget of the University of D elaware, 38.5% of the budget of Delaware Technical and Community College, and 31.8% o f the budget of Delaware State University. Appropriations of $226.3 million have been made fo r fiscal year 2015, including $115.6 million for the University of Delaware (this includes $1.8 million in f unding for Delaware Geological Survey), $76.1 million for Delaware Technical a nd Community College and $34.6 million for Delaware State University. Social Services The principal social service programs administered by the State are: (1) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (\"TANF\"); (2) General Assistance (\"GA\") to low-income single individuals who do not qualify for Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") or TANF paymen ts; (3) service programs for qualified individuals including child care, employment & training service s; (4) food benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (\"SNAP\"); and (5) d irect medical assistance to qualifying individuals (\"Medicaid\" & \"CHIP\"). Since January 1974, the SSI Program has been administered and f unded by the federal government. Beginning with fiscal 1975, the State elected to supplement federal SSI payments for individuals who received the State equivalent of SSI payments prior to January 1974. Enrollment Change (%) 2004 ............................... 118,413 1.2 2005 ............................... 120,482 1.7 ............................... 132,841 1.4 -58- Delaware's Medicaid program traditionally has been funded at th e minimum Federal financial participation (\"FFP\") rate of 50% . Each state's FFP is determi ned annually by a statutory formula designed to account for income variation across states. Delaware's rate has varied from a high of 64.38% (due to a provision of ARRA) to a low of 50% (the lowest rate) during the past five years. The current FFP for Delaware (beginning October 1, 2014) is 53.63%. The FFP rate e xpected to become effective on October 1, 2015 is 53.93%. Delaware's TANF program is funded by a federal capped block gra nt and State budgetary General Funds. The State is required under federal law to maintain a p rescribed level of historic State expenditures for benefits and services to individuals eligible for TANF. GA program grants are entirely funded by the State. This program has experienced consistent growth since 20 03. As of October 2013, the payment standard for the GA program is $90 a month per single-person fa mily. The portion of the expenditures for the foregoing programs paid by the federal government is accounted for by the State through the non-appropriated budgeta ry Special Funds. The portion paid by the State is accounted for through the budgetary General Fund. After a period of gradual decline, the TANF caseload increased 29% between 2009 and 2011. Since 2012, the TANF caseload is again gradually declining. The Stat e provides health care, child care assistance and help finding work for participants in the State's TANF program and provides health care and subsidized childcare to income eligible individuals or those who have left the welfare rolls and continue to be eligible for that coverage. In 2014, an average of 11,120 people per month received TANF cash assistance and 4,953 people per month received GA for 16,073 combined average monthly recipients. Since fiscal year 2008, welfare caseloads and income maintenanc e expenditures increased, driven by a dramatic increase in applications for SNAP and medical assistance. While the TANF caseload declined slightly beginning in 2012, the GA caseload continues to increa se as well as SNAP and Medicaid. The following table indicates the trends of selected State social s ervices expenditures for fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2014. -59- Social Services Expenditures (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2014 Recipients/month ..................... 845 830 815 820 of Services for Children, Youth and Their Famili es provides integrated service delivery for children and their families in its efforts to promote family stability through a child-centered, family-focused continuum of care. The Department served 21,591 clients in fiscal year 2014, some of these clients were shared by each of the three divisions. The Family Services division spent $46.4 million in fiscal year 2013, $46.4 million in fiscal year 2014 and has budgeted $ 51.0 million in fiscal year 2015. The Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services (\"YRS\") handles delin quent youth in both pre- and post- adjudication through an array of alternative placements and Sta te-owned secure facilities. The YRS division spent $37.3 million in fiscal year 2013, $39.6 million in fisca l year 2014, and has budgeted $42.1 million for fiscal year 2015. The Division of Prevention and Behavioral He alth Services (\"DPBHS\") provides mental health services for children and youth. The DPBHS spent $38.4 million in fiscal year 2013, $41.4 million in fiscal year 2014, and has budgete d $40.5 million for fiscal yea r 2015. Corrections The Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") is the only government op erated correction agency in the State. Delaware operates under a unified corrections system. Delaware has no regional, county or municipal correction or jail system and no separate probation system. Of fenders immediately beco me the responsibility of the State, including: pre-trial and sentencing, misdemeanor and felony, jail and prison and all community based sanctions. Sentencing in the State has evolved with the passage of Sentencing Accountability (\"SENTAC\") legislation whereby all offenders are sentenced to o ne of five levels ranging from Level 1 (administrative supervision) to Level V (incarceration). This structure allows the State flexibility to match offenders with the most appropria te sentence. Total budgetary General Fund expenditures for DOC in fiscal year 2014 were $273.5 million. The budget for fiscal year 2015 is $277.5 million. As of September 2014, the incarcerated population in the custody of the Department wa s approximately 5,961, of which about 3,927 are prisoners. BUDGETARY SPECIAL FUNDS SUMMARIES Each budgetary Special Fund is created by statute or administr ative action for a specific purpose. The appropriate Fund is credited with the specific revenue or recei pts allocated to such Fund. Disbursements from certain budgetary Special Funds require specific appropriation by the General Assembly. In general, money in budgetary Special Funds is not available for disbursement or encumbrance until funds are deposited therein with the result that disbursements plus outstanding encumbrances cannot exceed the available funds (except for federal funds and the Transportatio n Trust Fund). In the case of bond funds, total disbursements plus encumbrances cannot exceed authorizations. At fiscal year end, the available fund balance plus outstanding encumbrances are carried over into the succeed ing fiscal year. Local School Property Taxes and Assessed Valuation These taxes are levied by local school districts upon the asse ssed value of real estate in the district, as determined for county taxation purposes, for the local share of school operating costs and debt service on capital improvements. All tax receipts of a district are credited to t he appropriate budgetary Special Fund and operating expenses are disbursed from such Fund upon the presentation of warrants or drafts to the State Treasurer by the school board of the district. The State's share of operating a nd debt service costs are a ppropriated and disbursed from the budgetary General Fund. -61- The following table outlines the assessed and estimated full valuation of all taxable real property in the State as of July 1, 2014.

Unemployment Compensation Money deposited in the Unemployment Compensation Fund consists of employers' contributions and has at certain times in the past included advances from the fed eral government necessary to meet the excess of unemployment compensation benefits paid over the employers' contributions. As of August 31, 2014, the Unemployment Compensation Fund re flected a cumula tive advance o f $10,679,876.75. Federal Grants, Benefits and Reimbursements All grants and reimbursements of money received from the feder al government by the State are credited to budgetary Special Funds. The money is disbursed to the appropriate agency to be used for the purpose stated in the grant application without any further aut hority from the General Assembly. The Delaware State Clearinghouse Co mmittee is the committee represe nting the legislative and executive branches of government. It is charged with reviewing all State agency applications for federal funds and no agency may expend federal funds without approval of this commit tee. The following chart indicates the distribution of federal funds expended by the State by Department in the fiscal years indicated below. -62- Ratio of Federal Funds Expended by Department Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Health & Social Services Fund Receipts State pension contributions are appropriated by the General As sembly in the annual budget to cover the liability on budgetary General F und salaries and are disbursed each month from the budgetary General Fund. Each monthly disbursement is recorded as a receipt of the appro priate budgetary Special Fund and is disbursed from such budgetary Special Fund to meet pension benefits and o perating costs. The balance is disbursed from the budgetary Special Fund and invested as part of the State pe nsion plan. See \"STATE PENSION PLAN\" for additional information. Employee pension contributions are als o recorded as budgetary Special Fund receipts and are disbursed together with the State's share of pension co sts. Pension costs paid by the federal government for employees paid under federal programs are also recorded as budgetary Special Fund receipts and disbursements. Social Security Fund Receipts All Social Security contributions by State departments and age ncies and political subdivisions are recorded as a receipt to the Social Security Fund and are remit ted on a semi-monthly basis. Contributions are submitted to the U.S. Department of the Treasury semi-monthly, at which time a disbursement is recorded.

Additional catch-up contributi ons are permitted for participants age 50 and older, who may contribute an additional $5,500 in calendar year 2014. An alternative to the age 50 catch-up -63-provision is available for certain participants within three ye ars of retirement, which serves to double the annual contribution limit to $35,000. Employees make self-directed investment elections from a broad menu of investment options made available through the plan vendor, which range from ultra conse rvative to very aggressive. The total market value of plan assets as of September 1, 2014 was $565.8 million (unaudited). The State also provides a $10 per-pay employer match to contri butions by 457(b) deferred compensation plan participants, which began on January 1, 2001. The match p lan is approved under Section 401(a) of the Code. However, the match plan was suspended by the General Ass embly for fiscal years 2009 through 2014, and remained suspended for fiscal year 2015. Certain State employees working in the Department of Education , or for any school district or state- funded college or university, are eligible to participate in the State of Delaware 403(b) retirement plan, which is a tax-sheltered annuity (the \"TSA Plan\").

The total market value of plan assets as of September 1, 2014 was $273.9 million (unaudited). STATE PENSION PLAN The State of Delaware Employees' Pension Plan (the \"State Emplo yees' Plan\") is a cost-sharing single employer defined benefit plan that covers State employee s and all local school district and other affiliated employees who qualify as full-time and regular part- time employees. As of June 30, 2013, participation in the State Employees' Plan, as well as the following state funded plans (collectively the \"Plans\") are as follows: The Plans and the other plans managed by the State's Board of P ension Trustees (the \"Pension Board\"), but not funded by the State, are referred to herein as the \"Fund\".

Code \u00a75541 which establishes a State Employees' Retirement Fund, manda tes that state appropriations and other employer contributions, and employee contributions be deposited and benefits paid. The sta tute dictates that the assets of the Fund are to be held in trust and not be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the employees and their beneficiaries. Section 5541 allows the acc umulated assets of the Fund to be commingled with the assets of local and other government entiti es. The custodian of the Fund's assets is Northern Trust Company, C hicago, Illinois. The Fund's assets are managed by professional investment management firms. The t otal return on the fund in fiscal year 2013 was 11.1% on a market value basis compared to 20.6% for the Sta ndard & Poor's 500. However, due to the Fund's asset-smoothing technique which recognizes only a portio n of the gains and losses, the return on the actuarial asset value was 7.1%. Below is a table depicting one -year and five-year returns from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 2014, inclusive. Fiscal One Year Five Year Year RETURN RETURN 1993 16.3% 11.2% 1994 -65-The Fund provides retirement, disability and survivor benefits as detailed in Note 15 of the Basic Financial Statements attached as Appendix B. In May 2011, the Delaware Code was amended in order to reduce benefits for and increase the contribution of all State employees hired on and after January 1, 2012 (\"Post 2011 Employees\"). In general, recipients, other than Po st 2011 Employees, in the State Employees' Plan are entitled to receive a service pension at various times during their years of credited service, i.e.: (1) age 62 with 5 years of credit service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of credit service; (3) a reduced service pension at age 55 with 15 years of credited service; (4) a reduced serv ice pension at any age with 25 years of credited service; or (5) at any age with 30 years of credited service. Employees hired before January 1, 2012 are \"fully vested\" in benefits after 5 years of service, and Post 2 011 Employees are \"fully vested\" in benefits after 10 years of service. Post 2011 Employees are entitled to receive a service pension if: (1) the employee has 10 years of credited service, and has attained age 65; (2) the employee has 20 years of credited service, and has attained age 60; or (3) the employee has 30 years of cr edited service. A Post 2011 Employee can receive a reduced service pension if: (1) the employee has 15 years of credited service, and has attained age 55, or (2) the employee has 25 years credited service regardles s of age. All Plan participants also participate in the Old Age Disability Security Income component of the Federal Social Security System. For members of the State Employees Plan, benefit payments are computed using the average monthly compensation for the 36 months of highest monthly compe nsation. Such compensation excludes overtime in the case of Post 2011 Employees. The average is then multiplied by 1.85% for each year of credited service after January 1, 1997 to determine the actual monthly benefit. Retirees with credited service before December 31, 1996 get a multiplier of 2.00 for service p rior to January 1, 1997. Post 2011 Employees contribute 5% of annual compensation above $6,000. All other State employees contribute 3% of annual compensation above $6,000. Except for the Closed State Police Plan, the State's annual contribution to the Plans are equal to the sum of the normal cost of each year and the annual payment requ ired to amortize the unfunded accrued liability using an amortization period of 20 years. The State' s contribution must also include an amount to fund post retirement pension increases in accordance with a for mula contained in the Delaware Code. The Closed State Police Plan is funded on a pay-as you-go basis; al l other Plans are funded on an actuarially sound basis, as determined by the Pension Board, on the basis o f actuarial analyses undertaken by Cheiron, Inc. (\"Cheiron\") annually. The most recent valuation, as of June 30, 2013, determined the State Employees' Plan to have a funded ratio of 91.1% based on the actuarial val ue of the assets and 89.6% based on the market value of the assets. Each year the Pension Board certif ies the required State contribution rate as a percentage of covered payroll, based on the results of the actu arial valuations of the Plans. The State Employees' Plan has an unfunded accrued liability of $737.5 mil lion as of June 30, 2013. A Schedule of Funding Progress for the State Employees' Plans is shown below. See Schedule 1 - Schedule of Funding Progress in the Financial Section of the Delaware Public Employ ees' Retirement System Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for fiscal year 2013 for the funding pr ogress of the New State Police Plan, the Judiciary Plan, the Closed State Police Plan and the Special Pl an. -66- HISTORICAL FUNDING PROGRESS ACTUARIAL VALUE STATE EMPLOYEES' PLAN (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended June 30 (1) Actuarial Value of Assets (2) Actuarial Accrued Liability (AAL)(3) Unfunded AAL (UAAL) (2) - (1)(4) Funded Ratios (1)/(2)(5) Annualized Covered Payroll (6) UAAL as a % of Covered Payroll (3)/(5) 2013 $ 7,519,770 $ of Pension Contribution Funding Policy Payment of each annual contribution is subject to appropriation by the General Assembly.

The following table sets forth the annual required contribution of the Sta te Employees' Plan as well as the percentage contributed. Fiscal Year Ended Annual Required Contribution (000)(1) Percentage ContributedGeneral Fund Expenditures (000,000) % of Total Gen. Fund Expenditures % of Covered Payroll 2013 Does not include contributions to the Post-Retirement Increase Fund The following table sets forth the actual cash inflows, including investment earnings, and cash outflows for the State Employees' Plan for the last five years. For detailed cash flows for the New State Police Plan, the Judiciary Plan, the Closed State Police Plan a nd the Special Plan, see the Schedule of Additions by Source and the Schedule of Deductions by Type in the Statistical Section of the Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System Comprehensive Annual Financ ial Report for fiscal year 2013. -67-State Employees' Pension Plan (in millions) Fiscal 2009Fiscal 2010Fiscal 2011Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2013 Income Employee Contributions ............... $ 45.9 $ 44.9 $ 46.4 $ 47.9 $ 50.6 State Contributions(1) (budgetary General Fund and budgetary Special Funds) ........... 3.6 Other Disbursements ..................... 11.1 (1) Includes contributions to a Po st-Retirement Increase Fund. General Funding Practices Since 1993, the Pension Board has commissioned actuarial studie s annually. Cheiron of McLean, Virginia (\"Cheiron\") has served as the independent actuary sinc e 2006 and uses the assumptions described in the following table for the State Employees Plan: Actuarial Cost Method Entry Age Normal Amortization method Level Percent Closed for Plan Bases and Open for Aggregate Gain/Loss Amortization period 20 years Asset Valuation Method 5-Year Smoothed Market Actuarial Assumption: Investment Rate of Return Salary Increases att ributable to inflation Salary Increases attributable to merit and productivity 7.5%* 3.25% 3.8% to 11.8% ________________________ *Prior to fiscal year the assumed Investment Rate of Retu rn was 8% and will be decreas ed to 7.2% in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015, the assumed inflation rate was reduced to 3.0 %. The actuarial assumptions used have been recommended by Cheiro n and adopted by the Pension Board based on the Fund's recent experience. -68- For the State Employees' Plan, the information in the followin g table provides a comparison of the actuarial value of assets to the market values, the ratio of th e AVA to market value, and the funded ratio based on AVA compared to funded ratio based on the market value of assets. Fiscal Year Ended June 30 Actuarial Value of Assets (000) Market Value of Assets (000)% of AVA to market valueFunded Ratio (actuarial value) Funded Ratio (market value) 2013 $ Plan Investment Policy and Practices The Investment Committee of the Pension Board seeks the followi ng investment objectives established by the Pension Board: Achieve a real return of 3% per year over long periods, Manage portfolio risk that limits downside price fluctuation, Maximize total investment retur ns, consistent with Pension Boar d objectives. While not governed by a mandated target asset allocation, inves tment decisions are shaped by the Pension Board's internal invest ment guidelines which provide that a minimum of 20% of the total assets of the Fund be invested in fixed income investments, such as bonds , cash equivalents and certain real estate investments. This guideline is monitored with the assistance of an independent investment advisor. The committee strives for appropriate investment diversification by allocating funds across a variety of asset classes and by selecting managers whose demonstrated performanc e reflects different management styles and asset class expertise. The performance of all investment manag ers is closely monitored, not only in relation to specific absolute objectives, but also in relation to other fund managers following the same or similar investment objectives. Litigation, Investigations and Labor Relations There has been no material litigation brought or any investigat ion initiated in connection with the pension plan or members of its governing body. Audits of the p ension plan's financial statements have been conducted annually by an independe nt auditor and that auditor h as expressed an unqualified opinion. Transfers of Investment Earnings Earnings generated over and above the investment rate of return are retained as part of the plan assets. Pension Plan Reserves The State passed legislation whic h established a mechanism for funding ad hoc post-retirement increases granted by the General Assembly to members retired un der the State Employees' Plan, the New -69-State Police Plan and the Judiciary Plan beginning in fiscal 1994. The mechanism allows the State to appropriate actuarially determined employer contributions to a separate Post-Retirement Increase Fund (\"PRI\") managed by the Pension Board. The actuary uses the cur rent actuarial assumptions, methods and population data to calculate the estimated additional liability resulting from the potential benefit increases. When the Legislature grants an ad hoc post-retirement adjustmen t, funds are transferred from this PRI fund on a monthly basis based on a five-year actuarial funding sched ule to the appropriate pension plan from which the additional benefits are disbursed. For the fiscal ye ar ended June 30, 2013, $26.6 million was transferred to the appropriate plan. During the last five years there have been three post-retiremen t increases granted by the General Assembly in fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2015. As of June 30, 2014, these post-retirement increases have outstanding liabilities totaling $132.5 million, which will be funded by the State and transferred to the appropriate plans over the rema ining amortization periods. The Pension Board adopts actuarially determined funding for the Post-Retirement Increase Fund. Funding for fiscal year 2013 was 1.49% of covered payroll. Fun ding for fiscal year 2014 was 1.51%. Funding for fiscal year 2015 is 1.66%. Pension Obligation Bonds No pension obligation bonds have been issued and the State does not anticipate issuing any pension obligation bonds in the future. Other Relevant Reports The Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System, a component u nit of the State, annually issues a comprehensive annual financial report. This report, along wi th the Cheiron's actuarial valuation, can be found on the state's website at http://www.delawarepensions.com /financials.shtml. The information included in this section relies on information produced by the State together with Cheiron, its independent actuary. Actuarial assessments are \"forward-looking\" and refle ct the judgment of the fiduciaries of the Plans. Such assessments are based upon a variety of assumption s, one or more of which may provide to be inaccurate or be changed in the f uture, and will change with the future experience of the Plans. OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The State provides post-employment health care to its employees and, in fiscal year 2008, began accounting for these benefits according to GASB Statement No. 4 5, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Bene fits Other Than Pensions (\"GAS B 45\"). The State's actuarially accrued liability, based on a study conducted by Cheiron using actual d ata as of July 1, 2013, has been determined to be about $5.99 billion using a discount rate of 4.25%. The State began pre-funding the obligation in 2002 and 2003 wit h lump sum payments and contributions based on a percentage of payroll. In fiscal year 2007, the amount contributed as a percentage of payroll was approximately $5 million and increased to approxima tely $10 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. In both fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the State contribute d $10 million from abandoned property revenue and, in 2011, an additio nal $9.7 million was contribute d by the State primarily from Medicare Part D subsidies received. Fiscal year 2012 and 2013 contributions, b ased on a 0.9% of payroll, were about $16.8 million each and the fiscal 2013 Medicare Part D subsidy was $1 1.2 million. In addition, $3.6 million was received from fiscal 2013 Abandoned Property revenues. Fiscal 2014 payroll contributions totaled $16 million plus an additional $6.2 million in Medicare Part D subs idies brought total fiscal 2014 contributions to $22.2 million. Payroll contributions for fiscal 2015 are expec ted to be about $17 million. -70-The State has established an irrevocable trust and, at December 31, 2013, has accumulated $222 million in assets resulting in a funding ratio of 3.7%. At a 4 .25% discount rate, the State's fiscal year 2014 annual required contribution (\"ARC\") is $406.7 million, which i s expected to be only partially met with cash contributions and paid benefits. P aid benefits are estimated t o be in the amount of $177.6 million. In 2011, the Governor signed legislation, which made significant modifications to employee's health care insurance and pension plan programs. The legislation establishes a fixed cost share in the State's health insurance programs for both active employees and retirees and i ncreases the time to vest for retiree health care benefits. Further reducing this liability was the State's participation, effective January 1, 2013, in an Employee Group Waiver Plan, or EGWP, which shifts the cost of r etiree pharmacy benefits to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS The State currently has 31,789.6 full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") positions budgeted for fiscal year 2015, an increase of 247.2 FTEs from fiscal year 2014. This includes 14,205.7 FTEs in the public schools, 1,130.0 FTEs in institutions of higher learning (excluding empl oyees of the University of Delaware, which is not considered part of the State's financing reporting entity) and 16,444.9 FTE positions in all other departments. Since July 1966, virtually all State employees have had the ri ght to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining. Classification of bargaining units is d etermined by the Public Employee Relations Board (\"PERB\"). Collective bargaining is conducted by OMB on b ehalf of departments and agencies. With respect to non-merit system employees, such bargaining may incl ude all terms and conditions of employment, including wages, hours and benefits. With respect to the merit system employees, individual bargaining units may not bargain wages, most benefits, classifi cation plans or hiring practices. Effective on August 2, 2007, Senate Bill 36 permits merit system employees t o negotiate compensation, defined as payment of salaries and cash allowances, through the collective bargaining process. Position classification, health care and other benefit programs, wor kers compensation, d isability programs and pension programs are not negotiable. These agreements are subject to approval by the Governor and binding to the extent sufficient appropriations are made by the General Assembly. At present, approximately 8,000 of the State's merit system employees are organized and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees of institutions of higher education, certified profe ssional employees of the State public school system (teachers) and certain public school support personnel have the right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining. Bargaining units representin g such employees negotiate with their respective school districts regar ding all matters relating to s alaries, employee benefits and certain working conditions. Virtually all of these school employees are covere d by collective bargaining agreements. State employees in Delaware do not have the legal right to str ike. Few work stoppages have occurred. Currently only two-thirds of employees eligible for union representation are covered by collective bargaining agreements. All payment contracts reached under suc h agreements are subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, except for the locally funded portion of school district employees' salaries and benefits. In 1982, a State law was enacted establishing the PERB to over see the conduct of labor negotiations between public school teachers and their boards of education. There are provisions for mediation and binding arbitration of collective bargaining disputes. Strikes, slow-downs and walkouts are prohibited; but, if they occur, school boards are required to seek injunctive re lief. In 1986, legislation was enacted which extended the PERB's jurisdiction to police officers and firefig hters. The PERB's jurisdiction was further expanded in 1994 to include all public employees in the State. In the same year, a State law was enacted -71-establishing the Merit Employee Relations Board to address grievances and related issues of merit system employees. GOVERNANCE The chief executive officer of the State is the Governor, who is elected for a term of four years. The State Constitution limits any Gove rnor to two terms, whether or not consecutive. The Governor appoints all members of the State judiciary, t he cabinet, and the boards and councils. The Governor reports to the General Assembly at the start of each annual session in January on the \"State of the State,\" recommends changes in legislation, and follows this re port with an annual budget mess age and financial accounting of the State. In addition to the Executive Office of the Governor (which inc ludes the Offices of Management and Budget, Economic Development, an d Technology and Information), there are thirteen cabinet departments, as reflected in the table which follows. They include the following: the Department of State, which administers the Division of Corporations and the Division of Cultural and Histo rical Affairs; the Department of Finance, which performs financing, accounting, bond finance, revenue collectio n, fiscal policy function s and administers the State lottery; the Department of Health and Social Services; th e Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families; the Department of Natural Resources and Environ mental Control; the Department of Labor; the Department of Transportation, which oversees the Division of Mo tor Vehicles; the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which oversees the state police; the Department of Correction; the Department of Agriculture; the Department of Education; Delaware State Housin g Authority; and the Delaware National Guard. Delaware is unusual in that the State government (as opposed to county or municipal governments) funds and administers substantially all correctional, public health, welf are, and transportation serv ices for its residents. Other elected officers include the Lieutenant Governor who presides over the Senate and the Board of Pardons; the State Treasurer, w ho is one of four Issuing Office rs, signs all state checks and oversees the management of the State's bank accounts; the Auditor of Account s who audits all State agencies' financial transactions; the Insurance Commissioner; and the Attorney Gene ral who is the chief legal officer of the State. All of the elected officers serve terms of four years. The State's General Assembly is bicameral and consists of a 21 -member Senate and a 41-member House of Representatives. The entire House stands for re-election every two years, while Senators are elected to four year staggered terms. Regular sessions of the General Assembly convene in January and adjourn by June 30th. Between regular sessions, the Gov ernor or the presiding officer s of either house may call special sessions. Proposed legislation is usually assigned to a standing committe e for review. It may then receive consideration on the floor of both houses. The judicial branch of the government includes a Supreme Court , which acts primarily as an appeals court, and the Court of Chancery, an equity court which has jur isdiction over corporate matters, trusts, estates, and other matters involving equitable jurisdiction. The Superi or Court has jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases, except equity cases. The Family Court administers justi ce in cases involving domestic relations or dependent juveniles. The Court of Common Pleas is a court of l imited jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters which the Superior Court would otherwise handle. The J ustice of the Peace Courts handle criminal matters and civil cases where the amount in controversy is less than $5,000.

Shailen Bhatt LITIGATION The State recognized $1.8 million in governmental activities as probable litigation expenses as of June 30, 2014. Additionally, the State is a defendant in various suits involving contract/construction claims, tax refunds claims, allegations o f wrongful discharge and/or other employment-related claims, use of excessive force, civil rights violations, and automobile accident claims. Although the State believes it has valid defenses to these actions, the State has identified a pot ential aggregate exposure which could exceed $6.3 million, as of October 1, 2014. THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), New York, NY, will act a s securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such othe r name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity and interest rate of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity and interest rate, and will be deposited with DTC. DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited-p urpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization\" within the m eaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \"clearing agency\" registered pur suant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt i ssues, and money market instruments from -73-over 100 countries that DTC's participants (\"Direct Participant s\") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales an d other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of se curities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidi a r y o f T h e D e p o s i t o r y T r u s t & C l e a r i n g Corporation (\"DTCC\"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, Nat ional Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registe red clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC sys tem is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers a nd dealers, banks, trust compa nies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Part icipant, either directly or indirectly (\"Indirect Participants\"). DTC has Standard & Poor's rating of: AA+. Th e DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (\"Beneficial Owner\") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DT C of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing de tails of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Parti cipant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Tra nsfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownersh ip interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfe rs, all Bonds deposited by Dir ect Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such o ther name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DT C and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change i n beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC's r ecords reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose ac counts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain respo nsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direc t Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any sta tutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. B eneficial Owners of Bonds may wi sh to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with resp ect to the Bonds, such as redemptions and defaults. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notic es to Beneficial Owners. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity and interest rate are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed. N e i t h e r D T C n o r C e d e & C o . ( n o r a n y o t h e r D T C n o m i n e e ) w i l l c o nsent or vote with respect to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance w ith DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the State as soon as possible after the record date. The -74-Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). Redemption proceeds on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., o r such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practi ce is to credit Direct Participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the State, on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's record s. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \" street name\", and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor its nominee or the State, s ubject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the State, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficia l Owners will be the responsibili ty of Direct and Indirect Participants. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to the State. Under such circumstance s, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered. The State may decide to discontinue use of the system of book- entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certific ates will be printed and delivered. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book- entry system has been obtained from sources that the State believes to be reliable, but the St ate and the Underwriters take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. APPROVAL OF LEGAL MATTERS Certain legal matters incident to the authorization and issuan ce of the Bonds are subject to the approval of Saul Ewing LLP, Wilmington, D elaware, Bond Co unsel, whose ap proving legal opinion, substantially in the form set forth in APPENDIX D, will be available at the time of the delivery of the Bonds. Bond Counsel has not verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statemen ts contained in the Official Statement nor will it express an opinion as to the accuracy, completeness, or fairnes s of the statements contained in the Official Statement. TAX MATTERS Tax Exemption-Opinion of Bond Counsel The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") con tains provisions relating to the tax- exempt status of interest on obligations issued by governmental entities which apply to the Bonds. These provisions include, but are not l imited to, requirements relati ng to the use and investment of the proceeds of the Bonds and the rebate of certain investment earnings derived fro m such proceeds to the United States Treasury Department on a periodic basis. These and other requirements o f the Code must be met by the State subsequent to the issuance and delivery of the Bonds in order for interest thereon to be and remain excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. The State has made covenants to comply with such requirements. In the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest (including accrued or iginal issue discount) on the Bonds is not includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation under existing statutes, regulations, rulings and court decisions. The opinion of Bond Counsel is subject to the condition that the State comply with all -75-applicable federal income tax law requirements that must be sat isfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon continues to be excluded from gross income. Failure to comply with certain of such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds to be so includable in gross income retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. The State has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. Interest on the Bonds is not treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of th e Code for purposes of the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes; however, under the Code, t o the extent that interest on the Bonds is a component of a corporate holder's \"adjusted current earnings,\" a portion of that interest may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding other federal tax consequences relating to the Bonds or the receipt of interest t hereon. See discussion of \"Alternative Minimum Tax\", \"Branch Profits Tax\", \"S Corporations with Passive ment Income\", \"Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits\", \"Deduction for Interest Paid by Financial Institutions to Purchase or Carry Tax-Exempt Obligations\", \"Property or Casualty Insurance Company\" and \"Acc ounting of Or iginal Issue Discount and Amortizable Bond Premium\" below. Alternative Minimum Tax The Code includes, for purposes of the corporate alternative m inimum tax, a preference item consisting of, generally, seventy-five percent of the excess of a corporation's \"adjusted current earnings\" over its \"alternative minimum taxable income\" (computed without regard to this particular preference item and the alternative tax net opera ting loss deduction). Thus, to the extent that tax-exempt interest (including interest on the Bonds) is a component of a corporate holder's \" adjusted current earnings,\" a portion of that interest may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Branch Profits Tax Under the Code, foreign corporations engaged in a trade or bus iness in the United States will be subject to a \"branch profits tax\" equal to thirty percent (30%) of the corporation's \"dividend equivalent amount\" for the taxable year. The term \"divide nd equivalent amount\" includes i nterest on tax-exempt obligations. S Corporations with Passive Investment Income Section 1375 of the Code imposes a tax on the income of certain small business corporations for which an S Corporation election is in effect, and that have \"passive investment income\". For purposes of Section 1375 of the Code, the term \"passive investment income\" includes inte rest on the Bonds. This tax applies to an S Corporation for a taxable year if the S Corporation has Subchap ter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year and has gross receipts, more than twenty-five perc ent (25%) of which are \"passive investment income\". Thus, interest on the Bonds may be subject to federal income taxation under Section 1375 of the Code if the requirements of t hat provision are met. Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits Under Section 86 of the Code, certain Social Security and Rail road Retirement benefits (the \"benefits\") may be includable in gross income. The Code provides that inte rest on tax-exempt obligations (including interest on the Bonds) is included in the calculation of \"modif ied adjusted gross income\" in determining whether a portion of the benefits receive d are to be includable in gros s income of individuals. Deduction for Interest Paid by Financial Institutions to Purcha se or Carry Tax-Exempt Obligations The Code, subject to limited exceptions not applicable to the Bonds, denies the interest deduction for indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry tax-exe mpt obligations, such as the Bonds. With respect to banks, thrift institutions and other financial institutions, the denial to such institutions is one hundred percent -76-(100%) for interest paid on funds allocable to the Bonds and an y other tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7, 1986. Property or Casualty Insurance Company The Code also provides that a property or casualty insurance c ompany may also incur a reduction, by a specified portion of its tax-exempt interest income, of its ded uction for losses incurred. Accounting Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Amortizable Bond Premium The 2014B Bonds maturing on July 1, 2034 bearing interest at 3 .000% are herein referred to as the \"Discount Bonds.\" In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the difference between the initial public offering price of the Discount Bonds set forth on the cover page and the stated redem ption price at maturity of each such Bonds constitutes \"original issue discount,\" all or a portion of which will, on the disposition or payment of such Bonds, be treated as tax-exempt interes t for federal income tax purpos es. Original issue discoun t will be apportioned to an owner of the Discount Bonds under a \"constant interest metho d,\" which utilizes a periodic compounding of accrued interest. If an owner o f a Discount Bond who purchases it in the original offering at the initial public offering price owns that Discount Bond to maturity, that Bondho lder will not realize taxable gain for federal income tax purposes upon payment of the Discount Bond at maturi ty. An owner of a Discount Bond who purchases it in the original offe ring at the initial public offering price and who later disposes of the Discount Bond prior to maturity will be deemed to have accrued tax-exemp t income in a manner described above; amounts realized in excess of the sum of the original offering price of such Discount Bond and the amount of accrued original issue discount will be taxable gain. Purchasers of Discount Bonds shou ld consider possible state and local income, excise or franchise tax consequences arising from original issue discount on the Discou nt Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the Discount Bonds should consult th eir tax advisors regarding the Delaware tax treatment of original issue discount. All of the 2014B Bonds, except for the 2014B Bonds maturing on July 1, 2034 bearing interest at 3.000%, are herein referred to, collectively, as the \"Premium B onds\". An amount equal to the excess of the initial public offering price of a Premium Bond set forth on the inside cover page over its stated redemption price at maturity constitutes premium on such Premium Bond. A purcha ser of a Premium Bond must amortize any premium over such Premium Bond's term using constant yield prin ciples, based on the purchaser's yield to maturity. As premium is amortized, the purchaser's basis in su ch Premium Bond is reduced by a corresponding amount, resulting in an increase in the gain (or decrease in th e loss) to be recognized for federal income tax purposes upon a sale or disposition of such Premium Bond prior to its maturity. Even though the purchaser's basis is reduced, no federal income tax deduction is allowed. Purchasers of Premium Bonds, whether at the time of initial is suance or subsequent thereto, should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the determinatio n and treatment of premium for federal income tax purposes and with respect to state and local tax consequences o f owning such Premium Bonds. Delaware State Tax Opinion In the opinion of Bond Counsel under existing statutes interes t on the Bonds is exempt from personal and corporate income tax imposed by the State. CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAX LAW From time to time, there are presidential proposals, proposals by various federal committees and legislative proposals in Congress that, if enacted, could alter or amend the tax matters referred to herein or -77-adversely affect the marketabil ity or market value of the Bonds or otherwise prevent holders of the Bonds from realizing the full benefit of the tax exemption of interes t on the Bonds. Further, such proposals may impact the marketability or market value of the Bonds simply by being proposed. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such proposals may be enacted or wh ether if enacted such proposals would apply to bonds issued prior to enactment. In addition, regulat ory actions are from time to time announced or proposed and litigation is threatened or commenced which, if implemented or concluded in a particular manner, could adversely affect the market value, marketability or tax status of the Bonds. It cannot be predicted whether any such regulatory action will be implemente d, how any particular litigation or judicial action will be resolved, or whether the Bonds would be impacted thereby.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of the Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA), Delaware State University (DSU), Delaware Charter Schools, Riverfront Develo pment Corporation (RDC), and Diamond State Port Corporation (DSPC) within the aggregate discretely presented component units. The financial statements of DSHA, DSU, RDC, DSPC and the Delaware Charter Sc hools were audited by other auditors whose reports thereon have been furnished to us and which represent 89% of total assets, 80% of total net position and 93% of total revenues within the aggregate discretely presented component units. Our opinions, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for those entities, are based solely on the reports of the other auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. KPMG LLP 1601 Market Street Philadelphia, PA 19103-2499 KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership, the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative (\"KPMG International\"), a Swiss entity. The Honorable Governor and Honorable Members of the State Legislature 2 An audit involves performing procedures to obtain au dit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal c ontrol relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Opinions In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of ot her auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the State of Delaware, as of June 30, 2013, and the respective changes in financial position, and where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Emphasis of Matter Change in Accounting Principle Resulting from the Adoption of a New Accounting Pronouncement As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective July 1, 2012, the State adopted the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standa rds Board (GASB) Statement No. 61, The Financial Reporting Entity: Omnibus, an amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 34 . Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Delaware State Housing Authority As discussed in Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements, the Delaware State Housing Authority, a discretely presented component unit, restated its net position as of July 1, 2012 to correct a material misstatement in the amount previously reported. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management's discussion and analysis and required supplementary information as listed in the accompanying table of contents (collectively referred to as RSI) be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the RSI in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial st atements, and other knowledge we obtained during our The Honorable Governor and Honorable Members of the State Legislature 3 audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 6, 2014 STATE OF DELAWARE Management's Discussion and Analysis The following is a discussion and analysis of the State of Delaware's (the State's) financial activities as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Readers are encouraged to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that is furnished in the letter of transmittal, which can be found on pages i-vi of this report, and the State's financial statements, which follow this section. These financial statements have been prepared using the financial accounting model adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Financial Highlights /g120 The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at the close of the most recent fiscal year by $4,877.2 million (net position). Component units reported a net position of $1,109.3 million, an increase of $27.4 million from the previous year as restated. /g120 As a result of its operations, the primary government's total net position increased by $68.9 million (1.4%) in fiscal year 2013 when compared to the previous year's ending net position as restated. Net position of governmental activities decreased by $74.1 million (4.2%) from the previous year, while net position of the business-type activities increased $143.1 million (4.7%) from the previous year. /g120 The State's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $1,902.9 million, an increase of $74.1 million (4.1%) in comparison with the restated prior year balance. /g120 The general fund reported unassigned fund balance of $1,025.3 million which was 23.6% of total general fund expenditures. /g120 The State's total general obligation debt increased $58.4 million (3.5%) during fiscal year 2013 to $1,755.2 million. Of the State's outstanding general obligatio n debt, $545.7 million (31.1%) has been issued on behalf of local school districts, which is supported by the property tax revenues of those districts. In addition, the State has $1,063.3 million in outstanding revenue bonds with $56.2 million for energy conservation projects and $1,007.1 million for transportation projects. Overview of the Financial Statements This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the State's basic financial statements. The State's basic financial statements are comprised of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains additional required supplementary information and other supplementary information, in addition to the basic financial statements. 4State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 Government-Wide Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the State's operations, in a manner similar to a private sector business. The statement of net position reports the difference between the State's assets, deferred outflows, liabilities, and deferred inflows as net position . Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the State is improving or deteriorating. The statement of activities presents information showing how the State's net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event that created the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. As a result, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the State that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities). The governmental activities of the State include general government, health and children's services, judicial and public safety, natural resources and environmental control, labor and education. The business-type activities of the State include transportation, lottery and unemployment services. The government-wide financial statements include not only the State (known as the primary government), but also legally separate entities for which the State is financially accountable. These entities include the Delaware State Housing Authority, the Diamond State Port Corporation, the Riverfront Development Corporation, the Delaware State University, the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation and 22 charter schools. Financial information for these component units is reported separately from the financial information presented for the primary government. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 19 - 20 of this report. Fund Financial Statements A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The State, lik e other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. The State's funds can be divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds. - Governmental Funds Governmental Funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, the governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and 5State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 outflows of available resources, as well as on balances of available resources on hand at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating a government's near-term financing requirements. Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for government funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government's near-term financial decisions. Both the governmental funds balance sheet and the governmental funds statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. The State's governmental funds include the general, federal, local school district, and capital projects funds. Information is presented separately in the governmental funds balance sheet and in the governmental funds statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance (deficit) for these funds. The basic governmental funds financial statements can be found on pages 21 - 24 of this report. The State budgets and controls its financial activities on the cash basis of accounting. In compliance with State law, the State records its financial tran sactions in either of two major categories - the General Fund or the Special Fund. References to these funds in this report include the terms \"budgetary\" or \"budgetary basis\" to differentiate them from the GAAP funds of the same name which encompass different funding categories. The State adopts an annual appropriated budget for its budgetary general fund. A budgetary comparison schedule has been provided for the budgetary general fund to demonstrate compliance with the budget. The schedule can be found on page 117 of this report. - Proprietary Funds Proprietary Funds charge customers for the services they provide - whether they are provided to outside customers (enterprise funds) or other State agencies and other governments (internal service funds). Proprietary Funds provide the same type of information as the government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. The proprietary fund financial statements provide separate information for the Lottery, Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund and the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT), all of which are considered to be major funds of the State. The basic proprietary fund financial statements can be found on pages 25 - 27 of this report. - Fiduciary Funds The State acts as a fiduciary to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. Fiduciary Funds are not reflected in the government-wide financial statements because the resources of those funds are not available to support the State of Delaware's own programs. The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much li ke that used for proprietary funds. These funds are used where th e State holds assets in trust or as an agent for others, including the pension trust funds and agency funds. 6State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 The basic fiduciary fund financial statements can be found beginning on pages 28 - 29 of this report. The combining fiduciary and agency fund statements can be found on pages 127 - 131. Notes to the Financial Statements The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 32 - 113 of this report. Required Supplementary Information In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report presents certain Required Supplementary Information (RSI) concerning the status of the State's legally adopted budget, the maintenance of the State's infrastructure and additional schedules related to funding status and progress, annual pension costs and actuarial methods and assumptions for the State's pension and OPEB trusts. The RSI can be found on pages 115 - 125 of this report. Statewide Financial Analysis As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government's financial position. The State's assets exceeded its liabilities by $4,877.2 million at the close of the most recent fiscal year. The largest portion of the State's net position of 99.3% reflects its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment) less any related outstanding debt used to acquire those assets. The State uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the State's investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. Restricted net position, comprising 11.7% of total net position, represents resources that are subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on how they can be used. The remaining portion of the State's net position represents the unrestricted deficit net position (11.0%). 7State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, Assets: $ $ 3,183,550 $ 3 ,040,470 $ 4,877,171 $ 5,022,118Condensed Financial Information - Primary Government 2013 2013 2013Governmental Activities Business-type Activities Total(Expressed in Thousands) *The State implemented GASB Statement No. 61 during fiscal 2013.

Therefore, the State's governmental activities net position as of July 1, 2012 has been restated. Fiscal 2012 amounts for governmental activities reported above have not been restated to reflect this change.As of June 30, 2013 2012 2012 2012 The capital assets of the governmental activities decreased by $82.6 million (2.3%) since June 30, 2012. The decrease is the result of decreased land easements in the amount of $213.4 million due to a restatement of net position with the implementation of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 61. The land easements are now recorded by a discretely presented component unit, the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation on page 30. These decreases are offset by increases in construction in progress and other depreciable assets as a result of significant renovations to, and expansions of, existing school buildings across all counties to accommodate the rise in student population. The increase in governmental activities non-capital assets is due to an increase in cash and investments due to an increase in business and real estate tax revenues along with increases in charges for services. The increase in governmental activities long-term liabilities outstanding of $305.2 million (8.2%) is primarily due to an increase in the other post employment benefits liability and bonds payable. At June 30, 2013, the long-term obligation for OPEB was $1,682.0 million, an increase of $185.5 million (12.4%) from fiscal year 2012. The OPEB obligation will increase each year as the State continues to defer full funding of its annual required contribution. Additional information for the OPEB obligation can be found in Note 14 of the financial statements. In addition, the general obligation long term debt increased by $58.6 million (3.5%) from fiscal year 2012. The State's debt as a percentage of the State's personal income was 7.8% in fiscal 8State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 year 2012 and 7.3% in fiscal year 2013. The State's debt burden reflects its centralized role in financing facilities, such as schools and prisons.

Changes in Net Position - Primary Government For Year End June 30, 2013 Governmental Activities Business-type Activities Total Primary Government(Expressed in Thousands) 9State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 Governmental Activities Since fiscal year 2012, the net position for governmental activities has decreased by $74.1 million. A comparison of the cost of services by function for the State's governmental activities is shown in the following chart, along with the revenues used to cover the net expenses of the governmental activities. Key elements of the decrease in the State's net position from governmental activities are as follows: Total general revenues of governmental activities increased overall by $208.4 million (5.6%) relating to increases in business taxes of $216.4 m illion and real estate taxes of $31.3 million. There was a decrease in investment income of $21.2 million (6.5%). The increases in tax revenues were primarily attributable to overall improvements in the economy and successful tax audits resulting in increased business tax revenue. The decrease in investment income is due to decreased mar ket gains in the current year. Program revenues increased by $147.6 million (7.5%) from the prior year due to an increase in charges for services of $137.6 million (32.6%) resulting from increases in licenses, fees, permits and fines and rentals and sales from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control and the Department of Agriculture. Also, operating grants increased by $10.0 million (0.6%) compared to the prior fiscal year, since Health and Social Services received additional funding of $103.8 million (9.9%) due largely to increased Medicaid funds and Education received $65.5 million (20.5%) less in operating grants due mainly to the end of ARRA funding. Revenues by Source - Governmental Activities Expenses for governmental activities decreased during fiscal year 2013 by $10.6 million (0.2%). The decrease in governmental activities is due in part to the decreased spending of $110.4 million (16.9%) for the general government due to organizations identifying alternative funding sources for expenditures. This is offset by increased spending of $42.1 million (1.8%) at Health and Children's Services as a result of a general increase in the Charges for Services 9.3%Operating and Capital Grants and Contributions 25.7% Personal Income Taxes 18.4%Business Taxes 33.3%Other Taxes 4.7%Real Estate Taxes 8.4%Investment of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 population served and rising health care costs and in educational expenses of $36.5 million (1.5%) due to the continued increase in student population resulting in additional personnel and other operating costs. Expenses and Program Revenues- Governmental Activities Business-type Activities The net position for business-type activities increased by $143.1 million (413.6%) in fiscal year 2013. This increase is comprised of a $130.3 million (273.2%) increase in net position for DelDOT plus a $12.8 (197.7%) million increase in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. The increase of $12.8 million in Delaware Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund net position is due to a decreased demand in benefits paid by the Trust Fund. The operating revenues (charges for services and operating grants) and operating expenses decreased by $51.3 million (22.2%) and $78.3 million (31.9%), respectively due to decreases in the benefits paid with improvements in the economy and less individuals unemployed and collecting benefits. Change in net position increased from a decrease of $13.1 million in 2012 to the increase of $12.8 million in 2013. DelDOT's net position at June 30, 2013 was $130.3 million higher than at June 30, 2012. Change in net position increased from $47.7 million in 2012 to $130.3 million in 2013. DelDOT's total operating revenues increased by $13.3 million (2.9%) while operating expenses decreased by $58.6 million (9.8%). The change is primarily attributable to an increase in toll revenues and an increase in motor vehicle and related revenues as a result of increased auto sales. The decrease in operating expenditures is primarily due to decreased capital preservation. In addition, capital contributions increased by $12.0 million (6.0%) due to increased federal capital grants. There was no change in the Lottery's net assets. By law, the Lottery's net assets cannot exceed $1.0 million. Revenue for the Lottery decreased by $79.0 million (11.1%) over last year mainly due to increased competition from casinos operating in Maryland and $0$500,000$1,000,000$1,500,000$2,000,000$2,500,000$3,000,000 General Government Health and Children's ServicesJudicial and Public SafetyNatural Resources and Environmental ControlLabor Education Interest on Long-Term Debt(Expressed in Thousands) Expenses 2013 Expenses 2012 Program Revenues 2013 Program Revenues 2012 11State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 Pennsylvania. The Lottery transferred $276.8 million in gaming revenues to the State, a decrease from fiscal year 2012 of $51.3 million (15.6%). The total costs of games and prizes decreased by $27.8 million (7.4%) over the previous year due to the decrease in video lottery activity. Revenues by Source - Business-type Activities Financial Analysis of the State's Funds As noted earlier, the State uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. Governmental Funds The focus of the State's governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of available resources. Such information is useful in assessing the State's financing requirements. Unassigned fund balances may serve as a useful measure of a government's net resources at the end of the fiscal year. Charges for Services 81.6%Operating and Capital Grants and Contributions 18.4% Expenses and Program Revenues - Business-type Activities $0$100,000$200,000$300,000$400,000$500,000$600,000$700,000$800,000 DelDOT Unemployment LotteryExpenses 2013 Expenses 2012 Program Revenues 2013 Program Revenues 2012 12State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 Fund balance classifications comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which a government is bound to observe constraints imposed upon the use of the resources reported in the governmental funds. This is further described in note 1 and note 16 of the basic financial statements. As of the end of the current fiscal year, the State's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $1,902.9 million, an increase of $74.1 million over the prior year fund balance as restated. Of this amount, $7.7 million is nonspendable (.4%), either due to its form or legal constraints, $569.7 million (29.9%) is restricted for specific programs by external constraints and $209.5 million (11.0%) is committed for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by a formal action of the Delaware Legislature. An additional $91.6 million (4.8%) has been assigned to specific purposes by management. The remaining $1,024.4 million (53.9%) of fund balance is unassigned. General Fund The General Fund accounts for the operation and administration of the State. Total general fund balance increased by $52.1 million for the fiscal year. Total General Fund revenues increased by $258.4 million (6.7%) due to several factors. The main increases were in personal taxes, which increased by $35.0 million and business taxes, which increased by $239.6 million. This was partially due to increased effort with enforcement efforts and an increase in business profits. These increases were offset by a decrease in investment income of $20.6 million due to decreased market gains. Total General Fund expenditures increased by $96.0 million (2.3%). This was primarily due to increases in Health and Children's Services of $12.3 million, Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control of $27.6 million, Public Safety of $58.1 million, Education of $125.3 million and debt services costs of $21.2 million offset by a decrease of expenditures in the General Government of $150.9 million due to organizations identifying alternative funding sources for expenditures. The increase in expenditures for Health and Children's Services, Public Safety, Education, and Natural Resources and Environmental Control, were attributable to an increase in services and for Health and Children's Servi ces a decrease in federal coverage for the Medicaid program. At the end of the current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance of the general fund was $1,025.3 million, while total fund balance reached $1,448.5 million. Federal Funds Federal Funds represent pass through grants used for designated purposes. These funds report federal grant revenues and the related expenditures to support the State's grant programs. Total federal fund expenditures increased by $19.3 million. Expenditures increased for Health and Children's Service by $82.2 million due largely to increased Medicaid expenditures and 13State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 decreased for General Government and Education by $14.3 million and $40.3 million, respectively. The General Government decrease is due to decreased funding for agricultural and energy related programs and the Education decrease is due to decreased funding for Title I and Special Education programs. Local School District Funds These funds are used to account for activities relating to the State's local school districts, which are funded by locally raised real estate taxes and other revenues. The fund balance decreased by $12.1 million to $294.3 million due to an increase of expenditures to serve the increasing population. Capital Project Funds Capital Project Funds are used to account for the construction and acquisition of capital assets of the primary government. Capital outlay expenditures totaled $226.1 million in fiscal year 2013, an increase of $38.4 million. Proprietary Funds The State's Proprietary Funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. The Proprietary Fund financial statements provide separate information for the Lottery, Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund and the DelDOT Fund, all of which are considered to be part of the primary government and major funds of the State. Total Proprietary Fund net position increased in fiscal year 2013 by $143.1 million as a result of operations. Page 11 discusses the changes in net position of the business-type activities. General Fund Budgetary Highlights The Budgetary General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of the fiscal year, total fund balance increased by $71.2 million. Revenues were $370.5 million (11.0%) more than the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to increases in the corporate income tax of $68.8 million (57.7%), abandoned property of $252.7 million (84.1%), corporate and partnership fees of $20.3 million (8.1%) and realty transfer tax of $10.7 million (33.7%). The $252.7 million increase in abandoned property was the result of increased enforcement efforts and an audit of transfer agents to ensure inactive accounts are timely reported to the State. Offsetting these revenue increases were decreases in gross receipts tax of $10.8 million (4.7%) bank franchise tax of $8.4 million (7.7%), and insurance tax of $8.0 million (14.2%). Expenditures were $66.3 million (1.8%) more than the previous fiscal year. Salaries and wages increased by $8.2 million (0.6%) and pension costs increased by $19.1 million (7.5%). Grants- in-Aid increased by $8.7 million (2.4%), contractual services increased by $28.9 million (6.3%) and capital outlays increased by $3.3 million (20.0%). 14State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 The original budget authorizes current fiscal year operating and administrative expenditures. Included in the final budget are the original budget, prior year encumbrances, multi-year project budgetary carry-forwards from the prior fiscal years, and all modifications to the original budget. The most significant components are the original budget and carry-forwards of prior fiscal year. The unused appropriations from a prior year will carry forward to the final budget for authorized capital projects and grants until the funds are spent. Where actual expenditures were within the final budget in departments, the significant budget variance was $25.4 million in the Executive Department for funds budgeted, but not spent on ongoing capital improvement projects, technology projects, and contingency items. Business taxes were $35.9 million less than budgeted due in large part to refunds that were in excess of budgeted amounts. Other revenues, which are mainly licenses and fees, were $34.6 million more than budgeted as the budgeted refunds for these revenues were less than expected. Funded projects, which are not completed by year-end, may carry over unspent funds into fiscal year 2014. Unspent funds are reflected in the final budget which may cause variances from original budget. Capital Assets and Debt Administration Capital Assets The State's investment in capital assets for its governmental and business-type activities, as of June 30, 2013, amounted to $7,703.4 million (net of accumulated depreciation). This investment in capital assets includes land, land improvements, buildings, vehicles and equipment, easements, roads, highways, and bridges. The total decrease in capital assets for governmental activities was $82.6 million (2.3%) and the increase for business-type activities was $120.3 million (3.0%). Major capital asset changes during the current fiscal year included the following: /g120 The decrease in governmental activities is due to the implementation of GASB 61 which decreased easements reported by a newly iden tified discretely presented component unit that was previously blended, offset by increases for the continued completion of school renovations, /g120 The increase in business-type activities is due to increased spending at DelDOT for the Turnpike/SR-1 interchange and the US 301 projects. As allowed by GASB, the State has adopted an alternative process for recording expense related to selected infrastructure assets. Under this alternative method, referred to as the modified approach, the State expenses certain maintenance and preservation costs and does not report depreciation expense. Assets accounted for under the modified approach include 4,378 center line miles of roads and 1,601 bridges that the State is responsible to maintain. DelDOT performs condition assessments of eligible infrastructure assets at least every three years. Currently, road condition assessments are conducted every two years. Historically, road condition assessments were conducted every year. The Department's assessment plan will 15State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 ensure that all infrastructure assets are assessed and evaluated within the three-year period, as required. Due to timing of these conditions assessments, information for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 is not available for all assessments. It is the State's policy to maintain at least 85% of its highways at a fair or better condition level and 75% of its bridge systems at a good or be tter condition level. No more than 10% of bridges and 15% of roads should be in substandard condition. Of the State's 1,601 bridges that were rated in fiscal year 2013, 71.9% received a good or better Bridge Condition Rating (BCR) rating, 20.9% were rated fair, and 7.2% received a substandard rating. Of the 7,614,980 square feet of bridge dec k that was rated, 91.4% or 6,956,457 square feet received an Overall Pavement Condition (OPC) condition rating of good or better, 8.5% received a fair rating, and 0.1% received a substandard deck rating. In 2011, 4,378 center line miles were rated; 95.8% received a fair or better OPC rating and 4.2% received a poor rating. The fiscal year 2013 estimate to maintain and preserve DelDOT's infrastructure was $185.4 million, but the actual expenditures were $233.8 million, which is $48.4 million over the estimate. The estimated expenditures represent annual budget or bond bill authorizations and the actual expenditures represent the current year spending, which includes cumulative authorizations. Additional information on the State's capital assets can be found in Note 1 on pages 46 - 47, Note 12 on pages 86 - 88 and starting on page 120 in the Required Supplementary Information. A summary of the State's primary government's capital assets, net of depreciation is provided below: Land $ 459,587 $ 447,812 $ 283,876 4,034,852 $ 7,703,445 $ 7,665,755 State of Delaware Capital Assets as of June 30, 2013 Net of Depreciation (Expressed in Thousands) 2012 2013Governmental Activities Business-type Activities 2013 2012Total 2013 2012 Long-Term Debt The State uses general obligation debt to finance capital projects. At the end of the current fiscal year, the State had total general obligation bond debt outstanding of $1,755.2 million bac ked by the full faith and credit of the State. The State's debt burden reflects its centralized role in 16State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 financing school construction projects. As of June 30, 2013, $545.7 million, or 31.1%, of the State's outstanding debt was issued on behalf of local school districts. Local school districts transferred $64.3 million of property tax revenue to the State to cover related debt service during fiscal year 2013 . The State has no constitutional debt limits. However, in 1991, the State enacted legislation that limits debt issuance with a three-part test as follows: /g120 A 5% test restricts new debt authorization to 5% of budgetary general fund revenue as projected by DEFAC in June for the next fiscal year. Should actual revenue collections increase during the year, no additional authorizations are made. For fiscal year 2013, debt issuance was limited to $187.0 million. /g120 A 15% test restricts debt issuance if the annual payments on all outstanding debt exceed 15% of estimated budgetary general fund and Transportation Trust Fund Revenue for the next fiscal year. Currently, these annual payments represent approximately 8% of estimated general fund and Transportation Trust Fund revenues. /g120 Finally, a cash balance test restricts debt issuance if the debt service payment in any year exceeds the estimated cumulative cash balance for the following fiscal year. For fiscal year 2013, the projected cash balance exceeded debt service. Due to the State's statutory debt limits and its fiscal management, three principal rating agencies, Moody's Investor's Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's, reaffirmed their triple-A ratings on the State's general obligation bonds during fiscal year 2013. On February 28, 2013, the State issued $336.3 million of its general obligation bonds maturing between February 1, 2014 and February 1, 2033. Of the $336.3 million issued as Series 2013, $111.3 million was issued to refund higher priced bonds resulting in a net present value savings of $14.4 million, or 11.7% of the principal refunded. In addition, the Sustainable Energy Utility, Inc. had $56.2 million of Revenue Bonds, Series 2011 outstanding as of June 30, 2013. These bonds were used to support general government initiatives and have been used to finance construction on energy efficient upgrades to facilities in the State. As such, that debt is reflected in the primary government statements as governmental activities. The bonds are secured by appropriations of the state agencies that are participating in the SEU program. Debt issued by the Delaware Transportation Authority does not constitute a debt of the State or a pledge of its general taxing power or of its full faith and credit. Rather, the outstanding revenue bonds are obligations of the Authority payable solely from and secured by a pledge and assignment of certain tolls and revenues such as motor fuel tax revenues, motor vehicle document fees and motor vehicle registrations. The Delaware Transportation Authority has revenue bonds outstanding of $923.8 millio n to support its ongoing capital transportation program and $99.7 million in Grant Anticipation Vehicle Bonds (GARVEEs), to finance a portion of the costs of completing the final design and right-of-way acquisition for a new U.S. 301. 17State of Delaware Management's Discussion and Anal ysis, June 30, 2013 Additional information on the State of Delaware's long-term debt can be found in Notes 5, 6 and 7 on pages 69 - 83 of this report. Financial Management The State's financial management continues to be recognized by a premier credit rating from all three principal rating agencies: Aaa from Moody's Investor's Service, AAA from Fitch Ratings and AAA from Standard & Poor's. The ratings reflect Delaware's financial management practices that have become institutionalized within the State: /g120 expenditure budgeting of 98% of available budgetary general fund revenue; /g120 budgetary general fund revenue forecasts that are frequent, objective and often conservative; /g120 three-part debt affordability test that limits debt authorization to 5% of budgetary general fund; revenue and debt service to 15% of tax supported revenue; and cash balance test; /g120 consistent satisfaction of the State's budget reserve requirement - the State's rainy day fund has never fallen below its mandated 5% of general fund revenue; and /g120 full funding of its pension plan. Economic Factors and Next Year's Budgets and Rates DEFAC met on June 17, 2013 to prepare the final revenue and expenditure estimates upon which the fiscal year 2014 operating and capital budgets would be based. The most recent employment data for the State of Delaware has indicated improvement in the labor mar ket; therefore, the FY 2014 forecast anticipates small growth. There is an assumption in the forecast that the scheduled expiration of tax cuts in 2014 will occur. The fiscal year 2014 operating and capital budgets meet budgetary spending limitations imposed by law. The fiscal year 2014 operating budget is $3,718.2 million, 5.0% more than fiscal year 2013. The fiscal year 2014 operating budget included $60.9 million in supplemental appropriations (historically in the form of cash allocated to the capital budget), a decrease of 53.7% over the fiscal year 2013 budget.

(a) Reporting Entity The accompanying financial statements present the State's primary government and include all funds, elected officials, departments and organizations, bureaus, boards, commissions, and authorities that comprise the State's legal entity. Also included in the State's primary government are the State's 16 local school districts and 3 vo-tech schools (collectively referred to as the local school districts). The local school districts have separately elected boards, but they have not been specifically granted power by legislation to be legally separate. Based on the powers and authority granted in Title 14 of the State of Delaware code, the primary government holds sufficient power and responsibility that the local school districts have been accounted for as not being legally separate and as a result have been reported in the primary government. The financial activity of the local school districts is reported in the General Fund, Local School District Fund (for real estate taxes levied by the Schools), Federal Fund, and the Capital Projects Fund. The DelDOT enterprise fund is also included in the reporting entity of the primary government. DelDOT has the overall responsibility for coordinating and developing transportation polices for the state along with the maintenance and operation of roadways and bridges that fall under its jurisdiction. To assist DelDOT in their mission, the State and DelDOT created the Delaware Transportation Authority (the Authority), which includes the activities of the Transportation Trust Fund (the Trust Fund) and the Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC). The Authority is a body politic and corporate whose actions are overseen by the Secretary of Transportation, the Director of the Office of Financial Management and Budget, and the Administrator of the Trust Fund. The Authority's principal role is to provide financing to DelDOT and as a result is a blended component unit of DelDOT. Fiduciary funds, although legally separate entities, are in substance part of the State's operations. The State's reporting entity also comprises its component units, entities for which the State is considered either financially accountable or the nature and the significance of their relationship with the State is such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading. Blended component units are reported within the primary government. Discretely presented component units are reported in a separate column in the government-wide financial statements (see note below for description) to emphasize that such are legally separate from the State. The decision to include and how to report a component unit in the State's reporting entity is based on several criteria, including legal standing, debt responsibility, fiscal dependency, and financial accountability. The State is financially accountable for legally separate organizations if it appoints a voting majority of the organization's board and (1) it is able to impose its will on that organization or (2) there is a potential for the organization to provide 32State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on, the State. The State may also be financially accountable if an organization is fiscally dependent on the State and there is a potential for the organization to prov ide specific benefits to or impose specific financial burdens on the State, regardless of whether the organization has a separately elected governing board, a governing board appointed by a higher level of government, or a jointly appointed board. Blended Component Units The Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System (DPERS) is a public employee retirement system, which covers substantially all State employees. The DPERS is a legally separate entity, which includes its blended component unit, the First State Independence Fund I, LLC, a hedge fund-of-funds which DPERS is considered to be financially accountable. DPERS' Board is comprised of five members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate, plus two ex-officio members. It provides services and benefits almost exclusively to the primary government, and it is considered a blended fiduciary funds component unit and is shown in the financial statements as part of the primary government as a pension trust fund. The financial report of DPERS for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 may be obtained in writing to the State Board of Pension Trustees and Office of Pensions, McArdle Building, Suite 1, 860 Silver La ke Boulevard, Dover, Delaware 19904-2402. The Delaware Other Post Employment Benefit Fund Trust (OPEB Trust) is a trust, which provides retirement medical coverage to pensioners and their eligible dependents in the State's Employees', Judiciary, New State Police, and Closed State Police Pension Plans. The OPEB Trust is a legally separate entity and by legisla tive code the Board of DPERS serves as the Board of the OPEB Trust. It provides services and benefits almost exclusively to the primary government. The OPEB Trust is considered a blended fiduciary funds component unit and is shown in the financial statements as part of the primary government as the OPEB Trust Fund. The Delaware Economic Development Authority (DEDA) was established by 29 Del. C. 50, Subchapter IV as a legally separate entity to assi st the State in the financing of citizens and activities of exempt persons in order to contribute to the prosperity, health, and general welfare of the citizens of the State by acting as the financing vehicle. DEDA is considered to be a blended component unit due to the board being the same as the primary government and is reported as part of the General Government in the General Fund of the primary government. The Sustainable Energy Utility, Inc. (SEU) is a legally separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, which was established to reduce energy waste and foster a sustainable energy future for the State. The Governor appoints seven of the eleven members. It provides benefits almost exclusively to the prim ary government by developing and coordinating programs for the purpose of promoting sustainable use of energy by State departments and agencies. The SEU is considered a blended component unit and is shown as part of the Natural Resources and Environmental Control function in the General Fund of the primary 33State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 government. Discretely Presented Component Units The following component units are entities that are legally separate from the State, but are financially accountable to the State for reporting purposes or whose relationship with the State is such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading. The component units' column of the basic financial statements includes the financial data of these entities. Each discretely presented component unit has a June 30, 2013 fiscal year-end. Complete financial statements for each of the discretely presented component units may be obtained from their respective administrative offices. Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) The Delaware State Housing Authority is a public corporation whose Director is appointed by the Governor with the consent of the State Senate and serves at the Governor's pleasure. The DSHA is governed by the Council on Housing whose eleven members are appointed by the Governor. The DSHA administers the role of providing affordable housing as a key aspect of State policy. The State provides both General Fund appropriations and capital funding to assist DSHA in its mission. Certain transactions of the DSHA require the approval of the primary government. The DSHA is authorized, among other things, to (1) make mortgage, construction and other loans to not-for-profit and limited for-profit housing sponsors; (2) ma ke loans to mortgage lenders, requiring the proceeds thereof to be used for making newly qualified residential mortgage loans; (3) purchase qualified mortgage loans from mortgage lenders; and (4) apply for and receive assistance and subsidies under programs from the federal government and others. Diamond State Port Corporation (DSPC) The Diamond State Port Corporation was organized as a body corporate and politic constituting a public instrumentality of the State. The DSPC is empowered to operate, improve and maintain the Port of Wilmington and related facilities. The Governor appoints eight of the fifteen members of the board of directors, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Certain transactions of the DSPC require the approval of the primary government. Riverfront Development Corporation (RDC) The Riverfront Development Corporation was formed to plan, develop and manage programs and projects intended to foster economic development along the Brandywine and Christina Rivers. The Governor appoints seven of the eighteen board members; however, seven of the remaining eleven directors consist of the Governor and six State officials. Authorization by the State's Budget Director and Controller General is required before funds of the RDC may be expended, which indicates imposition of will. 34State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Delaware State University (DSU or the University) Delaware State University is a public institution of higher education. Funding is primarily through State appropriations. State appropriations, without restrictions as to use by the University, are reported in general revenue. Additional funding is derived from tuition, federal grants, private donations and grants. The Board of Trustees is comprised of fifteen members, eight appointed by the Governor of Delaware and seven elected by the Trustees. The President of the University and the Governor of the State of Delaware serve as ex-officio members of the Board. Delaware State University financial data includes its two component units, the Delaware State University Student Housing Foundation and the Delaware State University Foundation, Inc. The State annually appropriates funding for the University, which totaled more than $33 million in fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, which is twenty eight percent of the University's total revenues. Delaware Charter Schools The State's 22 Charter Schools are public schools funded primarily through State appropriations. Additional funding is derived from federal grants passed through from the primary government, private donations and funds received from local school districts on a tax portion per child basis. State funding for the Charter Schools totaled $107.8 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 which represents over eighty percent of the Charter Schools' total revenues. Each Charter School is a separate legal entity managed by their own separate board of directors and operate independently under a charter granted by the State Department of Education with the approval of the State Board of Education. Charters are granted for an initial period of three years and renewable every five years thereafter. Charter Schools issue their own debt but are dependent on the State for their primary funding. Financial information for Delaware Charter Schools is presented in the aggregate as they are individually immaterial to the State's basic financial statements. Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation (DALPF) The Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation was established to provide comprehensive agricultural lands preservation programs to serve the long-term needs of the agriculture community and the citizens of Delaware. State appropriations fund DALPF for their specific programs. DALPF is comprised of twelve trustees and the Governor of the State of Delaware appoints ten of them. DALPF shall continue until its existence is terminated by law, whereby all of its rights, properties and liabilities shall pass to and be assumed by the State. Related Organizations Organizations in which the State appoints the voting majority of the board but the State is not financially accountable for the organizations are considered related organizations. The Delaware Solid Waste Authority (DSWA) is a lega lly separate entity and the primary government appoints all seven members of its governing board. The primary government's accountability for DSWA does not extend beyond ma king the appointments. The DSWA is 35State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 responsible for implementing solid waste disposal, recycling, and resource recovery systems, facilities and services for the State of Delaware. The finan cial activities of DSWA are not included in the State's financial statements. The Delaware Health Facilities Authority (DHFA) was established by 16 Del. C.92 for the benefit of the people of the State, the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity and the improvement of their health and living conditions and provides a measure of assistance and an alternative method to enable facilities to provides structures needed to accomplish this purpose. All of the seven members of the board are appointed by the Governor. The primary government's accountability for DHFA does not extend beyond ma king the appointments. The financial activities of DHFA are not included in the State's financial statements. Complete financial statements for each of the related organizations may be obtained from their respective administrative offices. Jointly Governed Organization The Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA), a body politic, was created with the intention of advancing the economic growth and development of those areas in the State of Delaware and the State of New Jersey, which border the Delaware River and Delaware Bay. DRBA is governed by twelve commissioners: six appointed by the State of Delaware and six appointed by the State of New Jersey. DRBA is autonomous from a day-to-day operations perspective and neither State is obligated for the DRBA's debt. DRBA is not included in the basic financial statements as the State of Delaware has no ongoing financial interest or financial responsibility. Complete financial statements for the DRBA may be obtained from its administrative office. Other Organization The Governor appoints eight members of the governing board of the University of Delaware (the University). The remaining twenty members are elected separately. Since the primary government's accountability does not extend beyond State grants to the University and there is a lack of fiscal dependency, the financial activities of the University are not included in the State's basic financial statements. Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the statement of activities) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the primary government and its component units. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities , which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is separately presented from certain legally separate component units for which the State is financially accountable. 36State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 The statement of net position measures not just current assets and liabilities, but also long- term assets and liabilities such as capital assets (including infrastructure assets) and general long-term debt. The difference between the State's assets and its liabilities is its net position. Net position is displayed in three components - net investment in capital assets (capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and related debt); restricted; and unrestricted. Net position is restricted when constraints are pla ced that are either externally imposed or are imposed by constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, generally it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed. The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segments are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or segment and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items properly excluded among program revenues are reported as general revenues . Separate fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statements. Major individual governmental funds and major individual proprietary funds are reported in separate columns in the fund financial statements. (b) Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements. Agency funds reported as part of the fiduciary fund financial statements are custodial in nature and do not present results of operations and, therefore, do not have a measurement focus. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied and other taxes are recognized when the transaction occurs. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements have been met. As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial statements. Exceptions to this general rule are charges between the State's enterprise operations and various other functions of the government. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the various functions concerned. Intrafund non-exchange transactions between the primary government and component units are reported as operating or capital grants as appropriate for restricted amounts. Unrestricted amounts are reported as general revenue. 37State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the State considers all revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to other long term liabilities including compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. Taxes, grants, fees, sales, rents, and interest income associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal period to the extent earned and available. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the State. Revenue related to expenditure driven grants is recognized when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other requirements for recognition have been met. Governmental Funds The State reports the following major governmental funds: General Fund - The General Fund is the State's primary operating fund. It accounts for all financial resources obtained and used for those services traditionally provided by a state government, which are not required to be accounted for in other funds. These services include, among others, education, and health and social services. Federal Fund - The Federal Fund accounts for all activities relating to the State's federal grant programs. Local School District Fund - The Local School District Fund is used to account for aggregate financial activity of the State's local school districts that is funded by locally- raised real estate taxes, interest, and minor miscellaneous revenue. All other financial activity that is funded from sources, such as federal grant programs, major and minor capital project programs, and subsidized government programs are accounted for in the General Fund, Federal Fund, and Capital Projects Fund. Capital Projects Fund - Transactions related to resources obtained and used for the acquisition or construction of major capital f acilities (other than those financed by Proprietary and Fiduciary Funds), are accounted for in the Capital Projects Fund. Such resources are derived principally from proceeds of general obligation bond issues, federal grants, and transfers from the General Fund. Proprietary Funds Proprietary funds are used to account for those activities which are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises. The costs of providing services to the public 38State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 on a continuing basis are financed by or recovered primarily through user charges. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund's principal ongoing operations. The principal operating revenues of the unemployment fund are charges to employers for taxes against wages. The principal operating revenues of the lottery fund and DelDOT fund are charges to customers for sales and services. The Lottery fund recognizes revenue from online games on the day of the drawing. Revenue from the sale of instant tick ets is recognized when the book has been activated and 85% of the related prizes of an activated book are paid, 90 days from the date of activation, or when the next pack of the same game is activated. Revenue from the video lottery and table games is recognized, net of prizes paid, at the time the public plays the game. Revenue from the sports lottery is also recognized at the time the public plays the game. Operating expenses for proprietary funds include the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses, and depreciation on capital assets. For the unemployment fund, expenses are payments of benefits to recipients. All expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating expenses. The State reports the following major proprietary funds: DelDOT Fund - The DelDOT Fund accounts for the activities relating to the operation of the State's Department of Transportation, including the Delaware Transportation Trust (Authority), which is comprised of the Transportation Trust Fund and Delaware Transit Corporation. Unemployment Fund - The Unemployment Fund accounts for the activities relating to the State's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Lottery Fund - The Lottery Fund accounts for the activities relating to the State's Lottery program. Fiduciary Funds The fiduciary funds account for assets held by the State in a trustee capacity or as an agency for other individuals or organizations. The fiduciary fund statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The State reports the following fiduciary funds: Agency Funds - Agency funds are custodial in nature and do not involve measurement of the results of operations. They account for the receipt of various taxes, deposits, deductions, and certain property collected by the State, acting in the capacity of an agent, and for the distribution to other governmental units or designated beneficiaries. 39State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Pension Trust Funds - The Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System (DPERS) is a public employee retirement system, which covers substantially all State employees. It provides services and benefits almost exclusively to the primary government and it is considered a fiduciary fund and is shown in the financial statements as part of the primary government as a pension trust fund . Pension trust funds account for transactions, assets, liabilities and net position available for plan benefits (Note 15). For pension trust funds, employee contributions are recognized as revenue in the period in which the employee services are performed. Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of each plan. Investment Trust Funds - Investment Trust Funds are used to account for external investment pools where a government commingles the monies of more than one legally separate entity and invests, on the participants' behalf, in an investment portfolio; one or more of the participants is not part of the sponsor's reporting entity. The Investment Trust Fund accounts for the transactions, assets, liabilities and fund equity for the DPERS's external investment pool and for the OPEB Fund Investment Trust Fund. OPEB Trust Fund - The OPEB Trust Fund is a trust administered by DPERS. In addition to providing pension benefits, the State is statutorily required to provide health insurance coverage and survivor benefits for retired employees and their survivors. Substantially all of the State's employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while wor king for the State. Health care benefits are provided through plans whose premiums are based on the benefits paid during the year. The cost of providing post-retirement benefits is shared between the State and the retired employee. New Accounting Pronouncements During fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, the state adopted GASB Statement No. 61, The Financial Reporting Entity: Omnibus and amendment GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 34. The objective of this Statement is to improve financial reporting for a governmental financial reporting entity and to better meet user needs and to address reporting entity issues that have arisen since the issuance of Statements No. 14 and No. 34. This Statement modifies certain requirements for inclusion of component units in the financial reporting entity. For organizations that previously were required to be included as component units by meeting the fiscal dependency criterion, a financial benefit or burden relationship also would need to be present between the primary government and that organization for it to be included in the reporting entity as a component unit. Further, for organizations that do not meet the financial accountability criteria for inclusion as component units but that, nevertheless, should be included because the primary government's management determines that it would be misleading to exclude them, this Statement clarifies the manner in which that determination should be made and the types of relationships that generally should be considered in ma king the determination. This Statement also amends the criteria for reporting component units as if they were part of the primary government (that is, blending) in certain circumstances. This Statement also clarifies the reporting of equity 40State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 interests in legally separate organizations and amends certain note disclosure requirements. The adoption of Statement No. 61 in 2013 resulted in the State decreasing net position of the governmental activities as of June 30, 2012 in the amount of $213.9 million for the change of DAPLF from blended with the governmental activities to a discretely presented component unit and a related $525 thousand decrease in the General Fund balance as of June 30, 2012 on the Governmental Funds Balance Sheet as follows: During fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 the State adopted GASB Statement No. 63 Financial Reporting of Deferred Outflows of Resources, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position . This Statement provides financial reporting guidance for deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources. GASB Concepts Statement No. 4, Elements of Financial Statements , introduced and defined those elements as a consumption of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period, and an acquisition of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period, respectively. GASB Concepts Statement No. 4 also identifies net position as the residual of all other elements presented in a statement of financial position. Statement No. 63 amends the net asset reporting requirements in Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements\u2014and Management's Discussion and Analysis\u2014for State and Local Governments , and other pronouncements by incorporating deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources into the definitions of the required components of the residual measure and by renaming that measure Local School Capital General Federal District Projects Total Net Position as previously reported at June 30, 2012 1,396,993 $ 15,630 $ 306,397$ 110,302 $ 1,829,322$ Restatement for GASB 61 Adjustment (525) - - - (525) Net Position as restated at July 1, 2012 1,396,468$ 15,630 $ 306,397$ 110,302 $ 1,828,797$ Governmental Funds Balance Sheet (Expressed in Thousands )Discretely Presented Governmental Business-Type Component Activities Activities Total Units Net Position as previously reported at June 30, 2012 1,981,648 $ 3,040,470$ - 58,931 Other - - - (19,702) Net Position as restated at July 1, 2012 1,767,754$ 3,040,470$ 4,808,224$ 1,081,915$ Government Wide Statement of Net Position (Expressed in Thousands ) 41State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 as net position, rather than net assets. The adoption of Statement No. 63 resulted only in the State renaming net assets to net position. Impact of Future Accounting Pronouncements In 2012, the GASB issued No. 65 Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities. This Statement establishes accounting and financial reporting standards that reclassify, as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities and recognizes, as outflows of resources or inflows of resources, certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities. GASB Concepts Statement No. 4, Elements of Financial Statements , introduced and defined the elements included in financial statements, including deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources. Statement No. 65 amends the financial statement element classification of certain items previously reported as assets and liabilities to be consistent with the definitions in GASB Concepts Statement No. 4. This Statement also provides other financial reporting guidance related to the impact of the financial statement elements deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources, such as changes in the determination of the major fund calculations and limiting the use of the term deferred in financial statement presentations. The provisions of this Statement are effective for financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2012. Earlier application is encouraged. The State is currently evaluating the future impact of this statement. In 2012, the GASB issued No. 66 Technical Corrections\u20142012\u2014 an amendment of GASB Statements No. 10 and No. 62. The objective of this Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting for a governmental financial reporting entity by resolving conflicting guidance that resulted from the issuance of two pronouncements, Statements No. 54 Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions , and No. 62 Codification of Accounting and Financial Reporting Guidance Contained in Pre-November 30, 1989 FASB and AICPA Pronouncements . This Statement amends Statement No. 10 Accounting and Financial Reporting for Risk Financing and Related Insurance Issues , by removing the provision that limits fund-based reporting of an entity's ris k financing activities to the general fund and the internal service fund type. This Statement also amends Statement No. 62 by modifying the specific guidance on accounting for (1) operating lease payments that vary from a straight-line basis, (2) the difference between the initial investment (purchase price) and the principal amount of a purchased loan or group of loans, and (3) servicing fees related to mortgage loans that are sold when the stated service fee rate differs significantly from a current (normal) servicing fee rate. The provisions of this Statement are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The State is currently evaluating the future impact of this statement. In June of 2012, the GASB issued No. 67 Financial Reporting for Pension Plans\u2014an amendment of GASB Statement No. 25. The objective of this Statement is to improve financial reporting by state and local governmental pension plans. This Statement results from a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of existing standards of accounting and financial reporting for pensions with regard to providing decision-useful information, supporting assessments of accountability and inter-period equity, and creating additional 42State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 transparency. This Statement will re place the requirements of Statements No. 25 Financial Reporting for Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Note Disclosures for Defined Contribution Plans, and No. 50 Pension Disclosures , as they relate to pension plans that are administered through trusts or equivalent arrangements (hereafter jointly referred to as trusts) that meet certain criteria. The requirements of Statements No. 25 and 50 remain applicable to pension plans that are not administered through trusts covered by the scope of this Statement and to defined contribution plans that provide postemployment benefits other than pensions. This Statement and Statement No. 68 establish a definition of a pension plan that reflects the primary activities associated with the pension arrangement\u2014determining pensions, accumulating and managing assets dedicated for pensions, and paying benefits to plan members as they come due. The provisions of this Statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2013. The State is currently evaluating the future impact of this statement. In June of 2012, the GASB issued No. 68 Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions - An Amendment to GASB Statement No. 27 . The primary objective of this Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. It also improves information provided by state and local governmental employers about financial support for pensions that is provided by other entities. This Statement results from a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of existing standards of accounting and financial reporting for pensions with regard to providing decision-useful information, supporting assessments of accountability and inter-period equity, and creating additional transparency. This Statement and Statement No. 67 establish a definition of a pension plan that reflects the primary activities associated with the pension arrangement \u2014 determining pensions, accumulating and managing assets dedicated for pensions, and paying benefits to plan members as they come due. In addition, this Statement details the recognition and disclosure requirements for employers with liabilities (payables) to a defined benefit pension plan and for employers whose employees are provided with defined contribution pensions. This Statement also addresses circumstances in which a non-employer entity has a legal requirement to mak e contributions directly to a pension plan. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2014. This will result in the liability being included on the statement of net position. In 2013, the GASB issued No. 69 Government Combinations and Disposals of Government Operations . This Statement establishes accounting and financial reporting standards related to government combinations and disposals of government operations. As used in this Statement, the term government combinations includes a variety of transactions referred to as mergers, acquisitions, and transfers of operations. The requirements of this Statement are effective for government combinations and disposals of government operations occurring in financial reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied on a prospective basis. Earlier application is encouraged. The State is currently evaluating the future impact of this statement. In 2013, the GASB issued No. 70 Accounting and Reporting for Non-exchange Financial Guarantees. Some governments extend financial guarantees for the obligations of another government, a not-for-profit organization, a private entity, or individual without directly 43State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 receiving equal or approximately equal value in exchange (a non-exchange transaction). As a part of this non-exchange financial guarantee, a government commits to indemnify the holder of the obligation if the entity or individual that issued the obligation does not fulfill its payment requirements. Also, some governments issue obligations that are guaranteed by other entities in a non-exchange transaction. The objective of this Statement is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments that extend and receive non-exchange financial guarantees. The provisions of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2013. Earlier application is encouraged. Except for disclosures related to cumulative amounts paid or received in relation to a non-exchange financial guarantee, the provisions of this Statement are required to be applied retroactively. Disclosures related to cumulative amounts paid or received in relation to a non-exchange financial guarantee may be applied prospectively. The State is currently evaluating the future impact of this statement. (c) Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets or Equity Cash Equivalents, Cash and Pooled Investments, and Investments Cash equivalents consists of demand deposits, short-term money mar ket securities, and other deposits held by financial institutions, generally with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and Pooled Investments consist of cash equivalents, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, short-term (12 to 18 months) and long-term investments, which comprise corporate, municipal and U.S. government obligations, held and managed by the State Treasurer. Investment securities are stated at quoted mar ket prices, except that investment securities with a remaining maturity at time of purchase of one year or less are stated at cost or amortized cost. All of the investment assets of the Pension and Investment Trust Funds, with the exception of the Closed State Police Pension Plan (which is a pay-as-you-go plan) and the Delaware Volunteer Fireman's Fund (which is a length of service award plan), are pooled and invested in a common Master Trust. Investments are presented at fair value. Fair values for fixed income and equity securities are determined by quoted mar ket prices based on national exchanges when available. Pooled investments are funds wherein the System owns units or shares of commingled equity, bond, and cash funds. Pooled investments are redeemable with the underlying funds at net asset values under the original terms of the partnership agreements and/or subscription agreements. Alternative investments include nontraditional investments, some of which may be illiquid, such as limited partnerships, venture capital funds, or private LLCs. DPERS or management generally uses net asset value as reported by investment managers as a practical expedient to fair value for its investments in pooled and alternative investment funds. Net asset values provided by pooled and alternative investment managers are based on quoted prices for the funds' underlying securities (most of which are mar ketable), as well as estimates, appraisals, assumptions, and methods that are established by valuation 44State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 committees and reviewed by DPERS or management. Net asset value may differ from fair value, and under some circumstances, DPERS or management may determine, based on other information available, that an underlying investment's reported valuation does not represent fair value. These net asset values are review by DPERS or management and its investment advisor; both management and the custodian receive periodic and audited annual financial reports from the alternative fund managers. Receivables and Payables Activities between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are referred to as \"due to/from other funds\" (i.e., the current portion of interfund loans). All trade and property tax receivables, including those for the component units, are shown net of an allowance for uncollectibles and refunds. Inventories and Prepaid Items All inventories are valued at cost using the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories of governmental funds are recorded as expenditures when consumed, rather than when purchased. Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items in both government-wide and fund financial statements. Restricted Assets When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first, and then unrestricted resources as needed. In the government-wide financial statements, restricted net assets represent bala nces that are subject to external restrictions or were created by enabling legislation. The State has the following restricted assets: /g120 The Delaware Transportation Authority restricts revenue bond proceeds that are accounted for in the Transportation Fund. /g120 The governmental activities have funds that are required to be restricted as disclosed in Note 16. The discretely presented component units have the following restricted assets: /g120 Diamond State Port Corporation has restricted investments for capital project outlays. /g120 Delaware State University has restricted assets for capital project outlays, grants, and college endowment funds. /g120 Charter schools have restricted assets to cover debt service payments, capital improvements and donor imposed restrictions. /g120 Delaware State Housing Authority has restricted assets used for the specific purpose of housing development fund activities per enabling legislation. 45State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Capital Assets Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure assets (which are normally immovable and of value only to the Stat e, such as roads, bridges, sidewalks, and similar items), are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements, the proprietary funds and discretely presented component units. Capital assets are defined by the State as assets with estimated useful lives in excess of one year at the date of acquisition. Such assets are recorded at historical cost if purchased or constructed, or estimated historical cost if the original cost is not determinable. Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair mar ket value at the date of donation. All land and buildings are capitalized, regardless of cost. Equipment and vehicles are capitalized when the cost of individual items exceeds $25,000. Building and land improvements are capitalized when the cost of the project exceeds $100,000. Infrastructure and software are capitalized when the costs of individual items or projects exceed $1.0 million. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend assets lives are not capitalized, but rather expenses as incurred. The State possesses certain capital assets that have not been capitalized and depreciated, because the assets cannot be reasonably valued and/or the assets have inexhaustible useful lives. These assets include wor ks of art and historical treasures, such as statues, monuments, historical documents, paintings, forts, miscellaneous State capitol-related artifacts and furnishings. These assets are held for public exhibition, education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than for financial gain; they are protected, kept unencumbered, cared for and preserved; and they are subject to an organizational policy that requires the proceeds from sales of collection items to be used to acquire other items for collections. Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed. Interest incurred during the construction phase of capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capitalized value of the assets constructed. Property, plant, equipment, and software of the primary government and component units is depreciated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives: Primar y Component Government Unit Asset Years Years Buildings and Building Improvements 10 - 40 15 - 75 Land Improvements 20 N/A Furniture and Equipment 3 - 12 3 - 40 Vehicles 7 N/A Software 5 N/A 46State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 The State has elected to use the modified approach to account for certain infrastructure assets. Under this process, the State does not record depreciation expense nor are amounts capitalized in connection with improvements to these assets, unless the improvements expand the capacity or efficiency of an asset. Utilization of this approach requires the State to: 1) commit to maintaining and preserving affected assets at or above a condition level established by the State, 2) maintain an inventory of the assets and perform periodic condition assessments to ensure that the condition level is being maintained, and 3) ma ke annual estimates of the amounts that must be expended to maintain and preserve assets at the predetermined condition levels. Roads and bridges maintained by the Department of Transportation are accounted for using the modified approach. Advances from Federal Government During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the amount of unemployment insurance taxes collected by the Division of Unemployment Insurance from Delaware employers was not sufficient to cover the amount of benefits paid to Delaware residents. As a result, the unemployment fund received advances from the federal government to be used for benefit payments. Pursuant to Subchapter XII - Advances to State Unemployment Funds, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71321, advances are made to the unemployment fund once all funds in the trust have been extinguished, and amounts borrowed must be no more than the aggregate amount necessary to provide benefit payments in any three-month period, as certified by the Federal Secretary of Labor. These advances must be repaid when funds become available in the Unemployment Fund. Interest accrues daily, and the interest rate varies, based upon the outstanding balance of the loan. Interest is due annually on September 30 and is to be paid using appropriations from the State General Fund. Total accrued interest was $1.5 million as of June 30, 2013 and a corresponding receivable due from the State General Fund has been accrued accordingly. The outstanding advance balance totaled $71.5 million as of June 30, 2013. For the year ended June 30, 2013, $20.1 million was received in advance largely for Health and Human Services and Education programs and is recorded in the Federal Fund. Compensated Absences It is the State's policy to permit employees to accumulate earned, but unused vacation and sick pay benefits. In the governmental fund financial statements, liabilities for compensated absences are accrued when they are considered \"due and payable\" and recorded in the fund only for separations or transfers that occur before year-end. In the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements, the State has accrued a liability for compensated absences, recognizing the obligation to ma ke future payments. Long-Term Obligations In the government-wide financial statements and proprietary fund financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental activities, business-type activities, or proprietary fund statement of net assets. 47State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Bond premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs, are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the effective interest method. Bond issuance costs are reported as deferred charges and amortized over the term of the related debt. In the fund financial statements, governmental funds recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as bond issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as expenditures. Fund Equity In governmental fund types, fund equity is called \"fund balance.\" Fund balances are reported as nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, or unassigned as described in note 16. The State Constitution provides that certain excess unencumbered budgetary general funds at the end of a fiscal year must be placed in a reserve account (the Budgetary Reserve Account). This account, designed to mitigate the operational im pact of any future unanticipated deficits may not exceed 5% of the estimated general fund revenue for the ensuing fiscal year. Total funding of the budgetary reserve account was $198.9 million at June 30, 2013. When resources meeting more than one of the classifications (excluding nonspendable) are commingled in an account, assuming that expenditure meets the constraints of the classification, the assumed order of spending is restricted first, committed second, assigned third and finally unassigned. In proprietary funds, fund equity is called net position. Net position is comprised of three components: net investment in capital assets; restricted; and unrestricted. (d) Grants Federal grants and assistance awards made on the basis of entitlement periods are recorded as intergovernmental receivables when entitlement occurs. All other federal reimbursement type grants are recorded as accounts receivable when the related expenditures or expenses are recognized. Related revenue is recorded subject to availability in the governmental funds. Amounts not collected within 60 days of fiscal year-end are recorded as deferred revenue in the governmental funds. (e) Litigation Revenue In 1997, several states began litigation against defendant tobacco product manufacturers to recover certain amounts the states expended to provide health care to the users of tobacco products. In 1998, a settlement was reach ed which provided that the states cease litigation against the manufacturers. As part of the Master Settlement Agreement, certain manufacturers agreed to remit periodic payments to the states until 2025. The State's share of the estimated $200 billion settlement amounted to $774.5 million. Amounts to be remitted 48State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 are calculated based on a variety of specific settlement provisions. Future tobacco product sales are one k ey factor used in determining periodic payment amounts. A receivable of $13.5 million has been recorded pursuant to the settlement. The Master Settlement agreement receipts of $26.3 million are recorded in the general fund as part of other revenue and as miscellaneous general revenue on the government-wide statement of activities. Expenditures of monies received under the Master Settlement Agreement are authorized by legislation and are dedicated to health care and related programs. (f) Management Estimates The preparation of the basic financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to ma ke estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the basic financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 2 CASH, INVESTMENTS AND RESTRICTED ASSETS Cash Management Policy and Investment Guidelines The State Treasurer maintains the majority of the deposits and investments of the primary government and uses professional money managers to invest the State's deposits according to guidelines set in the Statement of Objectives and Guidelines for the Investment of State of Delaware Funds (the Policy) by the State's Cash Management Policy Board (the Board). The Board, created by State law, establishes policies for, and the terms, conditions, and other matters relating to, the investment of all money belonging to the State except money in DPERS, the OPEB Trust and money held under the State deferred compensation program. By law, all deposits and investments belonging to the State are under the control of the State Treasurer in various pooled investment funds (State Investment Pool) except for those that, by specific authority, are under the control of other agencies or component units, as determined by the Board. The deposit and investment policies of those entities may differ from those of the State Treasurer. Typically, these agencies follow the deposit and investment policies of the State Treasurer in an effort to minimize deposit and investment risk s. As mandated by State statutes, the State's funds shall be invested pursuant to the prudent person standard as defined in the Policy. The prudent person standard allows the Board to establish investment policies based on investment criteria that it defines, and it allows the Board to delegate investment authority to investment professionals. This standard of care not only permits, but also encourages diversifying investments across various asset classes. The objectives and guidelines, as outlined in the Policy, apply to all cash and special purpose funds for which the State is financially accountable. These funds are categorized as outlined below: /g120 Cash Accounts. Cash accounts divide the State's available cash into three parts: 49State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 /g120 Collection and Disbursement Accounts: The State maintains an amount of cash in its general collection and disbursement accounts sufficient to meet its outstanding obligations. /g120 Cash and Liquidity Accounts: The majority of the State's cash balance available for investment is maintained in the cash and liquidity accounts. These accounts are managed and invested by investment managers, selected by the Board through competitive bid, in order to maximize the return to the State while, at the same time, providing for safety of principal and sufficient liquidity for the State to meet its cash needs. The State manages its short-term investments to ensure sufficient liquidity and prevent their premature sale for the purpose of covering expenditures. Short-term investments should mature at face value in sufficient amounts to meet any needs. /g120 Reserve Cash (Intermediate) Account: To the extent cash is not expected to be needed on short notice, the Board directs the funding of a third part. This account is managed and invested by an investment manager or managers, selected by the Board after a competitive bid, in order to maximize the return on said money to the State while providing for the safety of principal. The State manages its intermediate investments to ensure such investments are made under circumstances and in amounts in which the State would not be forced to liquidate them at a loss. /g120 Special Purpose Accounts. There are two primary types of special purpose accounts: /g120 Endowment Accounts: Endowment accounts consist of funds set-aside for specified purposes. /g120 Authority Accounts: The State's Authorities (state agencies, local school districts and component units) maintain a variety of fund types, including various operating funds, bond funds and debt service reserve funds. The Policy specifies the types of investments these managers can make; the maximum percentage of assets that may be invested in particular instruments; the minimum credit quality of these investments; and the maximum length of time the assets can be invested. The Policy provides, among other things, that no more than 10% of the entire portfolio may be invested in obligations of any one issuer other than the U.S. Government. The following investments are permissible for all funds under the review of the Board, subject to percentage limitations of the account: /g120 U.S. government securities /g120 Government agency securities /g120 Certificates of deposit, time deposits, and bankers acceptances /g120 Corporate debt instruments /g120 Repurchase agreements /g120 Reverse repurchase agreements /g120 Money mar ket funds /g120 Canadian treasury bills /g120 Canadian agency securities 50State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 /g120 Mortgage-backed and asset-bac ked securities /g120 Municipal obligations Additional permissible investments for special-purpose accounts only: /g120 Guaranteed investment contracts /g120 Asset-back ed securities and trust certificates The primary government's accounts are categorized as \"authority accounts\". At June 30, 2013, investments of the primary government were primarily in commercial paper, corporate obligations, government agency bonds and notes, and municipal obligations. All of these meet the objectives defined by the Policy. The State's Cash Management Policy Board Statement of Objectives and Guidelines for the Investment of State of Delaware Funds is available by request through the Office of the State Treasurer. Risks The following deposits and investments disclosure of the primary government excludes the OPEB Trust and DPERS, including the Investment Trust, which are described on pages 57 - 61. Custodial Credit Risk Deposits For deposits, custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, the deposits or collateral securities may not be recovered from an outside party. All State deposits are required by law to be collateralized by direct obligations of, or obligations, which are guaranteed by, the United States of America, or other suitable obligations as determined by the Board, unless the Board shall find such co llateralization not in the best interest of the State. The Board has determined that certificates of deposit and time deposits must be collateralized, unless the ban k issuing the certificate has assets of not less than $5 billion and is rated not lower than \"B\" by Fitch, Inc. Bank Watch. The Board has also determined that State demand deposits need not be collateralized, provided that any ban k that holds these funds has had for the last two years a return on average assets of 0.5% or greater and an average equity-capital ratio of at least 1:20. If the ban k does not meet the above criteria, collateral must consist of one or more of the following: /g120 U.S. Government securities; /g120 U.S. Government agency securities; /g120 Federal Home Loan Board letters of credit; /g120 State of Delaware securities; or /g120 Securities of a political subdivision of the State with a Moody's Investors Service rating of \"A\" or better. At June 30, 2013, the carrying amount of the primary government's deposits was $517.5 million 51State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 and the ban k balance was $571.0 million. Of the $571.0 million bank balance, $131.0 million was fully insured; $22.8 million represents unemployment insurance taxes collected from Delaware employers that are held in escrow by the U.S. Treasury; and the remaining $417.2 million was subject to custodial credit risk because they were uninsured and uncollateralized. Included in the primary government's deposits are agency funds. The carrying amount of the agency fund's deposits was $28.7 million and the bank balance was $31.1 million. Of the $31.1 million bank balance, $21.1 million was fully insured and the remaining $10.0 million was subject to custodial credit risk because the deposits were not covered by depository insurance or the deposits were uncollateralized, collateralize d with securities held by the pledging financial institutions, or collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution's trust department or agent but not in the government's name. Of the primary government's bank balance of $571.0 million, $386.3 million is part of the Treasurer's cash pool and the remaining balance represents outside ban k accounts of the primary government. State law permits the Treasurer to deposit in a financial institution in the State in which the Treasurer has custody if the deposit is interest bearing; the financial institution provides collateral that has a mar ket value that exceeds the amount by which a deposit exceeds the deposit insurance, and a custodian holds the collateral. Investments Custodial credit risk for investments is the ris k that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty to a transaction, the value of the investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party may not be recovered. Investments are exposed to custodial credit ris k if the securities are uninsured, are not registered in the name of the government, and are held by either the counterparty or the counterparty's trust department or agent but not in the government's name. At June 30, 2013, the primary government's investments were $2,311.1 million. Of the primary government's investments, $412.0 million was fully insured and collateralized. Included in the primary government's investments of $2,311.1 million are agency funds. The amount of the agency funds' investments was $28.0 million. The following table provides information on $1,899.1 million of the primary government's investments that are exposed to custodial credit ris k; $1.6 million of this amount represents the agency funds' investments: Investment TypeFair Value (Expressed in Thousands) Certificates of Deposit 64,289 $ Commercial Paper 113,424 Corporate Obligations 372,385 U.S. Government Obligations 1,115,219 Municipal Obligations 12,319 Other Obligations 221,479 1,899,115 $ 52State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate ris k is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Also, the terms of a debt investment may cause its fair value to be highly sensitive to interest rate changes. The State manages interest rates using the segmented time distribution and effective duration methods. The State approves and contracts with different investment managers of fixed income securities in order to manage the exposure to interest rate risk with each different manager focusing on different goals of yield periods or duration of maturities of their particular portion of the investment pool. The Policy provides either maturity or duration limitations for the various investment pools. The interest rate ris k inherent in the portfolio is monitored by measuring the weighted average maturity and/or duration. Effective duration measures the expected change in value of a fixed income security for a given change in interest rate. This method tak es into account the li kely timing and amounts of variable cash flows for bonds with call options and prepayment provisions. The following table presents the fair value and effective duration of the primary government and agency fund investments by investment type at June 30, 2013: Investment Type Treasurer's PoolOutside Treasurer's PoolTotal Investments (Expressed in Thousands) Effective Duration (In Years) Corporate Obligations 372,385 $ - $ 372,385 $ 1.61 Municipal Obligations $ 417,841 $ 2,311,103 $ Although the Policy does not limit total portfolio maturities, it provides maximum maturity restrictions for each of the investment account types as described below: /g120 Cash Account Investment. The maximum maturity for any investment at the time of purchase for the cash account is one year. /g120 Liquidity Accounts. The maximum maturity for any investment at the time of purchase for the liquidity accounts is two years. /g120 Reserve Cash (Intermediate) Account. The maximum maturity for any investment at the time of purchase is 10 years. The maximum average maturity of the portfolio is seven years. /g120 Endowment Accounts. The maximum maturity for any investment at the time of purchase is 10 years. The maximum average maturity of the portfolio is seven years. The Board shall consider tailoring maturity res trictions to meet specific purposes for endowment accounts to be established in the future. /g120 Authority Operating, Bond and Debt Service Reserve Fund Accounts. Maturity 53State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Restrictions: The maximum maturity for any investment at the time of purchase is 10 years, except when prudent to match a specific investment instrument with a known specific future liability, in which case the maturity limitation shall match the maturity of the corresponding liability. As of June 30, 2013, the primary government and agency funds had the following debt investments and maturities: Fair Value Less Than 1 1 to 5 6 to 10 More than 10 Long Term Investments Corporate Obligations Corporate Bonds 332,389 $ 150,327 $ 177,460$ 4,602 $ - $ Asset-Bac Securities 3,881 36,115 - - Municipal Obligations 12,319 401 11,303 - 615 U.S. Government Obligations U.S. Treasury Bonds, Notes 499,630 658 488,559 10,413 - U.S. Agency Bonds, Notes Obligations 133,415 154 - Pooled Investments 160,768 160,768 - - - Short Term Investments Commercial Pape r 197,115 196,621 494 - - Certificate of Deposit 65,670 65,670 - - - U.S. Government Obligations U.S. Treasury Bonds, Notes 325,072 290,281 9,932 24,859 26,181 $ Investment MaturitiesInvestment Maturity (Expressed in Thousands) Credit Risk Credit risk of investments is the ris k that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The Policy requires that the State's investments in asset-bac ked securities be rated AAA by a major rating agency. Corporate debt instruments must be rated by Standard and Poor's Ratings Services (S & P) and/or Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and/or Fitch Ratings (Fitch) as follows: Investment S & P Moody's Fitch Commercial Paper A-1 P-1 F1 Senior Long-Term Debt A A A Corporate Bonds AA Aa AA Additionally, the State has multiple non-rated/pooled accounts which represent immaterial amounts when treated individually. The Board permits the types of investments which are held in these accounts. 54State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 The following table presents the State's investments which were rated by S & P as of June 30, 2013 the ratings are presented using S & P's rating scale: Investment Type TOTAL AAA AA A A-1 NR Long Term Investments Corporate Obligations Corporate Bonds 332,389 $ 24,033 $ 215,623 $ 92,733 $ - $ - $ Asset-Bac ked Securities 39,996 23,357 - - - 16,639 Municipal Obligations 12,319 - 11,392 753 - 174 U.S. Government Obligations U.S. Treasury Bonds, Notes 499,630 - 499,630 - - - U.S. Agency Bonds, Notes 253,901 - 253,901 - - - Other Obligations Pooled Investments 160,768 - - - - 160,768 Short Term Investments Certificate of Deposit 65,670 - 4,339 30,277 - 31,054 Commercial Paper 197,115 - - - 185,157 11,958 U.S. Government Obligations U.S. Treasury Bonds, Notes 325,072 - 325,072 - - - U.S. Agency Bonds, Notes 183,252 - 183,252 - - - Total Investments 2,311,103 $ 79,612 $ 1,621,474 $ 134,023 $ NR = Non-Rated Pooled accountsCredit Risk - Quality Ratings (Expressed in Thousands) Concentration of Credit Risk Concentration of credit risk is the ris k of loss attributed to the magnitude of the State's investments in a single issuer (5% or more of total investments). When investments are concentrated in one issuer, this concentration represents heightened ris k of potential loss. No specific percentage identifies when concentration ris k is present. The investments in obligations explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, mutual funds, and other pooled investments are exempt from disclosure. The Policy provides the following percentage of account limitations, valued at mar ket. Investments due to mature in one business day may be excluded from the computation of said limitations. A. U.S. Government - no restrictions. B. Government agency - 50% total; 20% in any one agency. C. Certificates of deposits, time deposits and ban kers acceptances - 50% total; 5% in any one issuer. 1. Domestic - No additional restrictions. 2. Non-domestic - 25%, 5% in any one issuer. 55State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 3. Delaware domiciled - Not more than the lesser of $10 million or 25% of an issuer's total equity capital may be invested in any one issuer. (Investments due to mature in one business day may be excluded from the computation of this percentage.) D. Corporate debt - 50% total; 25% in any one industry; 5% in any one issuer, 5% of any issuer's total outstanding securities. 1. Domestic - No additional restrictions. 2. Non-Domestic - 25%; 5% in any one issuer. E. Repurchase agreements - 50% total. F. Reverse repurchase agreements - 25% total. G. Money mark et funds - 25% total; 10% in any one fund except for the Cash Account, which may invest 100% of the Account in the Delaware Local Government Investment Pool (DELGIP) Fund. The Investment Guidelines for the DELGIP Fund are defined in Appendix B of the Policy. H. Canadian treasuries - 25% total; 10% in any one agency. I. Canadian agency securities - 25% total; 10% in any one agency. J. Mortgage-back ed and asset-back ed securities - 10% total (when combined with asset- back ed securities and trust certific ates if applicable). K. Municipal obligations - 5% in any one issuer. L. Guaranteed investment contracts - Permitted where it is prudent to match a specific investment instrument with a k nown specific future liability, subject to credit quality guidelines for commercial paper and corporate bonds and debentures and with adequate exit provisions in the event of the future downgrade of the issuer. M. Asset-back ed securities and trust certificates - 10% total (when combined with mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities if applicable). At June 30, 2013, the State's investments have met the requirement of all the State's laws and policies, when applicable. There were no obligations that represented 5% or more of the primary government's investments, except for U.S. government securities, pooled and mutual funds. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency ris k is the risk that changes in the foreign exchange rate will adversely impact the fair value of an investment or deposit. The Policy only permits investments denominated in U.S. dollars; therefore, the State's 56State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 investments are not exposed to foreign currency ris k. Commitments At June 30, 2013, the State did not enter into any commitment agreements with any investment managers for future funding of various asset classes. OPEB Trust Fund (OPEB Trust) Investment Policy The State Board of Pension Trustees is responsible for the management and investment of the funds in the OPEB Trust. The Board authorized its Investment Committee to select the investment managers of the OPEB Trust following the established investment guidelines for the Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System (DPERS) until a separate investment policy is adopted for the OPEB Trust. The System follows the prudent person standard, which requires fiduciaries to discharge their duties solely in the interests of part icipants and their beneficiaries with such care, skill, prudence, and diligence as a person acting in lik e circumstances would exercise in the conduct of an enterprise with similar character and with similar aims. The OPEB Trust investment objectives and policies currently include indexed exposure to approximate the System's policy benchmark . The Investment Committee regularly reviews the OPEB investment performance, and considers investment vehicles which stri ke a balance between risk and return while being mindful of the government's time horizon for the OPEB investments. Of the OPEB Trust's investment balance of $187.6 million, all is invested in three mutual funds and are not in individual investments registered in the Trust's name. For the fixed income type of mutual fund, the investments in maturities is in government agencies and hold a maturity of six to ten years at a fair market value of $76.2 million with a AA credit rating. The foreign equities type of mutual fund represents $35.8 million of balance of the trust. These are denominated in US Dollars and are invested in no individual country but an international region. The other $75.6 million is in an equity index fund. Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System (DPERS or System) Investment Policy There are no State statutes limiting allowable investments for the System. The investment decisions are dictated by the prudent person rule and the internal investment guidelines established by the Board as outlined below: /g120 Allocate a minimum of 20% of assets to fixed income investments such as bonds, cash equivalents, and certain real estate investments /g120 Maintain a widely diversified portfolio, to minimize the ris k of overexposure in any one market segment or investment style /g120 Monitor the performance of all investment managers using specific benchmar ks /g120 Control exposure in illiquid asset classes /g120 Review, re-examine, and reconfirm the operation of results of the investment process regularly 57State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 /g120 Identify new long-term opportunities for risk reduction and improved investment returns /g120 Review actuarial assumptions to ensure consistency with capital mar ket expectations For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, management of the System has operated in accordance with these policies, in all material respects. Securities Lending The System entered into a contract with its custodian to allow participation in its securities lending program. The objective of securities lending is to earn income through a conservatively operated and well-controlled program. The System elected not to participate in the program during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, but may elect to participate at some time in the future. Investments The following is a listing of fixed income investments and cash equivalents and related maturity schedule which shows the System's exposure to interest rate ris k as of June 30, 2013. It is the System's policy to classify corporate convertible bonds as equity securities because those securities generally convert to preferred equity interests upon maturity. Corporate convertible bonds in the amount of $671.6 million have been included in the chart below because they have maturity dates and are exposed to interest rate ris k. Fair Less Investment T ype/Sector Value than 1 1 - 6 6 - 10 10 + Asset Bac ked Securities $ 375 $ - $ 26 $ 349 $ - Cash Equivalents 340,320 340,320 - - - Commercial Mortgage-Bac ked 1,466 1,466 Corporate $ 379,336 $ 1,023,950 $ 1,104,901 $ 256,877 Investment Maturities (in Years )Delaware Public Em ployees' Retirement S ystem (DPERS or S ystem ) (Expressed in Thousands ) Interest Rate Risk The State has delegated an investment policy for the System to the Board and its Committees. The Investment Committee sets its own guidelines in conjunction with the Board to manage and review the System's exposure to fluctuating interest rates. Interest rate ris k is a consideration when establishing and reviewing investment manager guidelines and asset allocation. Both topics are included in the Statement of Investment Policies and Objectives which is published on the System's website. 58State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Credit Risk The System's general investment policy is to apply the prudent-person rule to all ris ks incurred by the fund: Investments are made as a prudent person would be expected to act, with discretion and intelligence, to seek reasonable income, preserve capital and, in general, avoid speculative investments. The System has no investment policy that would further limit its investment choices related to credit risk. As of June 30, 2013, the System's fixed income investments and cash equivalents had the following credit ris k characteristics as indicated in the following schedule (expressed in thousands): Moody's Ratings Percent of Market or Comparable Total Fund Value AAA to A 17.9% $ 1,450,682 BBB to B 10.5% 850,709 CCC to 0.5% 37,726 Agency of the Government 0.1% 6,014 Not Rated 5.2% 419,933 Total 34.2% $ 2,765,064 Custodial Credit Risk For deposits, custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, the deposits or collateral securities may not be recovered from an outside party. At June 30, 2013, the $435.3 million carrying amount of the System's cash and cash equivalents was comprised of $417.1 million of short-term investments and $18.2 million in deposits. Of the $18.2 million in deposits, $17.5 million was subject to custodial credit ris k because it was uninsured and uncollaterized. The remaining $687 thousand was held as pooled deposits by the State Treasurer's Office. Investment Concentration Risk As of June 30, 2013, the System held no concentration of investments in an individual issuer in excess of 5% of the fair value of the System's net assets. Management Fees The System paid $27.4 million in management fees to the venture alternative investment funds and partnerships for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. These fees are netted against investment income. Management fees charged at the underlying fund level for the investments held by the First State Independence Fund I, LLC ranged from 1% to 2% of net assets, plus a performance fee of 20% on positive investment earnings, which were netted against earnings. Investment Commitments The System has commitments to invest up to an additional $779.2 million in venture capital limited partnerships in varying amounts as of June 30, 2013, to be drawn down, as called upon at any time during the term of each partnership, which is usually a ten-year period. Generally, these 59State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 commitments are self-funding, in that the capital calls are met using cash flows generated by the existing venture capital/limited partnerships as managers in this asse t class realize the proceeds of their investments. Foreign Investments Foreign investments include equity securities, bonds, cash, and cash equivalents. The following is a listing of the System's foreign assets as of June 30, 2013. The listing includes $6.5 million of investments of domestic issuers which have been classified as domestic, but are denominated in a foreign currency.

In June 1994, the Board adopted a formal written policy on the use of derivatives which is reviewed periodically and policy, as amended, was incorporated in the formalized investment policy adopted by the Board. This was during fiscal year 2007 and reviewed during fiscal year 2008. Some selected managers are permitted to use derivatives. In every case, the types of derivatives used and limits on their use are stated in the manager's contract and are monitored on an ongoing basis. Derivatives serve a variety of useful purposes for the System, including the reduction of foreign exchange ris k, the minimization of transaction costs and as a means of implementing value added strategies to enhance returns. If the use of derivatives in a portfolio strategy results in some leverage, that leverage is never permitted to expose the Fund to a loss greater than the amount committed to that strategy. 60State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 The following lists principal categories of derivatives and their uses during the year: Category Purpose Foreign exchange forward con tracts Hedge currency ris k of investments denominated in foreign currencies; enhance return Exchange traded futures contracts Reduce transaction costs; hedge equity mar ket risk; control fixed income; counterbalance portfolio duration; enhance return Exchange traded options contracts Enhance return; reduce transaction costs Total return equity swaps Hedge equity mar ket ris k exposure Generally, derivatives are subject both to market risk and counterparty risk. The derivatives utilized by the System typically have no greater risk than their physical counterparts, and in many cases are offset by exposures elsewhere in the portfolio (for example, a short S&P 500 futures contract partially hedging a long position in S&P 500 securities). Counterparty risk, the risk that the \"other party\" to a contract will default, is managed by utilization of exchange traded futures and options where practical (in which case the futures exchange is the counterparty and guarantees performance) and by careful screening of counterparties where use of exchange traded products is impractical or uneconomical. Derivative securities are priced and accounted for at their fair value. For exchange traded securities such as futures and options, closing prices from the securities exchanges are used. Foreign exchange contracts are valued at the price at which the transaction could be settled by offset in the forward markets. The Investment Committee monitors the System's deriva tive holdings on a regular basis to ensure that the derivatives used by managers of the System will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. Total derivative instruments at June 30, 2013 were not material to the system. Risk and Uncertainty The System invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, mar ket, and credit risk s. Due to the level of ris k inherent in investment securities, it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such change could affect the amounts reported. Discretely Presented Component Units Diamond State Port Corporation (DSPC) At June 30, 2013, the carrying value and the ban k balances of the DSPC's deposits were $5.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Of the ban k balances, $250 thousand is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The remaining amount is not collateralized by the banks as the banks meet the criteria set by the State under the collateralization requirements. 61State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 DSPC's assets restricted for capital improvements were $19.9 million at June 30, 2013. These assets are invested in a mutual funds account with a Moody's rating of Aaa. Delaware State University (DSU) At June 30, 2013, the carrying value and bank balances of DSU's deposits were $18.6 million and $20.6 million, respectively. An additional $16.5 million of cash and cash equivalents related to unexpended State appropriations are held by the Office of the State Treasurer. There was no portion of the University's investment portfolio, excluding U. S. Government guaranteed obligations, which exceed 5% of the portfolio and there was no portion of the University portfolio that was invested in below investment grade securities. The University's $8.0 million in fixed income investments was not rated as of June 30, 2013 using the Standard and Poor's rating scale. DSU's investments at quoted mar ket value were $16.9 million at June 30, 2013. In addition, DSU's two discretely presented component units' investments at quoted mar ket value were $18.5 million at June 30, 2013. Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) As of June 30, 2013, the carrying value and the ban k balances of DSHA's deposits were $44.8 million and $46.1 million, respectively, all of which are insured by the FDIC. Investment Policies DSHA has an investment policy that encompasses all moneys related to the issuance of bonds, as well as all funds otherwise held by DSHA. DSHA see ks first and foremost to ensure safety of principal, and secondly, to attain the highest possible return available given the ris k constraints. DSHA is allowed to invest in certain qualified investments as defined by amended Subchapter II, Section 4013, Chapter 40, Title 31, of the Delaware Code and DSHA's formal investment policy. Subject to certain limitations, such as the credit ratings on bonds and the capitalization level of depositories, \"qualified investments\" include: a. Obligations of or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. or Delaware state governments. b. Obligations of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities. c. Obligations of depositories and other financial institutions. d. Bankers' acceptances. e. Commercial paper. f. Money mar ket mutual funds. g. Corporate debt obligations. h. The State of Delaware investment pool with the State Treasurer's Office. i. Other investment arrangements made pursuant to an investment agreement authorized by a resolution of DSHA. Certain federal funds administered by DSHA are subject to additional limitations within the 62State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 qualified investments listed above. For those investments in the State of Delaware Investment Pool, the fair value of the pool shares is the same as the carrying value of the pool shares. The State of Delaware Cash Management Policy Board provides oversight for this pool. Securitized mortgage loans consist of Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) mortgage bac ked securities, which were pooled and securitized by a contract servicer utilizing Single Family Mortgage Program loans purchased by DSHA. Investments Investments are presented at fair value. Fair values are determined by quoted mar ket prices based on national exchange prices for all investments, except for the State of Delaware Investment Pool. The State pool is valued based on the pool's share price. The table below lists the investments and the related maturities: Interest Rate Risk As a means of limiting its exposure to fair value losses arising from rising interest rates, the DSHA's investment policy places limits on maturities for the various funds as follows: a. Single Family Program Funds: Investment contracts for bond program funds should have a maturity that matches the final bond maturity to minimize reinvestment risk . Individual investments of bond program funds should match anticipated cash requirements or Investment Less Type Fair Value than 1 1 - 5 5 - 10 10 - 20 20 - 30 U.S. Treasur y Notes $ 11,627 $ 3,350 $ 8,125 $ - $ 208 $ - US Treasur y Strips 548 360 8 - 259 - U.S. Treasur y Bonds 26 - - - 19 - U.S. A gencies 20,278 6,510 13,275 - - 37 8 Commercial Pa per 5,398 5,410 - - - - Corporate Notes 14,776 1,000 13,750 - - - Investment Agreements 630 - - - 266 364 Mone y Mar ket Savin gs Accounts 15,564 15,564 - - - - Bank Mone y Mar ket Accounts 25,168 25,168 - - - - State of Delaware Investment Pool 10,736 10,736 - - - 752 742 Securitized 606,955 - - - - 5 78,910 Total Investments & Securitized Mortgage Loans $ 711,706 $ 68,098 $ 35,158 $ - $ 752 $ 579,652 Investment Maturities (in Years) (Expressed in Thousands) Book Value 63State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 provide sufficient liquidity to allow funds to be accessed to meet bond resolution requirements without incurring material principal losses. b. Federal Program Funds: HUD funds held by DSHA should have a maximum maturity of one year. HUD-related funds held by DSHA (escrows, replacement reserves, residual receipts) shall have a maximum maturity of three years. c. General Fund: The Operating Reserve Account, which is managed externally, should have a maximum maturity at the time of purchase of ten years. However, specific investments may be transferred into the account from time to time that may have a longer maturity. DSHA may further reduce the maximum maturity of the operating reserve investments from time to time. d. Other DSHA funds should be invested with a maturity that matches, or is prior to, the anticipated time at which the funds will be needed. e. DSHA investments (other than deposit accounts, money mar ket fund shares, or deposits with the State Treasurer's Office) should have a fixed maturity date by which principal and accrued interest will be fully repaid. DSHA is not permitted to enter into investments that have an expected maturity date that can be extended, depending upon mar ket conditions. Credit Risk DSHA's general investment policy is to mak e investments with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. DSHA's investment policy limits its investment choices as mentioned above under Investments. For DSHA's Single and Multi-Family Programs, the investment rating must be equal or exceed the bond rating. DSHA's Operating Reserve Account has a specific credit quality requirement. Corporate debt obligations and shares of money market mutual funds shall have a long-term rating of AA and/or AA, respectively by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's at the time of purchase. As of June 30, 2013, DSHA's investments were rated as follows: 64State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 U.S .

Of DSHA's $104.8 million investment balance, $600 thousand represents deposits held by various Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) providers under investment agreements. These accounts are uninsured and uncollateralized. The funds are specifically ide ntified for DSHA, but the custodial credit ris k cannot be categorized for these funds. Credit ris k for such investments depends on the financial stability of the GIC provider whose rating must equal or exceed that of the bond rating. The ban k and savings money markets must be collateralized at 102% or greater by securities pledged and identified as held in DSHA's name. Although the State Investment Pool is not collateralized, the State's Cash Management Policy Board requires that investments in the pool meet certain ratings, investment types and maturity criteria. DSHA's investment policy does not limit the amount of securities that can be held by the counterparties. NOTE 3 RECEIVABLES All trade, loan and tax account receivables are recorded net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. In the governmental fund financial statements, receivables that will not be available within 60 days of year-end are recorded as unearned revenue. Taxes receivable represent the amount of personal, business, and other taxes determined to be measurable at June 30, 2013. Uncollectibility for taxes receivable primarily results from identified assessment problems, inability to locate taxpayers, and accounts of decedents. The State levies taxes on real property through its school districts. Each of the three counties of the State establishes the assessed values of real estate and bills and collects its own property taxes. Local school property taxes are levied by local school districts based on the assessed value of real estate, as determined by county taxation formulas. Taxes are levied on July 1 and are 65State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 payable on or before September 30. Taxes paid after the payable date are assessed a 6% penalty for nonpayment and 1% interest per month thereafter. Taxes are billed and collected by the counties with funds remitted to the local school district to be used for the local share of school operating costs and debt service on general obligation bonds issued for capital improvements. Receivables as of year-end for the State's individual funds, including the applicable allowances for uncollectible accounts, are as follows: General Federal Local School Total Fund Funds District Funds Receivables Receivables: Taxes $ 213,726 $ - $ 34,859 $ 248,585 350,796 457,369 Loans and Notes 50,423 261,836 - 312,259 Intergovernmental - Federal Grants 120,628 Total Receivables 614,945 488,692 Doubtful (400,839) Total Receivables, Net $ 214,106 $ 393,854 $ 35,030 $ 642,990 for Collection During the Subsequent Yea r $ 103,810 $ 246,571 $ 22,471 $ 372,852 Receivables - Primar y Government (Expressed in Thousands ) Amounts not Scheduled Governmental Activities/ Governmental Funds Total Unem ployment Lottery DelDOT Receivables Receivables: Taxes $ 49,444 $ - $ - $ 49,444 - - 536 536 138,976 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (39,834) (734) - (40,568) Total Receivables, Net $ 42,295 $ 11,070 $ 45,043 $ 98,408 for Collection During the Subsequent Year $ - $ - $ - $ - Receivables - Primar y Government (Expressed in Thousands ) Amounts not Scheduled Business-T ype Activities/Pro prietar y Funds 66State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Unearned Revenues Governmental funds report unearned revenue in connection with receivables for revenues that are not considered to be available to liquidate liabilities of the current period. Governmental funds also defer revenue recognition in connection with resources that have been received, but not yet earned. Amounts considered unearned federal grant drawdowns are reported as unearned revenue. The various components of unearned revenue and advances reported at year-end in the governmental funds are as follows: Unavailable Taxes Receivable $ 84,409 Loans and Notes Receivables 308,793 Intergovernmental 24,711 Accounts Receivables 45,715 Subtotal Unavailable 463,628 Advances Advance Par k Reservation Fees 1,024 Federal Grant Advance Drawdowns 20,062 Subtotal Advances 21,086 Total Unearned Revenue $ 484,714Unearned Revenues (Expressed in Thousands) Discretely Presented Component Units Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) Total receivables as of June 30, 2013 are as follows: Receivables: Mortgage Loans $ 258,946 Accrued Interest 50,391 Other Receivables 726 Grants Receivable 281 Total Receivables 310,344 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (1,077) Total Receivables, Net $ 309,267 for Co llection Dur ing the Subsequent Year $ 265,107 (Expressed in Thousands) Amounts not Scheduled 67State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Mortgage loans receivable which total $258.9 million consist of single family and multi-family loans and are collateralized by first, second or third mortgages on the properties and in limited instances are guaranteed by corporate sponsors. Interest rates on the loans vary from 2.99% to 12.43% and loan maturities are between one and forty years depending on the type of mortgage loan issued. NOTE 4 INTERFUND BALANCES AND TRANSFERS (a) Due To/From to Other Funds Receivables reported as \"due from other funds\" and the related payables reported as \"due to other funds\" represent amounts owed to State organizations by other organizations within the State primary government. Amounts receivable from or payable to other levels of government are reported as intergovernmental receivables or payables and are expected to be repaid within one year from the date of these financial statements. The composition of due from/due to balances at June 30, 2013, expressed in thousands, is as follows: The amounts due from the Federal Fund are recorded for borrowings to eliminate negative balances in the State Investment Pool. The amount for the Federal Fund is created by expenditures relating to reimbursement type federal grant revenues. These costs result in a negative balance in the State Investment Pool. The amounts due to the Federal Fund are for reimbursements for grant expenses for over expending federal government grants. The amount due to the Lottery Fund (reported as an internal balance on the statement of net position), represents overpayments of profits required by law to be transferred to the General Fund. The amount due to the Unemployment Fund is from interest that the General Fund owes the Unemployment Fund due to an overpayment of a temporary borrowing. (b) Transfers In From/Out to Other Funds Transfers in and transfers out from/to other funds in the statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balance and the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position, proprietary funds represent transfers between funds. Transfers are used to 1) move revenues from the fund that statute requires to collect them to the fund that statute requires to expend them, 2) use restricted revenues collected in the General Fund to finance various programs accounted for in other funds in accordance with budgetary authorizations, 3) move profits from the Lottery Fund, as required by State law, and 4) move bond proceeds from Amount $ 20,922 Federa l 16,833 Primary Governmen t 1,524 677 Receivable d Payable Fun d l Genera Genera lGovernmental Funds 68State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Capital Projects to the General Fund to cover expenses paid by the General Fund. A schedule of transfers in and transfers out for the year ended June 30, 2013 is presented below (expressed in thousands): NOTE 5 GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS General obligation bonds have been authorized and issued primarily to provide funds for acquisition and construction of capital f acilities for State administrative operations, public and higher education, public and mental health, corrections and conservation purposes and for maintenance and construction of highway facilities. The State Constitution provides that the State may issue general obligation bonds for specific purposes in amounts approved by the General Assembly. The enabling acts pursuant to which the bonds are issued provide that all bonds issued shall be direct obligations of the State; that is, the bonds are secured by the pledge of the full faith and credit of the State. General obligation bonds are redeemed over a period not to exceed 20 years, generally from available resources in the general fund. Accordingly, the State has generally issued 20-year serial bonds with equal amounts of principal maturing each year. Bonds outstanding have call provisions providing for early redemption at the option of the State, generally beginning 8 or 10 years following the date of issue in the inverse order of maturity, in whole or in part, at redemption prices not to exceed 100% of par value. On February 28, 2013, the State issued $336.3 milli on of its general obligation bonds maturing between February 1, 2024 and February 1, 2033. Of the $336.3 million issued, Series A Bonds, at $111.3 million, were issued to refund higher priced bonds resulting in a net present value savings of $14.4 million, or 11.7% of the principal refunded. Series B Bonds, at $225.0 million, were issued as new money. The bonds of both series bore coupons of 2% and 5% and yield between .16% and 2.93%. The refunding Series 2013 resulted in an economic gain of $13.3 million and a debt service cash savings over the next nine years of $14.4 million. Bonds issued and outstanding totaled $1,755.0 million at June 30, 2013. Of this amount, $545.7 million is supported by property taxes collected by the local school districts. During fiscal year 2013, the local school district funds transferred $64.3 million of property tax revenue to the State to meet the required debt service on their share of the debt.

In prior years, the State has defeased certain general obligation bonds by creating separate irrevocable trust funds. New debt has been issued or cash appropriated and the proceeds have been used to purchase U.S. government securities that were placed in the trust funds. The investments and fixed earnings from the investments are sufficient to fully service the defeased debt. Accordingly, the debt has been considered defeased and has been removed as a liability from the government-wide financial statements. At June 30, 2013, a total of $355.6 million of defeased bonds were outstanding. NOTE 6 REVENUE BONDS Revenue Bonds The State Constitution empowers certain State agenci es and authorities to issue bonds that are not supported by the full faith and credit of the State. These bonds pledge income derived from acquired or constructed assets or some other stream of revenues to retire the debt and pay related interest. Primary Government In August, 2011, pursuant to the Delaware Energy Act, 29 Del. C. \u00a78059, the Sustainable Energy Utility, Inc. (the \"SEU\"), a Delaware nonprofit corporation created by and for the benefit of the State issued $67.4 million of its Sustainable Energy Utility, Inc. Energy Efficiency Revenue Bonds, Series 2011 (the \"SEU Bonds\"). Interest rates on bonds outstanding range from 2.0% to 5.0%. Of the total amount, $56.2 million of the SEU Bonds were issued to finance energy conservation measures for multiple State agencies and the remaining amount of $11.2 million was issued on behalf of Delaware State University. Under separate Installment Payment 71State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Agreements, each agency and Delaware State University, is obligated to ma ke installment payments to the SEU in accordance with the Energy Performance Contracting Act, 29 Del. C. \u00a76971. Further, each agency and Delaware State University separately entered into Guaranteed Energy Savings Agreements with various energy services companies, which guaranteed that the savings achieved will be sufficient to cover the financing costs associated with the SEU bonds upon completion of the energy conservation measures. In the event that savings are not realized, the energy services companies will be held responsible for the deficiency. The SEU Bonds are limited obligations of the SEU, secured by the trust estate and payable only from amounts appropriated by the State that are eligible for payment under the Installment Payment Agreements. No funds appropriated to any agency for any purpose are available to pay the Installment Payments of any other agency or Delaware State University. The final maturity of the SEU bonds is September 15, 2034. As of June 30, 2013, $28.4 million of the SEU Bonds issued to finance projects at State agencies was unspent and held by Citiban k, the bond underwriter. (Expressed in Thousands) Fiscal Year Principal Interest Total 2014 1,635 $ 2,549 $ $ Sustainable Energy Utility Revenue Bonds DelDOT Fund Delaware Transportation Authority (Authority) The Authority is subject to oversight by the DelDOT and is included in the DelDOT Fund. The Authority assists in the implementation of the State's plans and policies regarding the coordination and development of a comprehensive, balanced transportation system for the State. It has the power to develop a unified system of air, water, vehicular and specialized transportation in the State. The Authority includes the Transportation Trust Fund and the Delaware Transit Corporation. The Secretary of the Department of Transportation, with consent of the Governor, appoints the Authority's Director. To assist the Authority in financing a unified transportation system, the State created a 72State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Transportation Trust Fund (the Trust Fund) within the Authority which receives all receipts of the Authority. The primary sources of funding of the Trust Fund are motor fuel taxes and motor vehicles fees imposed and collected by the State and deposited in the Trust Fund, and revenue from the Delaware Turnpike, which the Authority owns and operates. The Authority also has the power to issue bonds, with legislative authorization, to finance improvements to the State's transportation system. Debt issued by the Authority does not constitute a debt of the State or a pledge of its general taxing power or of its fu ll faith and credit. Rather, the outstanding revenue bonds are obligations of the Authority payable solely from and secured by a pledge and assignment of certain tolls and revenues such as motor fuel tax revenue, motor vehicle document fees, and motor vehicle registrations. The Authority may apply Trust Fund revenue in excess of debt service requirements for transportation projects, subject to legislative authorization, and may pledge any or all of this revenue to secure financing for these projects. The Authority has defeased various bond issues by creating separate irrevocable trust funds. New debt has been issued and the proceeds have been used to purchase U.S. government securities that were placed in the trust funds. The investments and fixed earnings from the investments are sufficient to fully service the defeased debt until the debt is called or matures. For financial reporting purposes, the debt has been considered defeased and is therefore not reported as a liability.

The bonds are due on October 1, 2017 and are secured by un-appropriated gross revenues of the University. The Bond Trust Indenture requires the University to maintain a debt service reserve fund equal to the maximum annual debt service on all bonds outstanding under the Indenture.

As of June 30, 2012, $3.1 million including less than a million of unamortized bond discount remained outstanding on the 1999 Revenue Bonds. The refunding of the callable portion of the Series 1999 Bonds resulted in a net present value savings of $.1 million.

Johnson Controls, Inc. guaranteed that the savings achieved will be sufficient to cover the financing cost associated with the bond, upon completion of the energy upgrades to various buildings and systems throughout the University. In the event that the savings are not realized, Johnson Controls, Inc. will be responsible for the amount of that deficiency.

It is the policy of the State not to purchase commercial insurance to cover these risks. Instead, State management believes it is more economical to manage its ris k internally and thus, covers all claim settlements and judgments out of its general fund. The State continues to carry commercial insurance for all other risk s of loss, including general liability and the remainder of the property and casualty liability. There have been no significant reductions in insurance coverage from prior years. In the past three years of insured coverage, settled claims have not exceeded commercial coverage. Claim liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Because actual claim liabilities depend on such complex factors as inflation, changes in legal doctrines and damage awards, the process does not result in an exact amount. Claim liabilities are reevaluated annually to ta ke into consideration recently settled claims, the frequency of claims and other economic and social factors. The management of the State estimates that the amount of actual or potential claims against the State at June 30, 2013, for wor kers' compensation, automobile accident and health-care claim liabilities is $207.8 million. The claim liabilities relating to health-care totaling $41.9 million have been recorded as accrued liabilities in governmental activities. The liability for wor kers' compensation and automobile accident liabilities totaling $165.9 million has been recorded in governmental activities as claims and judgments. The current portion of these claims totals $37.4 million. Other claim liabilities relating to police professional malpractice and property and casualty were not recorded at June 30, 2013 as the total of these liabilities were not material to the financial statements. Changes in the balances of claim liabilities during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Governmental Activities: General Government 25,527 $ Health and Children's Services 6,239 Judicial and Public Safet y 14,630 Natural Resources and Environmental Contro l 4,352 Labo r9 9 Educatio n 60,854 Total Governmental Activities 111,701 $ Business-type Activities: DelDOT 25,332 $ Total Depreciation Expense Business-type Activities 25,332 $ (Expressed in Thousands)Depreciation Expense 88State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Current Year Beginnin g Claims and Endin g Fiscal Balance Chan ges in Actual Claim Balance Year July 1 Estimates Pa yments June 30 2012 $ 176,929 $ 639,514 $ (617,548) $ 198,895 2013 $ 198,895 $ 640,376 $ (631,434) $ 207,837 Chan ges in Claim Liabilities (Expressed in Thousands) DelDOT The Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC) maintains coverage on auto insurance through both the retention of risk and the purchase of commercial insurance.

NOTE 14 OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (OPEB) Plan Description On July 1, 2007, the Delaware OPEB Trust Fund (OPEB Trust) was established pursuant to Section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code and separate from the DPERS. The OPEB Trust is administered by the DPERS Board of Directors. Policy for and management of the OPEB benefits provided to retirees are the responsibility of the State. No stand-alone financial report is issued for the OPEB Trust. The OPEB Trust is a single-employer defined benefit plan. The OPEB Trust provides retirement medical coverage to pensioners and their eligible dependents in the State Employees', Judiciary, New State Police, and Closed State Police pension plans. The State of Delaware has elected to assume the OPEB liability on behalf of employees who participate in the State's pension plan but are employed at outside agencies including Delaware State University, University of Delaware, Delaware State Housing Authority, Delaware Charter Schools and Delaware Solid Waste Authority. Due to this assumption, the State is a single employer defined benefit plan. Membership of the plan consisted of the following at June 30, 2013: Retirees and Beneficiaries Receiving Benefits 19,863 Terminated Plan Members Entitled to But Not Yet Receiving the Benefits 2,575 Active Eligible Plan Members 36,316 Total 58,754 Substantially all State employees become eligible for post retirement benefits if they reach retirement age while wor king for the State. The costs of providing these benefits are shared between the State and the retired employee. The plan provisions are as follows: 89State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Eligibility: State Employees: Early Retirement: Age 55 with 15 years of service or any age with 25 years of service Normal Retirement: Age 62 with 5 years of service or age 60 with 15 years of service or any age with 30 years of service Benefits: During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the State provided health insurance options through several providers. Spouse and Survivor Coverage: Both are available under any of the plan options with similar retiree contributions. Employee Contributions: If hired prior to July 1, 1991, no contributions are required. If hired on or after July 1, 1991 (except disability pension), contributions depend on years of service. Retiree Contributions (hired on or after July 1, 1991): Years of Service Percent of Premium Paid b y State Less than 10 0% 10 - 14 50% 15 - 19 75% 20 or more 100% Funding Policy The State of Delaware funds the OPEB Trust for current retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis along with funding for future benefits at a rate that is approved in the annual budget, but not actuarially determined. Additional funding has also been provided on an ad hoc basis. By State Statute Chapter 52, Title 29 of the Delaware Code, contribution requirements of plan members and the government are established and may be amended by the State Legislature. Funds are recorded in the OPEB Trust for the payment of retiree health care claims and administrative and investment expenses. Administrative costs are financed through investment earnings. State appropriations, other employer contributions, and retiree contributions for health care are recorded in the OPEB Trust. The funds available are invested under the management of the DPERS Board of Pension Trustees, which acts as the Board of Trustees for the OPEB Trust and is responsible for the financial management of the OPEB Trust. 90State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Contributions The contribution rates for the employer and retiree are established annually by the budgeting process of the State. Those rates include an employer contribution based on projected pay-as-you-go financing requirements as a percent of covered payroll, with an additional amount to prefund benefits, which is not actuarially determined. For fiscal year 2013, the State contribution in relation to the annual required contribution (ARC) totaled $193.1 million. Retiree contribution rates are affected by the retiree date of hire, with eligible retirees hired after June 30, 1991 paying a proportionately higher rate if their years of service total less than 20. Retiree contributions for health coverage totaled $7.4 million. Annual OPEB Cost and Net OPEB Obligation The State's annual OPEB cost is calculated based on the annual required contribution (ARC) of the employer, an amount which is actuarially determined. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities over a period of thirty years. Amounts \"required\" but not actually set aside to pay for these benefits are accumulated as part of the net OPEB obligations. The following table shows the components of the State's annual OPEB obligation for fiscal year 2013 and 2012, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and the State's net OPEB obligation (dollar amounts in millions): Governmental Business-T ype Total Activities Activities * Net OPEB Obligation at June 30, 2011 1,317.1 $ 1,204.1 $ 113.0 $ Annual Required Contribution 563.8 515.0 48.8 Adjustment to Required Contribution 1,672.4 157.3 Employer Contributions (187.3) at June 30, 2012 1,642.4 $ 1,496.5 $ 145.9 $ Governmental Business-Type Total Activities Activities * Net OPEB Obligation at June 30, 2012 1,642.4 $ 1,496.5 $ 145.9 $ Annual Required Contribution 483.8 440.4 43.4 at June 30, 2013 1,852.9 $ 1,682.0 $ 170.9 $ * This column includes DTC's OPEB activity.

The actuarial accrued liability for benefits was $5,988.0 million, and the actuarial value of assets was $222.0 million, resulting in an unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) of $5,766.0 million for the primary government. The covered payroll (annual payroll of active employees covered by the plan) was $1,944.0 million, and the ratio of the UAAL to the covered payroll was 297%. Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the basic financial statements, will present information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood by the employer and the OPEB plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the employer and plan members to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce the effects of short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations. In the June 30, 2013, actuarial valuation, the entry age normal actuarial cost method was used. Investments are valued at mar ket fair value. The actuarial assumptions included a 4.25% investment rate of return, which is a blended rate of the expected long-term investment returns on plan assets and on the State's own investments calculated based on the funded level of the plan at the valuation date, and an initial medical inflation rate of 4.25% with an ultimate rate of 4.25%. The UAAL is being amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll on a level percent open basis over 30 years using a 3.25% rate of salary increase. Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC) In June 2010, the Delaware Transit Corporation OPEB Trust Fund (the DTC OPEB Trust) was established pursuant to Section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code. The DTC OPEB Trust is 92State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 administered by DTC. Policy for and management of the OPEB benefits provided to retirees are the responsibility of DTC. No stand-alone financial report is issued for the DTC OPEB Trust. Plan Description DTC provides continuation of medical insurance coverage to employees that retire. Based on collective bargaining agreements, any full-time employee is eligible to participate in the plan if the employee retires after meeting the eligibility requirements, which are: 1) age 65 with 5 years of service or after wor king for 25 years for contract employees or 2) age 55 with 10 years of service or age 62 with five years of service for noncontract employees. Disabled employees must reach eligibility. Surviving spouses of participants are allowed access to the plan and receive the same subsidy as retirees. DTC subsidizes the medical premium. The subsidized percentage is 90% of published rates for retirees less than age 65 and 100% for retiree's age 65 or greater. DTC subsidizes 100% of the dental and vision coverage for noncontract employees. Contract employees are allowed to access to dental and vision coverage, but must pay the full premium. Life insurance is provided to retirees. Retirees under age 70 receive $6,000 in coverage. Once the participant reaches age 70, the coverage drops to $5,000. DTC must contribute $0.23 per month per $1,000 of coverage for each employee. The numbers of participants are 799 active employees and 158 retirees as of June 30, 2013, the effective date of the other post-employment benefit (OPEB) actuarial valuation report. Funding Policy DTC funds the DTC OPEB Trust on a pay-as-you-go basis with additional funding on an ad hoc basis. Funds are recorded in the DTC OPEB Trust for the payment of retiree healthcare claims and administrative and investment expenses. Administrative costs are financed through investment earnings. Employer contributions and retiree contributions for healthcare are recorded in the DTC OPEB Trust. The funds available are invested under DTC's management, which acts as the Trustee and is responsible for the financial management of the DTC OPEB Trust. The cash basis costs associated with these benefits was $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Annual OPEB Cost and Net Obligation DTC's annual OPEB cost (expense) is calculated based upon the annual required contribution (ARC) of the employer, an amount which is actuarially determined. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover the normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities (or funding excess) over a period not to exceed 30 years. The following table shows the components of DTC's OPEB cost for the year, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and changes to DTC's net OPEB obligation (expressed in thousands): 93State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Annual Required Contribution 16,072 $ Interest on Net OPEB Obligation 2,434 Adjustment to Annual Required Contribution (2,835) Annual OPEB Cost (Expense) 15,671 Contributions Made (1,194) Increase in Net OPEB Obligation 14,477 Net OPEB Obligation - Beginning of Year 61,021 Net OPEB Obligation - End of Year 75,498 $ DTC's annual OPEB cost, the percentage of annual OPEB cost contributed to the plan, and the net OPEB obligation is as follows (expressed in thousands): Fiscal Year Annual Percentage of Net Ended OPEB Annual OPEB Cost OPEB June 30 Cost Funded Status and Funding Progress As of July 1, 2012, the most recent actuarial valuation date, the Plan was 1.4% funded. The actuarial accrued liability was $121.6 million and the actuarial value of the assets was $1.7 million, resulting in an unfunded actuarial accrued liability of $119.9 million. The covered payroll (annual payroll of active employees covered by the plan) was $34.5 million and the ratio of the UAAL to the covered payroll was 347.1%. Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about the future.

The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations. In the July 1, 2012 actuarial valuation, the projected unit credit method was used with linear pro-ration to assumed benefit commencement. The actuarial assumptions included a 4.0% investment rate of return, 3.0% payroll growth rate, a 2.5% inflation rate, and a healthcare cost trend rate of 8.0% initially, incrementally down to 5.9% after 10 years. The ultimate healthcare cost trend rate 94State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 will remain constant at 4.2% after 2098. The unfunded liability is being amortized as a level percentage of payrolls over a 30-year closed amortization period. NOTE 15 PENSIONS Pension Plans The State Board of Pension Trustees (Board) administers the following plans/funds (the Plans) of the Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System (DPERS) as described State Police Plan; /g120 Judiciary Pension Plans (Closed and Revised); /g120 County & Municipal Police and Firefighters' Pension Plans; /g120 County & Municipal /g120 Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Fund; /g120 Diamond State Port Corporation Pension Plan; and /g120 Closed State Police Pension Plan. With the exception of the Diamond State Port Corporation Pension Plan, the State's General Assembly is responsible for setting benefits and contributions and amending plan provisions; administrative rules and regulations are adopted and maintained by the Board. The Board of Directors for the Diamond State Port Corporation is responsible for setting benefits and contributions and amending their plan provisions. The Plans of DPERS are considered part of the State's financial reporting entity and are included in the accompanying financial statements as pension trust funds in the fiduciary funds. All of the investment assets of the plans and funds, with the exception of the Closed State Police Pension Plan and the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Fund, are pooled and invested in a common DPERS Master Trust (Master Trust). Each of the plans or funds share in the Master Trust based on funds contributed and earnings or losses allocated. Individual investments in the Master Trust are not specifically identified to the various plans or funds. Additionally, the following non-DPERS retirements funds/plans, described below, have been established under the custody of the Board for investment purposes only: /g120 County & Municipal Police and Firefighters' COLA Fund; /g120 Post-Retirement Increase Fund; /g120 Delaware Local Government Retirement Investment Pool. The Delaware Local Government Retirement Investment Pool (DELRIP) is presented separately as investment trust funds in the fiduciary funds statement of net position and statement of changes in net position. The remaining non-DPERS retirement funds/plans are included in the pension trust fund. 95State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Non-DPERS Fund Descriptions and Contributions County & Municipal Police and Firefighters' COLA Fund During 1990, the State passed legislation which established a mechanism for funding post-retirement increases granted by employers who participate in the County & Municipal Police and Firefighters' Pension Plans. This mechanism allows the State to appropriate funds separate to a cost of living adjustment fund (COLA Fund) managed by the Board. The funds are generated by a 0.25% tax on the value of insurance premiums written within the State. The proceeds of the tax are transferred to the State and local governments on a per member basis. In 1994, the New State Police Plan began receiving funding for post-retirement increases from the Post-Retirement Increase Fund. Since that time, funds calculated for the State Police membership were re-directed into the COLA Fund. In accordance with Section 708 (c), Title 18 of the Delaware Code, when a participating employer grants a post-retirement increase for a plan outside of the DPERS County & Municipal Plans, funds are transferred from the COLA Fund to the employer. The participating employer must provide funds to match the State's contribution. Allocated funds that are unused will be reverted to the State General Fund. Post-Retirement Increase Fund (PRI) The State passed legislation which established a mechanism for funding ad hoc post-retirement increases granted by the General Assembly to members retired under the State Employees' Plan, the New State Police Plan, and the Judiciary Plans (Closed and Revised) beginning in fiscal year 1994. The mechanism allows the State to appropriate actuarially determined employer contributions to a separate PRI fund managed by the Board. The actuary uses the current actuarial assumptions, methods, and population data to calculate the estimated additional liability resulting from the potential benefit increases. When the Legislature grants an ad hoc post- retirement adjustment, funds are transferred from this PRI fund on a monthly basis based on a five-year actuarial funding schedule to the appropriate pension plan from which the additional benefits are disbursed. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, $26.6 million was transferred to the appropriate plans in DPERS. As of June 30, 2013 recently granted post-retirement increases have outstanding liabilities totaling $106.1 million, which will be funded by the State and transferred to the appropriate plans over the next four fiscal years as follows: Expressed in Fiscal Year Thousands 2014 $ 27,536 2015 28,521 2016 29,542 2017 20,536 Total $ 106,135 The Board adopts actuarially determined funding for the Post-Retirement Increase Fund. Funding for fiscal year 2013 was 1.49% of covered payroll. Funding for fiscal year 2014 will be 1.51%. 96State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 Local Government Retirement Investment Pool (DELRIP) In June 1996, the State established DELRIP in the custody of the Board to allow local governments the option to pool their pension assets with the System for investment purposes. The DELRIP is an external investment pool that allows local governments within the State to potentially maximize their rate of return and reduce administrative expenses related to the investment of funds. Participation in the pool is voluntary. There were three participating entities in DELRIP as of June 30, 2013, which comprise the pool in its entirety: Sussex County and the Towns of Elsmere and Newport. DELRIP is subject to the oversight of the System's Investment Committee and not subject to the regulatory oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The System has not provided or obtained any legally binding guarantees during the year to support the value of shares. The fair value of the shares in the pool is determined in the same manner as the value of the Master Trust shares. Since this pool is a portion of the total System, the same accounting and investment policies apply.

The Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC), a subsidiary public corporation of the Delaware Transportation Authority, contributes to two single-employer defined benefit plans consisting of the Contributory Pension Plan and the Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC) Pension Plan. Each plan provides retirement, disability and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Each plan issues a publicly avai lable financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information. Financial data for these plans has not been included in the fiduciary statements due to immateriality.

Classifications include: /g120 Nonspendable . Balances include items that cannot be spent. This includes activity that is not in a spendable form (inventories, prepaid amounts, long-term portion of loans/notes receivable, or property held for resale unless the proceeds are restricted, committed or assigned) and activity that is legally or contractually required to remain intact. /g120 Restricted. Balances have constraints placed upon the use of the resources either by constitutional provisions, enabling legislation, external resource providers such as creditors, grantors, or imposed by law or regulations of other governments. /g120 Committed . Balances can be used only for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by a formal action of the Delaware Legislature, the State's highest level of decision-ma king authority. This formal action is the passage of law by the legislature, or other parties named by the State's legislature, creating, modifying, or rescinding an appropriation. /g120 Assigned. Balances include amounts that are constrained by the State's intent to be used for a specific purpose, but are neither restricted nor committed. For the General Fund, amounts constrained for the intent to be used for specific purpose by a governing board or a body or official that has been delegated authority to assign amounts that varies by organization within the state. For governmental funds, other than the General Fund, this is the residual amount within the fund that is not restricted or committed. /g120 Unassigned. Balance is the residual amount of the General Fund not included in the four categories described above. Also, any deficit fund balances within the other governmental fund types are reported as unassigned. 109State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 A summary of governmental fund balances at June 30, 2013, is as follows (expressed in thousands): Local Total School Capital Governmental General Federal District Projects Funds Nonspendable Inventories 7,681 $ - $ - $ - $ 7,681 $ Total Nonspendable 7,681 - - - 7,681 Restricted: Health and Children's Services 6,939 - - - 6,939 Judicial and Public Safety 9,251 - - - 9,251 Natural Resources and Environmental Control 81,044 - - - 81,044 Agriculture 225 - - - 225 Labor 8,719 - - - 8,719 Education 3,886 - 294,276 160,982 Economic Development 536 - - 536 Other 3,818 - - - 3,818 Total Restricted 114,418 - 294,276 160,982 569,676 Committed - Health and Children's Services 44,756 - - - 44,756 Judicial and Public Safety 6,212 - - - 6,212 Natural Resources and Environmental Control 31,643 - - - 31,643 Agriculture 15,053 - - - 15,053 Labor 4,009 - - - 4,009 Education 8,680 - - - 8,680 Economic Development 82,521 - - - 82,521 Other 16,683 - - - 16,683 Total Committed 209,557 - - - 209,557 Assigned Health and Children's Services 2,768 - - - 2,768 Judicial and Public Safety 3,818 - - - 3,818 Natural Resources and Environmental Control 5,385 - - - 5,385 Agriculture 11,171 - - - 11,171 Education 51,851 - - - 51,851 Economic Development 122 - - - 122 Other 16,482 - - - 16,482 Total Assigned 91,597 - - - 91,597 Unassigned (Deficit) 1,025,284 (914) - - 1,024,370 Total Fund Balance 1,448,537$ (914) $ 294,276 $ 160,982 $ 1,902,881 $ Fund Balance Restricted by Enabling Legislation The restricted Fund Balance for the Local School Districts Fund are funds that are used to account for activities relating to Delaware's 19 local school districts, which are funded by locally raised real estate taxes and other revenues. The total amount in the fund was $294.3 million at June 30, 2013. 110State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 NOTE 17 AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS The State Lottery is a member of the Multi-Sta te Lottery Association ( MUSL), which operates online games on behalf of participating state lo tteries. Each MUSL member sells game tic kets through its agents and makes weekly wire transfers to the MUSL in an amount equivalent to the member's share of the estimated grand prize liability. Each MUSL member pays lesser prizes directly to the winners. The MUSL operates the Powerball games, as well as the Powerplay feature associated with Powerball, and also operates the Hot Lotto game. Participating lotteries are required to maintain deposits with MUSL for contingency reserves to protect MUSL from unforeseen prize liabilities. The money in this reserve fund is refundable to MUSL members if the MUSL disbands or if a member leaves the MUSL Board. The amount the Lottery had on deposit with the MUSL, as of June 30, 2013 was $2.4 million. This amount is also reported as a liability on the Lottery's balance sheet because it represents the amount to be paid to the State upon separation from the MUSL if the MUSL is not required to use a portion of the Lottery's reserves held by the MUSL. Complete separate financial statements for the MUSL may be obtained at the Multi-State Lottery Association, Suite 210, and 1701 48 th Street, West Des Moines, IA 50266-6723. NOTE 18 COMMITMENTS Primary Government The State has entered into various contractual commitments that control for services and for construction of various highway, capital and lottery projects. Commitment of the proprietary fund includes $253.2 million for DelDOT. Encumbrances which represent commitment related to unperformed contracts for goods or services are included in restricted, committed, or assigned fund balance, as appropriate. Encumbrances lapse at the end of the applicable appropriation, unless re-appropriated by the Legislature. Encumbrances outstanding against continuing appropriations at the end of fiscal year 2013 are as follows: general fund $148.9 million, federal funds are $17.9 million, local school district funds are $5.7 million and capital project funds are $30.0 million. Discretely Presented Component Units Diamond State Port Corporation (DSPC) DSPC has various contracts for construction and renovation of significant facilities in accordance with the Capital Budget approved by its Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2013, DSPC had $19.9 million in cash and cash equivalents committed to capital projects. 111State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 NOTE 19 CONTINGENCIES Various parties have made claims against the State. For those cases in which it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred and in which the amount of the potential judgment can be reasonably estimated, the State estimates the liability to be $4.8 million. The State recognized $1.3 million in governmental activities as claims and judgments liabilities for pending litigation settlements estimated to be probable as of June 30, 2013. In the opinion of the Attorney General of the State, however, the remaining cases are either subject to a valid defense or are not expected to result in an impairment of the State's financial position. Management believes the settlement in aggregate of claims outstanding will not result in amounts material to the financial statements of the State. The State receives significant financial assistance from the federal government in the form of grants and entitlements. The right to these resources is generally conditioned upon compliance with terms and conditions of the grant agreem ents and applicable federal regulations, including the expenditure of the resources for eligible purposes. Substantially all grants are subject to financial and compliance audits by the grantors. Any disallowances as a result of these audits become a liability of the State. The State does not believe that the liabilities that may result from such audits for periods through June 30, 2013 would have a material effect on its financial position or the results of operations. Site investigation, planning and design, cleanup and site monitoring are typical pollution remediation activities underway across the State. Several State organizations have dedicated programs, rules and regulations that routinely deal with remediation related issues; others become aware of pollution conditions in the fulfillment of their missions. The State has the knowledge and expertise to estimate the remediation obligations presented herein based upon prior experience in identifying and funding similar remediation activities. The State calculates pollution remediation liabilities using the expected cash flow technique. Where the State cannot reasonably estimate a pollution remediation obligation, it does not report a liability; however, the State has not identified any of these situations. The pollution remediation obligation estimates that appear in this report are subject to change over time. Cost may vary due to price fluctuations, changes in technology, changes in potential responsible parties, results of environmental studies, changes to statutes or regulations and other factors that could result in revisions to these estimates. Prospective recoveries from responsible parties may reduce the State's obligation. Capital assets may be created when pollution remediation outlays are made under specific circumstances. At June 30, 2013, the State had a total pollution remediation liability of $31.6 million, with an estimated potential recovery of $4.5 million from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The State Lottery has discharged its primary responsibility for payment of annual installments (generally 14 to 20 years) to winners of jackpots greater than $150,000 by purchasing annuities from private insurance companies. The Lottery remains liable for future periodic payments of deferred prize obligations (approximately $200 thousand at June 30, 2013) in the event that the annuity issuers default on their obligations. 112State of Delaware Notes to the Financial Statements, June 30, 2013 In fiscal year 2014 the State of Delaware has processed and paid $11.1 million of corporate income tax refunds as of November 30, 2013. Currently, there are corporate income tax refunds pending that total $136.8 million, an amount that is well in excess of the typical balance of refunds pending. The preponderance of the $136.8 million balance is attributable to fewer than five refund claims. These pending refund claims have been filed by taxpayers, but the validity of each of the claims has not been evaluated or determined as of the date hereof. Historically, the amount of refund claims for corporate income tax the State receives varies significantly from year to year. From fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2013, the corporate income tax refunds actually paid have ranged from a low of $17.8 million to a high of $52.9 million. The current budget projects total corporate income tax refunds of $45.6 million for fiscal year 2014 of which $40.0 million has been accrued for in the fiscal year. However, based on the current figures for this fiscal year, the potential continues to exist that the total corporate income tax refund claims may exceed the amount initially projected for the year. Based upon the claims received to date, the potential corporate income tax refund payments for fiscal year 2014 may now range from approximately $35.0 million to approximately $100 million. NOTE 20 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Discretely Presented Component Units Delaware State University (DSU or the University) The University entered into a $12 million, 15-year lease agreement with the owners of a local hotel with an option to buy any time after the second year. The lease on the 153 room facility, located a quarter-mile north of the campus, began on July 28, 2013 and will provide additional residential space for students as existing residential halls on campus are renovated and upgraded. NOTE 21 RESTATEMENT Discretely Presented Component Units Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) In prior years, securitized mortgage loans were carried at current principal amounts, which did not constitute fair value in accordance with GASB standards. The beginning net position as July 1, 2012 has been restated in the amount of $58.9 million due to recording these loans at fair value, as follows: Net Position as previously reported at June 30, 2012 365,990 $ Adjustment to record loans at fair mar ket value 66,827 Adjustment to record premiums and discounts on loans (7,896) Net Position as restated at July 1, 2012 424,921 $ DSH A (Expressed in Thousands ) 113 State of Delaware Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Required Supplementary Information 114NOTES TO REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION BUDGETARY REPORTING BUDGETARY BASIS VS. GAAP While GAAP requires the use of the fund structure described in Note 1(b), the State's budget system uses only a general fund and a sp ecial fund, each of which uses the basis of accounting described below. Additionally, the activities of the Delaware State Housing Authority and Delaware State University, both component units of the State, which are not substantially supported by tax revenues, are not included in the budget data. Reconciliation of the accrual adjustments necessary to convert budgetary basis information to GAAP basis is presented as Required Supplementary Information. The State Constitution requires the Governor to prepare and submit to the General Assembly a State budget for the ensuing year. The State budgets and controls its financial activities on the cash basis of accounting. In compliance with State law, the State records its financial transactions in either of two major categories - the general fund or the special fund. References to these two funds in this document include the terms \"budgetary\" or \"budgetary basis\" to differentiate them from the GAAP funds of the same name which encompass different funding categories. The General Assembly enacts the budget through the passage of specific line-item appropriations by department, the legal level of budgetary control, the sum of which must not exceed 98 percent of the estimated revenues and available unencumbered cash balance from the prior year pursuant to the State Constitution. The Governor has the power to approve or veto each appropriation passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may also enact supplemental appropriation or special appropriation bills after it completes action on the State's budget. The budgetary general fund provides for the cost of the State's general operations and is credited with all tax and other revenue of the State not dedicated to budgetary special funds. Certain special funds are subject to appropriation, referred to herein as budgetary or appropriated special funds. Unexpended appropriations at year-end are available for subsequent expenditure to the extent that they have been encumbered at that date or legislatively extended for another year. Budget data represents original appropriations modified by interdepartmental transfers, supplemental, continuing, and carried-over encumbered appropriations. Subsequent modifications to the budget require the approval of the Controller General and the Budget Director. Additional detailed information regarding compliance with the legal level on control can be obtained by contacting the Office of Management and Budget at (302) 739-4206. Summary information regarding individual department budgets and the compliance with the legal level of budgetary control is presented on the following pages. Encumbrance accounting is employed in budgetary funds. Encumbrances (e.g., purchase orders) outstanding at year-end do not constitute expenditures or liabilities and are reported as reservations of fund balances because the commi tments will be honored during the subsequent year. The budget schedules in Required Supplemental Information a) reflect the adjustments made to increase the special fund's excess of revenues over expenditures for certain revenue sources not previously recognized; b) eliminates the net activity of certain operations that are accounted for within both the special fund and also in the separate accounts of certain component units or 115agency funds that are not principally accounted for within the special fund; and c) presents the accrual adjustments necessary to convert budgetary basis information to GAAP basis. Statutory/Budgetary Presentation The Budgetary Comparison Schedule - Budget to Actual (Non-GAAP Budgetary Basis) presented on the following pages provides a comparison of the original and final legally adopted budget with actual data on a budgetary basis. The original budget and related estimated revenues represent the spending authority enacted into law by the appropriations bill as of June 30, 2013, and do not include encumbrances and multi-year projects budgetary carry-forwards from the prior fiscal year. GAAP requires that the final legal budget be reflected in the \"final budget\" column; therefore, updated revenue estimates available for appropriations as of the last Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (DEFAC) meeting in June 2013, as well as the amounts shown in the original budget, are reported. The final legal budget also reflects encumbrances and multi-year projects budgetary carry-forwards from the prior fiscal year. The tables on the following page represent the Budgetary Statements of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance - General and Special Funds. Also included is a schedule showing the budgetary fund balance designations for the General Fund. Of the $637.4 million budgetary general fund balance at June 30, 2013, $198.9 million is reserved for the budgetary reserve account and $276.4 million is designated as continuing and encumbered appropriations. The $162.1 million of undesignated fund balance, for the most part, is not available for new spending as these funds have been committed based on State statutes which are subject to review and change by the Legislature. 116(Expressed in Millions) Actual Variance with Actual Variance with Original Final Amounts Final Budget Original Final Amounts Final Budget Revenues Personal Income Taxes 1,086.2 $ 1,137.2$ 1,139.0$ 1.8 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ Business Taxes 1,787.6 1,787.1 1,751.2 (35.9) - - - - Other Taxes 173.8 167.6 162.1 (5.5) - - - - License, Permits, Fines and Fees 342.7 341.2 346.3 5.1 - - - - Rentals and Sales - - - - - - - - Interest Earnings 8.5 6.3 6.3 - - - - - Lottery Sales 248.1 236.8 235.3 (1.5) Grants - - - - - - - - Other Non-tax Revenue 50.2 Expenditures - - - Judic ial 90.3 91.6 91.4 0.2 9.8 134.5 25.4 112.4 112.4 50.0 62.4 37.3 38.8 41.3 (2.5) 29.6 29.6 29.1 100.5 103.2 (2.7) Legal 50.4 51.9 52.6 (0.7) 9.8 9.8 6.4 3.4 Department of State 24.2 24.0 23.8 0.2 47.8 47.8 48.7 (0.9) Department of Finance 17.7 18.5 20.4 (1.9) 99.7 99.7 108.4 (8.7) Department of Health & Social Services 1,049.0 1,062.4 1,061.9 0.5 106.3 106.3 112.6 (6.3) Department of to Children, Youth and Their Families 133.9 139.4 141.9 (2.5) 19.7 19.7 20.6 (0.9) Department of Corrections 257.8 264.8 265.0 (0.2) 4.2 4.2 2.9 1.3 Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control 35.2 44.3 44.6 (0.3) 96.4 96.4 48.8 47.6 136.2 144.0 144.3 (0.3) 18.3 18.3 15.1 3.2 Department of Transportation - - - - 346.4 346.4 349.9 (3.5) Department of Labor 7.8 7.9 7.9 - 13.7 13.7 12.3 1.4 Department of Agriculture 7.9 7.7 7.6 0.1 8.1 8.1 5.0 3.1 Department of Elections 4.0 3.9 6.5 (2.6) - - - - Fire Prevention Commission 5.0 5.3 5.0 0.3 2.6 2.6 1.9 0.7 Delaware National Guard 4.4 4.8 4.8 - - - - - Higher Education 215.9 224.6 226.7 (2.1) - - 1.0 (1.0) Department of Education 1,172.5 1,197.8 1,194.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 3.5 1.6 Total 3,658.5$ 19.7 $ 1,030.4 $ 1,030.4$ 928.5$ Excess of Revenues over Expenditures 153.5 52.9 71.2 18.3 - - 147.0 147.0 Budgetary Fund 566.2 - 630.7 630.7 630.7 End of Year 719.7 $ 619.1 $ 637.4 $ 18.3 $ 630.7$ 630.7 $ 777.7 $ 147.0 $ Budgetary Fund Balance Designated: Budget Reserve Account $ 198.9 Continuing and Encumbered Appropriations 276.4 Undesignated 162.1 Total $ 637.4 (See Budgetary Basis vs. GAAP in Notes to Required Supplementary Information)Budgeted AmountsGeneral Fund Special Fund Budgeted Amounts 117Statutory/Budgetary Reconciliations Since accounting principles applied for purposes of developing data on a budgetary basis differ significantly from those used to present financial statements in conformity with GAAP, a reconciliation is required of resulting basis, perspective and entity differences in the revenues in excess of (less than) expenditures and other financing sources (uses) between budgetary and GAAP presentations.

Under this alternative method, referred to as the modified approach, the State expenses certain maintenance and preservation costs and does not report depreciation expense. Assets accounted for under the modified approach include 4,378 centerline miles and 1,601 bridges that the State is responsible to maintain. The condition of the State's road pavement is measured using the Overall Pavement Condition (OPC) system, which is based on the extent and severity of various pavement distresses that are visually observed. The OPC system uses a measurement sca le that is based on a condition index ranging from 0.0 for poor pavement to 5.0 for pavement in good condition. The condition of bridges is measured using the \"Bridge Condition Rating\" (BCR) which is based on the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Coding Guide, \"Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges.\" The BCR uses a measurement scale that is based on a condition index ranging from 0 to 9, 0 to 4 for substandard bridges and 9 for bridges in good condition. For reporting purposes, substandard bridges are classified as those with a rating of 4 or less. The good or better condition bridges were ta ken as those with ratings of between 6 and 9. A rating of 5 is considered fair. This information is ta ken from past \"Bridge Inventory Status\" reports. It is the State's policy to maintain at least 85% of its highways at a fair or better condition level and 75% of its bridge systems at a good or be tter condition level. No more than 10% of bridges and 15% of roads should be in substandard condition. Condition assessments are determined every year for roads and every two years for bridges. Due to the timing of these condition assessments, information for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 is not available. 120BCR Condition Rating Numbe r Percent Numbe r Percent 1,151 71.9 1,149 72.3 1,137 72.8 Fair 53 34 20.9 322 20.2 313 20 Poor 0-4 116 7.2 120 7.5 112 7.2 Totals1 ,601 100 1,591 100 1,562 100 OPC Condition Square Square Square Rating Feet Percent Feet Percent Feet Percent Good 6-9 6,956,457 Center- Center- OPC Condition Line Line Line Rating Mile Percent Mile Percent Mile Percent Good 3.0-5.0 3,796 86.7 3,423 78.5 3,007 67.6 Fair 2.5-3.0 400 9.1 575 13.2 1000 22.5 Poor Below 2.5 182 4.2 362 8.3 440 9.9 Totals4 ,378 100 4,360 100 4,447 100 2013 2012 2011 d Actua l 233,810$ 285,923 $ 248,973$ *The estimated expenditures represent annual Bond Bill authorization.

The Bonds are issued as fully registered Bonds as provided in the Bonds and in a resolution of the Issuing Officers of the State adopted on October 22, 2014 (the \"Resolut ion\"). The Bonds are issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the State including Chapter 74, Title 29, Delaware Code, as am ended, and the Resolution. As Bond Counsel, we have examined a certified copy of the Reso lution and the form of the Bonds. We have examined originals (or copies certified or othe rwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments, certificates and documents as we have d eemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion rendered below. In such examination, w e have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us a s originals and the conformity to the original documents of all docum ents submitted to us as copies. We have relied on a certificate of the State as to the due exe cution and delivery of, and payment for, the Bonds. As to any facts material to our opinion we hav e, when such facts were not independently established, relied upon the aforesaid instruments, certificate s and documents including the State's Federal Tax Certificate dated the date of issuance of the Bonds, and th e statement of reasonable expectations of future events set forth in such certificate. We have not verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information set forth in any offering statement or other similar documents of the State deli vered to the purchasers or prospective purchasers of the Bonds, and we take no responsibility therefor . Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date h ereof and under existing law that: 1. The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered and constitute legal and valid general obligations of the State. 2. The State has pledged its faith and credit for the payment of t he principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Cons titution of the State does not contain any limitation upon the rate or amount of taxes which may be levied by the State for the paymen t of principal of and interest on the Bonds with the exception that any law which shall have the effe ct of increasing the rates of taxation on D-2personal income for any year or part thereof prior to the date of the enactment thereof, or for any year or years prior to the year in which the law is enacted, would be v oid. 3. Interest (including accrued original issue discount) on the Bonds is not includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation under e xisting statutes, regulations, rulings and court decisions. The opinion set forth in the preceding senten ce is subject to the condition that the State complies with all applicable federal income tax law requirement s that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest thereon continues to be excluded from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. Failure to comply with ce rtain of such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds to be includable in gross income retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. The State has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. Interest on the Bonds is not treated as an item of tax preference under Sec tion 57 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") for purposes of the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes; however, we call to your attention that under the Code, to the extent that interest on the Bonds is a component of a corporate holder's \"adjusted current earnings,\" a portion of that interes t may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opini on regarding other federal tax consequences relating to the Bonds or the receipt of interest thereon. 4. Under existing statutes, interest on the Bonds is exempt from p ersonal and corporate income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware. It is to be understood that the rights of the holders of the B onds and the enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, morat orium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and that their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of judicial dis cretion in appropriate cases. This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may her eafter come to our attention, or any changes in law that may hereafter occur.
