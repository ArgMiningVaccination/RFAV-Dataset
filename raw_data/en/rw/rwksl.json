Diverse exercise programs for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) produce similar outcomes, without one specific exercise protocol demonstrating clear superiority. One clear barrier to positive outcomes is poor exercise adherence. We suggest that there are certain common contextual factors present in all exercise prescription scenarios that may impact adherence and health-related outcomes. While challenging common core stability exercise prescription, we present an argument for enhancing and intentionally shaping the following contextual factors: the therapeutic alliance, patient education, expectations and attributions Cet article explore l'importance de consid\u00e9rer le mod\u00e8le les de prescrire des exercices.

Tout en communs de stabilisation tronc, succ\u00e8s ou de of low back pain Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. 1 Many individuals with a LBP episode will not be pain-free within a year, despite seeking care from a general practitioner or chiropractor. 2 Although many in- dividuals with acute LBP (pain for less than three weeks) see improvements over time; up to 73% will have a re-currence within 12 months. 3 Individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP; pain for greater than three months) also have poor outcomes; 60-80% of those seeking help will continue to have LBP after one year. 4 Data shows that dis- ability from back pain has increased since the late 1990's, despite advances in technology, improved imaging tech - niques, and a plethora of available passive interventions. 5 In light of this high burden, it is worthwhile to examine the effectiveness of CLBP treatments; including frequent - ly prescribed exercise programs. Prescribing exercise for CLBP Exercise is one of the few interventions for CLBP that has consistently been demonstrated to reduce pain and improve function. 6 Exercise alone or in combination with education is also an effective LBP prevention strategy.7 Although effect sizes for exercise are modest in reducing pain and improving function 8,9, it is a desirable part of a treatment program because it is a safe self-management technique that can be performed outside of the clinical environment. As a result, it is possibly the most cost-ef-fective and evidence-informed intervention currently available for CLBP. Unfortunately, while exercise can be effective, only a small percentage of patients with CLBP adhere to a prescribed exercise program, and poor adher -ence is associated with poor outcomes. 10,11 In other words, patients have to do the exercise to reap the benefit. While there are many potential barriers to exercise adherence in patients with CLBP, diagnostic uncertainty and fear of pain or harm are among the most commonly cited. 12 Clinicians often prescribe exercise for CLBP with a focus on biomechanics and the musculoskeletal system. This includes a focus on muscle strength, endurance, tim - ing, or mobility. Although targeting the musculoskeletal system can lead to physical changes, current evidence suggests that these changes do not correlate well with meaningful clinical outcomes 13,14 and these structured impairment-based programs may not facilitate long-term adherence 12. As outlined in the next sections, a contem - porary biopsychosocial approach to exercise prescription with an increased focus on clinician-patient communica - tion and contextual factors surrounding exercise prescrip-tion may improve adherence and patient outcomes. What type of exercise to prescribe? Despite years of research, the active agent in therapeutic exercise for CLBP is elusive and we also lack high qual-ity evidence to support the long-term effectiveness of one form of exercise over another for non-specific CLBP. 8,15- 25 This includes a comparison of programs focused on: general exercise, low back strengthening, increasing flexibility, improving motor control, Pilates, Yoga, and various forms of aerobic exercise. 8,15-25 To further com- plicate things, many clinicians, researchers, and patients may be looking in the wrong place for the beneficial ef-fect (i.e., the musculoskeletal system). In a systematic re-view of exercise therapy for non-specific CLBP, Steiger of therapeutic success or failure, and mastery or cognitive control over a problem. Overall, this commentary argues that to improve exercise adherence and outcomes in the CLBP population, the context in which exercise is delivered and the meaning patients embody need to be considered and shaped by clinicians. (JCCA. 2017;61(1):6-17) key words: chiropractic, low back pain, and colleagues concluded that the treatment effects are not directly attributable to changes in the musculoskel - etal system (e.g., muscle strength, mobility, or muscular endurance). 13 Their findings challenge long-held beliefs that exercise programs specifically targeting core stabil - ity/neuromuscular control have a regional structural or biomechanical impact and are key to successful CLBP rehabilitation. Furthermore, a systematic review of stud-ies of transversus abdominis training for LBP patients reported that changes in muscle morphometry or activa - tion were not associated with clinical outcomes. 14 They also found that the relationship between clinical improve - ments and changes in lumbar multifidus characteristics were unclear. 14 Another study found that even when indi- viduals with LBP were subgrouped and those with motor control impairments were identified, there was no addi-tional benefit to prescribing 'corrective' motor control impairment exercises compared to a general exercise pro-gram. 19 This finding is consistent with a recent Cochrane systematic review of studies of motor control exercises for non-specific CLBP which reported that no form of ex-ercise is superior to another. 21 Rather than only focusing on clinician-identified mus-culoskeletal impairments that have questionable rel-evance, we hypothesize that exercises for CLBP may be better selected and taught using a biopsychosocial ap-proach 26; considering patients' cognitions and self-identi - fied functional goals or meaningful movements that have been avoided due to provoked pain or the expectation of pain. This could be combined with encouraging patients to engage in regular exercise that they expect will help and that they personally enjoy (e.g., walking in nature or yoga with meditation etc.). This is consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) approach to disabil - ity, where a biopsychosocial approach is recommended, without making the mistake of \"...reducing the whole, complex notion of disability to one of its aspects\". 27 p.9 Un- fortunately, many exercise programs used in clinical prac-tice have deep-rooted patho-anatomic underpinnings that may be hard for clinicians to change from. The concern is that outdated or unfounded unidimensional tissue-based approaches that appear ubiquitous, ignore the current bio-psychosocial understanding of pain. 28 Using the example of core stability exercises for CLBP that are popular with chiropractors and other clinicians, the next section de-scribes how there may be drawbacks to the way they are widely explained and prescribed. In turn, the benefits of viewing exercise prescription through a contemporary bi-opsychosocial lens and harnessing the therapeutic context may be better appreciated. Questioning core stability exercise prescription Popular core stability exercise programs commonly focus on bracing or activating the trunk muscles that are be-lieved to support the spine. This includes exercises such as: crunches, planks, bird-dogs, or those aimed at spe-cifically targeting the transversus abdominis. While it is agreed that core stability/neuromuscular control are need-ed to perform activities of daily living, only low levels of muscle contraction that occur beyond conscious control are needed to stabilize the spine. 29,30 Meanwhile, current biomechanics literature demonstrates that individuals with LBP already have increased levels of abdominal and lumbar muscle activity 31, which persist despite symptom improvement32. With this increased muscle activity, it is of little surprise that patients with LBP have increased trunk stiffness 33, which is even higher in patients with kinesio- phobia34,35 and catastrophizing36. Although this increased muscle co-contraction and trunk stiffness may provide short-term protection, in the long-term it appears to be maladaptive as it can increase lumbar spine compression and limit movement. 33,37-39 Considering this evidence, we must question the value of core stability exercise pro-grams that promote bracing or excessively increasing trunk muscle activation, especially for CLBP patients that are exhibiting fear and guarding to avoid lumbar spine movement. Alternatively, many CLBP patients may be better instructed to perform trunk muscle relaxation tech-niques with movement, rather than trunk muscle activa - tion. 40 Indeed, many contemporary approaches to core stability focus on neuromuscular control, where patients are instructed to find a balance between movement and spinal stiffness to optimally perform a task. While this is a positive step away from programs promoting excessive bracing and stiffness; still, the relationships among pain, movement, and injury remain unclear 41 and the theories of dysfunctional neuromuscular control in patients with LBP continue to be challenged 19,42-45. Furthermore, the way core stability exercises are pre- scribed may be problematic, as it may create rather than reduce negative cognitions about the patient's back. A sys-tematic review by Smith and colleagues found that there is strong evidence that core stability exercises are not more effective than any other form of exercise in the long-term (pain or disability) and that the rationale provided for the need of core stability could increase fear-avoidance as compared to other exercises. 22 In addition, the Military (POLM) cluster randomized trial (n = 4,147) by George et al. 46 found, as compared to traditional lumbar exer - cises, there was no benefit of core stability exercises for preventing the onset of LBP that resulted in healthcare seeking. Instead, a brief psychosocial education program aimed at reducing fear and threat of LBP in combination with either exercise program resulted in lower two-year incidence of healthcare seeking for LBP. These studies suggest that the context of exercise prescription is import - ant. When anatomical explanations or words like spinal 'weakness' or 'instability' are used to explain why pa-tients get pain or continue to have pain, the meaning pa-tients embody may create and reinforce hyper-vigilance and enduring beliefs that the spine is vulnerable and in need of protection. 47-50 As clinicians focus on structural explanations for persistent pain, this presents a dilemma which is nicely summarized by Moseley (2003): \"How-ever, there is a vast body of evidence to the contrary; no-ciception is neither sufficient nor necessary to evoke pain and psychosocial factors are more important than physic-al factors in the development of chronic nonspecific pain. The latter finding is reflected in management guidelines for spinal pain throughout the world.\" 51 p.184 Furthermore, there is research suggesting that patients are actually quite unfamiliar with words such as 'instability' and 'muscle weakness', leading to misunderstanding. 52 This includes believing that their problem is permanent, it will progress, and that their spine can 'go' at any time - so they must remain on edge, expecting the worst and unable to relax. 52 As highlighted above, these beliefs may unconsciously produce more lumbar spine compression, fear-avoidance, and reduced range of motion. Once again, this demon-strates the importance of exploring the context of exer - cise prescription and considering the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. Common contextual factors If there are similar effect sizes and long-term outcomes for a large variety of exercise programs, this leads us to consider the context of exercise prescription. The context of exercise prescription may produce positive or negative effects, in addition to any specific exercise-derived mus-culoskeletal effects. A similar inquiry applied to psycho-therapy interventions led to what is now understood as common contextual factors that are therapeutically valu-able, possibly producing even more potent effects than those derived from specific intended interventions. 53,54 Common contextual factors are clearly not limited to just psychotherapy; they are also present in the clinical en-counters that chiropractors 55 and physiotherapists56 create with their patients - they are just not commonly appreci - ated or discussed. Placebo and nocebo effects While exercise behavior change is ultimately the respons-ibility of the patient, clinicians can have a significant im-pact because \"...with every utterance, the practitioner has the power to make things better or worse, and influence the outcome.\" 57 p.3 The concept of common contextual factors overlap with placebo and nocebo effects. As clin - icians work with patients, the context that is created can have a positive impact beyond the specific efficacy of the treatment intervention or natural fluctuations in pain and function. 58 This is commonly known also as the placebo effect. In contrast, clinicians can also promote a negative context and poor outcomes; the lesser-discussed nocebo effect. 59,60 Historically , the term placebo has carried negative connotations, viewed as something inert, non-specific, or fake. 58 More recently, placebo is not being viewed just as a sugar pill or an inactive 'sham' treatment, instead clinicians are being encouraged to embrace the context - ual elements of treatment that can produce positive ef-fects. 54,58,61 Indeed, Miller and Kaptchuck have suggested that the term placebo effect should be abandoned, pro-moting a non-stigmatized term such as 'contextual heal-ing'. 58 H\u00e4user and colleagues recently published a concise and all-encompassing description of placebo and nocebo effects, stating that they can be viewed as: \"...psychobio-logical phenomena that arise from the therapeutic con-text in its entirety (sham treatments, the patients' treat - ment expectations and previous experience, verbal and non-verbal communications by the person administering the treatment, and the interaction between that person and the patient).\" 62 p.465 While harnessing placebo ef fects Can Chiropr 61(1)Commentary ing' is a worthy endeavor, avoiding nocebo effects may be just as, or even more important, because the magnitude of nocebo effects in pain can be large. 63 Furthermore, the power of negative communication and nocebo in health care consultations has been suggested to be stronger than positive communication and placebo. 64 Studying placebo and nocebo effects in health care is complex, as there are many contextual factors linked to these effects. Further - more, some patients and conditions may be more sus-ceptible to placebo and nocebo than others. 60, 65, 66 By ex- ploring common exercise prescription contextual factors and their possible effects, a clinician can see beyond the spine for the positive or negative impacts of their inter - actions and interventions. Exploring common contextual factors We argue that the following contextual factors can sig-nificantly impact prescribed exercise adherence and out-comes: 1. The therapeutic alliance (relationship between the clinician and the patient), 2. Patient education, 3. Ex-pectations (of therapeutic success or failure), 4. Attribu-tions (of therapeutic success or failure), and 5. Providing an experience of mastery or cognitive control over a prob-lem. 54 1. The therapeutic allianceThe therapeutic alliance has been defined as \"a trusting connection and rapport established between therapist and client through collaboration, communication, therapist empathy and mutual understanding and respect\". 67 p.44 Furthermore, the therapeutic alliance is based on: col-laborative goal setting, agreeing upon interventions, assigning tasks linked to goals, and bonding as rapport and trust are established. 68 Specific to chiropractic, the therapeutic alliance is known to be forged in an environ-ment of emotional support, which fosters the growth of the belief that the problem (i.e., CLBP) is manageable 69 promoting the placebo effect55. As noted in Figure 1, we Figure 1. Common contextual factor interplay. The Therapeutic Alliance is presented as a key contextual factor, providing the foundation for the others. Each of the five contextual factors pr esented (1. Therapeutic Alliance. 2. Education. 3. Expectations. 4. Attributions. 5. Mastery & Control) overlap and influence the others, potentially producing positive (placebo) or negative (nocebo) effects. Embedded within each contextual factor is the opportunity to facilitate positive beliefs and behavior change - working towards improved exercise adherence and patient outcomes.J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 1 1P Stilwell, K Harman are suggesting that the therapeutic alliance provides the central foundation for patients to receive the benefits from other contextual factors and their placebo effects, further improving health-related outcomes and exercise adherence. Research is starting to support this as positive effects on pain and disability have been found when the therapeutic alliance is enhanced during the delivery of LBP interventions. 70-73 In contrast, the therapeutic alliance can be weakened by clinician behaviors such as discred-iting and blaming a patient, or being non-supportive. 64 We hypothesize that this may stimulate potent nocebo effects, and have a negative impact on self-efficacy, exercise ad-herence, and patient outcomes. 2. Education Not all education and exercise prescription are equal, as during their delivery there is potential for both placebo and nocebo effects. The following quotations from a qualita - tive study by Slade and colleagues 74 p.563 highlight how, in the absence of an easy explanation for CLBP, clinicians may resort to blaming past practitioners and the patient: \"You've got to sell it, show them what they do wrong, and that' s the hardest thing \" and \"It' s because you're doing everything wrong, you'll continue to get your back pain \".74 p.563 Yet, they deliver their own questionable and potentially fear-inducing persistent LBP explanations and exercise advice: \"I generally talk about instability... you've got instability at this level and your movement pattern aggravates and it' s because you're moving through one area too much\" and \"We see bad movement patterns... it' s all about correcting movement pat-terns\". 74 p.563 This type of blaming may not only cause patient confu- sion, the language delivered to certain patients may elicit nocebo effects and reinforce the fear that they are failing to get better because they are incompetent and that they have something seriously wrong with their back. Instead, explaining persistent pain using modern neuroscience ap-proaches may not only open the door to exercise prescrip-tion, it may also improve exercise adherence and patient outcomes. 75 Pain neuroscience education resources such as Explain Pain76 or Therapeutic Neuroscience Educa - tion77 are becoming popular as they can help demystify and unravel the complex and sometimes unpredictable nature of CLBP. These resources provide illustrations and explanations about the neurophysiology of pain and can be used to help patients change their understanding and beliefs about the pain that they are experiencing. 78 In essence, education and learning about pain can reduce uncertainty and perceived threat, which can reduce pain. 76 We believe that patients with CLBP can then begin to view their backs as sensitized rather than fragile and prone to injury or damage. While research examining pain science education is relatively new, evidence is rapidly building that supports its use with patients experiencing CLBP. 79-84 3. Expectations of therapeutic success or failureThere is a large body of literature that demonstrates the strong positive relationship between beliefs and outcomes [for review see Maddux] 85 - that is, if a patient expects they will have a positive result from a treatment, there is a strong likelihood that they will experience a positive re-sult from that treatment 86-89. There is also evidence that ex- pectations can be modified to produce better intervention outcomes through placebo effects. 71,90,91 But we must also consider potential nocebo effects on patients. Individuals in stressful positions are vulnerable to nocebo effects 60 and living with CLBP is distressing, accompanied by a sense of loss, lowered self-worth, and fear of the future 92. Un- fortunately, as previously discussed, clinicians may create or facilitate negative expectations through poor communi-cation or inappropriate language, which can then lead to poorer patient outcomes. 59 It is also possible that messages from the media, family, and friends could facilitate nega-tive expectations about the back and exercise, impacting exercise adherence and health-related outcomes. When clinicians explain pain and the purpose of an exercise, \"...it may be healthier to err on the side of optimism...\". 60 p.610 This is especially true with the non-specific LBP popula-tion where there is no significant underlying pathology, yet patient fear-avoidance beliefs can be high - already nega-tively affecting outcomes. 93 Once again, we argue that evi- dence-based pain neuroscience education should be used to promote positive expectations while avoiding nocebo effects (e.g., pain does not equal damage, the back is inher - ently strong, and the spine/nervous system Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Commentary 4. Attributions of therapeutic success or failure Attributions are an individual's explanation or under - standing of why things have occurred the way they did - it is a way of making sense of past experiences. 54 At- tributions help us to create a useful understanding of the world, as far as we can predict or control events. 94 When an intervention is judged as a success or failure in the past, it shapes expectations of success/failure for similar interventions in the future. 85 Another important impact of attribution is on the strength or stability of treatment out-comes. If a patient believes that their improvement was due to what a clinician did, then any beneficial effect is significantly shorter than if a patient believes that they improved because of their own actions. 54 Furthermore, people act on their beliefs,95 if a patient attributes their back pain to the fact that their spine is unstable or weak, and they are educated on how they are failing to do an ex-ercise properly, it should not be a surprise that they would expect to get worse if they engaged in exercise or load their spine. This type of unintended nocebo effect creat - ed by clinicians is clearly demonstrated in the following quote from a study by Darlow and colleagues: 47 p.532 \"Basically all I've kind of been told to do by physios is to work on my core...I've been tested by various different physios, and Pilates, and I'm ap-parently ridiculously weak .... I had an abortion because I didn't think I could have a baby. I didn't think I could handle it...carrying it, and having ex-tra weight on my stomach.\" 47 p.532 (Bolding added for emphasis). This last quote may be an extreme example of how edu- cation can shape attributions and expectations, and how these beliefs can shape behaviors. Still, as highlighted above, the increased use of individualized approaches that facilitate positive beliefs about the back and empow-er patients with CLBP is clearly needed. 5. Mastery or cognitive control over a problem Mastery is defined as \"control over those circumstances that importantly bear on the life of the individual\". 96 p.164 In the context of musculoskeletal rehabilitation, both cognitive and physical control is needed to achieve mastery - which often requires deliberate practice with performance feedback. 97-100 Emerging neuroscience re-search suggests that positive neuroplastic changes appear to be enhanced by slowly increasing the complexity of motor skill tasks, promoting cognitive effort and learn-ing. 101 This process is thought of as 'working through' the new behavior while paying attention to thoughts and responses to the movement. 54 With practice, patients can learn and believe that they are capable of consistently overcoming their challenging movement tasks, which can increase their self-efficacy and result in mastery. 95 These ideas are supported by findings in a recent synthe-sis of systematic reviews that identified self-efficacy as one of the most consistent predictors of exercise partici-pation. 102 Furthermore, a reciprocal relationship between improved exercise adherence and self-efficacy has been demonstrated. Simply put: participation in exercise tends to increase exercise self-efficacy, which in turn reinfor - ces exercise behavior and continued exercise participa-tion. 103 Positive beliefs are a key feature in self-efficacy and mastery, but they can also modulate the placebo ef-fect. 104 This suggests that if an exercise is expected by a patient to reduce pain and improve function, the pa-tient is not only more likely to do it, they are also more likely to derive benefit from it. In contrast, the potential for nocebo effects through conditioning and expectation should also be considered. If a patient repeatedly fails when attempting their meaningful movement task(s) and the clinician provides poor education and negative com-ments, such as telling them how they move wrong, their spine is unstable, or how a passive 'fix' is the key to suc-cess - the end result can be something like learned help-lessness. 105 This occurs when a patient feels that they do not have control over their situation and their pain, and that they only make things worse when they try to help themselves, so they give up. W e believe that once the patients' self-identified move- ment goals are achieved, they should be encouraged to en-gage in regular exercise that they expect will help and that they personally enjoy. Here, patient preferences should be key considerations when prescribing exercise. When a pa-tient can select the exercise they enjoy and/or expect will help, the beneficial effects of the exercise may not only be potentiated through expectations/placebo effects 104, but also through improved practice/adherence, leading to improved self-efficacy and mastery 106. Research supports this idea, as it has been found that incorporating patient preference and tailoring treatment programs to patients J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 13P Stilwell, self-management adherence and health-related outcomes.107,108 The complex positive feedback loop in Figure 1 can now be better appreciated; a strong therapeutic alliance with effective education can promote placebo effects, while avoiding nocebo effects. We argue that positive changes in attribution and expectations can then result in exercise engagement, which can feed forward into in-creased exercise self-efficacy and mastery. Conclusion Evidence keeps building about the multi-system bene-fits of exercise 109; this includes therapeutic exercise for CLBP. As suggested throughout this commentary, a focus on gross biological changes alone (muscle strength, en-durance etc.) has limited value. Instead, more research is needed to examine the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors - as this may have novel exercise prescription implications for patients with CLBP. This commentary provided an overview of some of the contextual factors that have biopsychosocial implications. It was described how these contextual factors can facili-tate placebo or nocebo effects, impacting patients' behav-iors and outcomes. The therapeutic alliance was presented as an important foundation, impacting patient education, expectations and attributions of therapeutic success or failure, and the patient's sense of mastery or control. Cur - rent evidence suggests that a strong therapeutic alliance, pain neuroscience education, and incorporating the func-tional needs and preferences of the patient can positively impact patients' beliefs and behaviors. Overall, this com-mentary suggests that to improve exercise adherence and health-related outcomes in the CLBP population, the con-text in which exercise is delivered and the meaning pa-tients embody need to be carefully considered and shaped by clinicians. More research is needed to further define and measure the active components within the common contextual factors presented in this commentary, as well as others factors shaping patients' exercise beliefs and be-haviors.

The objectives of this study were to determine what is most bothersome among patients with NC and how it impacts their lives and expectations with surgical and non-surgical treatment. Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were Contexte : Le point de vue du patient concernant l'effet de que les r\u00e9percussions Hamm, K Stuber, C Tomkins-Lane, YR Rampersaud Introduction Neurogenic claudication (NC) is the clinical syndrome as-sociated with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). It is characterized by bilateral or unilateral buttock, thigh or calf discomfort, pain, numbness or weakness precipi-tated by walking or prolonged standing and relieved by sitting and lumbar flexion. 1,2 Low back pain may or may not be present in individuals with NC. The pathophysiol - ogy is thought to be compression and/or ischemia of the lumbosacral nerve roots due to narrowing of the lateral and central vertebral canals, usually as a consequence of degenerative osteoarthritic changes in the lumbar spine. 1,3 Neurogenic claudication due to LSS is one of the most common causes of disability and loss of independence in older adults 4 and the most common reason for spine sur - gery in this population5. New cases of NC due to LSS are expected to rise dramatically over the next 20 years when an estimated 25% of the population in both the U.S. and Canada will be over the age of 65. 6 Studies evaluating the effective - ness of both operative and non-operative treatments for NC have used a wide variety of primary and secondary outcome measures. 7-10 These outcome measures assess various constructs including bodily pain, bodily func-tion, low back pain disability, back and leg pain, other leg symptoms, walking capacity (distance and time), walking performance, global improvement, quality of life, ranges of motion, treatment satisfaction and medication use. In most studies the outcome measures used are reflect- ive of the bias of the investigator(s) and is often inferred as the desired outcome of the patient. However, rarely has the perspective of the patient regarding the most import - ant outcome been considered. For example, limitation in walking is felt to be the hallmark of NC and is used as a conducted, audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis categorized key findings based on relative importance and impact on participants. Results: Twenty-eight individuals participated in this study. Participants were most bothered by the pain of NC, which dramatically impacted their lives. Inability to walk was the dominant functional limitation and this impacted the ability to engage in recreational and social activities. The most surprising finding was how frequently participants reported significant emotional effects of NC. Conclusions: From a patients' perspective NC has a significant multidimensional effects with pain, limited walking ability and emotional effects being most impactful to their lives.

Conclusions des patients, la pr\u00e9sente impact of neurogenic claudication: the patients' perspectives primary outcome measure in clinical trials.7,11,12,28 How- ever, previous systematic reviews by this group7,11,12 have demonstrated that many interventions for NC did not sig- nificantly improve walking performance or capacity. De-spite this, several interventions were still associated with good patient satisfaction and/or pain relief. Given the burden of NC, a lack of understanding of what outcomes are most important to those afflicted with NC represents a significant gap in both clinical and aca-demic knowledge. Clinicians need to know what is most important to a patient in order to recommend effective intervention(s) that address the patient's concerns. Re-searchers need to know what to measure in order to assess the most relevant patient outcome for a given interven - tion. Moreover, to make valid comparisons across studies and enable the pooling of data, a standardized set of out-come measures unique to this population and most rel-evant to patients is essential. In addition, there may be other constructs beyond those currently measured that may help to explain how this condition impacts people in different ways, and how these other factors can affect the patients experience and outcomes of NC. The objectives of this study were to determine what outcomes matter most among individuals with NC due to LSS and to assess patients' expectations and their experi-ences with surgical and non-surgical treatment. MethodsParticipant population and setting We recruited a purposeful sample 13 of participants from two university-affiliated hospital surgical and non-sur - gical spine clinics both located in Toronto, Canada. To be eligible to participate, patients had to experience NC with axial imaging-confirmed LSS, and be able to com-municate in English. To gain maximum variation of pa-tient perspectives regarding their condition and success with treatment an attempt was made to select participants along the continuum of care. Specifically, we recruited participants scheduled for non-surgical (early, less severe symptoms) or surgical care (late, more severe symptoms), as well as those who had received surgical and non-sur - gical treatment. We included individuals of varying ages (50-90 years), gender, intensity and type of symptoms, as well as duration of symptoms (months to years). All participants provided written informed consent. Research Ethics Board (REB) approval was received from the Mount Sinai Hospital REB Registration Number 13-0184-E and University Health Network REB Regis-tration Number 13-6914-BE, as well as the Institution-al Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pittsburgh (PRO13090531). Semi-structured interviews Research assistants, trained by a qualitative research expert (SZ), conducted semi-structured telephone inter - views lasting between 40 and 60 minutes. Interviews were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Inter - viewers followed a standardized set of open-ended ques-tions asking participants about their condition, focusing on what bothered them most and expectations regarding treatment. Figure 1 outlines a sample list of open-ended questions that were used. Quantitative measures questionnaire A questionnaire was administered by telephone directly following the completion of the semi-structured inter - 1. What things bother you most about your lumbar stenosis (condition)? Degree of pain in your back or legs? Functional ability? Walking ability (distance), independence? Getting Posture? Balance? Falls? Medication used? Overall health? 2. If you had to pick one important thing that bothers you most what would that be? How has your condition changed over time? What would be the least thing that bothers you about your lumbar stenosis? 3. What aspects of your condition would you like your treatment to address? 4. What type of treatment did your specialist recommend? What treatments have you received? How ef fective have the treatments been? 5. How would you measure the success of your treatment? 6. What would you consider the smallest improvement that would be worthwhile following your treatment... for each of the important outcomes you mentioned? 7. How much do you expect that things that bother you the most will change with your treatment? Figure 1. Sample questions for Assoc M Hamm, K Stuber, C Tomkins-Lane, YR Rampersaud view. The aim of the questionnaire was to characterize the participant sample with respect to demographics, duration of symptoms, pain intensity and functional status and to compare surgical and non-surgical participants. Box 1 below lists the measures included in the questionnaire. Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the question-naires. We compared pain, function and symptom out-comes among and between participants recruited from surgical and non-surgical clinics. For the semi-structured interviews the frequency and types of responses were determined using the Crab-tree and Miller \"editing\" approach to qualitative data. 18 Coding categories were developed through an open, it-erative process that involved reading the interviews with a focus that included physical and emotional effects of NC. From this process, a master code list of categories was developed. These codes were refined with inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then applied to the transcribed interviews. Two analysts [KW and MH], the qualitative expert [SZ], and the study team discussed the coding cat - egories (e.g. coping) and worked to integrate the codes into the larger analysis.

Coded passages were then examined to better understand patients' views and perspectives. The software program Atlas.ti (Scientific Software, Berlin, Germany) was used to assist in data organization and management. Quotations were chosen based on representativeness and their capacity to convey common participant views and themes. ResultsParticipant characteristics A total of 28 participants agreed to participate in a phone interview and complete a questionnaire. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the participants. Sixteen were re-cruited from a non-surgical clinic and 12 from a surgical clinic. The majority of participants (82%) were between 60 and 79 years of age, 54% were female, 68% were re-tired and over 80% received post-secondary education. Most participants reported that their dominant symp-toms involved chiefly the leg(s) (57%) or their back and leg(s) equally (32%). Almost half of the participants had symptoms for more than five years and over 75% ex-perienced symptoms within 30 minutes of commencing walking. Participants from the surgical clinic appeared to have greater functional limitations and longer duration of symptoms compared to participants from the non-surgical clinic (see Table 2). Major themes from interviews: Participants' experiences with LSS (see Quotes Table 3) 1. Physical effects: The most commonly reported symptoms were pain and discomfort; mentioned by each of the 28 participants. The location of the pain varied but included lower back pain and leg pain. Other reported discomforts included: tin-gling, leg and knee failure (i.e. sudden inability to stand, sit or walk, including falling), burning, a sensation of something crawling just under the skin (i.e. paresthesia), and a sensation of fullness or heaviness in the legs (Table 3: Theme 1 Quotes A.1-3). Problems with fatigue cen-tred on the legs or other body parts tiring quickly such that walking for long distances or, in the case of a school teacher, standing at work all day became impossible (Table 3: 1 A.4-5). While a few participants did not describe their pain from stenosis as particularly intense, most regarded their pain as debilitating. One described it as \"pure hell.\" For some participants the pain had always been intense, whereas for Table 2.

Symptoms of Pain, Discomfort:1. \"It' s the pain in my leg and also there is times that when I have to go to the washroom; excuse me; that I have to sit. It's my knees; like sometimes I can hardly sit down on the toilet and sometimes it's hard for me to get up. Let's say, if I sit down on the chair, I'm fine, but then when I have to stand up, I cannot stand up or when I start walking, it's hard to walk. When I feel better it's when I'm lying down or sitting down, but then when I'm sitting down and then stand up and starting walking that' s the worse part.\" 2. \"A burning feeling say from the top of the leg to the knee. A feeling that there was something crawling, as if they were bugs just underneath the surface of the skin crawling up and down and you know, it was pretty disconcerting.\" 3. \"Like I said it started in 2010 and I had often a lot of back pain, lower back pain. It went down into my left leg, but it was also accompanied by numbness in both legs, so severe at times that I would lose the feeling in both my legs and I would fall and go down.\" 4. \"Not being able to walk as far as I would like to without having to stop and experience the tingling in the front of my leg and the numbness in my foot and the pain associated with it.\" 5. \"When I first started the clinic here, I could not walk for than a minute and a half and I had to stop. My legs would swell. My feet would hurt that the sciatic nerve in my back would almost pull me down that it would cripple me. Even to walk, I work at [Name of Location] and to walk here I got to stop 6 or 7 times and this is me, I'm use... to running that distance.\" 6. \"It started I suspect 5 years ago, as a minor back pain. One usually would think it is just a strain, but over the years it has gradually progressed to the point where now it is very debilitating.\" 7. \"Now I've had that for very many years, but it' s always been bearable. The stenosis has really affected my daily life and it makes me sad at times, such I have to contend with it. At the same time, I must honestly admit that I am grateful for the health I've had. I realized that I have been very lucky . So, I can't have it always, but at the same time its human nature to resent it that I get such pain all the time.\" 2. Activity EffectsA.

Anxiety:1. \"W ell, I guess there is an underlying stress all the time that you know , I'm waiting for an operation and it may not be and it's probably not going to be 100% successful, so it is a gradual accommodation to the fact that this is who I am now.\" 2. \"W ell, it's yes, but not that fine.

In addition to concerns about the severity of their pain, participants described the emo-tional impact of the wearing, grinding nature of having to endure ongoing pain, including feelings of resentment (Table 3: 1 A.7). 2. Activity effects: Participants mentioned a wide range of activities that their NC interfered with including: walking, recreation - al activities (such as sports and exercise), standing, so-cial activities, household activities, controlling comorbid health conditions, working, sleeping and lifting. Each participant mentioned that their NC interfered with their ability to walk. Interference with walking was most frequently mentioned as the \"most bothersome\" aspect of the condition, identified as such by 17 of the 28 participants. For some participants this was a minor concern or one that had affected them profoundly in the past but with successful treatment was no longer an issue. For many however, the walking limitations caused major disruptions in their lives, from being unable to walk or run for exercise, to being unable to do basic social and daily activities such as grocery shopping, holiday shop-ping, going to the mall with family and friends, or even visiting neighbors (Table 3: 2 A.1-3). Related to walking, many participants described being unable to participate in recreational activities. Recreational activities mentioned included walking itself or hiking, various sports (football, cricket, soccer, golf, badminton, curling, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, squash), travel (due to the walk-ing that travel entails), dancing, bicycling, and aerobics (Table 3: 2 B. 1-3). Many participants described them - selves as active, outdoorsy people who, as a result of their NC, had become sedentary and were unable to participate in what had been previously seasonal outdoor activities (Table 3: 2 B.4). Inability to participate in recreational ac-tivities was mentioned as the \"most bothersome\" aspect of having LSS by 11 of the 28 participants. Interference with social activities was mentioned fair - ly often, and was linked to participants' difficulties with walking, standing, or doing recreational activities. Many described limiting time with family and friends, difficul-ties standing while socializing or being unable to play with grandchildren in the way that they wanted (Table 3: 2 C.1-3). Often the inability to stand or pain upon stand-ing was linked with an inability to do household/daily ac-tivities, such as cleaning or other chores, in the way that the participants were used to doing. For many there was difficulty with transitioning between positions or activ - ities, describing not being able to walk immediately after standing for example, or having extreme difficulty sit-ting and standing back up. This difficulty in transitioning made a wide range of activities difficult or impossible, from social events to using the toilet. For some participants, the amount of pain experienced while standing meant that they could not wait in lines, go shopping without physical support such as a shopping cart or another person, clean their households, cook, or even stand in the bathroom to do their hair or makeup in the morning (Table 3: 2 C.4-8). This directly impacted individuals' sense of independence, and for some, elimin - ated activities that they had previously found enjoyable, such as cooking or gardening (Table 3: 2 C.4). 3. Emotional effects: In addition to their physical symptoms, participants re- ported an array of emotional responses to their condition. Twenty-two of the 28 participants reported emotional im-pacts that were associated with their NC. The most fre-quent of these was depressed mood, although not always specified by name. Instead they described their feelings as sadness, loss of interest in activities, or hopelessness (Table 3: 3 A.1). These participants were likely to mention deep feelings of sadness, discouragement, social isolation or loss, as their NC prevented them from doing activities that they enjoyed (i.e., walking or other outdoor activities) or from which they derived meaning (i.e., work, volunteer work, being independent, socializing, lifting and holding grandchildren) (Table 3: 3 A.2-4). Additionally, for some of these participants, the perceived incurable/untreatable nature of NC was described as \"depressing\" in and of it-self. Eight of the participants mentioned anxiety, express- ing deep worries that family members would have to take care of them, or that their condition would worsen signifi-cantly (Table 3: 3 B.1-2). Seven participants expressed feelings of frustration with their NC (Table 3: 3 C.1-2). For some, this was focused on the physical limitations imposed on them by NC, such as only being able to walk for short distances or the ongoing relationship between exercise and pain relief. Lastly , six of the participants described NC as having hurt their pride. Most of these participants mentioned in J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 27C Ammendolia, M Schneider, M Hamm, K Stuber, C Tomkins-Lane, YR Rampersaud passing feeling embarrassed at having to rest frequently, or lamented the loss of complete independence (Table 3: 3 D.1). One participant had concerns about loss of in-dependence that were so severe that he spoke favourably of assisted suicide. Similarly, another participant spoke of the embarrassment of dealing with NC in social situa-tions, describing the limitations that always having to sit at parties imposed on her, and describing NC as having pushed her into an older, different phase of life (Table 3: 3 D.2). 4. T reatment effects, non-surgical: Participants had experienced a wide array of treat- ments for their NC. The most common treatments were manual therapy and supervised exercise (rehab therapy), and pain medication (see Table 2). Of the two, rehab ther - apy was spoken of more favourably. Rehab therapy was described as significantly to relieving pain and increasing mobility. For some participants, it provided complete re-lief, although that relief was contingent upon continuing the therapy. Some participants noted that the frequency with which one had to do the therapeutic exercises was sometimes frustrating (Table 3: 5 A.1). For others, how-ever, while rehab therapy did not provide complete relief, it reduced pain or discomfort in ways that were meaning-ful, such as allowing them to sleep at night, or increas - ing the distance they could walk at one time from under 100 metres to one kilometre. Others mentioned that rehab therapy could provide temporary relief, interspersed with some relapses (Table 3: 5 A.2). More participants found it efficacious than those who did not, and some found that it completely relieved their symptoms. 5. T reatment effects, surgical: Seven partic ipants had undergone surgery for their NC, four of whom directly praised the surgery as effective (Table 3: 5 B.1). Two participants found that their sur - geries were initially successful but that over time, their symptoms were beginning to return. Another two partici-pants found their surgeries to be helpful, but had them so recently that they weren't sure what level of function they would ultimately achieve in the longer term. 6. Expectations fr om treatments When it came to the relief that participants expected from their treatment, the most frequently mentioned ex-pectations were decreased/eliminated pain and increased physical abilities. Overall, the majority of participants (n=20/28) felt that treatment would have to improve (rather than simply maintain) their condition in order to be worthwhile. (i) Pain relief. Many participants expected and accepted that they would live with some level of chronic pain. Those who expected to live in pain frequently indicated that simply being in less pain would be adequate for them, and that any amount by which it could be lessened would be bene-ficial. They described themselves as going through life by just dealing with it (Table 3: 6 A.1). For example, one par - ticipant called her desire to be without pain \"greedy,\" and described pain as her \"partner in life.\" Two others indi-cated that if 10 were the worst pain possible, they would be willing to live at a constant two. Another participant indicated that a five out of 10 would be acceptable. These participants seemed aware and accepting of the fact that they would never be completely pain free (Table 3: 6 A.2) Rarely , participants expected complete and total relief of their symptoms, and expressed a desire to have no pain whatsoever (Table 3: 6 B.1). It seemed that participants expected more in terms of absolute pain relief from sur - gery than they did from other interventions, such as rehab therapy, although relatively few participants spoke about this issue (Table 3: 6 B.2). (ii) Physical abilities . Relief from pain overwhelmingly appeared to be the single most important thing that could be done for these NC sufferers. However given that decreased pain should lead to increased physical ability, these two outcomes generally go hand-in-hand. When participants spoke about increased mobility, they generally did not expect 100% recovery but rath-er would set an individual benchmark, which generally meant being able to do \"more\" than they currently could do. Benchmarks included: being able to walk a greater distance, being able to handle household chores alone, be-ing able to transition from sitting to standing without pain, being able to perform activities like playing with grand-children, or being able to \"get out of vehicles\" (Table 3: 6 C.1-3). Echoing the data discussed earlier about activities impacted by LSS, the most commonly mentioned activity in this area was walking: participants strongly want to be able to walk without pain (Table 3: 6 C.4). Discussion In this study we interviewed 28 individuals with NC due 28 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)The physical and psychological impact of neurogenic claudication: the patients' perspectives to LSS with the goals of better understanding how this condition impacts their lives and what they expected from non-surgical and surgical treatments. This study uniquely confirms that from the perspectives of patients, NC has a multidimensional impact on individuals with pain, limited walking ability, and depressed mood arising as the most common and significant symptoms. Most participants had undergone multiple treatments for their NC, many of which they found to be ineffective. The most effect - ive treatments were rehab therapy/exercise and surgery. Pain medication was also frequently used but participants generally indicated that they wanted to reduce or elimin - ate use of medications. Patients felt that treatment would have to improve (rather than simply maintain) their condi-tion in order to be worthwhile. Finally, a consistent theme arose amongst participants suggesting that pain, physical abilities, emotional state, and their expectations of treat - ment are strongly inter-related and at times inseparable. By far our participants were most bothered by the pain associated with NC. Described pain ranged from some-what mild and well controlled to absolutely crippling and debilitating. For most participants, the pain from their NC had dramatically impacted their lives; the impact of which cannot be overstated. Beyond the experience of pain itself, participants regularly expressed the desire to re-engage in their regular day-to-day, recreational and social activities. The activity most frequently mentioned, and the source of the most frustration, was the inability to walk and/or stand. In a study using focus groups to assess important outcomes among 33 older patients re-ceiving epidural injections for NC, Edward et al. 20 had similar findings. In their study the highest rated prob-lem areas were ''experiencing pain/discomfort'' and ''problems with weakness'' (52%) 20. In a recent qualitative study by Lyle et al.21 assessing 15 patients undergoing physiotherapy for NC, pain and the threat of pain was the most prominent feature leading to a loss of engagement in meaningful activities and sense of self. Similarly in our study the majority of patients per - ceived pain as the central cause of their other symptoms, with relief from pain overwhelmingly being the single most important thing that could be done for them. This finding was also prominent in the study by Lyle et al. 21, where most participants wished to get rid of the pain com-pletely as they felt that was key to getting back to their normal activities. While others implied complete relief was unlikely and they would be happy if they could get relief of some of the pain. In our study participants hoped for their pain levels to decrease and walking to return to the levels that they were capable of prior to their symp-toms arising. However, the majority of participants were willing to accept any achievable improvement over their current symptoms. Perhaps the most surprising finding was how frequent- ly participants reported various emotional effects that re-sulted from living with NC. The most common was an expression of depressed mood. In addition to depressed mood, participants mentioned experiencing anxiety (i.e., fear that it would become worse or that they would be debilitated), frustration and hurt pride (i.e., hurt pride at having to be taken care of or being viewed as disabled or unattractive) as a result of their NC. In the study by Lyle et al. 21, the authors noted fluctuating and unpredictable symptoms resulted in anxiety and uncertainty, however, they did not report depressed mood as a prevalent theme. Although we did not specifically ask about treatment for psychological illness in our interviews, it is worth noting that patients did not report receiving treatment for their mood alteration. The apparent emotional (psychosocial) impact of NC on patients suggests that these factors should be considered during assessment and management not unlike patients who suffer from chronic pain. Current diagnostic criteria for neurogenic claudication due to de-generative lumbar spinal stenosis do not include psycho-social factors 2,29. Our findings strongly suggest that the emotional as- pects of NC, particularly given the high prevalence of de-pressed mood, need to be considered and that treatment for depression and/or anxiety is possibly an unmet need in this population. Specifically, the emotional effects of NC may be important mediators of pain intensity, and/or related to limitations in walking and standing ability, and recreational activity. Emotional effects may also explain why there is a lack of correlation between decreased pain or disability scores and improved walking ability. 12 It is also possible that the emotional effects may explain why patients' symptoms and functional status are variable, as noted in the Lyle et al. 21 study and concurs with recent clinical trial data (Ammendolia et al. and Schneider et al., J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 29C Ammendolia, M Schneider, M Hamm, K Stuber, C Tomkins-Lane, YR Rampersaud unpublished data). These results are consistent with the literature on psychosocial impacts of NC. Studies have shown that high levels of depression and hopelessness may have a compounding effect on walking ability and recreational activity in individuals with NC, as well as surgical outcomes. 22 A systematic review of prognostic factors in NC showed that pre-operative depression is likely a prognostic factor for post-operative NC related symptom severity and disability. However, the prognostic value of depression on the outcome of pain and walking capacity was less clear. 22 Therefore, interventions directed at addressing psychosocial issues associated with NC might improve pain levels and functional activity through better coping mechanisms . 22,23 For the most part participants' expectations for treat - ment seemed realistic, likely in part because most received education on what they could expect from treatment by their practitioners (CA, RR). Patient expectations are known to impact outcomes 24,25 and the ability to mitigate unrealistic expectations prior to treatment would likely reduce the risk of disappointment and despair, as well as facilitate the acceptance of some degree of pain and physical limitation. In this study, patient expectations for improvement appeared higher for surgery than non-sur - gical treatment. This suggests that the minimally clinical - ly important difference (MCID) may be different between patients in these two groups. This has been demonstrated in quantitative studies evaluating the MCID for the Spinal Stenosis Survey and Oswestry Disability Index. 26,27 This may have implications in clinical trials when comparing the proportion of participants achieving MCID among subjects receiving surgery and those receiving non-sur - gical treatment for NC. Based on our patient-centred findings, we propose that both clinicians and researchers need to address NC as a multidimensional entity when considering manage - ment options and designing or evaluating specific inter - vention(s). We have proposed a theoretical framework to illustrate the potential inter-relationships of factors that impacts patient outcomes in NC (Figure 2). In this frame - work we ranked, based on our participants' experiences, the most bothersome symptoms, functional limitations, emotional aspects and treatment successes and hypoth-esized how these factors potentially interact.

Treatment outcomes can change the direction of future treatment is another potential inter - action. This framework can provide a guide to clinicians to establish how NC individually affects their patients and to inquire about their treatment expectations. This can allow for a more stratified approach to management ranging from rehabilitation therapy, psychosocial support and /or surgery that may lead to better individual patient outcomes. Future research is needed to validate and quan-tify these proposed interactions between pain, physical ability, emotional state and treatment expectations in NC. Future studies should address and measure priority areas including pain, walking and standing ability, recrea - tional and social activity and emotional well being. In a Cochrane review examining non-operative interventions to improve outcomes in symptomatic LSS, none of the 21 studies reviewed directly assessed recreational activ-ity, while only seven of 21 studies assessed psychosocial status, and 12 of 21 studies used an objective walking measure. 12 This paper provides valuable insight from a patient's perspective and this information can influence how we treat LSS patients in future and how we select outcomes for research. Study limitations Our study is not without limitations. Our qualitative ap-proach is not designed to be generalizable, but instead to provide depth and insight into patients' lived experience. For that reason we sought to achieve thematic saturation per group, which can be achieved with 10-12 interviews per group. We were able to recruit additional subjects per group and in our thematic coding we noted saturation, which occurs when key themes such as physical limita - tions are present for all participants. However, it is still possible that if more patients were interviewed different themes may have emerged. Another potential limitation is that our purposeful sam- ple focused on a Canadian sample in a hospital setting. Variations in health care system characteristics and re-lated factors such as access to treatment may impact pa-tients' outcomes and expectations. Recruiting from a hos-pital setting may result in participants with more severe symptoms and physical limitations. Although an attempt was made to recruit a representative sample of patients with NC due to LSS, it may be that the participating sam-ple was not a true general reflection of this population. This selection bias may also be reflected in our conceptual model of factors that impact patient outcomes and their potential interactions. These hypothesized interactions should be determined quantitatively using a random rep-resentative sample. Conclusions The results of this qualitative study show that NC should be considered as multidimensional in its impact on pa-tients. We found that pain, and limited walking and stand-ing ability were the most bothersome aspects of NC that significantly impacted important activities of daily living, as well as meaningful recreational and social activities. Additionally, this study is the first to qualitatively identify the significant emotional impact of NC. This is a find-ing that should not be overlooked in clinical practice and future research. A holistic understanding of how psycho-social and other factors impact outcomes in this popula-tion is needed. We present a conceptual model of poten-tial interactions between important outcomes in LSS as a framework for future study.

In this brief report we propose an in-vitro model to potentially assist in revealing a mechanism for, and therefore source of, this phenomenon. Using a suction cup under tension and de-nucleated fluid to simulate synovial fluid, an audible release with intra-articular cavity formation was elicited. This was followed by a refractory period during which no audible crack could be elicited until the observed cavity had slowly reabsorbed back into the joint fluid. Conversely, if regular fluid containing pre-existing nuclei was used, a cavity formation occurred but with neither an audible release nor subsequent refractory period. With this simple in-vitro model, we were able to reproduce the characteristic audible release, cavity formation and related refractory period typically observed in related Le \u00ab craquement \u00e0 la a permis cavit\u00e9 \"Cracking\" or \"popping\" is common in many joints, par - ticularly the knuckles, however the mechanisms respon-sible for the sound remains unclear. In 1938, Nordheim et al. used x-rays to investigate joint cracking and observed the presence of intra-articular radiolucencies after joints were moved beyond their normal range of active motion. 1 These lucencies were believed to be due to gas forma-tion, however, no elaborate in vitro model was offered at the time to help explain this phenomenon. Instead, a simple analogy based on a water-filled syringe was pro-posed. (see Figure 1) In that most basic model, gas forma-tion is reproduced within the syringe by simply pulling on the plunger while the needle end remains sealed. This action generates a bubble that expands in proportion to the increase in volume and corresponding negative pres-sure created as more tension is applied to the syringe. In accordance with Henry's law of solubility, dissolved gas comes out of solution as greater tension on the syringe re-duces its partial pressure. Additionally, in accordance with Boyle's law, the volume of an otherwise fixed amount of undissolved gas increases, again, as its absolute pressure is reduced. Yet gas formation with the syringe model does not generate a cracking sound, and therefore it does not fully explain the events associated with gas formation within joints. In 1947, Roston et al. also detected radiolucencies on x-ray images of cracking joints and hypothesized that they represented bubble formation in the midst of a vacuum created by joint tension or distraction. 2 Roston et al. theorized that the bubbles originated from smaller pre-existing gas nuclei (i.e., small spherical bubbles or gas cavities trapped in crevices on hydrophobic surfaces that are ubiquitous in polar fluids such as water), which transitioned to larger visible bubbles at lower vacuum thresholds. 3 These gas nuclei can be dissolved and elim -experiments in human joints. This simple in-vitro model may be of use in helping to discern both the timing and precise nature of other yet to be discerned mechanisms related to joint cracking. (JCCA. 2017;61(1):32-39) joint, servir \u00e0 discerner \u00e0 la fois pr\u00e9cise Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)A proposed in vitro model for investigating the mechanisms of 'joint cracking': a short report of preliminary techniques and observations inated by either hydrostatic compression, boiling at sea level pressure at 100oC, or boiling under high vacuum at room temperature. Although this theoretical framework of denucleation was introduced, no subsequent physical in vitro model evolved from that study. By 1971 Unsworth et al. introduced the 'cavitometre', which was the first in vitro synovial joint model that was developed specifically to study joint cracking. 4 This mod- el was constructed out of nylon and plexiglass with sur - faces similar in contour to a metacarpophalangeal joint, only at double the normal size, and separated by synovial fluid. When tension across the system was applied quick-ly to simulate a joint crack, a cavity appeared and then disappeared. Furthermore, a sound was generated, which the authors concluded was due to bubble collapse rather than bubble formation (the latter of which Roston et al. had hypothesized in an earlier study). However, unlike a real synovial joint, the model was open to ambient air, from which gas nuclei could be introduced. Furthermore, the model could be cracked repeatedly without hindrance by any refractory period between sequential iterations. Irrespective of the model's limitations, the collapsing bubble hypothesis of Unsworth et al. remained the most popular explanation for joint cracking sounds for over four decades. However in 2015, Kawchuck et al. used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal the occur - rence of a hypointense area coincidental to the time of a metacarpophalangeal crack. 5 This led to renewed interest in Roston's original theory of bubble formation as a vi-able alternative to Unsworth's theory of bubble collapse. In further support of Roston et al.' s work, Kawchuk et al. showed that traction of the finger caused the hypointense area to remain present in the field of view, similar to what is observed in the basic syringe model. But controversy would still exist between the two competing hypotheses as the time window between MRI frames in the study by Kawchuk et al. was 0.3 sec, whereas that of the video imaging in the cavitometre study by Unsworth et al. was within 0.01 sec. Kawchuk et al. further concluded that the process of cavity formation was likely due to tribonucleation, which by definition is a process of bubble formation from the relative motion of two solid structures under liquid ten-sion. 6,7 However, other studies on tribonucleation do not indicate that this phenomenon is associated with the gen-eration of any notable cracking sounds. 7,8 T o assist in resolving this ambiguity, we describe an in vitro model that possesses three important properties: 1) It is a closed system that mimics the sealed environment of the synovial joint in vivo; 2) It contains de-nucleated fluid and 3) It reproduces both a cracking phenomenon and sub-sequent refractory period identical to that which is seen in real synovial joints. We believe that this new in vitro model could be a basis for further advancement of previous re-search on the mechanisms of joint cracking. This improved model simulates much of the natural anatomy and geom-etry of a real metacarpophalangeal joint. The objective of the current paper is to describe this new-and-improved joint cracking model and to also present some qualitative observations from preliminary tests involving this model. Materials and Methods The development of our latest model began with con-struction of a very basic dry joint model initially (Model A), followed by the sequential construction of 5 addi-tional models (Models B to final Model F). Each model represented a minor modification of the one temporally preceding it. Model A: Basic dry joint This model consisted of an elastic suction cup (diameter 10mm) adhered to a polished flat glass plate with an air-filled space simulating a joint cavity. In this model, the suction cup was pressed up against the glass plate, and subsequent traction was applied in two different ways: 1) with just enough tension force to cause partial detachment of the cup (i.e., the centre of the cup) without breaking the seal around its perimeter; and subsequently 2) with greater and sufficient tension to cause the cup to detach fully (i.e., both centre and peripheral margin of the cup) from the glass surface. Model B: A wet joint This model was identical to Model A, except that the suc-tion cup was immersed in a beaker of distilled water so that the simulated joint space was filled with fluid. In this model, the suction cup was pressed up against the beaker wall to create a suction adherence, but this time, traction was applied with just enough tension force to cause par - tial detachment of the cup (i.e. the centre of the cup) with-out breaking the seal around its perimeter, similar to the first way in Model A.J Can Chiropr C: A \"de-nucleated\" wet joint This model was identical to Model B, except that the suc-tion cup was immersed in \"de-nucleated\" distilled water. As mentioned previously, nucleated water refers to nor - mal distilled water, which contains visible bubbles that form through the coalescence of pre-existing gas cavities (i.e., gas \"nuclei\") within the fluid. 4 These pre-existing nuclei are either smaller unattached spherical bubbles or larger gas volumes that are attached to hydrophobic crevices on solid particles. 9 Both types of nuclei can be partially removed by boiling the fluid for 30 minutes with the suction cup immersed in the fluid and letting cool. An-other approach to de-nucleate is by over pressurization 6 and a third approach is by vacuum, which we performed by using -110 kPa for 20 minutes while the suction cup was fully immersed in the fluid. After denucleating the fluid, the suction cup was pressed up against the glass beaker wall to generate a suction adherence. We then pulled on the suction cup with just enough manual force to cause only the centre of the cup to detach from the wall, without compromising the seal around the perimeter of the suction cup. Model D: A Ringer's solution-filled wet joint This model was identical to model C, but to more close-ly simulate the actual fluid in a synovial joint, a Ringer's solution, manufactured as per Casentini et al. 10, was used and de-nucleated as we did with distilled water for model C. Again, after pressing the suction cup to the beaker wall to create a suction adherence, we pulled on the suction cup with just enough manual force to cause only the centre of the cup to detach from the glass beaker wall without com-promising the seal around the perimeter of the suction cup. Model E: Wet joint model with realistic surface geometryTo determine if the cracking event was influenced by the geometry of the suction cup surfaces employed for models A through D, the suction cup was replaced by a polyurethane metacarpal bone. This was achieved by cre-ating a mold of a cadaveric metacarpal bone and pour - ing an identically shaped polyurethane copy. To roughly simulate the presence of a synovial fold and capsule, an elastic ring was attached to the polyurethane metacarpal head with an adhesive, exposing the central surface of the metacarpal head. This structure was then immersed in a glass beaker with Ringer's solution and de-nucleated under vacuum conditions. After 30 minutes of -110 Kpa the polyurethane metacarpal head was pressed up against the inside of a glass beaker wall while completely im-mersed in denucleated fluid. (see Figure 2) During testing of this model, we pulled on the polyurethane metacarpal base with just enough manual force to cause only the cen-tre aspect of the metacarpal head to release from the beak-er wall, but again without breaking the seal around the perimeter being maintained by the elastic ring. Figure 2. Model E36 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)A proposed in vitro model for investigating the mechanisms of 'joint cracking': a short report of preliminary techniques and observations Model F (Final Model): Compressible wet joint with realistic surface geometryTo test whether changes in joint tension affected the dur - ation required for the model to return to its baseline state (of cavity dissolution) after simulated cracking, a plexi-glass apparatus with a fulcrum mechanism was used to apply slight compression to the joint represented by the previous model (Model E). Again, de-nucleated Ringer's solution was used to simulate the presence of synovial fluid. During our tests, we first pulled on the polyurethane metacarpal base with just enough manual force to cause the centre aspect of the metacarpal head to detach from the beaker inside wall below the fluid line, again with-out compromising the seal around the perimeter of the elastic ring. Following detachment of the metacarpal head and corresponding cavity formation within the simulated joint, we applied compression to the joint model with a clamp (i.e. a fulcrum mechanism), which is depicted in Figure 3. The amount of compression force was not meas-ured at the time, but was subsequently estimated to be between 15 and 30 N. Results of preliminary testing With the Model A dry joint, pulling of the suction cup to detach only the centre aspect of the suction cup was not associated with an audible event. Only with further trac - tion and detachment of the cup perimeter did a cracking sound occur. W ith the Model B wet joint, as the suction cup was slowly pulled from the inside of the beaker wall in its closed state, a gas cavity formed silently as the centre of the suction cup detached without breaking the seal around its perimeter. Furthermore, when tension was subsequent-ly reduced in order to allow the suction cup to return to its previous neutral position, the cavity disappeared (as Figure 3. Compression tension apparatus Figure 4. Model B. Within a simulated wet joint space (without de-nucleated fluid) in a sealed condition (1), decompression and volume expansion results in expanding bubble formation (2-4) while return to initial tension and volume normalization results in bubble disappearance (5-6).J Can Chiropr was expected under Boyle's Law, which describes the in- verse relationship between pressure on the one hand and volume of an otherwise fixed amount of undissolved gas on the other hand). This sequence of events is depicted in Figure 4. W ith Model C in which distilled water within the simu- lated joint space was replaced by de-nucleated water, nei-ther central cup detachment nor gas cavity formation was observed when the suction cup was pulled with the same initial force as was used in Model B. In other words, with initial tension the centre of the suction cup did not release from the beaker wall but instead remained completely ad-herent to it. It is noteworthy that in the previous model employing nucleated fluid (Model B), bubble formation was observed immediately during traction, whereas in Model C employing denucleated fluid, gas bubble forma-tion was no longer evident early on. Only later with Mod-el C, when the suction cup was pulled with greater force did its centre detach from the surface. Moreover, upon detachment, a stable gas cavity formed in association with an audible crack. Also with Model C, when the suction cup was released and allowed to return to its baseline position, a visible cavity remained, and then disappeared only gradually over approximately 30 minutes. Finally, so long as a bubble or cavity remained visible to the naked eye, no further cracking sound could be elicited during re-pulling of the suction cup. On the other hand, once the bubble was no longer visible to the naked eye, an audible crack could again be elicited from the model (Figure 5). W ith Model D, we observed the same findings that we observed during experiments with Model C. More specif-ically, the experiment with de-nucleated Ringer's solution resulted in joint cracking and a corresponding refractory period that was identical to that of a model employing de-nucleated distilled water. W ith Model E, regardless of whether the joint was im- mersed in nucleated distilled water or nucleated Ringer's solution, the observed events were identical to those that were observed in Model B. In contrast, when either the distilled water or Ringer's solution was de-nucleated, our observations were identical to those obtained with Model C. Under Model E, we also were able to generate the crack - ing sound when the model was pulled off-axis, which we did in order to simulate cracking of a real knuckle joint in a partially flexed or non-neutral position (https://youtu.be/ TzC7PkgbHGA). W ith our final model, Model F, the application of com- Figure 5. Model C Within a simulated wet joint space (with de-nucleated fluid) in a sealed condition (1), decompression results in suction cup stretch without lift and without cavity (2). Suddenly, when sufficient tension is applied a cavity and sound spontaneously forms (3) and further decompression leads to increasing cavity volume formation. Relaxation of tension leads to enduring cavity (4) and over time, cavity size shrinks (5-6). The sequence 1-6 can then be repeated.38 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)A proposed in vitro model for investigating the mechanisms of 'joint cracking': a short report of preliminary techniques and observations pression through the joint (subsequent to cavity formation and an audible release) resulted in a reduction in the time required before cavity formation and joint cracking could be repeated. In this regard, the so-called refractory period without compression was previously 30 minutes, whereas the refractory period with joint compression was only 12 minutes. Qualitatively, we observed that the greater the amount of compression that was applied to the model, the shorter was the refractory time. Discussion We have introduced a series of in vitro models and a final model that will serve as a basis for our future investiga - tions into the mechanisms of synovial joint cracking. Our observations at this time are too anecdotal to warrant a full report, however they are presented here for the pur - pose of soliciting immediate comments and criticisms from the broader research community. In the meantime, a key preliminary finding is that the events we observed after replacing regular fluid with denucleated fluid (in Models C, D and E) are completely consistent with the same cavity formation and refractory period phenomena that is associated with the cracking of real synovial joints. Specifically, within a closed system employing denucle - ated fluid, as long as a bubble or cavity formation is vis-ible within the simulated joint space, a crack can not be repeated. In contrast, once the cavity disappears, a crack can again be elicited from the model. This behaviour of gas within liquid is typically inter- preted to reflect the dissolution of a spherical bubble by the forces of surface tension. Until its dissolution, a bub-ble acts as a gas nucleus (as observed in Model B) which permits formation of a larger visible gas cavity during de-compression of liquid within a closed system, but in the absence of generating an audible crack. Epstein and Ples-set derived equations that describe the time to dissolution of a bubble in relation to absolute pressure, dissolved gas tension, and surface tension. 11 Accordingly, in Model F, a reduced refractory period was both expected and ob-served, and ultimately reflected faster re-solution time in response to increased local absolute pressure. Admittedly , the precise timing of the crack in relation to the timing of bubble formation was not discernible from these preliminary experiments. At this time, it re-mains a mystery whether sound generation occurs before, after, or simultaneously to the time of cavity formation. The timing of the crack in relation to bubble formation will be the focus of our future work. Additionally, we plan to quantify corresponding forces, tensions, bubble sizes, and dissolution times through the use of multiple imaging methods (i.e., cinematography, ultrasound, and MRI). Conclusion In this brief report, an in-vitro model has been developed and proposed to investigate the origins of the cracking sound within synovial joints. So far, we have observed that when a de-nucleated fluid is introduced, decompres-sion of a sealed joint elicits both cavity formation and an audible event, similar to what occurs in human syn-ovial joints. Immediately afterward, a refractory period occurs during which an additional audible event cannot be elicited regardless of how much joint decompression or tension is applied. In contrast, if the fluid used in the model is nucleated, decompression of the simulated joint elicits cavity formation in the absence of an audible event. Additional measurement techniques will be developed and applied to this new model with the intent of better clarifying the mechanisms of in vivo joint cracking.

Both the cause of CPPD and the mechanism of onset of crystal deposition remain largely unknown and vastly debated throughout literature. 1,2 The formation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals is extracellular, however, pyro-phosphate is a by-product of several intracellular reac-tions thus unable to diffuse passively across the cell mem - brane. 1 It is unclear whether crystal deposition occurs as a result of extracellular pyrophosphate synthesis by plasma membrane-bound plasma cell glycoprotein 1 or whether pyrophosphate is transported across cell membranes by ankylosis human protein. 1 Causes of CPPD can be clas- sified into the following categories: idiopathic, metabol - ic, hereditary and post-traumatic.1 CPPD can be linked to underlying metabolic disorders hemochro - matosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypothyroidism, all of which in-crease the risk for calcium pyrophosphate deposition. 3 Numerous cases of CPPD have shown familial links in the ANKH gene, which functions to upregulate protein. 4 When the ANKH gene becomes mutated, protein activity is enhanced and thus extracellular pyrophosphate levels increase and promote the formation of pyrophosphate crystals leading to CPPD. 1,3,4 Despite attempts to deter - mine etiology, the majority of CPPD cases remain idio-pathic. 3,4 This condition has not yet shown an association with gender, obesity, or lifestyle characteristics, although it is slightly more common in Caucasian individuals. 1,2 CPPD has been documented most commonly in the knees, wrists, symphysis pubis and hips. 1 This condition is a common rheumatologic disease in elderly individuals, and is noted most often in knees and pelvis. 1 CPPD has been found to appear in one of three forms: asymptomatic, acute or chronic. 1 Asymptomatic patients most often dis- cover the deposit of pyrophosphate crystals through plain film radiographs for an alternative reason. 1 Acute CPPD, a presentation that is highly suggestive of acute crystal inflammation, is associated with the rapid development of joint pain, swelling, tenderness, warmth and restrict - ed movement, often reaching its maximum within 6-24 hours of symptom onset. 1 Chronic CPPD presents simi-for further assessment. The diagnosis of CPPD was confirmed and he was advised to take an anti-inflammatory if symptoms recurred and booked for further follow-up in six months. Summary: Although the presentation is less common, CPPD can present in the ankle joint and mimic other inflammatory disorders. Conservative treatment can be applied to treat acute symptoms and referral to a rheumatologist is suggested to monitor progress of this condition.

Staging for CPPD presentation includes the following categories: asymptomatic, acute, chronic, presenting with OA or as a pseudo-arthritide. 1,5 Common treatments that provide symptomatic relief in-clude conventional anti-inflammatory medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and cor - ticosteroids. 5 Although the progression of this condition may vary between individuals, most will experience re-current symptomatic episodes. 7 During acute attacks, patients often experience severe pain.7 Optimal and safe treatment for acute pain includes ice, temporary rest, intra-articular injections and joint aspiration. 7 Despite the incurable nature of this condition, the prognosis is good, as long as symptoms are controlled and patients are mon-itored for pre-disposing conditions that may be treatable and preventable. 8 The objective of this case report is to highlight a unique incidence of CPPD in the ankle, a less common location for this condition with minimal documentation in current literature. Additionally, this case report aims to provide health-care practitioners with a detailed case presenta - tion, radiographic findings, and potential treatment and management options for future patients with this case presentation.Case Presentation History and Physical Examination Findings A 36-year-old male initially presented to the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) campus clinic with a primary complaint of acute mechanical low back pain. He reported no comorbidities, medical history or medication use. At a subsequent visit, the patient re-ported a new complaint of an acutely swollen left ankle, with an onset of pain six days prior to his appointment. At this time, his back pain was resolved. There was no history of trauma to the ankle. Twenty-four hours after the onset of his ankle symptoms, he was woken up in the middle of the night by severe pain that resulted in the in-ability to fall back asleep. Over the course of the week-end, prior to his appointment, the ankle became swollen. The patient was self-medicating with ibuprofen, which helped to relieve but did not eliminate the pain. Follow-ing observation of the joint and orthopaedic testing of the ankle, all tests created pain due to palpation of the joint but no tests were positive for ligament injury or trauma. The patient was sent for diagnostic imaging in consideration of differential diagnoses of gout, pseudo-gout, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and septic arth-ritis. Imaging A plain-film radiographic series for the left ankle (Fig-ures 1 and 2) was taken in addition to a bilateral AP knee radiograph (Figure 3). There was adequate bone density with no osteochondral defects detected at the tibial pla-fond and talar dome. All bony joints appeared unremark - able, however blurring of Kager's fat pad was visualized. Radiographic findings included apparent chondrocalcin - osis with joint effusion in the talotibial joint, which is highly suggestive of pseudogout associated with CPPD. As well, there was subtle chondrocalcinosis of the me-nisci bilaterally visualized on the bilateral AP knee radio-graphs (Figure 3). Diagnosis, Treatment and Referral The patient was diagnosed, by plain-film radiography, with CPPD in the left ankle. At the time of writing, the patient did not receive any chiropractic treatment and was referred to a rheumatologist for further assessment. The patient declined conservative care, and was advised to J Can Chiropr Assoc Lubberdink, V Salerno, M Solomon treat the acute symptoms of CPPD at home and monitor his progress. Discussion Direct research evidence to support treatment recommen - dations are lacking therefore management strategies will vary according to the clinical presentation. Conservative treatment of CPPD is mainly symptomatic and often lim - ited due to the etiology of the disease. 1 Currently, there are no treatments that modify calcium pyrophosphate crystal formation or dissolution. 1 High-quality evidence is limited for non-pharmacological treatment interven-tions for managing CPPD, however, expert opinion recommends the use of cryotherapy and temporary rest during acute attacks. 7 Education is also an essential part of conservative care as it allows for patient involvement in the decision making process of their clinical manage - ment. 7 Patient-centered care is optimized when the patient understands the characteristics of their diagnosis, avail-able treatment options and associated benefits and risks. 7 The medical management of CPPD is challenging due to the fact that the condition is often associated with other disorders. The course of treatment often varies widely across patients depending on their specific health con-ditions and their unique case of CPPD. 5 Research shows the most common medications prescribed for CPPD are for symptomatic relief within the joint including conven-tional anti-inflammatory medications, such as NSAIDs. 5 However it is important to note since CPPD prevails in older patients, additional caution and careful considera - tions should be taken when recommending NSAIDS due to drug interactions and harmful side effects. A safer al-ternative is joint aspiration or intra-articular injection of glucocoricosteroids. 7 Glucocorticosteroids and joint aspiration have been shown to be a viable and effective option in the treatment of acute and painful CPPD attacks in addition to ice and rest. 7 Dosage recommendations, however, are vague and often based on clinical expertise and research related to the management of gout. 7 In addition to NSAID use, the management and treat - ment strategies should involve correcting the underlying metabolic abnormalities and treating the conditions. 5 Newer therapies that require more evidence include substances targeting anti-crystal formation (such as probenecid) as well as anti-inflammatory medications (such as methotrexate) that target interleukin pathways to prevent recurrent attacks. 5 At this time however, there is no definitive treatment available to dissolve the crystal deposits or prevent future crystal deposition. 5 Due to the incurable nature of this condition, CPPD is classified as a chronic disorder with recurrent episodes. The prognosis is good, as long as symptoms are controlled and patients are monitored. 8 Numerous clinical presentations of CPPD make diag- Figure 1. Left medial oblique ankle (left) and left AP ankle (right). Figure 2. Left lateral ankle. Figure 3. Bilateral AP knee - subtle chondrocalcinosis is visualized in pyrophosphate in the ankle joint: a case report nosing and treating this condition challenging. In this case specifically, CPPD targeted the menisci of the knees and the talotibial joint. A common location for CPPD includes, but is not limited to, the menisci of the knee and the patellofemoral joint, only one of which was seen in this case. It is apparent that there is irregular joint in-volvement, seeing that CPPD was also present in the an-kle, which is a less common location for this condition. Although CPPD is often associated with osteoarthritis, it is important to understand the difference in clinical pres-entation between the two conditions. A large proportion of patients with CPPD follow a progressive course of articu-lar degeneration in an irregular distribution pattern. 5 Typ- ically, around 50% of these individuals will experience acute attacks of pseudogout superimposed on their under - lying osteoarthritis, whereas the remaining present with classical osteoarthritis. 5 Features that distinguish CPPD from osteoarthritis include atypical joint distribution, presence of contractures and valgus knee deformities. 5 Clinically, CPPD has the potential to mimic several forms of inflammatory arthritic conditions resulting in a wide array of clinical manifestations. 5 These presentations in- clude asymptomatic or lanthanic chondrocalcinosis, acute pseudogout, pseudo osteoarthritis (with or without acute attacks), pseudo rheumatoid arthritis, pseudo-polymyal - gia rheumatica and pseudo-neuropathic arthropathy. 5 It is possible for CPPD to co-exist with other arthritic con-ditions, further complicating diagnosis and management strategies. Further research on diagnosing, managing and reducing calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition is es-sential seeing that CPPD and the associated CPPD-related arthropathies are likely to increase in prevalence due to the current aging population. 5 SummaryThis case report highlights a 36-year-old male patient who presented to a chiropractic clinic with an uncommon presentation of a common arthritic condition. Clinicians should take note of this unique presentation, as CPPD is prevalent in older, Caucasian populations and can often present concurrently with osteoarthritis. 1,7 It is imperative to understand which joints can be targeted by CPPD and what treatment options are available. As well, it is clinic - ally important to note the patient in this case report also had subtle findings of chondrocalcinosis in the menisci of the knees. Thus, inferring that if chondrocalcinosis is found in one joint in the body, there may be other joints in the body targeted as well. Further research is necessary to investigate the benefits of chiropractic care for the treat - ment and management of patients presenting with acute and chronic forms of CPPD, specifically with respect to providing pain relief and improving joint mobility.

The initial onset of pain may last up to several weeks 3 and subsequently transition to varying presentations of local paresis, sensory deficit, progressive weakness, or atrophy of the shoulder girdle and upper extremity musculature. 2 The variety of interchangeable symptoms reported with NA which may overlap with more commonly known dis-orders, multiple specialists often consulted by patients suffering from NA, and the lack of recognition of NA amongst health care providers can lead to lengthy dif-ferential diagnosis, delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis and mismanagement. 3 This syndrome was first reported in the 1880s by Dre-schfeld with many subsequent cases described over the next half century. 4 Parsonage and Turner introduced a de-scription of clinical characteristics associated with neural - gic amyotrophy in a series of 136 cases in 1948.4,5 Though Parsonage and Turner referred to this disorder as neural-gic amyotrophy, it has become commonly referred to as Parsonage-Turner syndrome as well. The exact etiology of NA is unknown and may occur as a sporadic condition, though it has also been shown to present as an autosomal dominant hereditary trait known as hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). 6 Though infectious and malignant causes have been recently discredited, there is some dis-cussion of possible autoimmune origin. 7 It is possible that NA may be a clinical entity which manifests itself as a collection of multiple underlying mechanisms, pheno-types, and prognoses, and not as a single disorder. 6 A lum- bosacral variant of NA exists and is known as lumbosac-ral radiculoplexus neuropathy which is more commonly known to occur in patients with mild type 2 diabetes. 7 Traditionally the prevalence of NA has been thought to be 2-4 cases per 100,000; though recent reports suggest an incidence rate of 1 per 1,000 per year. 7 NA is found to be more common in males than females, and most often presents in the second, third, and seventh decade of life. 8,9 While it seems NA is mostly known in the adult popula-tion, incidence of NA presenting in children and infants have been reported. 7 Recurrences are not uncommon and may appear in either the same extremity or an entirely new region. Manifestation of symptoms and symptom patterns may even emerge differently in reoccurrences as well. 7 Diagnosis of NA can be difficult due to the varying degree of patient presentation including severity and lo-spontaneous resolution of pain approximately 14 months post onset. Summary: NA is a poorly known clinical entity amongst health care providers and poses challenges in timely and proper diagnosis. Recognition of NA is important for patients to be best managed and for more optimal patient outcomes to be achieved. (JCCA. de de sant\u00e9, ce qui complique le fait de parvenir \u00e0 un diagnostic exact avec rapidit\u00e9. Il est important de reconna\u00eetre l'AN pour assurer une prise en atrophy. The differential diag- nosis requires clinicians to distinguish NA from periph-eral neuritis, radiculopathy, shoulder pathology, complex regional pain syndrome, rotator cuff injury, acute calcific tendonitis, adhesive capsulitis, cervical spine disorders, peripheral nerve compression, tumor, acute poliomyel - itis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, posterior interosseous nerve palsy 10,11 and costovertebral/costotransverse joint irritation. The goal of treatment largely focuses on pain management with additional attention paid to maintaining functionality of the affected limb, most commonly the shoulder and arm. As reported above, the prevalence of NA is quite low; furthermore the number of documented cases pre-senting to the chiropractic clinician is even smaller. To our knowledge, there are only two preceding reports of NA published in the chiropractic literature. 9,12 Both cases involved male patients in their thirties with an idiopathic acute onset of symptoms and electrodiagnostic evidence of neurologic involvement. Rix and colleagues described a patient that was improving with a combination of re-assurance, range of motion and strength exercises, though this patient was lost to follow-up. 12 Charles described a patient that had failed surgical pronator teres release and was subsequently treated with cervical manipulation, deep tissue therapy, and hand/finger exercise. 9 This latter case resulted in full functional and pain recovery after 12 treatment sessions. An improved ability for health care providers to recognize the distinct clinical manifestations of NA, formulate differential diagnosis, appreciate best management strategies, and understand prognoses asso-ciated with NA is needed. The objective of this article is to describe a patient with NA presenting to a private chiropractic practice and further discuss clinical presenta-tion, differential diagnosis, management, and prognosis of idiopathic NA. Case presentation An 85-year-old Caucasian male presented to a private chiropractic clinic with a chief complaint of right peri-scapular and lateral rib cage pain. The area of greatest pain was localized about the right inferolateral scapular border. Excluding this condition, he appeared to be in good health, ambulatory, and maintained an active life-style. The patient denied family history of related mus-culoskeletal disease or symptoms. The patient reported an unremarkable health history including no history of smoking, cardiovascular disease and a healthy weight throughout life. Past medical history was unremarkable. The patient's pain began with sudden onset of severe pain while lying in bed prior to waking in the early mor - ning period. His pain gradually decreased over the next few hours to a tolerable level. The following night the pain returned to a severe level and persisted for approximately 2 days. The patient presented to the local Emergency De-partment and was evaluated by electrocardiogram (EKG) which was unable to establish a cardiovascular causation. The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider. Upon primary care evalu-ation, further diagnostic studies were performed, includ - ing a second EKG and computed tomography (CT) of the chest which the patient reported revealed no abnormal findings. Subsequent referral to a cardiologist was given. Upon cardiology evaluation, the patient was determined to have vascular blockage, despite having no typical as-sociated symptomatology, and a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was recommended. CABG surgery was completed 4 months after initial complaint. The pa-tient began cardiac rehabilitation with a local physical therapist following surgery. At this time the patient re-ported that his chief complaint of right periscapular and lateral rib cage pain remained the same. The patient was referred to interventional pain medicine and spinal mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) of unknown regions was performed. These investigations revealed findings con-sistent with the patient's age and no definitive causation of pain was determined. The patient underwent two thor - acic nerve block procedures which yielded no substantial benefit with relief lasting only a few days. The patient was prescribed opioid medication which provided appre-ciable relief; however, the patient did not like taking this medication and wished to avoid taking them long term. The patient was subsequently referred for chiropractic care following a cardiac rehabilitation session in which the physical therapist noticed prominent right scapular winging. The patient presented for initial chiropractic evalua - tion 8 months following initial onset. Pain was reported to fluctuate between 5-8/10 on a numerical pain rating scale. The patient reported pain constant in nature which intensified in the evening. Provocative activities included raising the right arm and applying direct pressure to the 48 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Chiropractic management of a geriatric patient with idiopathic neuralgic amyotrophy: a case report shoulder blade region, such as sitting against the back of a chair. The patient reported noticing discomfort while seat-ed against the back of a chair soon after initial onset of pain, and described that prominent right scapular winging was noticed by a family member as well at this time. Physical examination revealed thoracic spine ranges of motion grossly within normal limits with pain noted at right rotational end range. Cervical ranges of motion were reduced in bilateral lateral flexion, extension, flexion, and bilateral rotation. Shoulder ranges of motion were grossly within normal limits bilaterally. Palpation revealed ten-sion and tenderness in the cervical and thoracic paraspinal musculature, greatest at the right levator scapula and right serratus anterior regions. Passive joint motion palpation revealed restricted mobility in the lower cervical and up-per thoracic spine regions. Sensory examination of the upper extremity was grossly intact to light touch. Gross motor strength testing of the upper extremity was within normal limits. Scapular movements were determined to be reduced and more difficult to achieve on the right com-pared to left. Visual inspection revealed winging of the right scapula measured at 2 inches on the right compared to \u00bd inch on the left. (Figure 1) Attempts to obtain past medical records and diagnostic studies were unsuccess-ful. Clinical diagnosis A working diagnosis was established with multifactorial consideration, including history and physical examin - ation findings. The patient was determined to be in the chronic musculoskleletal and paretic phase of neuralgic amyotrophy 1with residual biomechanical contribut - ed via paresis of the right serratus anterior. A thorough history and physical examination provided classic criteria indicating the diagnosis of NA, such as sudden onset of severe cervicothoracic/scapular pain initiating at night 1, lack of benefit with various musculoskeletal related inter - ventions1, presence of winging scapula1, lack of benefit with cardiac intervention, lack of appreciable sustained benefit from pain management interventions and a re-ported lack of abnormal findings of visceral origin upon diagnostic studies (in this instance, MRI, CT, and EKG). Chiropractic management and outcome The patient was placed on a treatment plan of 3 visits per week for duration of 4 weeks with treatment consisting of spinal manipulation administered to the thoracic spine, myofascial release therapy, and medium frequency elec - trical stimulation of the serratus anterior with an aim to reduce subjective pain levels. Additionally, scapular func-tion rehabilitation exercise therapy was included in the treatment plan with an objective to reduce functional lim - itations. A home exercise program (HEP) was established. A lumbar chair support was dispensed and prescribed to be used to encourage proper spinal posture and reduce discomfort associated with sitting in a chair. TENS de-vice was also dispensed to the patient for consideration as a self-care palliative relief strategy. The patient was provided with educational materials regarding the benign nature and treatment options for the management of neur - algic amyotrophy. The patient was referred to his primary care physician for co-management of the patient, particu-larly in relation to the patient's desire to discontinue his prescribed pain medication. The aforementioned trial of chiropractic care was carried out with which the patient Figure 1. Appearance of marked winging right scapula observed upon initial chiropractic examination. The patient presented for chiropractic evaluation approximately 8 months post onset of was willing and compliant. Upon completion of the initial treatment plan, a re-evaluation was performed reveal-ing no appreciable change in objective clinical findings. Numerical pain rating scale revealed improvement in pain levels, recorded at 0-1/10 at time of re-evaluation; though the patient reported daily fluctuation of pain, which some days reached a 7/10 rating. The patient expressed subject - ive value in pain relief and functional ability at this time, reporting ongoing treatment and HEP compliance pro-vided adequate pain relief comparable to relief obtained from previous opioid medication usage. The patient was recommended continued care for palliative relief aligning with the patient's values of maintaining non-prescriptive pain relief interventions. The patient elected to continue chiropractic care on an as needed basis with continuation of a daily HEP. The patient adhered to this treatment plan, presenting for an additional 18 chiropractic visits, and reported abrupt spontaneous resolution of symptoms six months after beginning chiropractic care.Discussion Presentation This case supplements two other known cases reported in the literature of chiropractic management of NA. Our case is unique in that it exemplifies the elusiveness of proper and timely diagnosis of NA and illustrates the po-tential of multiple and possibly unnecessary interventions for this particular syndrome. The patient in this case pre-sented with symptoms often typical to initial onset of NA such as severe acute onset of pain located in the shoul-der girdle and thorax/rib area which began in the early morning hours while in bed. Patients presenting with NA report cervical, shoulder, and/or arm pain in 96% of all cases. Pain levels are high and 90% of patients grade their initial onset of pain at 7 or greater on a Numerical Rating Scale. 1 Pain most commonly is reported at night and often there is no means of palliative relief at this time, with their pain spontaneously lessening. The pain can also present Table 1.

When present, shoulder girdle dysfunction results from scapular instability due to the functional loss of the serratus anterior, rhomboid, or the trapezius muscles. 1 The majority of patients will experi- ence additional periods of pain once the initial onset is over. 1 These subsequent pain experiences are thought to be the result of two consequences of the NA syndrome process. First, the irritated or injured nerves in the plexus can result in amplified mechanical sensitivity, producing neuropathic pain in the affected nerves' regions from in-creased strain on them with extension, abduction or ele-vation of the arm. This may last from a few weeks up to months in any given case. 1 Secondly, due to the dys- function associated with local neuromsuculoskeletal tis-sue such as local shoulder girdle muscular paresis, proper biomechanics may be strained and place excessive stress on compensating musculature resulting in ongoing pain throughout the progression of NA. 1 Differential diagnosisA thorough physical exam should be specific and com-plete to help distinguish between the multiple conditions which may present with similar features as NA. One of the hallmark signs of NA presenting in the upper extremity is substantial scapular winging and scapular dyskinesia. Though serratus anterior paresis is commonly thought to be the main offended musculature resulting in musculo-skeletal asymmetry/abnormalities, other muscles of the shoulder girdle may be affected resulting in presentations. For example, trapezius paresis may cause an appearance of a depressed shoulder and scapular sagging. 1 Many pa- tients will subsequently develop musculoskeletal related pain in the region of the compensating musculature, often including periscapular region. 1 Sensory examination of NA patients may reveal a non-specific pattern that is not consistent with localiza -tion of pain or regular dermatomal distribution related to the paresis of affected musculature 7, though could show pain with palpation of the affected peripheral nerve. How-ever it is important to recognize that sensory deficits and hypersensitivity may dissipate in weeks to months post-onset. 1 NA is a clinical diagnosis and does not have a gold standard laboratory, diagnostic, or specific imaging test to give a definitive diagnosis 7 though some studies sug- gest utilization of electroneuromyography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in confirming diagnosis. 4 Previous studies have reported appreciable change in electroneuromyography studies identified as early as three weeks post onset of symptoms. 4,13 These alterations typically entail acute denervation and sugges-tion of situational axonal degeneration. 4 Though these studies are sensitive for identifying denervation, assum-ing NA will lead to denervation might only be partially accurate as sampling error leading to a negative study is possible. 7 Sensory nerve conductio n studies have also been shown to be a poor study in assessing for the presence of NA. These studies have been reported to fail to show abnormalities in 80% of patients with NA, even when the affected nerves are examined. 7 Thus, a normal sensory nerve conduction study should not eliminate the inclusion of NA in the differential diagnosis. 7 MRI findings asso- ciated with NA include intramuscular edema and muscle atrophy, which may show associated fatty infiltration. 4,14,15 It is important, though, to emphasize the notion that diag-nostic studies indicating these findings should be viewed as only one piece of the entire clinical picture. These diag-nostic studies results should not be used to rule out the clinical diagnosis of NA, but can be used as additional rationale for the confirmation of the diagnosis. 16 In this case, the patient reported prior diagnostic stud- ies, though could only recall the use of electrocardiogram, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance studies. It is not known if an electroneuromyography study was administered. It appears that diagnostic studies utilized in this case provided ability to aid in confirmation of NA diagnosis. In spite of the many conditions that may be considered part of the differential diagnosis, a meticulous history and physical exam should help to distinguish NA from other considerations. 7 Nonetheless, NA and its diagnosis seem J be relatively foreign to many health care providers7 and delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis and mismanagement are not uncommon. In this case, the patient completed mul-tiple treatment options for several months with minimal relief. The patient in this case identified as presenting with common features associated with NA and responded well to a subsequent course of chiropractic treatments and self-care treatments for ongoing management of symptoms. Management and Prognosis Failure to properly identify neuralgic amyotrophy, par - ticularly in the acute phase, can lead to substantial mis-management and potential for suffering for several weeks. Approaches to care may focus primarily on conservative treatment options including manual and rehabilitation therapy, as well as traditional medical treatment options including long acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, opioids, and corticosteroid injection. 7,17,18 During the initial unrelenting pain presentation there is only pharmaceutical options and corticosteroid injection that have been shown to potentially manage symptoms and hasten recovery. 1,7,17,18 Manual and rehabilitation therapy may be indicated due to the biomechanical changes that ensue in the latter phase of NA. The objective of these treatments is to sta-bilize the musculoskeletal system about the area of insult. Often NA presents in the lower neck and shoulder region and thus typical therapy involves stabilizing the scapula by strengthening the various muscles around the shoulder girdle. 1 The serratus anterior muscle is frequently a site of local paresis and presents a hurdle for therapy creating an inability to produce and maintain proper shoulder mech - anics and muscular endurance. Thus, a graded progres-sion must be utilized to allow for strengthening while not fatiguing the muscles to the point that they contribute to further shoulder and scapular dysfunction. Improving sta-bilization about the shoulder girdle and reducing the pres-ence of scapular winging is important in the long-term success of patient suffering from NA. Potential goals of treatments aim to restore faulty movement patterns and reduce biomechanical imbalances that may have resulted from adaptive alterations from NA. V arious other treatment options have shown some indi- cation for continued study to further assess for their ability to aid in the management of NA patients. There is some thought of autoimmune influence in the manifestation of NA and thus some treatment efforts have been focused on associated management with immunomodulants such as prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulins and other pro-phylactic immunotherapies. 7 However, few studies have been conducted in this area of NA management and to date there is no conclusive evidence to recommend this mode of intervention. Surgical intervention for NA pa-tients suffering from substantial nerve injury, consisting of hourglass constriction (shown by intraoperative visual-ization or nerve ultrasound), has shown some prelimin - ary success. 7,19,20 Future studies are still needed, though, to determine if surgical intervention is a viable routine treatment option. 7 Patients generally regain strength in affected paretic muscles, though roughly one-third of NA patients still re-port some form of dysfunction or symptom even six years post initial presentation. 1,7 Previous studies have shown no well-defined link between neurological considerations and functional outcomes or a specific natural course; though studies have identified a strong association be-tween persistent pain, fatigue and the presence of scapular instability. 7,21,22 LimitationsThis is a case report which only describes the findings of this individual case. The findings of this study cannot be generalized to other patients or the general public. Reso-lution of symptoms in this case may not have been related to chiropractic care and may have been due to the natural progression of NA. In this case there was no availability of past medical records or diagnostic studies for review. This case relied heavily on communication with the pa-tient and obtaining a thorough patient history, which is subject to potential recall bias. Summary This case features the importance of timely recognition and proper diagnosis of NA. Recognition of NA can be difficult due to the nature of NA as a clinical diagnosis which does not have a gold standard laboratory, diagnos-tic or specific imaging test to establish a definitive diag-nosis, and the fact that it mimics so many other etiologies. Prompt recognition of common features associated with NA and differentiation from other diagnostic consider - ations can be appreciated with a thorough history and examination, which identifies the classic criteria for a 52 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Chiropractic management of a geriatric patient with idiopathic neuralgic amyotrophy: a case report diagnosis of NA. Prognosis is commonly characterized by fragmented recovery from symptoms associated with NA, with a potential for an extended length of time for resolution and recurrence and continued reports of some degree of residual dysfunction are common even up to several years after initial onset.

Top-ranked nominees were invited to a training workshop.

The mission of the CCGI is to develop, disseminate and help implement CPGs among Canadian chiropractors. 11 Prior work explored the determinants of guideline ad- herence among health care professionals using the Theor - etical Domain Framework (TDF)12, a framework previ- ously applied in a wide range of disciplines, settings and contexts13. Interviews of chiropractors and professional leaders in Canada14,15 suggested that guideline adherence is potentially influenced by the theoretical domains of social influence and social/professional role and identity. In other words, the set of behaviours and personal qual-ities displayed in social or work settings (social influence) and the processes existing between people that have the potential to influence thoughts, feelings or behaviours (social/professional role and identity) can lead to behav-iour change. 16 Mapping of Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs)17 on to these theoretical domains suggested that social processes of encouragement, pressure, support, and modeling/demonstration of behaviour are important techniques for changing professional behaviour 15. Change agents (people who, by the nature of their position or abilities are particularly capable of promoting change) are well suited to accomplish these BCTs. This is partly because peer pressure to conform to social norms affects behavioural intention, an important predictor of individ - uals' behaviour. 18 Implementation research supports the use of change agents, including practitioners, to deliver evidence-based recommendations and programs to improve the quality of care. 19,20 Opinion leaders (OLs) are individuals who have formal or informal influence on the attitudes, beliefs and additional OLs and BPCs. Recommended names were screened by OLs and final selection made by consensus. Webinars were utilized to train BPCs to engage peers in best practices, and facilitate guideline dissemination. Results: In Phase 1, 21 OLs were selected from 80 nominees. Sixteen attended a training workshop. In Phase 2, 486 chiropractors recommended 1126 potential BPCs, of which 133 were invited to participate and 112 accepted. Conclusions: OLs and BPCs were identified across Canada to enhance the uptake of research among chiropractors.

As respected members of a community, their spheres of in-fluence provide an opportunity for long-term subsistence of an initiative, long after active intervention has conclud-ed. 25 Reviews on the effectiveness of OL interventions suggest that a 12% absolute increase in compliance with an intervention may be expected when using OLs to pro-mote evidence-based practice. 26 By extension, best practice collaborators (BPCs) can also be seen as important change agents. Here BPCs are defined as individuals who are also seen as caring, know-ledgeable and good educators and who assist the OLs in their role. Recognizing the use of change agents as an important strategy to influence professional behaviour change, the current paper outlines the strategy used by the CCGI to identify and train OLs and BPCs to promote the use of best practice within the Canadian chiroprac-tic profession broadly (i.e., practicing chiropractors and leaders of national and provincial associations, regula-tory boards, liability insurance carriers, and other stake-holders). MethodsPhase 1: Opinion Leaders The aim of Phase 1 was to appoint OLs to assist the CCGI with the dissemination and implementation of CPGs among Canadian chiropractors and support professional leaders engaged in the process of guideline implementa - tion. Study design A cross-sectional research design was employed to iden-tify OLs in the chiropractic profession in all 10 provinces across Canada. Participants and recruitment CCGI stakeholders, professional leaders of national and provincial chiropractic associations and regulatory boards in Canada (n=50) who attended an annual meeting in February 2014 were asked to complete a survey question-naire. Survey questionnaire The questionnaire asked participants to provide up to three names of Canadian chiropractors they felt to be suit-able to serve as OLs as well as their reasons to nominate. Nominations were based on the chiropractors' skills and attributes, specifically, whether they were educationally influential, knowledgeable and humanistic, along with their sphere of influence (i.e., clinicians and/or profes-sional leaders/decision makers)(Appendix 1). 27 Data collectionFor each nominee, general demographic and practice data were collected from internet searches on publicly avail - able search engines such as Google and social media, the practitioner's clinic website and provincial/regulatory websites. Data gathered from these searches were com-plemented by information provided by the members of the selection committee based on knowledge of the can-didate through prior work (described below). A candidate profile was established in an Excel spreadsheet for each nominee, including their gender, the number of years in practice, their participation (or not) in continuing educa-tion activities, presentations given to their peers, academ - ic and publication record, and the presence/absence of prior liability issues or regulatory complaints. Data analysis A 10-member selection committee of CCGI stakeholders was established to review the candidate profiles. To ob-tain a wide range of views, perspectives and professional experience, the committee was composed of a purpos-ive sample from diverse geographical settings including members of a chiropractic specialty college (n=2), a field practitioner (n=1), academics (n=2), leaders from prov-incial associations and regulatory boards (n=3), and re-searchers (n=2). T o guide the selection process, committee mem - bers considered pre-established criteria adapted from Rycroft-Malone 27 to help inform their selection, including geographical location, past and current level of engage - ment with the profession, availability, attitudes and be-liefs toward evidence-based practice and CPGs, and prior teaching experience. Other desirable attributes included 56 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Selecting and training opinion leaders and best practice collaborators: experience from the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative Self-reporting method (CCGI stakeholders propose themselves) Screening Invited Eligibility Identifying Peer Nomination Method (CCGI stakeholders propose up to 3 names of potential candidates) Potential CCGI Opinion Leaders (n = 80) Characteristics extracted Licensed in Canada Gender Years in practice Participation in continuing education activities Lecturing to peers Academic and publication record Presence or absence of a history of liability issues or regulatory complaints Criteria for consideration Rounds 1 -3 Attitudes and beliefs toward evidence -based practice and guidelines Past and current level of engagement with the profession Prior teaching experience Perceived credibility across different professional groups Authority and presence Communication skills Ability to convince colleagues about issues related to clinical practice Ability to treat all colleagues with respect Geographical location Availability CCGI stakeholders invited to complete the survey questionnaire (n=50) Round 1 : Candidates (n=48) ranked for Practitioners (n=21 ), Decision Makers (n=9), Both (n= 18) Candidates selected and initially invited to participate (n=21) , Declined/withdrew (n=9), additional candidates invited (n=5) Ranking Candidate profiles to ascertain eligibility as Opinion Leaders (n = 79) Round 2 : Candidates with a mean score >5.5/7 ranked as 1st, 2nd & 3rd choices (n=35) ; Practitioners (n=12 ), Decision Makers (n= 7), Both (n= 16) CCGI Opinion Leaders appointed April 2015 (n=17), additional appointments after Nov 2015 (n=5) .

Flowchart illustrating the systematic process used to identify Canadian chiropractic Brockhusen being perceived as being credible and/or as an authority figure by their peers, having good communication skills, treating all colleagues with respect, and being capable of influencing colleagues about issues related to clinic - al practice (Figure 1). Potential OLs needed to have ex-perience dealing with a range of practicing chiropractors (e.g. working in solo vs. multidisciplinary practices, those with an evidence-based vs. alternative philosophy, and non-specialist vs. specialist chiropractors) and different professional groups. The commit tee formally met online on three occasions between June and August 2014 to undertake a two-round consensus process to identify nominees that would be invited to become OLs. In round 1, members of the se-lection committee considered the above criteria to rank candidates using a Likert scale from 1-7 (\"1\" = strongly disagree and \"7\" = strongly agree) on their likelihood of being influential toward practitioners and/or stakeholders. Mean scores were calculated and candidates with scores over 5.5 out of 7 were considered in the next round. In round 2, names retained were grouped by province and ranked by committee members as first, second and third choices. In round 3, committee members reached consen-sus over the top 2-3 candidates. These were then invited by e-mail to serve as OLs. A follow-up call was made by the project lead (AB) to provide detail about the OL program and answer any questions they had about the program. Other nominated individuals were kept in the retained list. Results CCGI stakeholder survey response rate was 38% (19/50), providing names of 80 potential OLs (Figure 1). One can-didate was from the US and was excluded. In round 1, median scores across identified potential OLs were 5.19 (0.73) for 'Practitioners' and 5.44 (0.75) for 'Leaders/de - cision makers'. To retain 40% of potential OLs, candi - dates with scores of 5.5 or above (n=48) were considered in the next round, including OLs for 'Practitioners' (n=21), 'Leaders/decision makers' (n=9) or nominated in both categories (n=18). In round 2, 35 candidates ranked as either first, second and third choices were retained for the following round, including potential OLs for 'Prac-titioners' (n=12), 'Leaders/decision makers' (n=7) and 16 for both 'Practitioners' and 'Leaders/decision makers' roles. In round 3, the selection committee made final rec-ommendations for 21 OLs, including two in each prov-ince with the exception of a larger province (three in On-tario and Quebec) and a smaller province (one in Prince Edward Island). Of the 21 clinicians and professional leaders/decision makers in the profession who received an invitation letter to become a CCGI OL, 5 declined due to time constraints or lack of interest. Five alternate can-didates were invited from the retained list and, of these, 4 withdrew for similar reasons, leaving 17 OLs. Because some new OLs admitted to having limited availability for this project, additional appointments were made from the retained list in November 2015 for Nova Scotia (n=1), and in March 2016 for Saskatchewan (n=1) and Alberta (n=3), bringing the total number of OLs in place to 22 by May 2016. The names of OLs in each province are avail - able at: http://www.chiropractic.ca/guidelines-best-prac- tice/about-us/meet-the-team/opinion-leaders/. Training workshop for Opinion Leaders Sixteen OLs were available to attend a one-day workshop in Toronto, Ontario in February 2015. While participation in the OL program is voluntary, traveling expenses were reimbursed. The session was co-developed and delivered by a Certified Executive Leadership Coach with the as-sistance of three academic researchers with clinical train - ing in chiropractic (AB, MM, DG) and one chiropractor and medical student (SB) and a research manager. Con-tent of the workshop was informed by the literature and addressed five essential activities of the implementation process: engaging, planning, reflecting, executing and evaluating. 28 The workshop objectives and agenda can be found in Appendix 2. T wo weeks prior to the workshop participants received an online invitation to complete the Strength Deployment Inventory (SDI\u00ae), a tool aimed at assessing self-aware-ness, conflict resolution and team functioning strategies. 29 During the workshop, the Certified Executive Leadership Coach presented the results of the self-assessments, aim - ing to raise the self-awareness of participants and form-ing the basis for enhancing their ability to communicate more effectively, handle conflict more productively, and improve relationships. This was further explored in the context of the roles and personal qualities of effective OLs. Participants were asked to identify stakeholders who they could directly or indirectly influence. Participants 58 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Selecting and training opinion leaders and best practice collaborators: experience from the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative were then divided into three groups to identify potential audiences they had access to regionally (e.g. patients, de-cision-makers, clinicians, multidisciplinary teams) and determine those upon which they had the most/least influ-ence. After a brief overview of the content of the CCGI website (www.chiroguidelines.org), participants were given time to explore its resources and tools. Comments received in the end-of workshop feedback questionnaire suggested that this activity successfully addressed an im-portant need of OLs to become familiar with CCGI tools and resources on CPGs and EIP. T o provide insight about the OLs' expectations about their participation in the workshop, attendees were asked to do a '3-2-1 exercise', listing three important things they had learned during the workshop, two questions they felt remained unanswered, and one suggestion for next steps. Results from the exercise indicated a need for addi-tional resources to help with their tasks, such as summar - ies of key guideline recommendations, PowerPoint pres-entations for board meetings or continuing educational events, a Question and Answer sheet to address potential questions by clinicians, and patient handouts and post-ers. Participants were invited to draft an 'Opinion Leader Action Plan' to identify upcoming opportunities of influ-ence and to outline the perceived needs for resources from the CCGI. A detailed summary of the workshop was forwarded to the participants with an invitation to attend a follow-up teleconference call. During periodic follow-up teleconfer - ence calls, OLs provided updates on their progress and their plans for dissemination in their respective provinces. Phase 2: Best Practice Collaborators The aim of phase 2 was to confirm the additional OL se-lection and appoint additional OLs and BPCs to comple - ment and assist trained OLs. Study design A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted on-line 20 months after phase 1 (REB Approval: 1507X01, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College). Participants and recruitment An invitation to complete a 10-minute national online survey was sent by the Canadian Chiropractic Associ-ation (CCA) by e-mail to all members with a valid e-mail address (n=7200). It included a description of the study and a link to access the survey. Those who returned their completed survey were eligible to win one of two $100 Indigo gift cards. Survey questionnaire The survey was adapted from Hiss' sociometric question-naire administered to care providers 30,31 and was divided into four sections (Appendix 3). Section I contained eight questions to find out how respondents give/receive infor - mation from colleagues (e.g. In general, do you talk to other chiropractors about clinical or professional issues in chiropractic practice?). They had to indicate, on a 5-point Likert scale, the answer that best represented their be-haviour (\"1\" = Never and \"5\" = Very often). In section II, respondents were asked to provide the names of three chiropractors in their province who best fit the following roles: educator, knowledgeable practitioner, and caring professional. In section III, the survey asked respondents to suggest up to 18 names of colleagues they would turn toward for: 1) their ability to give good advice, 2) discuss-ing challenging cases, 3) information on referrals resour - ces, and 4) socializing. Section IV asked 10 demographic questions about participants and their practice. Data collection Data collection took place over a three-week period in the fall of 2015. The survey was available in English and in French and delivered on FluidSurveys (www.fluidsur - veys.com). Data was submitted by respondents electron - ically immediately after completion and a list of all the proposed names of CCGI collaborators were entered into an Excel spreadsheet by province. Data analysis To further refine the list of names proposed by clinicians, OLs selected in phase 1 were asked to indicate if they con-sidered the individuals nominated as potential BPCs had the skills and attitudes required to help accomplish their tasks to promote EIP, guidelines and best practice. They were asked to classify the nominees in one of three cat - egories: 1) In my opinion, this candidate carries influence over their peers in the area of evidence-informed practice; 2) In my opinion, this candidate does not carry influence over their peers in the area of evidence-informed practice; Brockhusen or 3) I do not know this person. Individual opinion leaders in each province then independently rated the nominees who they knew in their region, and who they classified in the first category mentioned above. Best-rated candidates were placed on a short list based on personal knowledge of OLs and Phase 1 criteria. Final selection of short-listed nominees was made by consensus by the existing team of OLs in each province during a teleconference. The num-ber of nominees selected varied according to context (e.g. size of the province) and perceived local needs (e.g. dis-tance between communities). Results A total of 486 Canadian chiropractors submitted their completed survey, providing a response rate of ap-proximately 6% (Figure 2). Results indicate that a major - ity of respondents were male (53.7%), between the age of 25 and 45 years (66.0%), and in full time practice (86.4%) Canadian chiropractors invited to complete the survey questionnaire on identifying chiropractic opinion leaders (n=7200) Identifying Chiropractors completed the survey (n=486) Potential OLs nominated by peers (n=1126) Screening Criteria for consideration Gender Years in practice Attitudes and beliefs toward evidence -based practice and guidelines Past and current level of engagement with the profession Communication skills Ability to convince colleagues about issues related to clinical practice Ability to treat all colleagues with respect Geographical location Availability Absence of a history of liability issues or regulatory complaints Candidates licensed in Canada (n=1077) Nominees identified by existing opinion leaders as influential in the area of evidence - informed practice and invited to participate (n=129) Eligibility Characteristics extracted Licensed in Canada Nominees accepting invitation to participate as CCGI BPCs (n=112) Invited Figure 2: Flowchart illustrating the systematic process used to identify CCGI BPCs60 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Selecting and training opinion leaders and best practice collaborators: experience from the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative (Table 1). The largest percentage of participants was from Ontario (44.3%). Survey respondents volunteered names of 1077 colleagues from Canada, 47 individuals from the US and 2 from the UK. Among these, 338 were nomin-ated between 2-3 times, 132 between 4-7 times and 36 people over 8 times. All but one of the OLs selected in phase 1 were nominated within the top five choices in their province. OLs in place helped reduce the list to 129 names they believed had favourable attitudes and skills to assist them with their tasks as CCGI OLs. The potential BPCs received a letter informing them of the results of the survey and were asked if they were interested in collabor - ating with OLs in their respective province. A total of 112 chiropractors accepted the invitation to become BPCs. The list of names is available at: https://www.chiroprac- tic.ca/guidelines-best-practice/about-us/meet-the-team/best-practice-collaborators/.Training of Best Practice CollaboratorsBPC nominees in each province were invited to attend a 45-minute webinar describing the mission and relat-ed strategies of the CCGI, the current role of OLs, and their potential contribution as BPCs (Table 2). BPCs were asked to help OLs promote the use of best practices using their own network of colleagues. OLs were encouraged to engage with new BPCs to discuss respective views about the CCGI mission and strategies, possible roles and con-tribution of collaborators and their availability for future guideline dissemination projects, as well as to ensure that they have access to and become familiar with the CCGI bi-lingual website, available tools (e.g., online learning mod-ules on EIP and guidelines) and resources. Participation in these various activities aims to provide BPCs with a base-line understanding of the work of the CCGI and to help them perform their new role. A Competency Development Program was developed for OLs and BPCs along with as-sociated performance indicators, including topics such as demonstrating adequate knowledge, effective communi-cation and ability to develop networks with colleagues to help disseminate best practice (Appendix 4). Discussion Chiropractors across Canada occupying key positions within provincial, national and international organizations and academic institutions were identified and trained to serve as OLs or BPCs. In addition to facilitating the up-take and application of guidelines to improve chiropractic patient care within their networks, these individuals will help raise the credibility and visibility of the CCGI. Engaging team members tasked with implementing best practice and guidelines is often-overlooked.32 It is vital that members be carefully and thoughtfully selected or allowed to rise naturally, especially those considered to be 'implementation leaders' and 'champions'. 22 The decision about who to invite as OLs and BPCs for this project was informed by the scientific literature 27,30,31 and group consensus. There are different conceptualizations of OLs 21,33, one of which proposes that there are two types of OLs: experts and peers. Expert OLs exert influence through their authority and status, while peer OLs exert influence through their representativeness and credibil - ity. 34 CCGI OLs and BPCs include a mixture of these types, and results from the stakeholder survey undertaken in phase II affirmed the committee's selection.Table 1: Profile of survey participants (November 2015) CharacteristicsProportion n (percentage) Gender (n=339) Male: 182 (53.7%) Table 2: Roles and activities of CCGI Best Practice Collaborators Roles and activities of CCGI Best Practice Collaborators Education Discuss key guideline recommendations with clinicians; Support the implementation of best practice among the profession in their own area, in collaboration with existing local CCGI opinion leaders; Participate in or lead activities, groups or events.

Advancing the profession Raise awareness of the most recent research and encourage clinicians to use it in practice. 62 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)Selecting and training opinion leaders and best practice collaborators: experience from the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative Early accomplishments of the OL/BPC program Although this program is still in its infancy, several activ-ities have already taken place across Canada, including presentations of the EIP approach and CCGI resources to clinicians and chiropractic students, communications with physicians and presentations to insurance companies to raise awareness of the chiropractic guidelines (Table 3). Next steps Monitoring the success of this program will be accom - plished in multiple ways. For instance, evaluations will be conducted on the implementation process. Process indicators will include the frequency, type and quality of OL and BPC encounters with practitioners and lead - ers/decision makers, and whether OLs are appropriately supported/equipped/trained to complete their task. Social Network Analysis will be used to map and measure the relationships between actors, the patterns of these rela -tionships, and the flow of resources (e.g., knowledge, sup-port) between actors. 35 OL and BPCs' roles and activities will be revisited, ex- panded, refined, and re-evaluated throughout the course of implementation of the program. For instance, the se-lection committee agreed that the list of OLs should be reviewed every 2 years. Based on achieved outcomes, we may elect to update the selection process and offer tailored training programs to new OL and BPC partici - pants. The CCGI OL/BPC program has a number of strengths, including a structured process to identify and train chiro-practic OLs. Since the context and opportunities for struc-turing dissemination of CPGs can vary greatly between geographical settings (e.g.: population size, culture, en-vironment - urban vs. rural, professional structures) each region remains independent in the conduct of its activ - ities, the local context being at the core of change im-plementation, nonetheless promoting the same guideline recommendations. 36,37 This however represents a chal-Table 3.

While every attempt was made to maximize the response rate in the survey administered to chiropractors, we are unable to determine the generalizability of our findings to the total population of Canadian chiropractors; this is partly because our sample was a convenience sample of mem - bers of the CCA limited to those with e-mail addresses who did not previously opt-out from receiving these. Im-portantly, it remains to be shown whether this long-term investment strategy will significantly increase uptake of EIP and CPGs in chiropractic and improve chiropractic care and patient health. Conclusion The CCGI identified OLs and BPCs across Canada as a strategy to enhance the uptake of best practice and guide-line recommendations among clinicians, decision-mak - ers/professional leaders and patients. Respected and in-fluential individuals have been tasked to leverage their spheres of influence to reach out to field clinicians and other stakeholders. This initiative stands to improve the use of research evidence in practice by chiropractors and key leaders in Canada and, ultimately, patient care.

All efforts to ensure anonymity have been attempted.In 2004, a 61-year-old male presented to a chiropractic clinic complaining of neck pain after hearing a 'crunch' when getting out of bed that morning. The initial history intake and physical examination identified no red flags or indications for the patient' s pain, with the exception of traction being pain-provoking. Conventional radiographs were ordered, which identified a pathological burst fracture of the fourth cervical vertebra. This Imaging Case Review (ICR) is to provide clinicians with a follow-up to the patient' s care and current state.

The report identified extensive osteolytic destruction of the vertebral body with exten - sion into the pedicles and superior articular processes. The fracture appeared chronic and included retropulsion of the bone and 50% spinal canal compromise. The radiologist suggested multifocal osteolytic lesions with a chronic pathologic fracture of C4. On the same day, an abdomen and pelvis CT was ordered which showed no intra-ab - dominal metastasis. For a week following admission to the hospital, the patient received chest radiographs, which identified lobar atelectasis. After two weeks in hospital, his liver enzymes increased, though no cause was found on abdominal ultrasound. By February 4 th 2004, he was stable and able to begin chemotherapy through a periph-erally inserted central catheter line, which was inserted in the cavoatrial region. On the same day, the patient under - went a cervical and thoracic spine CT to assess for fur - ther bony destruction, which revealed that the pathologic fracture had not yet healed. The severe spinal canal sten-osis had progressed to 9mm width at its narrowest 2. The osteolytic lesions had expanded into the ribs and there was greater than 50% bone destruction at C6, and near complete replacement of bone in T5 with erosion through the posterior cortex into the spinal canal. Although the T5 vertebral body height was preserved, the radiologist warned of imminent pathological fracture at that level. In March 2004, a cervical spine CT with contrast was ordered. The C4 pathological fracture had further col-lapsed with increased retrolisthesis of C3 on C4. Mild cord compression was noted. By April 2004, these findings had stabilized, and no further progression of findings was noted on monthly monitoring follow-ups. In late August 2004, a cervical spine CT without contrast revealed min- Figure 2.

The surgery was performed with a metal plate and screws bridging C3-C5. On post-surgical follow up imaging, there remained mild retrolisthesis of C3 on C4 but with marked improvement in alignment and sten-osis. Final radiographs performed in late October 2004 confirmed that the fusion was stable without subluxation on flexion-extension views. The case report on this patient was published in March 2016.1 The patient is currently receiving follow up as- sessments every six months from his oncologist and has ceased chiropractic management. The most recent radio-graphs are shown in Figure 4. The key imaging features and aetiologies for pathological burst fractures are listed in Table 1. As discussed previously1 this case serves to emphasize that it is pertinent to recognize the limited accuracy of many orthopaedic tests. In this case, clinical examination failed to reveal a pathologic fracture of the cervical spine that was ultimately identified radiographically. This case further illustrates the need for practitioners to be diligent in their clinical assessment of patients, to be aware of subtle signs of disease processes, and to utilize diagnos-tic imaging when appropriate in ruling out possible sinis-ter differential diagnoses. These rare cases do present in chiropractic offices and with diligent and attentive care, the likelihood of a positive outcome increases. Key Messages Diligence is essential in the clinical assessment of subtle signs of disease processes Although rare, cases of pathologic spinal fractures do present to chiropractic offices Radiographic intervention is the diagnostic tool of choice to confirm a pathological fracture References 1.

Moreover, such cases are non-existent in the peer-reviewed chiropractic literature. Some controversy exists over the optimal (surgical vs. non-surgical) treatment of severe AC joint injuries. Published reports of nonoperative management for grade V injuries of the AC joint are also scarce. This case review highlights the plain film imaging and conservative management of a 57-year-old patient diagnosed with an acute Rockwood type V AC joint separation. Radiographs with nine years of follow-up are presented.

The injury occurred when he landed awkward-ly from a jump and somersaulted over the handlebars of his bike, jamming his left shoulder hard into the ground. He felt immediate excruciating pain, but did not seek medical attention. He applied ice to his shoulder multiple times at home over the next two days before presenting to the chiropractic clinic. The pain severity at the time of presentation was graded as a nine out of a possible 10. On examination, there was notable swelling and deformity of the left acromioclavicular (AC) joint with elevation of the left clavicle. Manual palpation revealed extreme laxity along with complete separation of the distal clavicle from the acromion process. Upper limb neurological and vas-cular examination was normal. Left shoulder joint radio-graphs, including an anteroposterior view of the left AC joint, revealed widening of the AC joint and an increased coracoclavicular (CC) space (measuring 32 mm), along with marked elevation of the clavicle (Figure 1). The pa-tient was diagnosed with an acute grade V separation of the left AC joint. According to the Rockwood classification1, there are six types of AC joint injuries (Table 1). Types I and II are typically treated conservatively while types IV to VI are often treated surgically. 1-3 The optimal (i.e. surgical versus non-surgical) management of Rockwood types III and V AC injuries nevertheless remains controversial. 2-5 For instance several studies have shown equally good clinical outcomes in patients treated non-surgically, ver - sus surgically, for these types of AC joint dislocations. 2,4-6 However, radiographic and/or cosmetic outcomes tend to be better in such patients with surgical intervention. 2-4,7 Given the potential for risks and complications with sur - gery2-7, some authors continue to advocate for a 'conserv- ative-first' approach to managing severe AC joint injur - ies8. For the clinician, patients with these types of injuries are advised to have both surgical and non-surgical con-sultations. In each individual case one has to consider the benefits and risks associated with surgical and non-sur - gical conservative management. Presently the outcomes with both plans of management are highly variable and require further study. The patient in this case was referred to his family phys-ician to evaluate the need for orthopedic surgical consul-tation. Based on the patient's preference as well as the absence of 'red flags', such as neurovascular or pulmon-ary compromise, non-surgical conservative therapy was recommended. The patient subsequently returned to the chiropractor and was treated as follows: ultrasound ther - apy (3.0 MHz, 1.0 W/cm 2, 50% pulse, eight minutes) was Figure 1. Initial anteroposterior radiograph reveals superior elevation of the left clavicle (arrow) and marked widening of both the AC joint space (22 mm) and CC (coracoclavicular) space (32 mm). Table 1.

After 12 visits (over eight weeks), the patient's left clavicle was still superiorly displaced but his shoulder range of motion was normal and his AC joint was pain-free. With the inherent limitations of a single case study, it is unknown if these clinical outcomes were as a result of the treatment or the natural course of the injury. Radiographs taken nine years later (at age 66) revealed that there was still moderate elevation of the left clavicle and widening of the AC and CC joints (Figure 2). Despite these findings, the shoulder range of motion remained full and pain-free and the patient had continued to participate in competitive cross-country trail riding with no limita - tions. These results are consistent with those found in a recent randomized controlled trial comparing operative versus nonoperative treatment of grades III and V AC joint dislocations. 4 Although patients treated nonopera- tively ended up with more prominent or unstable and radiographically wider AC joints, clinical outcomes were equally good between the operative and nonoperative groups at long-term (18- to 20-year) follow-up. 4 Good functional outcomes in non-surgically (versus surgically) treated patients with severe AC joint injuries have also been shown by others. 6,7 As in the current case this sug- gests that in the absence of clinical 'red flags', nonopera-tive treatment may be a viable option in managing some patients with Rockwood type V AC joint dislocations. However, larger studies are still needed. 4 For more infor - mation and additional examples of AC joint injuries, visit Radiopaedia.org. 9 Key Messages Based on the Rockwood classification, AC joint injuries are divided into six categories Rockwood types I and II typically respond well to conservative therapy , whereas surgery is usually recommended for types IV to VI Patients treated non-sur gically for types III and V AC joint separations may achieve a good clinical outcome despite a poorer radiographic and/or cosmetic outcome Reports of nonoperative management with long-term follow-up for type V injuries of the AC joint nevertheless remain scarce Patients with grades III and V separations are advised to have both surgical and non-surgical consultations; however at present the outcomes with both plans of management are highly variable and need further study Figure 2. Follow-up radiographs of the left shoulder without (A) and with (B) weights, obtained nine years later at age 66 years, reveal persistent widening of the AC joint, but no appreciable increase with weights.

Le grand nombre de r\u00e9alisations, dons et contributions du D r Drum envers la profession et le Brown Growing pains David Clayton Drum was born 20 minutes after his twin sister Lana, in Moncton, NB, August 9, 1944. This sur - prised his 20 year old mother, Barbara Phyllis, who was expecting just one bundle of joy, while his father, Wilfred Clayton, a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Coastal Command, was overseas and would not see his babies for the first 2 years of their lives. Coming home in 1946, Wilfred rejected a job with Air Canada to become sales manager of a printing and lithography business in downtown Toronto. \"Dad was a fine artist, superb athlete, loved jazz and played the piano. In 1954 he built me a studio and taught me how to use oil paints. When I was nine, my mother left the Anglican Church to become a Je-hovah's Witness. She enrolled me in their public speaking school and hoped I would become a boy evangelist. I did my best but my heart was never in it and I resigned af-ter 10 years of growing dissatisfaction, to attend anatomy and human dissection courses, to improve my drawing of the human figure.\" (Drum CD, old unpublished CV) David painted every day in grades 10 through 13 under the guidance of Alex Fraser, a wonderful teacher at Gor - don Graydon Secondary School. Summers were spent painting landscapes at his uncle's Gatineau cottage, in the Qu\u00e9bec Laurentians and in 1961, at age 17, he won the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) mural competi - tion and was hired by several companies to illustrate their catalogues. The Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC)Graduating from high school as class valedictorian in 1963, David intended to embark on a career in art, how-ever a misplaced application to the Ontario College of Art dashed his chances for a scholarship that year so he enrolled at CMCC, where he had a full bursary to attend anatomy and human dissection courses. Moving into the original college at 252 Bloor Street West, David was given free reign of the anatomy-pathology museum and library. Lyman C. Johnston, CMCC's Director of Re-search, commandeered him on the first day. 1 Soon David was illustrating Dr. Johnston's and other professors' pa-pers, along with the text of \"Segmental Neuropathy.\" 2 As well, he illustrated every undergraduate course for the student note service and served as coordinator of special occasions such as seminars, dances and \"Practichiro,\" a minstrel show, named and created by Dr. Rich Luck, dur-ing his college years (CMCC 1950-54). After winning the J.M. Wallace Award for the highest marks in the freshman year, David decided to stay at the College. \"I was just having too much fun.\" That summer he prepared sets of histological and pathological slides under instructor Diet-er Reschka. In his third year, David met Diane Strickland, a ballet dancer who took him to see \"Swan Lake\" on their first date. He had never experienced a production that beautiful and fell deeply in love with Diane. \"Marriage followed swiftly in 1966.\" In his final year, David de-veloped a course in chiropractic biomechanics and wrote and illustrated the text of, \"An Introduction to the Study of Spinal and Postural Mechanics.\" 3 David termed the study an introduction because he believed chiropractors had just begun to understand the part we have \"to play in the restoration of the human spirit and movement, by correcting faulty body mechanics.\" Some of the chapter headings are: Gravity the Constant Stressor; A Brief His-tory and Review of Principles of Kinesiology; Pyr - amidal System of Three-Dimensional Postural Analysis; Investigation Functional Spinal Scolio-sis; Studies of Abnormal A/P Spinal Curvatures and The Compression Subluxation, which David co-authored with Scott Haldeman, DC, PhD, MD. 4 This chapter is divid- ed into two sections. Section A, The Patho-Physiology of Peripheral Nerve Compression, summarizes Dr. Hal-deman's original research, as recorded in his master's thesis, on the microscopic effects of nerve compression and describes its six main sequelae. Section B, covers the various ways nerve roots can be compressed at the spinal level and details nine ways this can occur. David passed his Ontario and American board exams prior to graduating in 1967 with intern of the year hon-ours, which he shared with Edward Demchuk (CMCC 1967). His large practice was mainly composed of dan-cers referred to the school clinic by his wife. In 1968, Dr. Drum joined the faculty, teaching Histology and Princi-ples of Practice and published his first paper in the Jour - nal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association (JCCA): \"The Posterior Gravity Line Syndrome.\" 5 This article was co-authored by Dr. Johnston, with whom he partnered for 20 years, clarifying ideas, designing equipment, writing papers and travelling widely to hold post-graduate sem-inars. Drum observed that Johnston was an outstanding educator and inventor who \"conceived theories, con-74 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)David C. Drum, DC, FCCS(C): an accomplished, multi-faceted individual ducted research, built prototypes of his creations, then marketed and sold them.\" In 1968, David was privileged to meet Glenn Gould, one of the best-known and most celebrated classical pian-ists of the 20 th century. David was then living and prac- tising in a home on Bathurst Street. Gould heard that David owned Liberace's Heintzman concert grand piano #100,000 and wanting to try it out, arrived there unan-nounced one auspicious day. David did not hesitate to abandon his patients in the waiting room, for the private concert of a lifetime and was not disappointed. No one dreamed that Canada's foremost musician would expire prematurely from a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 50, just 14 years later. In December 1969, Part 1 of Drum's 2 part treatise \"Disc Regeneration: The Rationale for a Positive Thera - peutic Approach,\" appeared in the JCCA.6 The author as- serts his material is limited to intervertebral disc degen-eration of the lumbar spine, NOT frank herniation or pro-lapse of a nucleus pulposus. Under the first main heading, Variable Disc Stressors, Drum identifies posture, physical fitness, occupation, obesity and pregnancy, as possible sources of lumbar disc degeneration. Fortunately, many of these factors are amenable to change by the patient or doctor. Under Anatomical-Physiological Disc Stressors, Drum discusses seven factors that contribute to the inher - ent instability of the low back region and asserts: \"While it behooves us to be aware of their existence... there is little practical therapeutic significance in this section.\" That is because there is nothing we can do to alter them. In April 1970, Part 2 of Drum's document on Disc Re- generation was published in the JCCA.7 Drum declares one of the by-products of injured disc repair to be fibro-blastic production of tough, collagenous scar tissue. Al-though enzymes involved in a homeostatic system of col-lagen birth and destruction had been identified in some mammalians, they had yet to be found in human beings. Regardless, Drum lists four other factors that govern re-pair's effectiveness. 1. Physiological Condition of the Host: Young patients have a far greater capacity for re-pair than the aged. 2. Nutritional Status: Protein deple - tion prejudices tissue repair. Patients require nourishing diets rich in Vitamin C, which is essential for collagen formation. 3. Endocrine Function: Endocrine secretions may modify the reparative process. Adrenal steroids such as cortisone depress the rate and adequacy of repair and should be avoided. 4. Blood Supply: Adequate circulation is crucial to the healing process. Most orthopedic author - ities agree that exercise is valuable. What TYPE of exer - cise is left to the reader's imagination. Under Therapy, Drum puts \"Prevention\" of recurring traumatic episodes to the lumbar spine at the top of his list, including physical and emotional factors among the offenders. Because his prescription for regular athletics is seldom obeyed, Drum advises Johnston's \"Posturiz-er,\" which exerts a pumping action on the lumbar discs. Even here, Drum warns against its use in the presence of acute inflammatory exacerbations such as rheumatoid arthritis or nucleus pulposus herniation. Drum concurs with James Cyriax when he states: \"The first measure to be considered in all disc lesions is manipulation.\" 8 The form of manipulation Drum refers to is a \"chiropractic adjustment\" and because that has many connotations he details the rationale and protocol for handling: Fibrocar and Posterior Facet As for corsets and belts, Drum champions Johnston's \"Spine Power Belt,\" which is fitted over the patient's greater trochanters and limits motion at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 motor units. One year Drum utilized an intermittent, motorized traction table and found the results disappointing in treating disc bulge. On the other hand, practically the entire weight of the ab-dominal cavity impacts on the spine and its discs, so the loss of 10 to 15 pounds can contribute substantially to the management of these problems. Drum affirms our profes-sion is in the best position to provide conservative therapy for injured and degenerating discs, \"now that we possess a credible rationale behind our therapeutic approach.\" W ith the cooperation of its editor, Donald C. Sutherland (CMCC 1950), Dr. Drum prepared four \"series of inves-tigative case histories that will contribute to the formula-tion of a comprehensive concept of the pathogenesis and conservative treatment of the injured and diseased lum-bar disc.\" 9 Cases are chosen for their instructional value, not because they make our profession \"look good.\" In the First Series, Case 3 reveals the value of the \"health-team concept.\" The team consisted of a chiropractor, gynecolo - gist, neurologist and psychiatrist; all of whom were neces-sary for this patient's return to normal living. The Second Series was released in March 1971. 10 Case 7 was a patient Drum suspected of having ankylosing spondylitis. X-rays J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 75DM Brown confirmed this diagnosis and Drum referred his patient to a neurologist who sent him to a rheumatologist where he received Phenylbutazone. One week later he was pain free and able to resume his job. In the early stages, it is diffi-cult to differentiate ankylosing spondylitis from lumbar disc disease. Drum quotes DePalma and Rothman in their text, \"The Intervertebral Disc,\" as stating that \"many such errors have been made and many patients with ankylosing spondylitis have been subjected to disc surgery and fusion operations on the lower lumbar spine.\" The Third Series came out in July 1971. 11 On Page 13, Drum provides a handy \"Summary of Lumbar Disc Herniation: Its Diag-nosis & Treatment.\" Acute herniation is usually \"soft\" and associated with trauma. Chronic herniation is \"hard,\" more amenable to manipulative reduction and accompan - ied by multiple motor unit degenerations. Warning: Pro-tracted presence of contralateral leg pain, bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction, or signs of cauda equina syndrome, require consultation with a neurosurgeon. Drum says one of the most frustrating factors in dealing with disc lesions is their proneness to relapse and tells his patients this in advance, to avoid their loss of confidence. \"To my know-ledge, no long range studies have been conducted on this problem within our profession.\" February 2-4, 1975, the National Institute of Neuro - logical Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) held a workshop in Bethesda, Maryland, to discuss \"The Research Status of Spinal Manipulative Therapy.\" Participants included 16 chiropractors, 24 medical doctors, 7 osteopaths and 11 basic scientists. 12 This marked the beginning of inter-pro- fessional dialogue on the \"neutral\" issues of science and research. Inter-professional rivalries were deemed un-acceptable bases for scientific exchange. 13 David Drum was invited to attend this conference and present his thoughts. The subject he chose was \"The Vertebral Motor Unit and Intervertebral Foramen.\" The concept of a vertebral motor unit had been created by Prof. H. Junghanns, in 1950. \"It gave manipulating spinal therapists a functional concept of subluxations by stress-ing the relationship between the morphological features of the motor unit and its dynamics.\" It also hastened the evolution of clinical procedures to discover altered mech-anics before they became visible on x-rays and redirected attention from the osseous confines of the intervertebral foramen to the function of the structures passing through it. Drum describes the intervertebral foramen as \"an el- lipsoid aperture that gives exit to the segmental spinal nerves and entrance to the vessels and nerve branches that supply the bone and soft tissues of the vertebral canal.\" Although its neurovascular components may be influ-enced by spinal discs, the foramina themselves remain anatomically unchanged. Related areas Drum covers are: The Intervertebral Disc and Other Vertebral Motor Unit Ligaments; The Vertebral Motor Unit with Congenital Variations and The Pelvic Motor Unit. Dr . Drum buttresses his thesis with 209 specific refer - ences and closes with these remarks on the \"Limitations of the Motor Unit Concept - Areas for Additional Re-search.\" A limitation of the vertebral motor unit concept is its emphasis on segmental analysis and yet, Jung-hanns certainly never intended his model to be autonomous. In the introduction to his text he re-fers to the 'organ system spine' as appearing 'no longer, as in the past, as an isolated, segmental, skeletal organ. Today the spine appears in the light of many mutual relationships with the total body; with its equilibrium it exerts influences and also receives forces all of which are interwoven with the far-reaching chain of motion. In addition, the spine is able to exercise considerable influence upon neighbouring structures as well as upon remote organs by its action upon nerves and blood ves-sels. 'To fully exploit Junghanns' and other ana-tomical-mechanical concepts in clinical practice, will require the continuation of interdisciplinary dialogue enhanced greatly by this conference. Expanding horizonsIn 1971, David Drum opened a clinic specializing in dance-related injuries in Toronto at 2 Bloor Street East, where he was joined by his favourite student, Jean A. Moss (CMCC 1970). Dr. Moss stayed for three years, be-fore leaving to get her MBA and rise through the ranks to assume the College presidency (1990-2014). In 1974 she was replaced by Dr. Victor Celeste, who graduated from the New York Institute of Chiropractic in 1967. He came to live with David to avoid the Vietnam war draft 76 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)David C. Drum, DC, FCCS(C): an accomplished, multi-faceted individual and study for his Canadian board exams. \"He was the best diagnostician I ever met, possessing a sixth sense that could discern clinical problems. Tragically, he in-herited a rare neurological disorder that carried him off after dealing with it magnificently for 20 years.\" John Beal (CMCC 1972) and his wife Veronica, a registered nurse, soon became team members, as did James Mat-thews (CMCC 1961). In 1973, Drum began supervising interns in the CMCC outpatient clinic, teaching principles of practice to all four years and teaming with the insti-tute's postgraduate faculty to conduct seminars in Canada and the United States. This year, Drum moved his facili - ties to 100 Wellesley Street, between the Wellesley and Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospitals. \"Dr. Brian Nelson (National CC 1964) moved in while his new office was being renovated and we combined our talents as art deal - ers in 19 th Century European paintings.\" John Colwell, MD, a renowned orthopaedic surgeon, invited David to observe his operations and administer spinal manipula - tive therapy to his patients. \"We were able to introduce Dr. Lyman Johnston's concepts into the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Hospital for Sick Children with Jan Koreska, PhD.\" Dr. Koreska developed John-ston's models in a paper on orthogonal projection, where the spine could be visualized looking down from above. In February 1975, Dr. Drum had travelled to the NINDS conference accompanied by Dr. Charles Godfrey, as head of physical medicine at Wellesley Hospital, along with the director of epidemiology at the University of Toronto and the Editor of the Canadian Medical Journal. Togeth-er, they obtained a substantial grant from NINDS for a paper they coauthored on protocols and therapeutic goals of spinal manipulation. The year ended with CMCC con-ferring fellowships in the newly formed College of Clin-ical Sciences on Drs. Drum, Johnston, Vear, Haldeman, Ron Gitelman (CMCC 1961) and Adrian Grice (CMCC 1959). By then, Dr. Vear was administrative dean. He asked Drum to liaise between CMCC and the medical profession so David was making frequent trips to address department chairs in hospitals throughout North America. Vear also encouraged him to organize interdisciplinary postgraduate seminars for Canadian chiropractors, at our alma mater. Constantly on the go and rapidly running out of space, in 1974 Dr. Drum purchased two adjoining townhouses, in the heart of Cabbagetown, at 115-117 Winchester Street and immediately began renovations that provided 10,000 sq. ft. of prime real estate for his clinic/art gallery/resi-dence. \"Finally, with the space we needed, Lyman John-ston brought his Posture Research Foundation on board and was a constant presence with his 'Tension Release Therapy,' training and certifying chiropractors, three of whom stayed on staff.\" Howard Marcus, a retired Nation-al Ballet Principle Dancer, moved in as coach and exem - plar of the Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais Method. Although the systems differ, they are considered compar - able, because they train those in the limelight to perform with greater ease and less effort. Ada Mueller, a saintly German medical doctor who had struggled with women in the prison system for decades, came out of retirement and was joined by Karen Kain's sister Sandra, who was a registered nurse, a Tai Chi master, four massage therapists and a kinesiologist. \"We were swamped!\" When Karen Kain, Prima Ballerina of the National Ballet of Canada, followed by purchasing the townhouse next door, \"the whole Canadian ballet world seemed to tag along.\" In 1974, Victor Celeste's brother Anthony, a massage therapist, was employed exclusively by David to direct the operation of his co-joined clinic for treating dance injur - ies and art gallery, at 55 th St. and 3rd Ave., New York, in the heart of Manhattan. \"Art was always displayed on the clinic walls and available for purchase and we held several exhibits a year in the evening after clinic hours, with wine, food and live music.\" Every second Thursday night, David flew out of the Toronto Island Airport into Newark, New Jersey and returned Monday morning. On alternate week-ends, he soared to San Francisco to interact with the San Francisco California Dance Theatre and the Marin Civic Ballet, with the inspiring Jodie White. \"Her son David, a National Ballet dancer, was living in my home helping me comprehend the demands on male ballet dancers and Na-dia Potts spent hours demonstrating the rigours of pas de deux lifts.\" Drum's wife Diane, cooked for entire ballet companies such as the Royal Winnipeg and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, when they were in town and attending the clinic. Dance Canada asked for lectures as did George Brown College, Ryerson and York Universities in Toronto and Michigan State, Texas Christian, Pacific Lutheran and Brown College in the USA. \"Our clinic was on standby for all Toronto live theatre, thereby we met lots of legends including famous actors, comedians, sports celebrities, musicians, conductors, composers and impresarios.\"J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 77DM Brown As mentioned, 1970 ushered in a decade of rapid ex- pansion for Dr. Drum, who demonstrated financial acu-men equal to his clinical and artistic skills. His first step was to apply for money from the Canada Council for the Arts, to study the prevention and treatment of dance- re-lated injuries. \"I was subjected to both written and oral examinations and awarded a $5,000 grant, which was a lot of cash back then.\" His next move was to approach the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States. \"This independent federal agency graciously funded my lecturing and research in the departments of dance at Brown, Penn State, Texas Christian and Pacific Lutheran Universities, for an entire season.\" These contacts gave Drum access to the Life Bliss Foundation, a worldwide movement for meditation and healing, that sponsored him to work with the Joffrey Ballet, a professional touring dance company, founded in 1956 and based at that time in New York City. Dr. Drum's Manhattan clinic cared for the health care and physical training needs of the Joffrey Ballet and in turn, the Ballet covered most of the clinic's operating costs. Dancers paid the usual fees to licensed therapists when in New York but in Toronto, OHIP (On-tario Hospital Insurance Plan) paid for our Ontario dan-cers and there was a surcharge of $10. Drum's expenses were covered when he was in Montr\u00e9al and Winnipeg by the respective companies but he did not charge the dancers nor those visiting from other countries. Instead, they gave Drum tickets to their concerts and shared their expertise with his staff. \"Basically we broke even but I kept re-mortgaging my Cabbagetown properties when we ran short and was fortunate to have purchased them in a depressed market. Without the continuing escalation in downtown Toronto property values and the lowering of interest rates, I could not have sustained the clinic.\" David enjoyed teaching. \"I would have stayed my whole life in academia, but my political relationship to the college was becoming strained by my attitude toward adhering to the party line.\" David often crossed swords with Lyman Johnston. \"Lyman would be furious with me when I went off topic during my post graduate lectures. He had his own agenda and wanted me to follow it strict-ly. I started having similar difficulties in faculty meetings when I began advocating for interdisciplinary seminars and lectures.\" Without approval, Drum brought in bio-engineers, physical medicine specialists, orthopaedic and neurosurgeons at the under- and post-graduate levels. The students found this enlightening and his classes enlarged with all four years attending, to the dismay of other staff who were missing students. \"I never took attendance nor failed a single student. If they were having problems I gave them after hours tutoring in my clinic and did not request remuneration at the undergraduate level.\" Hard times hit in the early 1980s, with the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic, which killed Anthony Celeste and decimated their dancer clientele. \"Too many funerals and too many creative geniuses lost too young. I retreated to Toronto and welcomed a retired National Ballet dancer, Julie Houle (who would graduate from CMCC in 1998) and her husband, Donald Dawson, also of the National Ballet, onto the staff.\" Dr. Barbara Pike (CMCC 1982) joined in 1985 and the Cabbagetown clinic busied itself with dancers, musicians, actors and athletes. David and Diane toiled in tandem for most of their marriage, how-ever in 1974, when David began flying to New York and San Francisco on alternate weekends, Diane found her - self spending more time in the Canadian dance milieu. Although David cancelled these junkets in 1986, this was the traumatic year Diane's career was cut tragically short, when she succumbed to malignant melanoma. Moving on In 1987, David met Barbara Vance, a registered nurse with an extensive background in oncology clinical trials. One of the trials she was monitoring involved a medical doctor in private practice. \"He was being paid by a phar - maceutical company for his participation but was forging the results to avoid the time and effort involved in col-lecting data.\" David recalls that, \"Barbara became exas-perated with Lyman Johnston's attitude toward the proto-col of proper clinical trials. Discussions carried on into the night, instilling the discipline that helped me avoid premature decisions.\" At this juncture David's career took off because Barbara did everything for him, so he could practice part time and paint in his off days (4 days a week). After taking a six-month course in custom framing Barbara bought the framing business. Then, in 2006, she picked up the brushes and with no fear of painting, quick-ly developed a personal style with a daring use of colour and freshness that appeals to young and old. \"Now we paint our large format abstracts at the same time, without fighting.\" David divides his painting techniques into three per -78 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)David C. Drum, DC, FCCS(C): an accomplished, multi-faceted individual iods. The first is realism, an artistic movement that began in France, after the 1848 Revolution. David uses this method to draw medical illustrations such as those he pro-duced by the dozen, during his early tenure at the school. The second is impressionism, which he employs for land-scapes. In the 1980s, David became immersed in the tech - niques of Claude Monet. Barbara took him to France to experience the famous Monet gardens at Giverny and tour the Monet Museum in Marmottan, Paris. \"In those days I sported a straw hat and large beard. Japanese tourists thought I had been hired to impersonate Monet. I spent so long in the Monet Museum that the curator opened a case and let me try on his glasses. The man could hardly see when he was creating those monumental water lily panels!\" The third period is abstract expressionism. This post World War II art movement was spawned in New York City in the 1940s. David never blew glass but in 2011 created a series of 20 paintings from exploded shards of glass from a friend's studio. \"There was danger in just brushing against finished works but this experi-ment led to reverse glass paintings, where luminosity can be maintained without sharp protrusions and they can be placed in humid atmospheres. Because the pigments are sealed within layers of glass, the colours do not oxidize and remain fresh.\" Drum informs us that the Chinese had figured this out 2.000 years ago and a number of their antique reverse glass paintings still survive in museums. Unlike Picasso, Drum \"never abandons one era for an-other but rotates between all three as my mood and my client's wishes dictate.\" In 1986 David downsized, selling the Cabbagetown properties and moving to 226 Carlton Street. In January that year, Ian Coulter, PhD, CMCC's President (1983-90) formed an Alumni Affairs Committee associated with the College Governors' Club. 14 Its objectives were to unite our graduates and friends by providing them with an en-tertaining evening and to raise money for the institution. From 1986 through 1994, Barbara and David collabor - ated in the production of nine gala's, in a variety of lo-cations. The most memorable event was the last; held in Toronto's elegantly appointed Granite Club. On this beautiful evening, 295 revellers devoured a delicious din-ner, played games of chance, danced to the Murray Al-ter Orchestra and headed home in the wee hours of the morning, bearing 400 door prizes and 300 gifts obtained at auction. Net proceeds of these nine dinners to CMCC were $153,000. Their success was assured by Barbara and David who, with their patrons and friends, donated hundreds of art objects with an assessed retail value of $250,000. In addition, they trucked a load of equipment to each venue and set the paintings up for easy access and visibility. Of course, David was always the accomplished and irrepressible auctioneer, even in 1992 and 1993 when he had to compete with the Toronto Blue Jays, who could be seen on large-screen TV , winning the World Series twice in succession. Crystal Beach In January 2006, the Drums \"moved to the outskirts of town, where somebody ain't always hangin' around,\" purchasing an abode at 293 Oxford Avenue, in Crystal Beach, ON. Now a stable community of 3,800 on the northeast shore of Lake Erie, across from Buffalo, NY , from 1888 to 1989, it held an immense amusement park Figure 1. Barbara Vance and Dr. David Drum.J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 79DM Brown attracting 20,000 visitors daily, throughout the summer. Barb and Dave's dwelling had been designed and built by Arthur Lafferty of Buffalo, a colleague and admirer of an-other Buffalo architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. It appeared on the cover of a 1945 edition of Popular Mechanics as the \"home of the future.\" 2007 marked the 40th anniversary of Barbara and David's involvement in health care and they decided to \"retire from the healing arts to concentrate on art of a different nature.\" Since then they have opened Le Ba-teau Gallery of Fine Art in their own lodging. Previous-ly, Drum exhibited annually with the National Ballet in the O'Keefe Centre for the Performing Arts and provided paintings for many American and Canadian feature films. Currently, Barb and Dave show their paintings in Queen-ston at the RiverBrink Art Museum, at the Art Gallery in Jordan, in Ridgway at the Sanctuary for the Arts, in St. Catharines in the Veffer Gallery, in Buffalo at the Dana Tillou Gallery and in Toronto at Waddingtons and the Consignor Art Auctions. They also sold numerous works at the George Enns Gallery (now King Street Gallery) and the Pumphouse Gallery in Niagara-on-the-Lake. When comm issioned by then President, Dr. Jean Moss, to provide artwork for a particular wall at CMCC's new Leslie Street Toronto campus, Dr. Drum complied, finish-ing and hanging 4 abstract paintings by the summer of 2008, see Figure 3. (E-mail, M. McCallen to the author, Aug 5, 2016) The Leslie Street list of Drum's paintings, commissioned or donated, now (2016) stands at 10, see Figure 2 for another example. Memories of things past John Taylor (CMCC 1979) enrolled at CMCC in 1975 and remembers this \"as a time of major turmoil.\" In 1976, Dr. Vear resigned as Administrative Dean and was quickly supplanted by Dr. Sutherland, who was named President/ Figure 2. Women' s Hockey Gold (Permission for publication of image granted by Dr. David Drum). Figure 3. The Gonzo Line (Permission for publication of image granted by Dr. David Drum).80 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1)David C. Drum, DC, FCCS(C): an accomplished, multi-faceted individual CEO. Almost immediately, Sutherland fired his Academic Dean, Thomas Maxwell (CMCC 1955). This move rever - berated throughout the school yet Drum, who was teach - ing all 4 years, appears to have been untouched, watching calmly from the sidelines. Perhaps his extraneous sources of income left him with no desire to scramble up the exec - utive ladder. Later it was disclosed that David was quiet-ly donating his salary back to the college. \"David was a breath of fresh air and very popular among the classes. Comparatively young yet experienced and savvy in chiro-practic, he knew the subject well, had cooperated with others in developing chiropractic scientific theories and could link the art, science and philosophy of chiroprac - tic in a way that was understandable to students with a science background.\" Dr. Taylor confirms that David warmed his students with the glow of enthusiasm, at a time when they desperately needed it. (Email J. Taylor to the author, Aug 15, 2016) Upon graduation, Dr. Taylor established a practice in North Vancouver, BC. In 1991, Taylor became a Diplo-mate of the American Chiropractic Board of Radiology (DACBR) through the Los Angeles College of Chiroprac - tic, completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of California at San Diego in 1993 and was hired by the Western States Chiropractic College, Port-land, OR, as an associate professor of radiology. John stayed there until 2000, when he became a professor at the New York Chiropractic College, in Seneca Falls and in 2008, was offered his current position as a professor of radiology and coordinator of diagnostic imaging, at D'Youville College in Buffalo, NY . Perched on Canada's West coast, John heard little about David for decades. \"Fast forward about 35 years and I discover that David is retired in Crystal Beach, ON. In 2013 and now living just across the Peace Bridge in Buf-falo, I made a point of visiting David and his lovely wife Barbara Vance. Since then, we have become good friends and I take great pleasure from this relationship.\" February 2014, Taylor coaxed Drum into becoming the first speak-er in the D'Youville chiropractic students' \"Mentors Ser - ies\" program. David calls it \"a 90 minute presentation on the good the bad and the ugly... highlights from 40 years of clinical experience.\" John says David's theme was to make the students feel good about themselves and their futures, emphasizing, \"he had a great career because he made his own opportunities rather than waiting for oppor -tunities to come to him.\" David addressed his interdisci - plinary relationship with doctors at the Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital in Toronto, talked about how he treated dancers from the Canadian National Ballet and how he kept his clinic open all night to attend to the visiting Bol-shoi company from the USSR. He also spoke at length about his friend and mentor Lyman Johnston and their achievements. \"All the students left feeling much better about their careers.\" John Taylor is nothing if not persistent. Sunday, May 22, 2016, he cajoled David Drum into delivering the key-note address at the Hooding and Pinning Ceremony, for the Class of 2016 Chiropractic Program at the D'Youville College. Held in the Bauer Family Academic Center, it was attended by 17 graduates and 150 faculty and guests. The following excerpts are taken from Dr, Drum's re-marks. (E-mails D. Drum to the author May 25, 2016) I discovered chiropractic through illustrating Dr. Lyman Johnston' s papers at the Canadian Me-morial Chiropractic College. He was director of research and his favourite expression was, 'If you can't measure it, it does not exist.' I wondered where this left intuition, inspiration, hope and love. Lyman told us the profession was too vitalis - tic, needing mechanical and electrical instruments to measure what we were doing with results that could be quantified. He said this was science. But when we ar e truly sick, we are not wholly ourselves. We require a healer, a relationship we can trust, not just a provider of goods and services. Every new patient represents a case history of one. The case history is the patient' s story. Listen care-fully for they are telling you what is wrong. The doctor-patient relationship is further enriched by the intimate hands-on nature of our therapy. You are not alone but part of a system rigged toward health and greater complexity. So even though you are skillfully performing closed surgery by altering joint topography and restoring motion or decom-pressing tissues, the procedures are not as difficult as you may think. Dr . Johnston often hinted about introducing a 'perturbation' into a biological system that needed a kick start to a higher level of functioning. I recall a patient on the way to my clinic with chronic neck J Can Chiropr Assoc 2017; 61(1) 81DM Brown pain I was ineffectually treating, phoning to say her cab had dropped into an excavation which threw her against the ceiling. She arrived with a full range of painless neck motion. That was a perturb-ation but difficult to reproduce. Get your patients into that wonderful, continuous passive motion ma-chine - a rocking chair. Use an antigravity device - the swimming pool. Employ a stationary bike with hands dangling, for spinal mobilization. Embrace the unexpected and never lose a holy curiosity in your clinical interactions. When you are free of self-doubt you will still fail but in more useful ways. Dr . Johnston personified the motto 'carpe diem' and taught me to live life where the action is right NOW! One morning a call came in from the Orthopaedic Hospital half a block away. Could I come immediately to help a visiting surgeon who was teaching a new spinal procedure and found himself in extremis on his hands and knees half under the operating table? Thinking perhaps pro-longed flexion may have triggered a rib subluxa-tion, I was ushered into the surgical theatre. The gods were with me, the standing anterior thoracic dorsal lift adjustment worked and he was able to complete the surgery. The following day I was back in surgery ob- serving a patient having his frozen sacroiliac joint manipulated after copious injections of cortisone. It seemed appropriate to demonstrate what every chiropractor does daily without the danger of gen-eral anaesthesia and the expense of a full surgical team. Not to be left out, the hospital physiother - apists asked for a course in sacroiliac adjusting. This lead to the head of physical medicine in an as-sociated hospital sharing his techniques. His fath-er had been a 'bonesetter' in Scotland and taught him well. One has no idea where staying connected to your community health practitioners will lead. We are all in this together! At this point you are relatively inexperienced and have not seen many of the conditions you will be treating. But do not fret. You are embarking on an awe-inspiring open-end-ed adventure. The experience will be bigger and more exciting than you can imagine. How could it be otherwise when we are all made of stardust? W elcome to the profession, Class of 2016! February 17, 2016, it was announced that four large, framed artworks had been donated to D'Youville Col-lege and would soon grace the Chiropractic Department area in the Bauer Family Academic Center. After many years decorating the walls of CMCC with energetic and colourful paintings, Barbara Vance and David Drum de-cided to fill the bare walls of the chiropractic facility in the same spirit as their donations to the Canadian college. \"We hope the spirit and energy that so impressed us in the faculty and student body, is reflected in our paintings.\" As of August 30, 2016, 15 of their original paintings had been hung, beautifying the halls and eliciting compli - mentary remarks. A number of the works are multimedia abstracts incorporating themes that range from \"The Hand of God,\" to respectful tributes to Muhammed Ali and David Bowie. \"Moreover, the presence of this art in our little area has visibly improved the entire mood of the campus community.\" Barbara and David's commitment to and support of the chiropractic profession is both boundless and borderless.
