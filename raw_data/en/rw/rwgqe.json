Influenza (\"the flu\") is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness and, at times, can lead to death. The most effective way to prevent infection from an influenza virus is through annual influenza vaccination and hand hygiene. Annual influenza vaccination prote cts patients and staff and the integrity of the UAHN workforce. Influenza infections result in approximately 150,000 hospital admissions and 24,000 deaths annually which are preventable deaths. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all health care personnel receive the annual flu vaccine. This policy is intended to maximize vaccination rates against influenza among the personnel of the UAHN and the medical staff of UC, SC; its clinics and ambula tory care centers, and especially those whose work requires their presence in clinical settings. The goal is to protect patients, employees, medical staff, employees' family members, others affiliated with UAHN, and the broader community from infl uenza infection through annual immunization. POLICY: It is expected that all UAHN employees, faculty, residents, fellows, temporary workers, trainees, volunteers, students, vendors, medical staff and privileged practitioners, regardless of employer, who provide on -site services will receive an annual influenza vaccination. This is in accordance with patient safety standards and to provide a safe workplace for employees. DEFINITIONS: Health Care Personnel (HCP) are all employees, faculty, residents , fellows, temporary workers, trainees, volunteers, students, vendors, medical staff and privileged practitioners, regardless of employer who work in any UAHN areas. Patient is an individual undergoing medical assessment or active treatment. UAHN HR 201 Page 1 of 5 PROCEDURE: 1. Vaccination Requirement 1.1.
