What is chronic fatigue syndrome? Nowadays, many people lead busy lives. Work and home responsibilities result in no time for relaxation and poor sleep habits. Consequently, many people feel constantly tired, run down, or worn out. But in some people, chronic fatigue cannot be explained by lifestyle alone. As mentioned, fatigue can be a symptom of various medical conditions, including extreme stress, obstructive [sleep apnea](https://www.buzzrx.com/sleep-aid-coupons), restless legs syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, [heart disease](https://www.buzzrx.com/heart-health-coupons), [multiple sclerosis](https://www.buzzrx.com/multiple-sclerosis-coupons), or even something as common as a sore throat. A small number of individuals have a condition called chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME or ME/CFS) or systemic exertional intolerance disease (SEID), this complex disorder causes extreme fatigue. The fatigue lasts for a period of at least six months and cannot be explained by other causes. The tiredness is worse after physical or mental exertion but does not improve after resting. Other CFS symptoms can include unrefreshing sleep, dizziness when sitting upright from lying (orthostatic intolerance), and difficulties with memory and concentration. The exact cause of chronic fatigue syndrome remains unknown, but experts believe it is triggered by a combination of psychological and physical factors. There is not a single test to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. Instead, doctors will usually perform a physical examination and run a battery of tests to rule out other health problems as potential causes before diagnosing CFS. Treatment consists of improving symptoms, whether it is to boost energy, reduce pain, improve sleep, or provide emotional support. What medications are used to treat fatigue? There is no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome. However, many over-the-counter and prescription medications, as well as alternative therapies, can help to ease the symptoms of this disorder. Every patient with chronic fatigue syndrome is different. The symptoms of CFS can vary significantly from person to person. A healthcare provider will usually tackle the worst symptoms first that are interfering with daily life.
