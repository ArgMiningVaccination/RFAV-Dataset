This dance is held in Noble Silence and Noble Look. It's an opportunity to connect with and to heal your inner self, mother earth, and our relations. Photo: Juan Denauta What is the long dance? This Long Dance is a fusion ceremony containing indigenous North American, Andean, and pagan elements. We start the ceremony by honoring the four directions, the elements, and by setting our personal intentions. Then we drink the San Pedro cactus, which is a hallucinagenic plant that has been used ceremoniously by people of the Americas for over 3,000 years. Soon after, we start to move around the sacred fire moonwise (counter-clockwise) for 5 hours. We then change directions and move sun-wise (clockwise) for another 5 hours. We close the ceremony at sun rise by sharing a large breakfast, and drinking cacao. We also have a talking circle among all those who took part in the ceremony. What will the ceremony be like? Photo: Juan Denauta For the first hour of the dance, we'll be in silence. Afterwards, we'll be singing songs, playing music, and sending prayers to carry strength into our journey. In the first part of our ceremony we will put intentions towards healing from inside ourselves. Later in the night, when we change the direction of our walk, we move our focus outwards: towards connection and celebration. Movement can be anything that gets you around the circle in the indicated direction. You may stop as you need to rest and there are areas you can lie down. A safe space, and a great location Photo: Juan Denauta Our consciousnesses moving around the element of fire surrounded by our organic corral is a light motor par non, spiritual mechanics at their best. The space is very contained and beautiful. The location is beneath magnificent cliffs: you'll likely see a condor flying at some point. The dance is done inside a large corral with 12 posts surrounding a Sacred Fire. Feel free to bring any personal sacred objects to place on any of the four beautifully decorated Altars, placed towards the four cardinal directions, where we'll periodically come together for meditation and prayer.
