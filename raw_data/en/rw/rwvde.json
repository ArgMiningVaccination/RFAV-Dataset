A: The fundamental perspective of disease and health is what differentiates a Naturopathic Doctor. Our choice of methods of treatment is made by considering how treatment affects the health of the whole being not just the symptom or diagnosis. Q: What type of training does a Naturopathic Doctor receive? A: Licensed Naturopathic Doctors have graduated from a four-year graduate residential accredited program consisting of 4,590 hours of academic training and an additional 1,536 hours of clinic patient care. In the state of Maryland, where Dr. Martin is currently licensed, the law requires that each Naturopathic doctor graduate from an accredited Naturopathic Medical School and successfully pass the NPLEX exam, the national postdoctoral board examination to obtain licensure. The curriculum of the first 2 years totaling 1,968 hours emphasizes the basic sciences with additional training specific to our holistic philosophy: Anatomy, Botanical Medicine, Classical Chinese Medicine, Clinical Education, Histology, Holistic Model and Mind/Body/Spirit Medicine, Hydrotherapy, Introduction to Clinic, Lab Diagnosis, Microbiology, Medical Ethics, Naturopathic Medical History /Philosophy and Therapeutics, Orthopedics, Palpation, Pathology, Pharmacology, Physiology, and Research & Statistics. The curriculum of the last two years totaling 2,622 hours emphasize the clinical training: Clinical & Physical Diagnosis, Dermatology, Cardiology, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat (EENT), Endocrinology, Environmental Education, First Aid & Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Genetics, Geriatrics, Gynecology, Homeopathy, Lab Diagnosis, Mind Body Medicine, Minor Surgery, Neurology, Nutrition, Obstetrics & Natural practice medicine? A: Naturopathic Doctors are currently licensed in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and the United States Territories of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands. Naturopathic Physicians are registered in Minnesota. In Canada ND's are licensed in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. Several additional states have naturopathic licensing bills before their legislature including Illinois, Missouri, New York, North Carolina & Pennsylvania. Q: Is naturopathic medicine covered by my health insurance or discount health plan? A:At this time Maryland law does not permit Naturopathic doctors to participate as preferred in-network providers for insurance plans or submit workman's compensation claims. Visits with Dr Martin are eligible for insurance reimbursement as pertains to your particular insurance benefits for \"out-of-network\" coverage. If you have \"out of network\" benefits with your health insurance plan we are happy to provide you with a receipt of services (Super Bill) that you may then submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. The amount of reimbursement, if any, is solely dependent upon your insurance benefit limitations. Patients also frequently use their health Savings Plan or Flex Spending Accounts. Conventional labs are usually covered through your insurance benefits. Q: How to become a patient? A: Each prospective new patient begins by scheduling a Case Review ($195) to determine whether Dr Martin's holistic and thorough approach is the right one for you at this time. In this introductory but non-medical appointment you will discuss a brief history of your health concerns, goals, & needs as well as ask any questions you may have including diagnostic and treatment approaches for your specific concerns, etc. At your initial meeting Dr. Martin will carefully listen to your needs to determine if she can help you. Assuming she can, she will then present you with a realistic time and commitment required to successfully reach your goals. This individualized approach to your health care will be presented as a plan which takes into consideration the length of time you have been suffering, the severity of your concerns, the number of concerns and systems involved and the various changes you may have already made for improvement as well as steps you have not been willing to take thus far. The number of visits and length of overall time in a given plan varies greatly from person to person. Most commonly new patients are offered an initial plan that may range between 2 to 12 appointments and financial commitment varies accordingly. Initial visits are necessarily longer in length than later visits after which the treatment plan has been introduced and we are focusing our efforts on supporting your necessary changes.

A: Naturopaths are trained in conventional laboratory and physical assessment and diagnosis techniques. In the state of Maryland a naturopath can diagnose and recommend natural supplements, herbs, vitamins, and homeopathics. A Licensed ND in Maryland cannot prescribe any pharmaceutical drug. In licensed states, similar to that of a medical doctor, the naturopathic physician's scope of practice includes a formulary of pharmaceutically prepared substances. including antibiotics, vaccines and many other naturally derived substances designed to treat specific conditions. In addition to this formulary, naturopathic physicians have many other tools and modalities to effectively and gently aid the body in regaining its natural function of health.
