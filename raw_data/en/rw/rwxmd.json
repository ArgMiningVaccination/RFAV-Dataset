By empowering women with knowledge, Anna helps women take back agency over their own health. From the realities of perimenopause and menopause, using hormone labs to get a true look into our health, the best natural remedies for balanced hormones, and overcoming weight loss plateaus, we can reclaim the health we deserve. Dr. Anna Cabeca, DO, OBGYN, FACOG, is triple-board certified and a fellow of gynecology and obstetrics, integrative medicine, and anti-aging and regenerative medicine. She has special certifications in functional medicine, sexual health, and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. For the past 20 years, she's served 10,000+ women in her private practice\u2014 and millions more through her books, online videos and articles. When her own health took a troubling turn during menopause, she sought out the wisdom of healers around the world. She learned that modern medicine and time-tested natural remedies are not at odds. Working together, they create indisputable results and true well being. Using delicious, healing foods and simple lifestyle changes, Dr. Anna reclaimed her health and life. Fueled by her belief that every woman deserves to be empowered and in control of their health and life, she developed the Keto-Green lifestyle, which has helped thousands of women opt out of menopause misery and experience a joyful transition to the next stage of their lives. With her methods, you, too, can breeze through menopause into your \"second spring\", feeling the best you ever have. A few of my favorite things we cover this episode: - What perimenopause and menopause look like for women, and how they can use that knowledge to have greater agency over their own health. - Specific labs to request from your doctor, and key markers to know if your hormones are at optimal levels. - The best herbs, supplements, and other natural remedies for healing hormonal imbalances. - When someone should consider \"hormone replenishment\" therapies, and the first step that should always be taken beforehand. - The best diet and lifestyle choices for healthy hormones. - Dr. Cabeca's \"Keto-Green\" nutrition plan, including specifics on the \"Keto-Green Plate\", and how it doesn't only involve what we eat. - Why sufficient protein intake is critical for women and what ranges they should be in.
