Nicotine vaccines present a promising alternative to traditional smoking cessation products, but to date, no vaccine has been able to move through all phases of clinical trials. We have previously demonstrated that the AFPL1-conjugate nicotine vaccine does not induce systemic or immunotoxicity in a mouse model and that a heterologous vaccination approach is more advantageous than the homologous routes to inducing mucosal and systemic anti-nicotine antibodies. The purpose of this study was to confirm the safety profile of the vaccine in a repeat-dose toxicity study. The heterologous vaccination strategy was again used, and Sprague Dawley rats were administered a dose five times greater than in our previous studies. Physiological conditions, food and water consumption, body temperature, injection site inflammation, relative weights of organs, histopathology, and blood chemistry and hematology were evaluated during the course of the vaccination period to determine the safety of the vaccine. The AFPL1-conjugate nicotine vaccine did not induce clinically relevant changes or induce symptoms that would be associated with toxicity, making it a promising candidate for future investigations.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-11-23", "cleaned_text": "Sprague Dawley Rats [https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics11120626](https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics11120626) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Moreover, the growing use of E-cigarettes, particularly among young adults, will surely add to the number of individuals who become addicted to nicotine and represents a potentially serious problem given the unknown long-term health effects of these devices [ [2](#B2-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. The continued low rate of success from the currently available nicotine cessation products, including pharmacotherapeutics [ [3](#B3-pharmaceutics-11-00626)], in breaking nicotine addiction has fueled research to develop alternative therapies for addiction. For years, a nicotine vaccine has been pursued as an alternative. Using a strong adjuvant to allow the immune system to recognize the otherwise nonimmunogenic nicotine would produce antibodies that are able to bind to it and prevent it from crossing the blood-brain barrier to reinforce the nicotine addiction. [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Using a heterologous vaccination strategy, where the initial priming event consisted of an intramuscular (IM) and an intranasal (IN) vaccination with two subsequent IN boosts, the vaccine formulation was able to significantly induce anti-nicotine antibodies in both the lung and in the sera of mice, resulting in two levels of protection [ [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Additionally, the antibodies were able to bind to nicotine in the lung and in the blood when the mice were challenged in vivo with nicotine, as demonstrated by competitive ELISAs for IgA and IgG [ [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Both the homologous and heterologous routes did not show signs of toxicity when assessing daily physiological conditions and the gross necropsy of the organs [ [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. The rat is a versatile and well characterized model in vaccine toxicology studies [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. In particular, the adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rat is considered a relevant biological model and has been used extensively to evaluate both intrinsic toxicity and toxicity associated with the immune responses induced by vaccines [ [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [10](#B10-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [11](#B11-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Parameters monitored during repeat-dose studies typically include food and water consumption, body weight, and temperature [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Endpoint parameters are more extensive and include assessing blood chemistry, hematology, organ weights with macroscopic assessments, as well as histopathology on a range of tissues including pivotal organs such as the lung, brain, liver, and spleen [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. [12](#B12-pharmaceutics-11-00626)], we increased the dose of the vaccine to be 5 times greater than what was administered to BALB/c mice in previous studies [ [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. In addition, we also increased the number of boost events from two to three. The rats were evaluated for physiological criteria such as food and water consumption, weight gain, body temperature before and after each vaccination event, swelling at the injection site, hematology and blood chemistry variables, macroscopic evaluation of the organs and their relative weights, and histopathology of primary organs 3, 7, and 14 days after the final dose. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first preliminary report evaluating the toxicity of a nicotine vaccine candidate using multiple doses and combined routes of administration. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Husbandry 2.2. Vaccine and Vaccination Protocol [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Rats were immunized using a heterologous vaccination strategy ( [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-t001)). The initial vaccination involved a simultaneous administration via both the IM and IN routes. Three weeks after the first dose, 3 subsequent IN vaccinations followed as per the schedule in [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-t001). The duration of the repeat-dose study was 10 weeks (71 days). Three vaccination groups were assigned for the study, including animals immunized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a negative control, or AFPL1 alone to ensure that there were no negative effects associated with the adjuvant. A 50 g dose of the nicotine conjugate vaccine was used for all vaccinations (based on nicotine concentration) but was administered in different volumes suitable to the route of administration; the intramuscular dose volume of 200 \u00b5L was administered as 100 \u00b5L in each leg, while the intranasal dose volume of 80 L was delivered as 40 L per nare. 2.3. Clinical Observations and Symptoms [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-11-00626)] with a digital caliper (Electronic Caliper with digital display, 6, 150 mm, Mastercraft, Toronto, ON, Canada) by measuring the diameter of the inoculated limb at the center of the musculature of the thigh region. Leaving the teeth of the caliper on the inner and external side of the muscle, the caliper was closed without putting pressure on the leg. This was done both before and after the IM vaccination at 24 h intervals for 72 h. 2.4. Euthanasia and Blood Collection 2.5. Hematological and Blood Biochemical Evaluation 2.6. Anatomopathological Studies and Organ Weights 2.7. Immunotoxicological 2.8. Anti-Nicotine ELISAs [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Briefly, biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG was used as secondary antibody to detect the nicotine-specific systemic antibodies in the sera obtained over the course of the vaccination protocol. The plates were incubated with pNitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP, >97%, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the reaction was stopped with 3N NaOH after 30 min. The plates were read at an optical density (OD) of 405 nm with a subtraction of 490 nm. An internal standard curve for the quantification of anti-nicotine IgG was carried out by pooling the sera from rats (n = 10) with the highest anti-nicotine dilution titer. Relative concentrations of IgG were calculated from a 4-parametric standard curve (ELISA for Windows CDC, 2005 software, USA). The standard was assigned a concentration of 100 arbitrary units (AU)/mL for each serogroup, respectively. 2.9. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f001)A,B). The average weekly consumption of water was 50.71 \u00b1 9.03 mL and of food was 26.33 \u00b1 4.04 g. There were no significant differences between the groups of rats for either consumption of food or water. This consumption is similar to that reported for the species and reported by us in other studies [ [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [14](#B14-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [16](#B16-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [17](#B17-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Accordingly, the body weight of the rats increased over the course of the study ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f001)C). The weight-increase curves between the vaccinated groups and controls did not show any statistical differences and are on par with other published growth curves [ [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [19](#B19-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [20](#B20-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Body weight has been commonly considered as a sensitive indicator of toxicity of xenobiotics in a wide range of toxicological studies [ [20](#B20-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [22](#B22-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [23](#B23-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Toxicity usually manifests as either a decrease in weight gain compared to controls or absolute losses of body weight. [24](#B24-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. The temperature of the rats in this study was followed for 3 days after each vaccination ( [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f002)). The temperatures of the rats were all within the normal physiological range, and there were no increases that could be considered a fever. The only statistically significant temperature increase, although not clinically relevant, occurred in the PBS control group 24 h after the first vaccination event. [Figure 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f003)). A significant increase in muscle diameter 24 h after vaccination was noted in the rats receiving either the adjuvant control or the vaccine; however, these increases were only transient, and muscle diameters returned to normal by 72 h after the vaccination. The changes in muscle diameter did not result in changes in locomotion or obvious signs of pain/distress. [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-t002)). A macroscopic morphometric evaluation of spleen diameters showed no significant differences between the different groups in the total areas of this organ ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f004)). Key organs were subjected to a histological evaluation, and no differences in inflammation, changes in morphology, or recruitment of leukocytes were noted between the control and the vaccine group ( [Figure 5](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f005)). [Table 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-t003)) and blood chemistry analyses ( [Table 4](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-t004)a,b) in order to evaluate parameters that could be associated with toxicity. No significant differences were observed between the control groups and the vaccinated group for any of the parameters measured. In the blood, the primary leukocytes measured were neutrophils and lymphocytes, which is similar to other toxicological studies evaluating adjuvants using rats [ [25](#B25-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. [Figure 6](#pharmaceutics-11-00626-f006)), and significant levels of anti-nicotine IgG were detected at each collection point thereafter, plateauing by day 57 as compared to day 7. Similar to our previously published results, the control groups did not show cross-reactivity and non-specific results from the established ELISA protocol. 4. Discussion [26](#B26-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. The World Health Organization estimates that up to half of all lifetime smokers of tobacco will die as a result of smoking; therefore, developing a novel and effective anti-nicotine vaccine is crucial. We previously published the AFPL1-conjugate nicotine vaccine, demonstrating that it is able to bind to nicotine and prevent it from entering the brain in a mouse model [ [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. To the best of our knowledge, we were the first group to report a nicotine vaccine that induced both mucosal (IgA, IgG) and systemic anti-nicotine antibodies [ [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)] with no preliminary signs of toxicity. The next step in the development of this vaccine was to evaluate its safety in a SD rat model using the heterologous vaccination strategy and a higher dose, which was done at the Finlay Institute of Vaccine in Cuba. [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. AFPL1 has been used extensively as part of adjuvant and vaccine development at the Finlay Institute of Vaccine in Cuba and is multi-adjuvanted with the ability to activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4, and 9 (reviewed by [ [28](#B28-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]). AFPL1 is derived from the safe and clinically used VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae for protection from Neisseria meningitis B and has been used IN [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [30](#B30-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [31](#B31-pharmaceutics-11-00626)] as part of the institute's mucosal vaccine development. The cochleate, AFCo1, derived from AFPL1, has been shown to be devoid of toxicity when administered repeatedly in SD rats [ [32](#B32-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Because this vaccine is preventative and therapeutic for nicotine addition, adverse side effects are not acceptable [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00626)] and safety evaluations need to be performed, despite the adjuvant having already been established as safe in the literature when delivered either IN or IM. [33](#B33-pharmaceutics-11-00626)], which were not seen over the duration of the trial. Similar to our previous investigations, we did not see clinically relevant increases in temperature. The only group that showed any changes was the negative control group, and in order for there to be an established fever, the body temperature would need to be above 38 \u00b0C. Not surprisingly, we saw transient but significant increases in muscle diameter 24 and 48 h after vaccinating with either the adjuvant or the vaccine. This transient increase may be due to the recruitment of leukocytes at the site of injection, similar to other injectable adjuvants [ [34](#B34-pharmaceutics-11-00626)], and would not be considered a safety issue. [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. This is also supported by the morphometric analysis of the spleen. If there was systemic inflammation, we would have expected to see size changes in the spleen associated with inflammation; however, there were no significant changes as compared to the control or the adjuvant alone at any time-point. [36](#B36-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [37](#B37-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [38](#B38-pharmaceutics-11-00626)], indicating that the parameters that we have evaluated are in line with other groups. Previous nicotine vaccines, such as NicQb and NicVAX, have been evaluated for their safety during preclinical and clinical trials [ [38](#B38-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [39](#B39-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [40](#B40-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. Toxicity for these vaccines focused on systemic toxicity and assessing locally where the vaccine was administered, in addition to reactogenicity, when administered to human participants. [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-11-00626), [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00626)]. However, these models use inbred mice, which represents a limitation for assessing heterogeneic responses that would be expected during preclinical trials. Establishing that we can induce significant levels of anti-nicotine antibodies in outbred SD rats is promising and provides evidence that the vaccine could induce a therapeutic threshold of anti-nicotine antibodies necessary for smoking cessation.
