Liver biopsy (LB) is the current standard of care for diagnosing, staging and monitoring liver disease. It is an invasive proc edure associated with a number of risks including bleedi ng, hospitalization and death. Transi ent elastography (TE) is an alternative, non-invasive, method of staging and monitoring liver. Th e intent of this report is to use current literature to determine the safety, effectiveness, social considerations and cost-effectiveness of TE for the diagnosis, staging a nd monitoring of liver da mage associated with HBV, HCV, NAFLD, CLD and complications due to liver transplant (LTP). This report also reviews the use of TE in paediatric patients, th e use of acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI), and non-liver applications of TE. 1.2 Transient Elastography in Adult Liver Disease 1.2.1 Transient Elastography TE is a non-invasive diagnostic test that uses an ultrasound transducer probe attached to a mild amplitude, low frequency transmitter to measure tissue stiffness. 1.2.2 Methods A systematic review of literature published between 2000 - March 2011 was conducted. Original studies reporting on the effectiveness, ri sks, side-effects and safety of TE in comparison to LB were included. An information specialist developed the search st rategy. A random-effects - 11 - model was used to combine the studies to estima te a pooled effect of diagnostic accuracy. A primary economic evaluation was also complete d. A simple decision model informed by the systematic review was conducted to estimate the cost per correct diagnosis of TE compared to LB. Five clinical subgroups were consider ed (HBV, HCV, NAFLD, CLD and LTP) and were assessed according to the five st ages of liver damage based on the METAVIR staging system: no fibrosis (F=0), mild fibrosis (F 1, (F advanced/severe (F 3) and cirrhotic (F=4). 1.2.3 Results Fifty-seven studies were included in the primary analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of TE in adults with liver disease. The diagnostic accuracy of TE for a ll clinical and fibrosis stage subgroups was sufficient to excellent. Sensitiv ities ranged from 0.67 to 0.92 and specificities from 0.72 to 0.95. The area under the receiver opera tor characteristic ( AUROC) curves were between 0.88 and 0.94. LB is more expensive and more effective than TE. LB was associated with an additional $1,427 to $7,030 per correct di agnosis gained compared to TE. The model was sensitive to the sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of fibrosis. 1.2.4 Conclusions TE is an accurate method for liver disease diagnosis in patients with signifi cant or severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. The diagnostic accur acy is similar across all th e disease subgroups considered. - 12 - However, its effectiveness decreased as the seve rity of fibrosis decreased. Compared to LB, TE is less expensive, but it is less effective. TE' s diagnostic accuracy, calc ulated using the AUROC, ranged from 0.78 to 0.96 when LB was accepted as the standard of care with a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. LB was associated with an additional $1,427 to $7,030 per correct diagnosis gained compared to TE. However, when the like lihood of receiving LB is greater than 78% after undergoing TE, LB is a more economically attractiv e option (i.e. LB will cost the same as TE, but LB will have an increased c linical benefit due to its diagnos tic accuracy). There are a variety of other factors that may influence the attrac tiveness of TE that are uncounted for in this analysis: patient preference for a non-invasive te st, fewer physician visits are required with TE, and no pre-screening blood tests. System impl ementation of TE for liver disease should be considered. 1.3 Transient Elastography in Paediatric Patients 1.3.1 Patient Population Liver disease in the pediatric population can stem from a number of causes such as genetics (Wilson's disease, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency or Tyrosinemia), viral liver disease (hepatitis A, B or C) or poor bile flow from the liv er (Biliary Atresia or Alagille Syndrome). 4 With rapidly increasing rates of obesity in developed countri es, NAFLD is also becoming a major cause of liver damage in children. A 2009 article reported that NAFLD had become the leading cause of paediatric liver disease world-wide.5 - 13 - 1.3.2 Methods For the systematic review and meta-analysis, ni ne electronic database s were searched using terms such as transient elastography, non-invasive , liver stiffness, FibroScan\u00ae and fibrosis. This search was limited to English and French la nguage articles published between 2000 and 2011. Articles were included if the sample population wa s under the age of 18, had liver disease, and if TE and LB were compared. For inclusion, studies al so had to be prospec tive, be designed as a randomized controlled trial or cohort study, report findings usi ng the METAVIR scoring system and have 10 or more patients enrolled. 1.3.3 Results The search of electronic databases returned 1753 abstracts. After review, only 1 paper was relevant to paediatric TE. This study include d 52 children who had biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. All included patients underwent both TE and LB. The authors concluded that TE was an accurate procedure to identify absen ce of, significant, and advanced fibrosis. 1.3.4 Pediatric Transient Elastography Conclusions Evidence of clinical effect in a paediatric population is limited. However, the one study identified reported excellent accuracy. More studies are necessary to establish the effectiveness of TE in pediatric patients. Further considera tion of the economic value of TE is required in a paediatric population. - 14 - 1.4 Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging (ARFI) 1.4.1 Description of technology ARFI is a non-invasive procedure. It is an advanced form of ultrasound imaging that can be used to assess liver fibrosis. ARFI is a potential alternative to LB and competing technology to TE. It uses short, high-intensity pulses of acoustic radi ation to displace tissue in the body. These high intensity pulses are followed by a series of diagnostic pulses which assess the magnitude of displacement at multiple locations. Images are di splayed as a grayscale map of relative tissue elasticity; bright regions represent tissue that is less stiff. 1.4.2 Methods A systematic review of literature publishe d between 2000 - March 2011 was completed. Original studies reporting on the effectiveness, risks, side-effects and safety of ARFI in comparison to LB in adult liver disease were in cluded. Nine electronic databases were searched, using terms such as non-invasive, fibrosis, ARFI and acoustic radiation force impulse. The search was limited to English language articles. 1.4.3 Results Seven original papers reporting on the accuracy of ARFI for adult liver disease were identified. The diagnostic accuracy of AR FI for advanced fibrosis (F 3) and cirrhosis (F=4) was very good to excellent with sensitivities ranging from 0.90 to 0.94 0.98). - 15 - 1.4.4 Conclusions ARFI shows promise as a diagnostic tool for adu lt liver disease. Further consideration of the economic value of ARFI in comparison to LB and TE is required. 1.5 Other Applications of Transient Elastography 1.5.1 Description of Technology TE and the emerging technology of HI-RTE or real-time elastography (RTE) were predominantly used for the assessment of other a pplications of TE. RTE a ssess tissue elasticity using a real-time colour display. RTE uses sec ond generation ultrasound technology to assess breast, prostate, thyroid and panc reatic tissue and other applicati ons where biopsy is indicated. RTE provides increased accuracy for asse ssing lesions by using Extended Combined Autocorrelation Method (ECAM) technology to genera te a real-time elasticity image. Tissue is compressed by a freehand ultrasound tr ansducer and the relative elasti city is calculated using the ECAM elastography algorithm. Relative tissue elasti city is displayed using a colour overlay of the B-mode ultrasound image. Stiffer tissue is seen as blue and elastic tissue as red. 1.5.2 Methods A systematic review of literature between 2000 - March 2011 was completed for original studies reporting on the effectiveness, risks, side e ffects and safety of TE technologies. The search included systematic reviews, meta-analyses' and HTA reports documenting the use of TE. Studies were included if they reported original da ta, evaluated the efficacy of TE and were either randomized controlled trial or prospective cohort design. - 16 - 1.5.3 Results Eighty-two studies on other applic ations of TE were identified for full-text review. Seventy papers were included in the re view. Six clinical groups were identified: thyroid, pancreas, prostate, lymph nodes, breast and other. Thirteen papers were found on thyroid applications, 7 on prostate, 6 on pancreas, 3 on lymph nodes, 37 on breast applications and 4 papers on other clinical conditions (plantar fa sciitis, rectal tumor detect ion, postmenopausal bleeding and appendicitis detection). N one of the papers reported adverse eff ects or safety concerns associated with TE. 1.5.4 Conclusion The other applications of TE t echnologies represent a substantia l body of literature. Most of the observational studies were large, have poor to excellent sensitivities and specificities, appear to be of good quality and report e nough information to complete a pooled meta-analysis. The 4 publications in the \"oth er\" category did not cont ain enough research to merit a full systematic review and meta-analysis. The use of TE and RTE in the assessm ent of breast tissue had the highest number of relevant studies (n=37) indicating that TE use in the breast should be prioritized if future systematic reviews focused on TE are undertaken. 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Purpose of Assessment Liver disease affects over 2 million Canadians.3 The standard of care for detecting, staging and monitoring liver disease is liver biopsy (LB); an invasive, and so metimes painful, procedure with potential complications. Transien t elastography (TE) is a non-invasive diagnostic method for the - 17 - detection of liver stiffness, or fibrosis, that el iminates the risks associated with LB. The purpose of this assessment is to determine the safety, di agnostic accuracy and cost -effectiveness of TE in diagnosing and monitoring adult li ver disease. The use of TE in paediatric liv er disease, emerging uses of TE, and acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) will also be reviewed. 2.2 Intent of Report To determine the safety, effectivene ss/efficacy of TE for the diagnosis and monitoring of adults with liver disease in comparison to LB To determine the budget impact of pr ovision of TE for the diagnosis and monitoring of adult liver disease To review the social, ethi cal and legal considerations for the use of TE for the diagnosis and monitoring of a dult patients with liver disease To determine the safety, effectiveness/e fficacy and cost effectiveness of TE for the diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric liver disease To determine the safety, effectiveness/e fficacy and cost-effectiveness of ARFI. To review the clinical evidence for TE in emerging applications 2.3 Research Questions What is the potential role of TE in th e diagnosis and monitoring of adult patients with liver disease in Alberta? What is the budget impact of provision of TE for the diagnosis and monitoring of adult liver disease? What is the potential role of TE in th e diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric patients with liver disease in Alberta? - 18 - What is the clinical evidence to suppor t TE in other applications in Alberta? What is the clinical evidence to support ARFI in Alberta? 3 TRANSIENT ELASTOGRAPHY 3.1 Description of Conditions and Burden of Illness 3.1.1 Liver Fibrosis In adults, liver fibrosis is commonly caused by hepatitis B and C virus' (HBV and HCV), non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant (LTP) complications. 6 LTP is a result of severe liver damage a nd it is not considered a liver disease, but a transplanted liver is susceptible to reinfect ion and fibrosis. The two most common causes of liver disease are HBV and HCV it is estimated that 500,000 Canadians are living with these diseases.7 Liver fibrosis is characterized by the replacement of liver tissue by scar tissue (fibrotic tissue). 6 Increasing fibrosis can redu ce blood flow in the liver and lead to loss of liver function. If the scar tissue permanently changes blood ci rculation, fibrosis leads to cirrhosis. Once cirrhosis has developed, several complications may occur, such as portal hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure in branches of the larg e portal vein that brings blood fr om the intestine to the liver), liver failure and liver cancer.8 The risk of liver cancer is greatly increased once cirrhosis develops. As such, cirrhosis is considered a pre-malignant condition.9 Cirrhosis and liver cancer are now among the top ten causes of death worldwid e and in many developed countries cirrhosis - 19 - is now one of the top five causes of death in middle-aged populations.10;11 In 2005, 2,000 Canadians died from liver disease and almost 1,700 died of liver cancer.7 3.1.2 Liver Disease Etiologies All liver diseases can lead to liver fibrosis. 6 Historically, the main causes of chronic liver disease have been chronic hepatitis B (C HB) and alcoholic liver disease.12 However, over the last few decades, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and non-alcoho lic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have become increasingly prevalent.12 With rapidly increasing rates of obe sity in develope d countries, NAFLD is becoming a major cause of significant fibrosis.13 Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver often caus ed by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, or HCV. 14 HAV, HBV and HCV are spread through bodily fluids and are preventable diseases. In the acute phase, the virus causes an inflammatory response. The condition is considered chronic if the virus remains in the blood for more than six months.15 CHC and CHB may lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis hepatoce llular carcinoma. It is estimated that 0.2- 2.0% of the population are carriers of HBV or HCV a nd that 1.0- and 75.0 - of the HCV carriers, will develop chronic hepatitis.16 NAFLD refers to a wide spectrum of liver diseases ra nging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis. 17 NAFLD is an overall accumulation of fat in the liver cells. NASH occurs when fat accumula tion causes varying degrees of hepatitis and fibrosis in the liver. The term \"nonalcoholic\" is used because NAFLD and NASH occur in - 20 - individuals who do not consume ex cessive amounts of alcohol. Howe ver, the histological picture of NAFLD is similar to alcohol related liver di sease (ALD). Several ri sk factors increase the likelihood of a person developing NAFLD such as diabetes, excess weight and obesity, high levels of fat in the blood (hyperl ipidemia) and abdominal surgery.16 From the available data, over 70 million adult Americans suffered from NAFLD in 2005, which represented approximately one third of the popula tion in the United St ates at that time.18 In Canada, 50% of the population is overweight and 25% are obese.19;20 Approximately 75% of obe se individuals have an increased risk of developing a fa tty liver. Therefore, twenty-three percent of Canadians have an increased risk of developing fatty liver with inflammation.19 within the category of CLD. PBC is an autoimmune disease which results in the destruction of the bile ducts in the liver. 21 Damage to the ducts causes bile to build up in the liver which damages the tissue over time. This can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Wome n between the ages of 40 and 60 make up 90.0% of PBC cases.21 In some areas of the US and UK the prevalence of PBC is estimated to be as high as 1/4000.16 PSC is a chronic liver disease that is caused by gradual inflammation and sc arring of the liver's bile ducts. 21 The flow of bile to the digestive system is impeded by this inflammation. This may lead to liver cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Autoimmunity is believed to be the underlying cause of the inflammation. 22 The definitive treatment is LTP. There is relatively little data on the prevalence and incidence of PSC. Studies in different countries report annual incidence of 0.07 to 1.3 per 100,000 people a nd a prevalence of 0.2 to 8.5 per 100,000.23 - 21 - 3.1.3 Burden of Liver Disease in Alberta 3.1.3.1 Data Request from Alb erta Health and Wellness Physician claims (Supplemental Enhanced Serv ice Event) data from 2005-2010 were obtained from AHW. All records with Interna tional Classification of Diseases 9th Edition (ICD-9) codes 70.2, 70.3, 70.4, 70.5, 571.6, 571.8 and Canadian Classifica tion of Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Surgical Procedures (CCP) billing codes 62.81A, 62.82A and 99.09J in any position were requested. Table 1 outlines the mappi ng of ICD-9 and CCP codes to cl inical disease. Currently, TE does not have a specific code and is bill ed under the general 99.09J code. No codes were obtained for liver transplant (LTP). Table 1 ICD-9 and CCP Codes Used to Define Clinical Subgroup Disease/Procedure ICD-9/CCP codes Reference LB among adults (over 18 y ears of age) was obtaine d by calculating the total of number of LBs performed each year in the province. A subgroup analysis by healthcare zone was completed. Patients were classified in to zones based on residence postal code. The unit of analysis was LB, and repeat LBs were counted as separate biopsies. The annual number of - 22 - HBV, HCV, NAFLD and CLD cases was calculated. Disease status was ascertained every year. A case was defined as the presence of 1 or more codes from Jan 1 to Dec 31 in the given year.. Direct standardization was used to adjust the rates per 100,000 to the Alberta population based on the 2010 census. 3.1.3.2 Number of Liver Disease Cases in Alberta In Alberta, the annual number of liver disease cases in adults (19 years and older) between 2005 and 2010 (the period of study) increased from 422 to 501 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 1). The only exception was HCV, which gr adually declined from 50/100,000 in 2005 to 43/100,000 in 2010. HBV and CLD both increased dur ing this time period from 21/100,000 to 41/100,000 for HBV and from 7/100,000 to 12/ 100,000 for CLD. NAFLD tripled from 10/100,000 in 2005 to 29/100,000 in 2010. Figure 1 Annual Number of Liver Disease Cases in Adults in Alberta between 2005 and 2010. - 23 - 3.1.4 Disease Progression The early stage of liver disease is inflamma tion or hepatitis. Inflammation is an immune response to infection and if left untreated, can lead to permanent damage. 27 Untreated inflammation will eventually scar the liver and begi n to replace healthy tissue. As the scar tissue accumulates, blood flow through the liver can be impeded. This can impair liver function and stress healthy parts of the liver. Patients treated at this stage of liver damage have a reduced chance that their liver will repair itself. If the liver becomes damaged to the point where it is unable to heal itself, it is considered cirrhotic . At this point treatment will focus on preventing further damage.27 The signs and symptoms of advanced liver disease as outlined in Box 1. Box 1 Signs and Symptoms of Liver Disease27 An individual my bruise or bleed easily Fluid accumulates in lower extremities and abdomen Eyes become jaundiced Intense itching Blood vessels leading to the liver may rupture and burst Increased sensitivity to medications Toxins may accumulate in the brain causing diff iculties with concentration, memory, or sleep Several factors influence fibrosis progression: ge nder, age, overall health and lifestyle (Box 2). HCV viral load does not appear to have a significant effect on fibrosis progression. 16 - 24 - Box 2 Factors Influencing Liver Disease Progression16 Sex: males experience faster progression than females Age: fibrosis occurs more rapidly in individuals over the age of 50 Fibrosis stage: fibrosis is accelerate d by the degree of fibrosis damage Immune system compromise: co-infections such as HIV or use of immunosuppressive drugs after a liver transplant can accelerate fibrosis Lifestyle: high alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increases in fibrosis and cirrhosis Disease Type: Steatosis (fatty liver) and insulin resistance are associated with more rapid and severe fibrosis 3.1.5 Staging Staging is a method used to classify a pa tient's disease progression along a continuum. 28 In contrast, grading is the assessment of disease activ ity (or the rate at which the disease stage is changing).28 With most chronic diseases, stage gene rally increases with time. Relapsing or remitting diseases are exceptions to this rule. In contrast, activity may fluctuate as a disease flares and subsides. Therapeutic interven tions typically effects disease activity. Several systems exist for grading an d staging chronic hepatitis; all have been used effectively to assess changes in pathology fo llowing therapeutic in tervention. The stag ing system most commonly used is the 5-point METAVIR system. 29 The METAVIR scoring system was specifically designed for patients with HCV and incorporates bot h grading and staging systems. The grade gives an indication of the activity or amount of inflammation and the stage represents the amount of fibrosis or scarring. - 25 - The grade is assigned a number between zero a nd four based on the degree of inflammation (with zero being no activity and three of four considered se vere activity). The amount of inflammation is important because it is considered a precursor to fibrosis. The fibrosis score (F) is al so assigned a number from 0-4: 0. No scarring 1. Minimal scarring 2. Significant fibrosis where scarring has occurr ed and extends to blood vessels outside the liver 3. Advanced/severe fibrosis where fibrosis is spreading and connec ting, bridging, to other areas that contain fibrosis 4. Cirrhosis 3.1.6 Monitoring Monitoring is a scheduled assessment of a patient to track their disease progression over time. According to the Expert Advi sory Group on TE developed for this review, monitoring is determined on a case-by-case basis (i.e. there is no predetermined monitori ng schedule for each liver disease group). 3.2 Current standard of Care 3.2.1 Liver Biopsy LB is the current standard of care fo r staging and monitoring liver disease. 30 Ehrlich performed the first LB in 1883 and the first LB series wa s published in 1907 by Sh\u00fcpfer to assess cirrhosis - 26 - and hepatic tumors.31 Huard and Baron popularized LB during the 1930s and the technique rapidly increased in use dur ing WWII to investigate viral hepatitis in soldiers.31 LB applications broadened when Menghini developed a 1-seco nd aspiration method in the 1950s. Currently, a variation on Menghini's suction t echnique is most widely used.31 Several techniques have been developed to obtain liver ti ssue for histological assessment. 32 Percutaneous LB is guided on/percussion or imaging technology. A palpation/percussion-guided transt horacic approach, after administration of local anesthesia, percutaneous method.32 A transvenous (transjugular or patients with clinically estab lished ascites, a known or suspected hemostatic defect, a small, hard, cirrhotic live r, morbid obesity with a difficult- to-identify LB si te or those in whom free and wedged hepatic vein pressure measurements are additionally being sought.32 The surgical/laparoscopic biopsy is used when the li ver is abnormal in appearance prior to planned surgery or at the time of surgery.32 The plugged biopsy is a modifi cation of the percutaneous method in which the biopsy track is plugged with collagen, thrombin, or other such material, as the cutting needle is removed from a sheath. 32 LB procedures are performed in a hospital and the patient may be given a sedative to prevent pain or calm them for the pro cedure. The LB is usually done th rough the abdominal wall with the patient laying on their back as still as possible. Th e LB site is cleaned and a local anesthetic is be administered. A small incision is made and the LB needle is inserted and guided by ultrasound to the appropriate location. The patie nt holds their breath during this part of the procedure as a precaution to avoid puncturing a lung or damaging th e liver. The needle is removed quickly after - 27 - the sample is taken; pressure is applied to th e incision site and then bandaged. The tissue sample is then sent for analysis. LB techniques require specific tr aining to ensure the appropriate-s ized specimen is retrieved and to decrease the potential for co mplications. Although LB is often essential in the management of patients with liver disease, physicians and pati ents may find it cumbersome because of the following associated risks: Pain is the most common complication of LB, occurring in up to 84% of patients, including relatively mild discomfort32 Bleeding is also a common complication of LB. Severe bl eeding can require hospitalization, transfusion, radiological intervention or surgery. Bleeding requiring hospitalization has been estim ated to occur between 1/2,500 and 1/10,000 intercostal percutan eous approach for diffuse, non-focal, liver disease. Less severe bleeding, defi ned as that sufficient to cause pain, reduced blood pressure, or cause tachycar dia, but not requir ing transfusion or intervention, occurs in approximately 1/500 LB32 Death after LB is usually related to bleeding. The most commonly quoted mortality rate is less than or equal to 1/10,000 LB. Mortality af ter transvenous LB is reported to be 9/10,000; however, this may reflect the selection of higher risk patients for this intervention32 Miscellaneous complications include: or sepsis), - 28 hemobilia, neuralgia, and rare complications such as ventricular arrhythmia with transvenous biopsy32 Scrutiny of LB suggests it may be susceptible to sampling error resulting in the under-diagnosis of cirrhosis in 10 to 20% of the patients who have had the procedure.33 This has been linked to the small biopsy size extracted for diagnosis. Add itionally, inter-observer studies have found that pathologists disagree on fibrosis scores in at least 1 in 5 cases.33 Therefore, LB may be the standard of care, but its diagnostic accuracy can be susceptible to error due to sample size and interpretation of results. 3.2.2 Liver Biopsy in Alberta Between 2005 and 2010, 62.81A (needle LB) and 62.82A (transjugular LB) were the most frequently used biopsies in Alberta (Figures 2 and 3). There was an overall increase in the number of LBs performed between 2005 and 2010 fo r the entire Province. The number of LBs increased from 1,804 in 2005 to 2,077 in 2010. Calgar y and Edmonton regularly performed the highest number of LBs. Overall, transjugular LBs were substantia lly lower than the number of needle LB with 6 performed in 2005 and 7 in 2 010. Use of transjugular LB peaked in 2008 with 15, but since then, use of the procedure has declined. - 29 - Figure 2 Number of needle liver biopsies (CCP code 62.81A) performed in Alberta, 2005-2010 Figure 3 Number of Transjugular Liver Biopsies (CCP Code: 62.82A) Performed in Alberta, 2005-2010 3.3 Transient Elastography 3.3.1 Background In 1991 a team of researchers disc overed that it was possible to create an image and measure the local elastic changes inside soft objects such as body tissue. 34 Originally referred to as TE, the procedure is now also commonly referred to as elastogram, sonoelast ogram, sonoelastography, real-time elastography, shear wave imaging, st rain imaging or ultrasound elastography. - 30 - In 1997, a landmark trial was completed to determ ine how various breast lesions appeared on elastograms and to explore TE's potential role in diagnosing breast le sions. As a diagnostic reference, the patients underwent ultrasound-guided biopsies or aspirations of all the lesions. The results showed that softer tissues, such as fat, appeared brighter on the elastograms and firmer tissues appeared darker. The firmer tissues incl ude breast parenchyma, cancers and other masses. Malignant lesions are statistically and significantl y darker than benign ones, and cancers also are substantially larger on elastograms than on sonograms.35 Over the last decade, the technology has moved beyond breast TE into the detection of malignant lesions of the thyroid, pancreas, prostate and lymphatic nodes. In 2003, a TE m achine called FibroScan\u00ae was developed by Echosens in France to measure the degree of fibrosis in the liver.36 As mentioned above, TE is a relatively new ul trasound technology us ed to assess tissue stiffness. 37;38 Traditional ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to generate an image of internal structures and organs w ithout exposing the patient to x-ra ys. Images are created in real- time allowing clinicians to view the structure and movement of internal organs and observe blood flow.39 In contrast, TE generates a controlled vibration producin g a mechanical shear wave with a consistent frequency and energy.40 The TE machine prevents wave distortions by monitoring the wave in real-time. Low energy ultrasound measures the shear wave as it propagates through the skin and liver tissues.40 Echosens claims that FibroScan\u00ae can produce a diagnostic cylinder with a diamet er of 1.0 cm and a length of 4.0 cm, which is at least 100 times the size of a tissue specimen obtained by LB.43 - 31 - TE machines have a variety of probe attachments that can measure tissue depths from 15 to 75 mm. Algorithms are used to attenuate the ultraso und, calculate liver stiffne ss and select the valid measurement. An elastogram, which is a gra ph representing the shear wave propagation as a function of time and depth, is used to calculate liver stiffness.40 The number of successful acquisitions of the shear wave by ultrasound is used to determine ti ssue density (the wave travels more quickly in stiff tissue). Ten valid measurements should be obtained. The median value of the 10 valid measurements is considered to be representative of th e liver's elasticity.41 The success rate is calculated as th e number of valid measurements divided by the total number of measurements. Examinations with a success ra te higher than 60% are considered reliable.41 In approximately 5-10% of patients, the proce dure is considered unsuccessful. Invalid measurements occur most frequently patients who are overweight, who have narrow intercostal space or patients with ascites.33 As previously mentioned, there are a variety of probes used for penetr ating different tissue depths. The field of view of a transducer pr obe is determined by its shape and frequency. 42 A linear array transducer probe ca n have up to 512 rectangular el ements, spaced over 75-120 mm, arranged in a line. Adjacent elements are simulta neously pulsed, with a delay between inner and outer elements, creating a focused beam.42 The length of time of each delay regulates the transmitter beam's depth of focus and can be adjusted during scanning. The production of a unique delay pattern for each scan line requires s ophisticated programming and electronics. 43 Linear arrays are less expensive than other type s of transducers and have difficulties assessing organs protected by the ribcage.44 Medical transducer probes usuall y have frequencies from 1 to 18 MHz. Higher frequencies are used to identify small details, but do no t have the same deep - 32 - tissue penetration as lower frequencies. Low frequency probes have be tter tissue penetration capabilities, but lack the ability to create the detailed images of higher frequencies. High frequency is considered 10-15 Mhz, wh ile low frequency is 7 Mhz or lower.45 TE examination is painless, rapid, and does not need any preparation. 46 The examination is performed by a trained health professional, or a trained technician supervised by a clinician, and takes between 5 and 10 minutes to ad minister. The results are immediate. The machine costs approximately $100,000 and extra probes an additi onal $5000 each. There is a standard probe, a probe for obese patients and a paediatric probe. FibroScan\u00ae can be administered by medical or non-medical sta ff under the supervision of a clinical practitioner. 47 Limited training is needed for the operation of FibroScan\u00ae and specialized training is not required to obtain accurate results.48 However, interpretation of the results and the integration of TE into patient care requires the expe rtise of a hepatologist or gastroenterologist. The optimal frequency of patient te sting has yet to be determined. The procedure for TE is the same as a traditiona l ultrasound procedure. Th e patient lies on an adjustable examination table. A water-based gel is applied to the region of interest so the transducer will remain in contact with the body and eliminate ai r pockets that can obstruct the sound waves. The transducer is pressed firmly ag ainst the skin and manipulated to provide the best image of the targeted region. The images ar e either sent to a clin ician for analysis or analyzed immediately if the proc edure was performed by a clinician.39 - 33 - Studies have shown high TE intra- observer and inter-observer agr eement respectively.33 The interclass correlation coefficient is a descriptive statistic that describes the consiste ncy with which different observers obtain similar measurements; therefore, researchers using TE obtain similar measurements in 89 to 98% of trials. 3.3.2 Transient Elastography in Alberta There are three centers currently using FibroScan\u00ae for diagnosing and monitoring liver disease in Alberta: the division of Gastroenterology at the Foothills Hospital, the division of Gastroenterology at the University of Alberta and a clinic, GI Resear ch and Associates, in Edmonton. The FibroScan\u00ae machine at the Foothills Hosp ital was purchased in 2008 with money dedicated to viral hepatitis care through Al berta Health and Wellness. The F oothills facility does not have a paediatric probe. There are ongoin g negotiations with Echosens to provide a trial probe. Seven hepatologists are currently using the machine and they have one full time technician. One physician estimated that 70 to 75 % of his patients received a FibroScan\u00ae for liver disease. FibroScan\u00ae gave him confidence in his diagnoses and reassured patients' concerned about their disease state. It also provided a means to easily monitor fibrosis progression in untreatable patients. The FibroScan\u00ae machine at the Foothills Hospital is very accessible. Most patients can be scanned within 2 weeks and it has virtually replaced LB. One physician estimates that less than one patient per week is being sent for LB whereas, before FibroScan\u00ae, this physician would have sent 2 to 3 HCV patients a week for LBs. This same phys ician uses LB as a fallback - 34 - when biochemical indicators suggest adva nced fibrosis or physic ians use FibroScan\u00ae as reassurance that LB results are correct. Sometimes LB does not provid e a complete picture of disease progression in patients with cirrhosis, so FibroScan\u00ae is used to elaborate on the inform ation provided by a LB. The FibroScan\u00ae machine at the Foothills Hospital services southern Alberta and southeastern BC. Requisitions are sent out to rural communities that have shown an interest in FibroScan\u00ae, and they are faxed back to the Foothills Hospital when necessary. After the patient is seen at the Foothills, the results are sent back to the patient's physician. Th e rural patient's physician is responsible for monitoring their condition. Between 2005 and 2010, out of Province patients accounted for 2-3% of the total LBs performed in Alberta. The FibroScan\u00ae machine at the University of Alberta was purchased by the adult services research department and all the hepatologists, in cluding the pediatric hepato logists, in Edmonton use this machine (approximately 11 in total). Th ey have a paediatric probe. The University of Alberta services all of northern Alberta and parts of northern BC. The second FibroScan\u00ae machine is located at GI Research and Associates in Edmonton. The FibroScan\u00ae machine at this location was funde d by a pharmaceutical company. Information on the patient community this clinic services was unavailable. All three FibroScan\u00ae locations were able to provide the number of procedures completed between 2009 and June 2011 (Table 2). The numb er of FibroScan\u00ae procedures has risen - 35 - dramatically at all three locations over the time period specified and includes out of Province patients. Table 2 Utilization of TE in Alberta by Location Location Time Period Clinic 2009 2010 Jan - June 2011 Foothills Hospital (Calgary) 496 1112 987 University of Alberta (Edmonton) 610 855 649 Edmonton Clinic 524 463 3.3.3 FibroScan\u00ae Health Canada Approval FibroScan\u00ae was licensed for use in Ca nada in 2009 for liver diagnosis.49 It is listed as a Class III device indicating a potential risk to patients requiring an in-depth review before licensing and sale were granted. The medical device classificati on system in Canada takes into consideration patient risks such as invasive ness, duration of patient contact , potential for tissue damaging energy transmission, and consequenc es of equipment malfunction.50 3.3.4 Best Practice There are no guidelines for TE specific to Alberta or Canada. 3.3.5 Other Jurisdictional Guidelines There are no other indications and contraindications according to other jurisdictions (e.g., manufacturer/industry, FDA). - 36 - 3.3.6 Safety TE is a non-invasive imaging technique that eliminat es the pain and risks a ssociated with LB. No safety issues have been identified with the use of TE and there have been no reports of adverse effects at the publicat ion of this report.47 However, TE does tran smit energy through direct contact with a patient; therefore, it has been assigned a Class III categorization by Health Canada.50 This means that the manufacturer must pr ovide research demons trating that their device operates within the tolerance limits appr opriate for the medical condition it was designed to test.51 3.4 Methods: Technology Effects and Effectiveness (T) 3.4.1 Literature Search We searched the literature for original studies reporting on the effectivene ss, risks, side effects and safety issues of TE in detecting, staging and monitoring liver fibrosis. We also searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and HTA repor ts documenting the use of TE in liver disease diagnosis. Grey literature, including Health Cana da or Federal Drug Admi nistration (FDA) sites, were also included in our search strategy. As the technology only became available in 2001, we limited our search to the last ten years (2001- 2011) and excluded any articles not available in English or French. Additionally, any non-human st udies were excluded. The search strategy and the databases that were searched are presented in Appendix 1. 3.4.2 Selection of Literature All titles and abstra cts were reviewed in duplicate. The in clusion/exclusion cr iteria are listed below (Table 3). Each of the included studies were assessed using th e quality of diagnostic - 37 - accuracy studies (QUADAS) quality assessment t ool; a method developed to determine the quality and accuracy of studies in cluded in a systematic review.52;53 The QUADAS tool consists of fourteen questions. For each study, a response of yes, no or unsure was recorded for each of the fourteen questions. The ques tions used in the QUADAS tool are presented in Table 1a, Tables section. Table 3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria Study must evaluate the accuracy of TE (FibroScan\u00ae), compared to LB The target population must be patients with adult liver disease Study must report test sensitivity and specificity OR negative and positive predictive values, OR sufficient data to calculate these measures of diagnostic test performance Study must be published in English OR French Study must be prospective in design Study must be either a randomized controlled trial OR a prospective diagnostic cohort study In diagnostic cohort studies, 85% or more of the patients must have been evaluated with TE and LB The study must have enrolled 10 or more patients The study must report results using METAVIR staging system Exclusion criteria Study published in a language other than English or French Study does not report any test performance measures or sufficient data to calculate these measures Study reported using a staging system other than METAVIR Animal and in vitro studies Duplicate publications Preliminary reports - 38 - 3.4.3 Data Extraction Data were extracted from papers by two review ers and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. A standa rdized data abstraction form was used to collect information on study population, methods, interventions, ou tcomes, and complications (Appendix 2). 3.4.4 Analysis An overall analysis of liver disease was comple ted for all liver disease etiologies. Individual study data were pooled using a random-effect mode l to calculate the AUROC for liver disease. The AUROC is an overall assessment of a te st's diagnostic accuracy or performance.1 The cut- off for liver fibrosis stages varies by disease st ate; therefore, 5 clinic al subgroups were defined a priori by the Expert Advisory Gr oup: HBV, HCV, NAFLD, CL D and LTP. ALD was included in the overall analysis, but a sub-group analysis was not conducted due to insufficient data on the use of LB in ALD. Studies were classified ba sed on the reported clinical diagnosis of included patients. In addition, the accuracy of TE for det ecting the following liver stages was considered: no fibrosis (F=0), mild fibrosis (F 1, significant (F 2), advanced/severe (F 3) and cirrhotic (F=4). For each subgroup, a pooled estimate of sensitivity and speci ficity for TE compared to LB was calculated. - 39 - We quantified the presence of heter ogeneity of TE effectiveness using I2. This statistical tool describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is attr ibutable to heterogeneity rather than chance.54;55 Informed by the clinical literatu re, several potential sources of heterogeneity were examined by conducting meta-regression (I2). The variables tested were: mean age, percentage of failures of TE, body mass index (BMI), bi opsy length, fibrosis prevalence, study size, year of pub lication and fibrosis stage cut-o ff. Lastly, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger and Begg's tests.56 All analyses were performed using Stata 11 statistical software. 3.5 Results: Systematic Review 3.5.1 Meta-analysis Reports Four meta-analyses and five scanning reports we re selected for review. The meta-analyses were of good quality. The five scanning reports provided an overview of the current state of literature assessing both clinical effec tiveness and cost-effectiveness of TE in comparison to LB. The reports suggest that TE is a reliab le diagnostic tool with potential cost savings when compared to LB. Each meta-analysis and scanning report is briefly outlined below. A meta-analysis by Shaheen et al., published in November 2007, examined the diagnostic test accuracy of FibroScan\u00ae for the pred iction of HCV-related fibrosis. 57 MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for literatu re published between January 1997 and October 2006. There were no language restrictions. This meta-analysis included papers that had HCV patient populations, LB as the comparator an d enough data to construct contingency tables. Twelve studies met the inclus ion criteria. The AUROC were meta-analyzed using a random- - 40 - effects model to account for the heterogene ity across studies. The summary AUROC for FibroScan\u00ae was excellent when diagnosing cirr hosis (F=4: 0.95), but the accuracy dropped in patients with significant fibrosis (F 2: 0.83). The study concluded FibroScan\u00ae had excellent accuracy for identifying cirrhosis, but the accuracy decreased for th e earlier stages of fibrosis. The authors suggested that Fibr oScan\u00ae must undergo more refinement and testing before it could be considered as a replacement for LB . This study was limited by the small number of publications included in the analysis. Numerous large studies have been completed since the publication of Shaheen et al.'s meta-analysis. In January 2008, Friedrich-Rust and collea gues published another meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of TE compared to LB in three disease groups: HCV patients only, various liver diseases in a patient population including HCV, and patients without HCV. Their search strategy included PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL a nd grey literature from 2002 - April 2007. Articles were included if TE was evaluated, LB was used as the comparator, diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis was assessed using METAVIR or an e quivalent system, and if sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, or negative predictive value of a fibrosis stage was assessed using a cut-off indicator for liver stiffness. Fifteen comp lete articles and 35 ab stracts were included in the final analysis. The AUROC were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to account for the heterogeneity across studies . For all fibrosis stages, the AUROC was good to excellent (F 2: 0.84, F3: 0.89, F=4: 0.94) for the overall liver diseas e population. Findings were similar across disease groups. Similar to other meta-analysis', th e authors concluded that TE was most useful in the detection of cirrhosis. 41 - 41 - A meta-analysis published in March 2010 by Stebbing et al. investigated the diagnostic accuracy of TE for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. Th e search strategy included MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Sc holar, textbooks, medical reports, and grey literature. The inclusion criteria were detailed pa tient descriptions, LB as the comparator, and an index test using TE to determine fibrosis stages in correlation with LB. The 22 studies included in this review had pa tients with CHC, CHB, NAFLD, CL D, and co-infections. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by pooled estimates for significant fibrosis based on kilopascals identifying fibrosis stages in relation to LB. The results showed TE had good sensitivity and specificity (F 2: 71.9% and 82.4%) for signifi cant fibrosis and good to excellent sensitivity and specificity for cirrhosis (F=4: 84.45% and 94.69%). The authors suggest future studies investigate TE liver stiffness measurements to improve sensitivity. 58 Finally, a meta-analysis by Tsochatzia and coll eagues, published in April 2011, investigated the diagnostic performance of TE for fibrosis. Their systematic search strategy included material from MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCI, Cochrane Libr ary, conference abstracts, books, and grey literature from 2007 to 2009. The in clusion criteria consisted of full papers and abstracts evaluating TE for the monitoring an d diagnosis of liver fibrosis se verity, LB as the comparator and diagnostic accuracy for fibrosis using MET AVIR or an equivalent system. No language restrictions were applie d. Forty articles were included for fi nal analysis consisting of patient populations with CHB and CHC, ALD, NAFLD, and CHC and HIV co-infections. Data were combined using hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristics and bivariate normal random-effects analysis of sensitivity and specifici ty. Summary sensitivity and specificity results showed promise for TE accurate ly diagnosing cirrhosis after a \"positive\" measurement (F=4: - 42 - 0.83 and 0.89), but it was less accurate with significant fibrosis (F 2: 0.79 and 0.78). The authors suggest that TE should be used wi th caution in clinical settings due to insufficien t validation for stiffness cut-off points for fibrosis stages.59 3.5.2 Scanning Reports Five scanning reports from Aust ralia, Canada, France and the UK, were selected for review. Australia's National Sca nning Unit published a report in Sept ember 2006 which determined that TE had poor tissue penetration in obese patien ts, questionable diagnos tic effectiveness in significant to advanced fibrosis, but demonstr ated good to excellent accuracy in detecting cirrhosis.60 They also reported that TE had a potenti al cost savings when compared to LB.60 Both the Haute Authorite de Sante in France (Dec 2006) and the UK National Horizon Scanning Centre (Apr 2008) reported similar findings: ex cellent diagnostic accuracy with cirrhosis, increased patient screening, a non-invasive procedure and less costly than biopsy.61;62 Two scanning reports from the Canadian Agency fo r Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) were identified. The first report, published in September 2006, found that FibroScan\u00ae was a rapid and cost effective non-inva sive diagnostic tool for evaluating advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, but its accuracy decreased for patients with mild fibrosis.47 In an updated report (April 2008) the authors concluded that th ere was evidence for the clinical effectiveness of elastography (31 observational studies), but that there were no health t echnology assessments on its cost effectiveness or guidelines for use.63 3.5.3 Health Technology Assessments There were no complete health t echnology assessments identified. - 43 - 3.6 Conclusion: Meta-analyses and scanning reports The meta-analyses and scanning reports indicate that TE is an effective non-invasive diagnostic tool for analyzing advanced fibrosis and cirrhosi s. The procedure has the potential to increase screening rates of patients at a cost savings compared to biopsy. The reports recommend the completion of an HTA, and noted that more research is needed to delineate cut-off points and to increase fibrosis sensitivity for each fibrosis stage. 3.7 Results: Systematic Review of Original Articles Our literature search yielded 1753 titles. After title and abstract review, we excluded 1621 studies that did not meet the incl usion criteria. After a full text review of the remaining records, 57 papers were eligible for inclusion and 74 st udies were excluded. Figure 4 shows the flowchart of the assessed citations.

Variables were selected based on the clinical limitations of TE and LB and known sources of he terogeneity. Mean age, percen tage of failures of TE, BMI, LB length, fibrosis prevalence, study size, year of publication and fibros is stage cut-off were considered. One study was excluded as it was an extreme outlier reporting no false positives or false negatives and the percenta ge of failures was high (45%).74 Biopsy length, study size, year of publication and fibrosis stage cut-off were not statistically significant predictors of heterogeneity in any of the analyses. In the univariate analyses for the F 2 subgroup, mean age - 48 - (p = 0.005), percentage of failures (p = 0.012) a nd BMI (p = 0.075) were statistically significant predictors of heterogeneity. However, in the multivariate model, BMI was no longer a significant predictor (p = 0.316). In the F 3 subgroup, mean age was statistically significant (p=0.024) and in the F=4 subgroup, fibrosis prevalence wa s statistically significant (p=0.072). 3.7.4 Publication Bias No evidence of publication bias was found. The funne l plot for each of the fibrosis stages (not shown) demonstrated a random scatter of the studies with studies falling into all four sections of the plot (small samples with large and small effects and large samples with large and small effects). The p-values resulting from Egger's test were non-significant (F 2: 0.22, F 3: 0.51 and F=4: 0.20). 3.7.5 Clinical Subgroup Meta-Analysis The articles included in each subgroup analysis ar e summarized in the Tables section, Tables 4- 8. Table 6, below, presents the pooled sensitivity and specificity of TE compared to LB for each clinical disease and fibros is subgroup. No estimate was available for the NALFD, F 3 group, as too much heterogeneity exists to relia bly pool the data. In addition, CLD and LTP were excluded from the meta-analysis as only 1 and 2 studies were identified, respectively. Overall, TE had sufficient to excellent diagnostic accuracy with sensitivities ranging from 0.67 to 0.92 and specificities from 0.72 to 0.95.

The diagnostic accuracy is similar across all disease subgroups considered. 3.8 Economic Analysis 3.8.1 Literature Search The literature was searched for original economic evaluations of TE and only studies published in English or French were included. Only arti cles with information on detecting, staging and monitoring liver fibrosis in comparison to LB we re subject to full-review. We included studies reporting on cost-minimization, cost -effectiveness or cost-utility. Th e same clinical search terms were used as in the clinical review (Appendix 1), with economic search terms overlaid. Reports of costs with no consideration of clinical benefit were excluded. 3.8.2 Primary Economic Evaluation We completed a primary economic evaluation usi ng a simple decision model. Subsequently, we modeled the cost per correct diagnosis of TE compared to LB as outlined in Figure 6. - 50 - Broadly, the patient is screened using either TE or LB. Fibrosis prevalence is used to represent the likelihood that the patient has liver fibrosis . Based on the diagnostic accuracy of TE, the patient is classified as a true positive, false positive, true negative or false negative. True positives and true negatives are considered correct diagnoses. In the base case, patients do not continue to LB as the model cons iders cost per correct diagnosis. The impact of sequential LB is explored in a threshold analysis. Figure 6 Simple Decision Model 3.8.3 Target Population, Comparators, Perspective and Time Horizon The model compares the number of correct di agnoses using TE as opposed to LB. Following recommended guidelines, the perspective adopt ed is that of the health care payer. 121 The time horizon is from screening to result of test as we are only consideri ng the cost per correct diagnosis. As it is unlikely th e decision to use TE or LB w ould affect the therapeutic and treatment outcomes for long-term care, the m odel did not include long-term outcomes. No discounting was used due to the short time frame. Fibrosis prevalence and disease type influence the diagnostic accuracy of TE and LB. To addre ss the differences between disease subgroups and - 51 - fibrosis stages, we identified 15 ta rget populations: 3 fibrosis stages (F 2, subgroups (HBV, HCV, NAFLD, CLD and LTP). The inputs values varied with each subgroup. 3.8.4 Clinical Inputs - Diagnostic Accuracy and Fibrosis Prevalence Both the prevalence of fibrosis by disease and the diagnostic accuracy of TE were informed by the clinical meta-analysis (described in the T sec tion). For each paper, the prevalence of fibrosis was estimated by dividing the number of diseas ed by the total numbe r tested. A weighted average was then calculated for each subgr oup. The clinical meta-analysis provided the sensitivity and specificity for each subgroup. 3.8.5 Resource Use and Costs All costs are reported in 2010 Canadian dollars. The costs asso ciated with LB and TE were taken from the published literature. Costs were inflat ed using the Statistics Canada general consumer price index. 122 Only direct healthcare cost s are taken into considerati on. Societal costs may differ between TE and LB. For example, there is 1 addi tional physician visit, pr e-screening blood work and additional time off work associated with LB. However, these costs were excluded from the analysis underestimating the cost of LB. For TE, the cost of the machine, annual maintenance costs, and the physician cost were included. In the base case, the cost of the machine is amortized over an anticipated life time of 7 years with an annual utilization rate based on the 2010 average of the 3 centers in Alberta. This was varied in sensitivity analysis varying the expected lifetime of the machine and the annual util ization rate. Lastly, the model a ssumed that all LB and TE will be completed within existing infrastructure thus no capital costs were included in the model (i.e. - 52 - cost of operating room for LB, co st of maintaining the operati ng room, cost of room for TE machine, etc.). 3.8.6 Variability and Uncertainty Various sensitivity analyses were completed to e xplore the impact of the assumptions on the cost per correct diagnosis. The publishe d Canadian cost of LB is s ubstantially lowe r than those reported in other countries. Thus , the costs of LB were varied to represent costs seen in the US and Europe to explore the impact of the cost of LB on the results. The cost of the ultrasound machine was amortized over five and, subsequentl y, ten years to explore the impact of varying the lifetime of a machine. The annual utilization was varied to reflect the reported usage of TE in both Calgary and Edmonton. This was done to expl ore the impact of incr eased utilization. In addition, a threshold analysis wa s conducted to determ ine the required lik elihood of a patient undergoing a LB after undergoing TE for TE to b ecome the less economically attractive option; the same cost as LB alone but less clinical eff ectiveness. Lastly, as sensitivity, specificity and prevalence are linked concepts, an d cannot be varied independen tly, a probabilisti c sensitivity analysis was completed. Normal distributions were used for each of the three variab les and 95% confidence intervals for the cost per correct diagnosis were reported. 3.8.7 Results: Economic Evaluation 3.8.7.1 Literature Review Findings Seventy-eight potentially relevant citations were reviewed. Fifteen papers were selected for full text review (Figure 7). Only two articles met the inclusion criteria for eco nomic review. The two articles are summarized in Figure 7. - 53 - Figure 7 Flow Chart of Literature Identified for Economic Evaluation The Purchasing and Supply Agency of the Nati onal Health Services for the UK presented an economic report in 2009 on the co st-effectiveness of ultrasound TE compared to LB in the assessment of liver fibrosis. 123 The model considers two target populations; F 2 and F=4. No clinical disease group is specified. An economic model incor porating the diagno stic accuracy and costs of each test was developed. The resu lting average cost per additional correctly diagnosed fibrosis using LB compared to TE was \u00a32,626 ($4,260 CAD) for stages F 2, and \u00a333,839 ($54,890 CAD) for stage F=4. The results were sensitive to changes in the diagnostic accuracy of TE and the underlying prevalence of fibrosis. - 54 - Carlson and colleagues (2009) presented a cost -effectiveness evaluati on on non-invasive diagnostic tests for signif icant liver fibrosis in patients with HCV virus.124 The authors created a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost and accuracy of TE compared to LB. TE was associated with a lower cost th an LB (an average of $1124). However, TE resulted in fewer correct diagnoses than LB. The av erage cost per correct diagnosis with TE compared to LB was - $1096. 3.8.7.2 Primary Economic Analysis 3.8.7.2.1 Clinical inputs - Prevalence, Diagnostic Accuracy Table 7 presents the prevalence of fibrosis st age and diagnostic accuracy of TE by disease and fibrosis stage subgroup. Both the diagnostic accuracy and the preval ence of fibrosis stage vary across disease groups. Table 7 Prevalence of Fibrosis Stag e and Diagnostic Accuracy of TE Disease Fibrosis stage Prev. (95%CI) Sens. (95% Costs of Transient Elastography and Liver Biopsy The costs of LB were $461.30 based on the available Canadian literature. 47 Both a European estimate of $1095 and a US-based estimate of $1365 were considered in sensitivity analysis.47 The cost of TE was estimated based on the assumptions outlined in Table 8. Table 8 Assumptions for Cost of TE Variable Value Reference Total cost of ultrasound machine $111,786 CADTH 121 Annual maintenance cost $8,412 CADTH 121 Lifetime of a machine 7 years NHS 123 Number of scans per year 830 2010 average in Alberta Physician fee per scan $70.06 SOMB (3.01C) 125 Total cost per scan $99.44 3.8.7.4 Cost-effectiveness Results Table 9 presents the results of the base case an alysis. LB is more expensive and more effective than TE in all disease and fibrosis stage subgroups. As LB is regarded as the standard of care, the model assumes it correctly diagnoses 100% of patients (1000 of the 1000 hypothetical cohort). On average, LB costs an additional $362 per pro cedure than TE. The cost per correct diagnosis using LB compared to TE varies from $1427 to $7030 depending on the subgroup considered - 56 - Table 9 Cost per correct diagnosis using LB compared to TE Disease Fibrosis stage Number of correct diagnoses using TE (per 1000) Number of incremental correct diagnoses using LB (per 1000) Incremental cost per correct diagnosis using LB compared to TE ($/correct diagnosis gained) F2 747 253 $1427 F3 818 182 $1985 Hepatitis B F=4 820 F2 806 194 $1861 F3 900 100 $3620 Hepatitis 758 242 $1498 F3 947 79 $4569 949 Sensitivity analysis A one-way sensitivity analysis was completed on th e cost of LB and TE. As the cost of LB increases, the cost per correct diagnosis incr eases; the cost difference between LB and TE increases for the same clinical benefit making LB a less economically at tractive option. As the cost of TE increases due to either decreased utili zation or decreased life span, the cost per correct diagnosis decreases; the cost difference between LB and TE decreases for the same clinical benefit making LB a more economica lly attractive option. Similarly, as the cost of TE decreases, the cost per correct diagnosis incr eases. Table 10 presents the re sults of the sensitivity analysis. - 57 - Table 10 Cost Sensitivity Analysis Note: Incremental cost per correct diagnosis using LB compared to TE ($/correct diagnosis gained)Disease Fibrosis Stage Base case (cost of LB = $461.31 cost per TE = $99.44) ($1095 CAD) US LB costs ($1365 CAD) Lifetime of TE machine = 5 years (cost per TE = $107.13) Lifetime of TE machine = 10 years (cost per TE = $93.66) Calgary 2010 utilization (number of scans = 1112, cost per TE = $91.99) U of A 2010 utilization (number of scans = 855, cost per TE = $98.58) Edm Clinic 2010 utilization (number of scans = 524, cost per TE 3.8.7.6 Threshold Analysis In a scenario analysis, the likelihood of unde rgoing LB after TE was considered. If the probability of undergoing a LB, regardless of TE result, is greater than 78%, LB becomes the dominant option (i.e. LB will cost the same as TE, but it is the more clinically accurate choice). 3.8.7.7 Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis The 95% CIs resulting from the probabilistic sens itivity analysis of sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of fibrosis are pres ented in Table 11. As expected, all three variables impact the resulting cost per correct diagnosis with wide CIs. Of note, the NALFD F=4 and CLD F=4 (95% CI) includes TE as the dominant option meaning it is less expensive than LB and as effective as LB. Table 11 Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis Disease Fibrosis stage Incremental cost per correct diagnosis using LB compared to TE ($/correct diagnosis gained, 95% Budget Impact Analysis The upfront cost of the FibroScan\u00ae machine is approximately $111,786 with an additional $8412 annually for upkeep. Other costs would be ultr asound gel, the salary of a technician and any physician fee-for-service associated with the visit. The potential cost savings will be approximately $362 for every LB that is repl aced by a FibroScan\u00ae pro cedure. To recoup the upfront cost of the machine and annual maintena nce, assuming a 7 year lifetime of the machine, approximately 67 biopsies would need to be avoi ded per year (417 in to tal over 7 years). Based on the limited data available, the rate of biops y per 1000 disease cases has not changed since the introduction of FibroScan\u00ae in 2009 as outlined in Table 12 below. Table 12 Rate of liver biopsy per 1000 cases of liver disease, 2005-2010 Year Rate of liver biopsy (per 1000 cases of liver disease) 2005 278 2006 268 2007 278 2008 282 2009 252 2010 301 Based on data provided by AHW, th ere are 12 sites in Alberta co mpleting more than 10 biospies per year (Table 13). If each of those sites were provided with a FibroScan\u00ae machine, the total budget impact would be $1.34 M for the machines and an additional $100,944 in annual upkeep costs. However, based on the 2010 data, 6 sites are completing less than 100 biopsies annually. Given that 67 biopsies per year mu st be offset, it is unlikely that FibroScan\u00ae would result in cost savings in those centres. - 60 - Table 13 Biopsy utilization by site, 2005-2010 Site (scrambled identifier) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total C33J61 81 82 123 145 121 1006 658 C74Q61 416 443 376 359 406 520 2520 E21Q61 216 275 285 272 268 284 1600 E33Q61 503 535 438 475 500 483 2934 E66Q61 60 44 53 57 66 63 343 E97Q61 28 25 45 44 45 37 224 L97J61 85 96 109 89 81 120 580 X35Q61 89 69 92 104 69 75 498 Y12J61 24 25 28 26 34 37 174 Y21Q61 0 12 11 9 23 22 77 Y66Q61 58 40 49 61 63 87 358 Z74Q62 219 262 288 279 184 205 1437 3.8.8 Discussion 3.8.8.1 Assessment Limitations To our knowledge, this is the most comprehens ive HTA completed. Previous work has either focused on the clinical effectiveness of TE or the economic value. No literature to date has considered both the clinical effectiveness an d economic value in parallel. However, this assessment does have limitations. First, we are limited by the available literature. However, this limitation is likely to be small as the search strategy was designed to be over-inclusive: i.e. our inclusion and exclusion criteria were broad. Our economic model, as with all models, is also limited by the available data. Of note, we used observational data to inform the diagnostic accuracy and prevalence estimates. Ideally these estimates would be taken from a randomized controlled trial to minimize any se lection bias. However, in this case, a randomized controlled trial is unlikely to be performed; therefor e, we are limited to observational data. Additionally, the economic model does not consider operational costs required to perform LB or TE (i.e. operating room costs, nursing salaries , office space for Gastroenterologists, etc.) - 61 - However, exclusion of these costs is likely to u nderestimate the cost of LB. TE will be a more economically attractive option if these costs were included. Las tly, our model does not include societal costs or patient preferen ces. Again, these exclusions are likely to bias the results in favour of LB which requires more patient time and is less preferable due to patient discomfort and its invasive nature. Despite these limitations, our assessme nt is methodologically rigorous and follows best practices in both syst ematic reviews and economic evaluation. 3.8.8.2 Delivery Considerations TE's efficiency and effectiveness in diagnosing severe fibrosis a nd cirrhosis can increase patient screening. This will rapidly iden tify patients who require further di agnostic evaluation or are in need of immediate treatment. However, the effici ency of TE has the poten tial to increase its scope of use into fibrosis monitoring, despite limited ev idence for this purpose. 3.8.8.3 Implementation Considerations TE must be used under the supervision of a Ga stroenterologist. Depe nding on the location and availability of Gastroenterologists across the province, the uptake of TE across the province could be limited. 3.8.8.4 Evolving Developments TE for the diagnosis of liver diseases is curren tly being used in two major population centres in Alberta (Calgary and Edmonton). Its use could expand throughout th e province. However, TE is only useful in the presence of a Hepatologist or Gastroenterologist thus its adoption would be limited to places with established liver disease clinic s. In addition, it is likely that the use of TE - 62 - will expand into alternative/emerging uses as more studies are published that demonstrate the strong diagnostic accuracy of TE in compar ison to other invasive procedures. 3.8.9 Conclusions TE has strong to excellent diagnos tic accuracy in adult liver diseas e with AUROC in the range of 0.88-0.94. In the five clinical subg roups considered, the diagnosti c accuracy is similar with sensitivities ranging from 0.67-0.92 and specifici ties ranging from 0.72-0.95. In addition, TE costs less than LB but is less effective. LB is associated with an additional $1,427-$7,030 per correct diagnosis gain ed. System-wide implementation of TE should be considered. - 63 - 4 TRANSIENT ELASTOGRAPHY FOR US E WITH PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS 4.1 Background As with adult patients, the current standard of care for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease in paediatric patients (under 18 years old) is LB. Howeve r, TE may have th e capability to reduce the number of LBs performed on paediatric patients and to provide health care providers with a more comprehensive clini cal picture to base their treatm ent decisions upon. As paediatric patients are a vulnerable population, a non-invasive option to LB is par ticularly attractive. In this report, TE will be assessed in comparison to LB as a method for liver disease diagnosis and monitoring. 4.2 Social Systems and Demographics of Paediatric Liver Disease (S) 4.2.1 Causes of Pediatric Liver Disease The type and frequency of liver disease that aff ects paediatric patients differs considerably from adult populations. In 2010, the most common cause of liver disease in the adult population was viral hepatitis. Whereas, liver disease in the pediatric population can st em from a number of causes such as genetics (Wilson's disease, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency or Tyrosinemia), viral liver disease (hepatitis A, B or C) or poor bile flow from the li ver (Biliary Atresia or Alagille Syndrome). 4 With rapidly increasing rates of obesity in developed countries, NAFLD is also becoming a major cause of liver damage in ch ildren. A 2009 article re ported that NAFLD had become the leading cause of paediatric liver disease world-wide.5 NAFLD is a liver disease etiology that has quickly increased in prevalence. 5 This disease is most common in children who are obese and/or children with type II diabetes.126 The disease is more - 64 - common in male children than females. Its preval ence also differs by ethnicity with Hispanic children the most prone to NAFLD.126 Children with higher total cholesterol, higher blood pressure, higher insulin levels and higher gl ucose levels are most at risk of NAFLD.126 One of the most common causes of liver disease in childhood is Biliary Atresia. Biliary atresia is often diagnosed in early childhood, and affects up to 1/20,000 infants in Canada. 127 It occurs when the bile duct is damaged or blocked, which re sults in improper bile drainage into the small intestines. As bile backs up into the liver, th e liver tissue becomes da maged. A Kasai procedure may remedy this, or a liver transplant may be necessary. Another common cause of liver disease in children is viral hepatitis. 128 Nearly 90% of the hepatitis cases are eith er HAV, HBV, and HCV.128 Is it estimated that between 5-13 per 100,000 children have hepatitis B.128 With treatment, children will rarely suffer long-term damage as a result of viral hepatitis.128 Wilson disease is hereditary, and occurs in 1/30,000 infants born in Canada. 129 Wilson disease is characterized by the accumulation of copper within the body, and often results in liver damage. Symptoms develop as copper accumulates, so it of ten takes a number of y ears before a diagnosis is made. This disease is often treated with a decoppering agent. In paediatric cases where liver disease is su spected, non-invasive diagnostic procedures are favourable to reduce discomfort in this population. 130 - 65 - 4.2.2 Burden of Paediatric Liver Disease in Alberta Within Alberta, the number of paediatric liver disease patients is comparatively low. It is estimated that approximately 1 in every 250 Am erican children have HCV and approximately 10% of the pediatric population has NAFLD.131 Figure 8 shows the prevalence of four types of p aediatric liver disease within Alberta. Of the four displayed, HBV has consistently been the hi ghest within the past six years peaking in 2010 with five cases reported. HBV is followed in frequency by both NAFLD and HCV, with CLD being the least frequent of the four. This graph is limited in that it only shows four disease etiologies; it does not show so me of the main causes of paediatric liver disease. Figure 8 Number of Cases of Pediatric Liver Disease in Alberta - 66 - 4.2.3 Paediatric Transient El astography in Alberta Currently there is one FibroScan\u00ae m achine in Alberta being used for paediatric patients and it is located in Edmonton. The machine is shared by elev en physicians (one who uses it for paediatric patients). Both the machine and the paediatric probe were funded through research money. The Paediatric Gastroenterologist who uses th e machine in Edmonton was consulted to provide expert advice on the current and pot ential use of TE in paediatric patients. This individual is the only physician in Alberta currently using TE on th e paediatric population. He has use of the machine for one half day a week, and noted that it was difficult to schedule patients with such limited availability. Currently, he uses TE on approxi mately 30-40% of his patients, and orders a LB for about 10% of his patients. This expert noted that his use of TE is dependent upon the patient's history and liver disease etiology. For example, TE resu lts will not cha nge the clinical pathway of a patient newly diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis. In this case, LB will be performed regardless of TE results. However, fo r a low-risk patient w ith NAFLD, TE may be used instead of LB. This expert also noted that he uses TE to non-invasively monitor disease in paediatric patients with biliary atresia to predict whether they need a surveillance endoscopy. He emphasized that TE has changed his practice and th at it gives reassurance and more confidence in the decisions he makes. One thing that was emphasized during our consul tation was that the machine, without a pediatric gastroenterologist, is no t useful. The TE results must be read and interpreted by an expert who takes other clinical factors into consideration when interpreting TE results. As this kind of - 67 - paediatric expertise only exists in Calgary and Edmonton, having TE machines for paediatric use outside these city centers would not be useful. Further to this, it was noted that a TE machine in both Calgary and Edmonton solely for use on paediatric patients would provide better access. He mentioned that significant expertise exists in both of these major centers; given the ease of using TE, this expert concluded that there would be enough expertise in each city to use the machines to capacity. 4.3 Technology Effects an d Effectiveness (T) 4.3.1 Current Standard of Care (Liver Biopsy) As with adults, LB is the curr ent standard of care for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease in paediatric patients. Paediatric LBs ar e performed in a hospital and the patient is given general anesthetic, unlikely a dults who are given a local anes thetic. The LB is usually done through the abdominal wall with th e patient laying on their back. A small incision is made and the LB needle is inserted and guided by ultrasound to the appropriate locati on. The needle is removed quickly after the sample is taken; pre ssure is applied to the incision site and then bandaged. Uncomplicated paediatric LB usually take 45 minutes. The chil d will be asked to refrain from eating or drinking at least 6 hours prior to surgery, a nd will remain in hospital for observation for at least 6 hours. 132 LB techniques require specific tr aining to ensure the appropriate-s ized specimen is retrieved and to decrease the potential for complications. There are a number of risks to paediatric patients that are associated with LB. The anesthetic used for sedation may cause harmful side-effects (such as - 68 - difficulty breathing), transfusion or surgery may be required if the liver continues to bleed after the procedure, bile leakage or acc idental puncturing of another organ.133 4.3.2 Transient Elastography There is little difference in the use of TE for adult patients or paediatric patients. The most significant difference is that since children often have small intercostal spaces, a paediatric probe must be used. TE detects liver stiffness through the space between the ri bs, so for children, a smaller probe is required to fit between the ribs . It is pertinent to note that although a unique probe must be used, the standard TE machine can be used to connect with the paediatric probe. During examination, the child lies supine with their right arm maxima lly abducted. The TE examination is painless, rapid, and does not need any preparation. 46 The examination is performed by a trained health professional, or a trained technician supervised by a clinician, and takes between 5 and 10 minutes to admi nister. The results are immediate. 4.4 Systematic Review and Meta-analysis 4.4.1 Methods In order to quantitatively assess the efficacy of TE for paediatric patients compared to the current standard of care (LB) a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Nine electronic databases were searched, using terms such as non-invasive, liver stiffness, FibroScan\u00ae, and fibrosis (Appendix 1). This search was limited to French and English lang uage articles published between 2000 and 2011. - 69 - Articles were included if the sample population was under the age of 18 and had liver disease, TE was used, LB was the comparator, the report was prospective, the study was designed as a randomized controlled trial or cohort study, resu lts were reported usi ng the METAVIR scoring system and 10 or more patients were enrolled (Box 3). Studies were ex cluded if they were non- human, duplicate publications, preliminary results , did not report enough data to formulate a contingency table or if the METAVIR system was not employed. Literature on economic the implications of TE and paediatric patien ts were included in full-text review. - 70 - Box 3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria Study population must be under 18 years old Study must evaluate the accuracy of TE compared to LB, or must report on the economic impact of using TE with paediatric patients The target population must be patients with liver disease Study must report test sensitivity and specificity OR negative and positive predictive values, OR sufficient data to calculate these measures of diagnostic test performance Study must be published in English OR French Study must be prospective in design Study must be either a randomized controlled trial OR a prospective diagnostic cohort study The study must have enrolled 10 or more patients The study must report results using METAVIR staging system Exclusion criteria Study published in a language other than English or French Study does not report any test performance measures or sufficient data to calculate these measures Study reported using a staging system other than METAVIR Study participants were over 18 years old Animal and in vitro studies Duplicate publications Preliminary reports 4.4.2 Results The search of electronic databases returned 1753 abstracts of potentially relevant articles (Figure 9). After abstract review, 3 papers were identifi ed to proceed to full-text review. Of these 3 papers, two were excluded after full-text review because the reference standard was not LB. Both - 71 - of the excluded studies reported on the use of tr ansient elastography for th e detection of gastric or esophageal varices in paediatr ic patients with Biliary Atresia.134;135 Based on the inclusion criteria outlined in Box 3, only 1 paper was relevant to paediatric TE. Figure 9 Flow Chart of Literature Id entified for Paediatric Liver Disease Results from the included paediatric study are summ arized in Table 14. In this study, Nobili et al looked at 52 children who had biops y-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 130 All included patients underwent both transient elastography and bi opsy. Nobili et al concluded that \"TE is an accurate and reproducible methodology to identify paediatric subjects without fibrosis or significant fibrosis, or with advanced fibrosis.\" Studies Identified by database/hand search n=1753 After title/abstract reviewing n= 1750 Exclude Included in Systematic Review (Paediatric Liver )Full text Review n=3 ExcludeExcluded after full-text review (n=2) Reasons for exclusion: LB not reference test (n=2) - 72 - Table 14 Results of Incl uded Paediatric Study Author, Year Study Sample Standard of Care Elastography Test Description Elastography Cut-off Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) NPV (%) PPV (%) AUROC Nobili 2008130 52 consecutive patients included (32 males, 20 females) prospectively Mean age 13.6 \u00b1 2.44 July 15th 2007-January 15th 2008 Included if: serum aminotransfer ase was elevated 18 gauge core biopsy with ultrasoun d guidance Elastography performed using a FibroScan device with a 3-5 MHz transducer probe Patient lay dorsal decubitus with right maximally abducted Blinded 5.1 kPA 7.4 kPA 10.2 kPA 97 92 100 91 92 100 91 100 100 97 80 100 0.97 0.99 1 4.4.3 Discussion Although the study concluded that TE was an effective method of diagnosing liver disease in paediatric patients, more studies and larger coho rts are needed to determine the usefulness of TE. With no information available on the economic impact of TE for paediatric patients, an economic analysis could not be completed. This information would be required to make an informed decision about the potential future us e of TE on paediatric patients in Alberta. - 73 - 5 ACOUSTIC RADIATION FORCE IMPULSE 5.1 Background Although the most commonly used alternative to LB is TE, another technology, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, can be used as a non-invasive method for diagnosing and monitoring liver disease. In this repor t, ARFI was compared, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to TE and LB as a method fo r liver disease diagnosis and monitoring. 5.2 Social Systems and Demographics of ARFI (S) 5.2.1 Liver Fibrosis and Liver Disease Etiologies In adults, liver fibrosis is commonly caused by HBV and HCV, NAFLD, CLD and LTP complications. Historically, the main causes of chronic liver disease have been CHB and alcoholic liver disease.12 However, over the last few decad es, CHC and NAFLD have become increasingly prevalent.12 With rapidly increasing rates of obe sity in develope d countries, NAFLD is becoming a major cause of significant fibrosis.13 Liver fibrosis is characterized by the replacement of liver tissu e by fibrotic or scar tissue. Increasing fibrosis can redu ce blood flow in the liver and lead to loss of liver function. If the scar tissue permanently changes blood circula tion, fibrosis leads to cirrhosis. 5.2.2 Staging Staging is a method used to classify a pa tient's disease progre ssion along a continuum. 28 One of the uses of ARFI is the diagnosis of liver diseas e according to these stages of liver disease. With - 74 - most chronic diseases, stage generally increa ses with time; although, relapsing or remitting diseases may be exceptions to this rule. 5.3 Technology Effects an d Effectiveness (T) 5.3.1 Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ARFI is an advanced form of ultrasound imaging and a non-invasive procedure. It ca n be used to assess the stiffness of liver tissu e; therefore, it is a potential alternative to LB and competing technology with TE. ARFI imaging is an alternative that is fast and with no in dications of risk at the publication of this report. It uses short, high-intensity pul ses (approximate duration of 0.3 seconds) of acoustic radiation force to displace tissue in the body. 136 These high intensity pulses are followed by a series of diagnostic pulses wh ich assess the magnitude of displacement at multiple locations.137 The displacement of the tissue varies i nversely to its stiffness; the stiffer the tissue, the smaller displacement. As such, tissue displacement can range anywhere from 1-20 microns. 138 As the procedure is underway, results are displayed on an attached screen. Images are displayed as a grayscale map of relative ti ssue elasticity, where bright regions represent tissue that is less stiff. Results of the el asticity measurement are also reported in m/s.113 ARFI devices have all of the capabilities of a standard u ltra-sound device, which make it possible for conventional B-ultrasound and ARFI re sults to be compared side-by-side either retrospectively or in real-time. Furthermore, ARF I's small region of interest (1 cm diameter) and variable depths (up to 55mm) allows it to acco mmodate patient groups difficult to assess using TE, such as obese patients or patients with ascites. 110 - 75 - When a health professional is performing ARFI, the patient will lie supine with their right arm maximally abducted. The person conducting the exam ination is able to select the depth of measurement and desired region of interest on th e ARFI device. Ideally, minimal pressure is applied on the probe by the health professional.113 Often, the patient will be asked to momentarily hold their breath to reduce movement associated with inspiration/expiration. There are no specific recommendations from the manuf acturer about the numb er of measurements necessary to obtai n reliable results.139 The literature suggests that there is great variability on how many measurements are taken per patient, ranging from 5-10 tr ials per patient. It takes 5-10 minutes to complete the procedure. The German based company Siemens was the first to produce a commercially available device with ARFI imaging capabilities. Siemens refers to ARFI as \"Virtual Touch Tissue Imaging.\" 140 Siemens incorporated ARFI technology into th e ACUSON S2000, a standard ultrasound system. This ultrasound system can be used for genera l imaging such as echocardiography and obstetrics and can also be used for ARFI.141 Siemens launched the ACUSON S2000 device with ARFI capability in November, 2007. 142 It was originally designed to detect liver stiffness.143 In August of 2010 the ACUSON S2000 2.0 was launched as an updated iteration of the orig inal machine. A few notable innovations were added to this second generation, such as the abi lity to display results in high definition (HD), HD zoom options and new color map capabilities. At the same time, a new transducer probe (9L4) was added to the ACUSON S2000 US line of probes th at can image smaller ar eas such as breast and thyroid tissue.144 - 76 - Since Siemens first launched the S2000 with ARFI capabilities in 2007, two other organizations have developed ultrasound devices able to perf orm ARFI. Supersonic Imag ine got into the field of ARFI with their device, the Ai xplorer Multiwave Ultrasound System.145 Similarly, in 2009, Phillips unveiled their iU22 Premium Ultrasound S canner, which has the capability to perform ARFI imaging. This device became commercially available in the United States in early 2010, which was followed by release in Canada in late 2010.146 Although this report focuses on the use of ARFI for the diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease, it has a variety of uses and a corresponding array of probes which allow for the measurement of elasticity at different depths. With the appropriate probe, it can be used to measure tissue stiffness throughout the body. 5.3.2 Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Compared to Liver Biopsy As ARFI is a non-invasive procedure, it has a nu mber of potential benefits compared to LB. A key benefit is that the risk's and pain asso ciated with LB are not a concern with ARFI. Additionally, because of its non-i nvasive nature, the ARFI proce dure takes less time to complete and requires no pre- or post-ope rative preparation or follow-up. With LB, the specimen must be sent to a lab for analysis, whereas ARFI results are available immediately and can be read by the radiologist within the time-frame of the appointment. However, ARFI does have drawbacks when compared to LB. For example, ARFI, as also seen in TE, can be influenced by inflammatory activity in the liver leading to an overestimation of - 77 - fibrosis.110 Therefore, caution is recommended when interpreting results from all forms of elastography.110 5.3.3 Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse in Alberta ARFI was licensed for use in Canada in 2008.49 It is listed as a Clas s III device indicating a potential risk to patients requiring an in-depth re view before licensing a nd sale were granted. This means that the manufacturer must provide re search demonstrating that their device operates within the tolerance limits appropriate for the medical condition it was designed to test.51 Furthermore, evidence suggests that there are mini mal health risks associated with the use of ARFI.147 Although it is licensed, ARFI imag ing has not been used extens ively in Alberta. An ARFI machine was on loan to the Foothi lls Hospital in Calgary for a y ear, however it has since been returned and is no longer available. There ar e no other known machines in Alberta. The radiologist who had access to the ARFI machine in Alberta was consulte d for expert advice in order to contextualize the potential use of ARFI within Alberta. This radiologist obtained the S2000 machine as a de mo from Siemens. With in her practice, ARFI imaging was mainly used to measure liver stiffness, for inflammatory bowel disease and to scan liver masses. She noted that within her facilit y, she and her staff became highly dependent on the ARFI technology for a variety of uses and stated that not having access to the machine for the past 8 months has negatively impacted her prac tice. She noted that the device brings useful information to the clinical picture of a patient; it brings another level of evidence and confidence - 78 - to the decision-making process. This radiologist stated that when she had ARFI available to her, a high majority of the liver patients she sa w in her clinic would have ARFI completed. Additionally, she mentioned th at the technology was easy to learn and simple to use. In consultation, this radiologist mentioned th at although ARFI does reduce the number of LBs that are done, that is not the only, nor the major benefit to usi ng the technology. She stated that one of the key benefits of ARFI is that it allo ws for better patient management and patient care. She mentioned that there was interest in the ARFI technology within ot her hospitals, but that currently, no other clinics like her's have been developed within Alberta. 5.4 Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 5.4.1 Methods In order to quantitatively assess the efficacy of ARFI imaging comp ared to the current standard of care (LB) a systematic review and meta-a nalysis was conducted. Nine electronic databases were searched, using terms such as non-invasive , fibrosis, ARFI and ac oustic radiation force impulse (Appendix 1). This search was limited to English and French language articles published between 2000 and 2011. Articles were included if the sample populati on had some form of liver disease, ARFI technology was used, LB was the co mparator, the report was prospe ctive, the study was designed as a randomized controlled tria l or cohort study, results were reported using the METAVIR scoring system and 10 or more patients were en rolled (Box 4). Studies were excluded if they were non-human, duplicate publications, prelimin ary results, did not re port enough data to - 79 - formulate a contingency table or if the MET AVIR system was not em ployed. Literature on economic the implications of ARFI we re included in full-text review. Box 4 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria Study must evaluate the accuracy of Acoustic Radi ation Force Impulse (ARFI), compared to LB, or must report on the economic impact of ARFI The target population must be patients with adult liver disease Study must report test sensitivity and specificity OR negative and positive predictive values, OR sufficient data to calculate these meas ures of diagnostic test performance Study must be published in English OR French Study must be prospective in design Study must be either a randomized controlled trial OR a prospective diagnostic cohort study The study must have enrolled 10 or more patients The study must report results using METAVIR staging system Exclusion criteria Study published in a language other than English or French Study does not report any test performance measures or sufficient data to calculate these measures Study reported using a staging system other than METAVIR Animal and in vitro studies Duplicate publications Preliminary reports Data was pooled using a random-effects model a nd results were reported in area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) graphs; a statistical tool which use sensitivity and - 80 - specificity to determine overall efficacy. Sensiti vity, specificity and overall summary receiver operator characteristic curves were also reported. 5.4.2 Results The search of electronic databases returned 1753 ab stracts of potentially re levant articles. After abstract review, 14 papers were identified for full-text review. Of these 14 papers, six were excluded. Three were excluded because they did not focus on liver disease, one was excluded because it reported only preliminary findings, one did not have enough data to construct a contingency table, one did not report results using the METAVIR staging system, and one did not use LB as the reference test (Figure 10). Based on the inclusio n criteria outlined in Box 4, 7 papers were included for meta-analysis. No litera ture on the economic implications of ARFI was found; therefore, an economic analysis was not possible. Figure 10 Flow-chart of Included and Excluded Studies Studies Identified by da tabase/hand search n=1753 After title/abstract reviewing n= 1740 Excluded Included in Systematic Review (Adult Liver) n=7 Full text Review n=14 Excluded Excluded after full-text review (n=7) Reasons for exclusion: Not liver disease (n=3) Pilot study (n=1) Not enough data to construct a contingency table (n=1) Not METAVIR (n=1) LB not used as reference test (n=1) - 81 - The seven papers which were used in the meta -analysis included 616 participants total. The sample sizes of each study ranged from 54-136 patie nts (Table 15). All of the studies included compared ARFI with LB for the di agnosis of liver diseas e. However, different etiologies of liver disease were addressed in each study. The studies that were included looked at patients with CHC, CHB, NAFLD, auto-immune hepatitis (AIH ), NASH and CLD. Not all of the studies reported data for F 2, F3 and F=4. Since data was pooled based on stage, the number of studies analyzed in each F stage was variable. Four studies reported results for F 2, six gave data for F3 and all seven studies reported data on F=4. Table 15 ARFI AUROC Results by Author Author Year Disease(s) n Age Male % Fibrosis Stage 0.9 F3 1.54 Braticevici 2009148 F=4 0.976 - 82 - The results of the meta-analysis suggest that ARFI is an effective technology when compared to LB for the diagnosis of liver disease (Table 16) . For the diagnosis of stage 2 liver disease (F 2), the AUROC indicated strong accuracy with 0.88 and a 99% confidence interval of 0.85-0.91. For F2, the sensitivity was 0.90, which means that 90% of the patients with F 2 liver disease were correctly identified as having stage 2 liver disease. The specificity for F 3 was found to be 0.82, which means that of those who did not have F 2 disease, 82% were correctly identified as not having that stage of liver di sease. Although stage 2 liver disease had 'strong' diagnostic accuracy, it had the lowest accuracy of the three stages analyzed. Table 16 Sensitivity, Specificity and AUROC of ARFI by METAVIR Fibrosis showed 'excellent' diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing stage 3 liver disease (F 3). The AUROC for this stage was 0.97, which is a very high diagnostic accuracy. Both the sensitivity and the specificity for the dia gnosis of liver disease were higher for patients with F 3 stage liver disease than for those with F 2 stage disease. The sensitivity for F 3 was 0.94, and the specificity was 0.90. - 83 - The accuracy for diagnosing stage 4 liver diseas e (F=4) was not as high as for stage 3 liver disease, however, it is still be considered 'excellent.' The AUROC was 0.94, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 and 0.91 respectively. When these results are compared with the results for TE (AUROC for F 2 was 0.88, F 3 was 0.92 and F=4 was 0.94), ARFI and TE are similar in their ability to accu rately diagnose liver disease. However, ARFI has not undergone the sa me level of scrutiny as TE due to the limited number of high quality studies in publication. In this regard it is an unfair comparison. The summary ROC curves reiterate the evidence that ARFI is effective in diagnosing liver disease (Figure 11). In Figure 11, each study is shown as a dot. Th e upper left side of the graph represents perfect specificity and sensitivity (and therefore perfect diagnostic accuracy). Dots which stray to the right or to th e bottom of the graph show poor er accuracy. The three stages of liver disease are each represented graphically be low. These graphs echo the AUROC results; the diagnosis of F 2 liver disease with ARFI is least accu rate, followed by F=4 disease. ARFI is most accurate at diagnosing F 3 liver disease. - 84 - Figure 11 Summary Receiver Opera ting Characteristic Curves (ARFI) F2 F 3 F = 4 - 85 - 5.4.3 Economics (E) There is limited economic data available on the use of ARFI. No data exists in the literature, and due to the sparse use of ARFI in Alberta, only one expert c ould be consulted on the economic impact of ARFI. Therefore, a ll of the economic information came from one source, which is a significant limitation to this report. It is estimated that to purchase a new ACUS ON S2000 machine (which has ARFI capabilities), the up-front cost would be at l east $200,000. In addition to this cost , probes are specific in that they are calibrated to measure stiffness to a certain depth; different probes are needed for different uses. It was estimated that new probes cost between $18,000 and $40,000 each. Manufacturers state that the life-sp an of a new machine is 3-4 ye ars of optimal use. However, expert consultation noted that this was a very co nservative estimate; the machine would be able to function properly for up to 10 years if properly maintenance. However, within Alberta there are a number of existing ultra-sound machines which, for a cost, could be updated to run software capable of performing ARFI imaging. The estimated cost of updating the software on an existing machine was $35,000. 5.5 Discussion Since ARFI is a new and not widely accessible technology, quality RCT publications on the technology are limited and so is expert opini on. These shortcomings present a significant limitation to this report. Within the meta-analysis, only seven relevant studies were identified; however, all of the studies had fairly large sample sizes, so this may not have had a significant - 86 - influence on the results. No literature on the economic impact was found, and only one expert within Alberta could provide consultation on basi c economic implications of ARFI. Similarly, since ARFI has not been widely used in Alberta, there is limited information to gauge demand. Based on the available information, ARFI does show promise as a diagnostic tool in adult liver disease. When ARFI technology was available in Albe rta, clinicians at a si ngle location viewed it as a helpful diagnostic tool in liver diseases. The technology is expensive, but versatile. In comparison to TE, ARFI has similar efficacy and related risks, 110 but there is insufficient research to provide an evidence based comparis on between the technologi es. In order to draw conclusions about the potential utilization of ARFI within Al berta, economic information is required. Information on the potential impact ARFI utilization would have on LB rates is also needed to draw conclusions on the pote ntial use of ARFI within Alberta. - 87 - 6 OTHER APPLICATIONS OF TRANSIENT ELASTOGRAPHY 6.1 Introduction TE can be used to assess internal structures ot her than the liver. Tissue stiffness indicates the presence of disease in several clinical conditio ns and the ability to diagnose the presence of a disease in its early stages can lead to a successf ul treatment. A review of published literature was conducted to identify the other cl inical conditions using TE procedures. A general overview of TE technology as well as an overvi ew of the effectiven ess of TE technology by clinical condition is provided. 6.2 Overview of Transient Elastography Technology The procedure for most of the ot her applications of TE is the same as a traditional ultrasound procedure except where an invasive probe is us ed. The procedure for using an invasive probe will be discussed in the appropriate sections. For most external ultrasound procedures the patient lies on an adjustable examination table. A water-base d gel is applied to the region of interest so the transducer will remain in contact with the bod y and eliminate air pockets that can obstruct the sound waves. The transducer is pressed firmly ag ainst the skin and manipulated to provide the best image of the targeted region. The images ar e either sent to a clin ician for analysis or analyzed immediately if the proc edure was performed by a clinician. 39 The procedure takes 10- 20 minutes to complete. - 88 - 6.3 Methods Literature was searched for original studies repor ting on the effectiveness, risks, side effects and safety of TE. The search included systematic reviews, meta-analyses' and HTA reports documenting the use of TE. Grey literature, including Health Canada and Federal Drug Administration (FDA) sites, was also search ed. As the technology only became available in 2001, we limited our search to the last ten ye ars (2001-2011) and only include d articles available in English or French. Additionally, any non-human studies were excluded. Studies were included if they reported orig inal data, evaluated the e fficacy of TE and were eith er randomized controlled trial or prospective cohort design. The database s searched were MEDLINE, PubMED, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CE NTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, HTA Health Technology Assessment Database , NHSEED, DARE Databa se of Reviews of Effects, and EconLit. The search strategy was developed by an information specialist. For each paper on an alternative use, sample information, st andard of care, methods and basic results were extracted. 6.4 Overall Results of Systematic Review Eighty-two studies on other applicat ions of TE were identified fo r full-text review (Figure 12). Based on full-text review, 12 papers were excluded; 3 had insufficient data, 1 was not TE, 2 were ARFI and 6 were not original publications. Seve nty papers were includ ed in the review. Six clinical groups were identified: thyroid, pancreas, prosta te, lymph nodes, breast and other. Thirteen papers were found on thyroid applica tions, 7 on prostate, 6 on pancreas, 3 on lymph nodes and 37 on breast applications . Studies were included in the \"other\" category when they were the sole source of information on a specifi c application. The \"other\" category contains 4 - 89 - papers, one on each of the following: plantar fa sciitis, rectal tumor detection, postmenopausal bleeding and appendicitis detectio n. None of the papers reported adverse effects or safety concerns associated with TE. The papers included in this review of other applications of TE have been summarized in the Tables section. Figure 12 Flow Chart for Inclusion/Exclusion of Emerging Uses 6.5 Thyroid 6.5.1 Clinical Condition The thyroid regulates hormones for growth and metabolism. If the thyroid becomes compromised, it can lead to cardiac disease, lupu s, reproductive complicati ons, diabetes, arthritis and several other conditions. 151 Early detection of thyroid abnormalities can decrease the - 90 - incidence and/or severity of the associated disease(s). Globally, approximately 200 million people are living with thyroid disease.151 In Canada, 30% of the population has a thyroid disease and approximately 50% do not kno w they have the condition.151 In Alberta, there were 500 new cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed in 2011.152 Thyroid nodules are typically sm all, painless and are usually discovered by a healthcare professional during a routine examination. 151 Although larger sized nodul es will feel firm and smooth under the skin, smaller no dules will most frequently be discovered using ultrasound technology. Once detected, a biopsy is performed to determine whether it is cancerous or benign. Approximately 5% of the overall Canadian population has a si ngle thyroid nodule.151 A single nodule can have several causes: a cyst contai ning fluid, a benign tumo r/adenoma; a slow growing adenoma, or, in 5-10% of the population with a nodule, a malignant tumor.151 Treatment for non-malignant nodules consists of monitori ng the size of th e nodule over time. If the nodule increases in size, it will be reassessed by a biopsy. 153 The patient's thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels may also be assessed.153 TSH levels are assessed us ing a blood test. If the TSH levels are abnormal, too low or too high, this may indicate the presence of a thyroid disease.153 If the biopsy indicates malignancy, and th e TSH levels are abnormal, the nodule is surgically removed and a treatment regime is prescribed.151 In nodules where malignant cells are present in large numbers, the thyroid gland may be removed.153 - 91 - 6.5.2 Standard of Care The traditional method of nodule as sessment is thyroid biopsy or fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). FNAB is a diagnostic tool that di fferentiates malignant from benign nodules, but approximately 20% of FNABs are unabl e to properly diagnose the nodule.154;155 Test results are complicated by the lack of a standardized reporting scheme th at takes into consideration nodules somewhere between benign and malignant.156 Cytological reporting schemes can range from 3 to 8 cagtegories.156 Furthermore, the skill of a clinician ad ministering the FNAB will impact the quality of sample extracted and th e overall the cytologic evaluation.154 If a FNAB is preformed correctly, the likelihood of a false negative is less than 5%. In other words, fewer than 5 out of 100 FNACs properly preformed will miss a positive finding.157 A FNAB is performed by having th e clinician locate the nodule and then having the patient lay supine with their neck exposed. 157 The site is disinfected and a local anesthetic may be injected. Clinicians who regularly perf orm FNABs do not use a local an esthetic to avoid unnecessary injections and patient discomfort157 Once the site has been prepared, a 25 gauge 38 mm needle is inserted into the nodule. The patient is asked to hold their br eath while the clin ician manipulates the needle to obtain the maximum amount of tissu e. The procedure is repeated 4 to 6 times.157 Once the procedure is completed, pressure is applie d to the biopsy site for 5 to 10 minutes to stop the bleeding and reduce swelling. The pr ocedure lasts approximately 20 minutes.157 6.5.3 Transient Elastography Technology Table 17 lists the technologies used in each study for thyroid applications. The Siemens Acuson Premium Edition X300 is an enhanced version of traditional ultrasound with eSie TouchTM - 92 - imaging technology.158 eSie TouchTM elasticity imaging uses mild compression to create a high resolution elastogram showi ng relative tissue stiffness.158 The elastogram is created by calculations of global tissue deformation and di splays information according to the operators region of interest. Axial detection pulses are cons tantly being transmitted to the viewing area to provide operator feedback about tissue deformation along a single axial line at a point in time.158 This technology allows stiff and soft tissue to be differentiated when the tissues appear to be similar on a B-mode ultrasound exam.158 The Siemens VFX-13-5 MHz transducer is used with the Acuson X300 to assess thyroid tissue stiffn ess. The VFX 13-5 can be used for several applications including breast, cerebrovascul ar, digital, musculoskeletal, superficial musculoskeletal, penile, is a wide bandwidth linear transducer with virt ual format and adjustable MultiHertz imaging.159 - 93 - Table 17 Technology used in Thyroid Applications Study Country System Transducer Probe Asteria 2008160 Italy Friedrich- Rust HV 900 Hitachi (EUP-F531) Hong 2009164 Transducer Probe Ning 2011168 MHz (EUP-L73S) Xing 2011172 10 MHz (EUP-L53L) HI-RTE or real-time elastography (RTE) is an emerging technology for the assessment of tissue elasticity using a real-time colour display. 173 RTE uses second generation ultrasound technology to assess breast, prostate, thyroid and pancreatic tissue and other applications where biopsy is indicated. According to Hitachi, RTE provides increased accuracy for assessing lesions by using Extended Combined Autocorrelation Method (E CAM) technology to ge nerate a real-time elasticity image.173 Tissue is compressed by a freehand ultrasound transducer and the relative elasticity is cal culated using the ECAM elastography algo rithm. Relative tissue elasticity is displayed using a colour overlay of the B-mode ultrasound image.173 Stiffer tissue is seen as blue - 94 - and elastic tissue as red. In the literature, seve ral different linear array transducers were used with the Hitachi systems, however, all transducers were in the mid- to high- frequency range due to the shallow depth of the thyroid.173 Siemens' Sonoline Elegra DICOM system is a RTE machine with SieScape\u00ae Panoramic imaging that scans and displays a large region of interest using high-resolution. 174 The system contains a specialized computer processor that allows conventional re al-time transducers to produce a large field of view image.175 Colour SieScape\u00aeImaging aids in identifying blood flow in vascular structures us ing colour and the 3-ScapeTM Real-Time 3D Ultrasound Imaging creates real-time 3D images upon acquisition which allows clinicians to view the 3D image in real- time.175 The clinician can also instantaneously restructure the volume of the image or the slice planes. The 3-ScapeTM Real-Time 3D Ultrasound Imaging pr ovides an enhanced view of a lesion's vessel anatomy.174 The 7.5 MHz linear transducer probe is used for peripheral vascular, arterial and venous scans.176 6.5.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence Thirteen studies reported on th e use of elasticity imaging a nd RTE in papers focused on th e diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules identified as a sw elling or lump(s) in the thyroid gland.153 All but three studies used elasticity score (ES) as the scor ing system where 1 is soft tissue and 4 is stiff; the other three used systolic t hyroid stiffness index (STSI), di astolic strain variation index (DSVI) and strain value as their scoring systems. Most studies reported the elastography test taking no longer than 10 minutes . The sample sizes ranged from n=31 to n=309 and the mean - 95 - ages ranged from 39 to 64.8 years of age. The re ported sensitivities for elasticity imaging ranged from 65% to 100% and specificities ranged from 50% to 100% (Table 9 in the Tables section). 6.5.5 Conclusion TE and RTE, when applied to thyroid conditions, are promising accompaniments to existing diagnostic procedures . Overall, the technology is easy to use and a patient can be assessed more rapidly with TE/RTEthan with FNAB. The reported diagnostic accuracy ranged from poor to excellent for identifying malignant tissue between so ft tissue stages, and sufficient to excellent in patients with tumors that were in the mostly soft to stiff range. A meta-analysis is required to estimate the diagnostic accuracy. 6.6 Prostate 6.6.1 Clinical Condition Prostate Cancer is the most common cancer af fecting Canadian men over the age of 40. Over 25,500 Canadian men will be diagnosed with pros tate cancer in 2011 and 1 in 7 men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime. 177 In Alberta, there were 2,500 new cases of prostate cancer in 2011.152 Symptoms include: slow or painful urination, painful ejaculation, blood and/or pus in the urine, and pain in the abdomen, low back, pelvis or upper thighs.178 The causes of prostate cancer are unknown, but th ere are indications that diet, environment, and heredity may increase the risk of developing the disease.178 Prostate cancer is predominantly treated by surgery, radiation and hormone therapy.178 - 96 - The prostate is a walnut sized, spherically shaped, gland located below the bladder. It produces seminal fluid and controls urinary flow.179 The prostate also produces prostate specific antigen (PSA) which turns semen into liquid before ejaculation.180 High levels of PSA are frequently found in men with prostate cancer, but it is not an indicator of prostate cancer.180 A prostate that increases in size can cause PSA to be leaked into the blood.180 The increase in PSA is assessed by a blood test.180 If prostate cancer is suspected, the blood test can be followed up with a biopsy.180 6.6.2 Standard of Care Biopsy is the standard of care for diagnosing prostate cancer. Th ree types of biopsies can be performed: transrectal, transurethral, or transp erineal. Before a biopsy, th e patient may be put on short-term prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.181 The patient may also be asked to stop taking anti-inflammatory medicatio n and, if a transrectal biopsy is to be performed, the patient will undergo an enema to elim inate gas and fecal matter.181 The transperineal prostate biops y is preformed through a small in cision made in the perineum. The patient has the option to be put unde r general anesthesia for the procedure. 181 The procedure is performed with a spring-loaded needle that can quickly and painlessly collect between 6 and 13 samples.181 The number of samples collected is at the discretion of the clinician. The transperineal procedure can cause tenderness and blood in the seme n for up to 2 months after the procedure. - 97 - Transrectal prostate biopsy is guided by transrectal ultrasound through the anus and into the rectum.181 The same type of spring-loaded needle used for transperineal prostate biopsy is used to collect the tissue sample. Pa tients may experience rectal bl eeding and blood in the urine and semen after the procedure.181 The transurethral prostate biopsy uses a lighted cystoscope inserted into the urethra. The cystoscope allows the clinician to look directly at the prostate and collect a tissue sample using a cutting loop. The cutting loop is rotated and tissue is extracte d with each rotation. 181 6.6.3 Transient Elastography Technology The technology used in each study can be found in Table 18. Hitachi RTE technology used for prostate analysis is the same technology as was described in the thyroid section. However, the types of probes used for assessi ng the prostate are different than external probes. The end fire transrectal probes are rectally in serted into the body. The patient lies on their side with their buttocks close to the edge of the ex amination bed with their knees bent.182 A protective sheath is placed over the transducer probe and lubrication is applied before it is inserted into the rectum through the anus.183 The probe is manipulated to obtain images of the prostate from various angles. An inflatable balloon can be attached to the probe for PSI (pounds per square inch) compression of the prostate for analysis with RTE technology.184 - 98 - Table 18 Technology used in Prostate Applications Study Country System Transducer Probe Aigner 2010183 Austria, USA Hitachi LOGOS EUB al Probe 2011185 Probe 4-9 MHz Salomon 2008187 4-9 MHz (V53W) Zhang 2011189 China Transrectal Probe 4-9 MHz (V53W) 6.6.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence Seven studies were reviewed for prostate applications of RTE: one assessed RTE in targeting biopsies, two researched PSI compression using a small inflatable balloon attached to a transrectal probe and the remaining four studies looked at the diagnostic accuracy of RTE alone. 183; 185; 186; 187; 184; 188; 189 All study sample populations consisted of men exhibiting prostate cancer symptoms such as elevated PSA levels and/or an abnormal digital rectal exam. The studies ranged in size from n=33 to n=492 patients with mean ages from 57.4 to 68.6 years of age. The diagnostic accuracy of RTE alone had sensitiv ities between 74% and 91.7% and specificities between 72% and 93%. The two studies with RTE and balloon compression had sensitivities ranging from 60% to 84% and specificities from 80% to 96% (Table 10 in the Tables section). 6.6.5 Conclusion The use of RTE in prostate applications is a promising addition to existing diagnostic technologies. RTE alone had good to excelle nt diagnostic accuracy compared to biopsy - 99 - (sensitivities between 74% and 91.7% and specificities between 72% and 93%). The two studies with RTE and balloon compression ha d sufficient to excellent dia gnostic accuracy (sensitivities between 60% and 84% and specif icities from 80% and 96%). Transrectal probes are relatively easy to use with minimal training and a patient ca n be assessed more rapidly than with biopsy. A full systematic review and meta-analysis would provide more detailed information as to the diagnostic accuracy and relevance of RTE in prostate applications. 6.7 Pancreas 6.7.1 Clinical Condition Approximately 4000 Canadians are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer every year; it is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in Canada.190 In Alberta, there were 370 new cases of pancreatic cancer in 2011.152 Pancreatic cancer predominantly affect s people older than 50, but it can occur in younger people with a family history of the disease.190 Due to the location of the pancreas deep in the abdominal cavity, it can be difficult to detect. Early symptoms are subtle or absent, but once the tumor has increased in size it begins to affect other organs andmore identifiable symptoms develop: abdominal pain; loss of appe tite, nausea, and weight loss; and/or jaundice and itching190 The majority of pancreatic cancer tu mors are discovered after the cancer has spread to other regions making it difficult to treat and largely incurable. Approximately 6% of patients diagnosed with pancre atic cancer live more than five years after diagnosis.190 6.7.2 Standard of Care Diagnosing pancreatic cancer can be problematic because sy mptoms are often subtle, non- specific and slow to develop. If pancreatic cancer is suspected, the patient will undergo a - 100 - physical examination, blood tests, x-rays, ultrasound and biopsy.191 Ultrasound will identify pancreatic abnormalities in approxi mately 75% of patients. If an abnormality is detected, the patient may be sent for a computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic res onance imaging (MRI), or an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) exam for confirmation.191 If a pancreatic mass is confirmed, a biopsy is performed to determine if it is malignant or benign.191 Biopsy of the pancreas is performed using th e technically demanding pr ocedure of endoscopic introduces an endoscope that passes through the stom ach and stops in the first part of the small intestine. A catheter is then fe d through the endoscope until it re aches the bile and pancreatic ducts.191 Once the catheter is in place, a dye is injected to aid in x-ray imaging. The x-ray can show if the ducts have become narrowed or blocked by a growth.191 Once the masses are identified, a biopsy can be perf ormed through the catheter such as an FNAB or brush biopsy.191 A brush biopsy is when a small brush is pass ed through the endoscope and rubbed against the bile or pancreatic ducts to obtain cell samples.191 During the FNAB proce dure, several punctures may have to be made in the mass to obtain a sufficient amount of tissue for analysis.192 The FNAB may also be performed using CT or EU S so the clinician can ensure the needle is obtaining tissue from the tumor. 191 EUS can also aid in guiding the biopsy needle through the stomach and into the area of interest. A local anesthetic may be applied for this procedure.191 - 101 - As with most biopsy procedures, there are co mplications associated with FNAB, such as infection, bleeding, pancreatitis, and duodenal pe rforation. patients.193;194 6.7.3 Transient Elastography Technology Studies identified for the analysis of pancreatic tissue only used RTE systems, with the exception of one study that did not report on the system used (Table 19). The linear endoscopic probes were EUS Pentax The endoscopic probe is a long flexible tube with ultrasound tec hnology at the tip that is inserted into the body. Conventional ultrasound sends ultrasound waves thr ough the surface of the body to the region of interest. As mentioned earlier, it ma y be difficult to obtain high qua lity images of tissue deep in the body using RTE on the surface of the body, resulti ng in incomplete information as to tissue stiffness. The small ultrasound tr ansducer located at the tip of an endoscope can produce high quality, accurate and detailed ultrasound images because the ultrasound waves do not have to travel through the body to the region of interest.195 RTE assessment of the pancreas uses a conventional EUS probe and does not require additional equipment to perform an analysis.196 - 102 - Table 19 Technology used in Pancreas Applications Study Country System Transducer Probe Giovanni 2009197 Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, EUB Romania Not Reported Reported 6.7.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence The 6 pancreatic studies identified for review as sessed RTE in pancreatic lesions (Table 11 in the Tables section). 197; 192; 198; 199; 200; 201 All of the studies used either surgical specimens as the reference standard or FNAB. Many did not use a scoring system for cut- offs; two used a hue histogram system and one used strain ratio. The studies ranged in size (n = 24 to n = 258) and considered a range of ages (mean ages reported from 48 to 64). The diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of RTE to identif y malignant pancreatic masses ra nged between 41% to 100% and 53% to 95.2%, respectively. 6.7.5 Conclusion The use of RTE in pancreatic applications may aid in characterizing pancreatic masses to be assessed by endoscopic biopsy resulting in great er precision, a reduction in the number of FNABs performed and a decrease in th e potential for FNAB complications.202 The endoscopic probes used for RTE were conventional EUS pr obes requiring no additional training. A patient can be more rapidly assessed using RTE than a biopsy procedure because it is a standalone - 103 - procedure that does not require ex tra instruments. RTE had poor to excellent diagnostic accuracy compared to biopsy. However, a full systematic review and meta-analysis is required to estimate the diagnostic accuracy and understand the effectiv eness of RTE in pancreatic applications. 6.8 Lymph Nodes 6.8.1 Clinical Condition Lymphoma is a blood cancer that affects the white blood cells, or lymphocytes, responsible for protecting the body against infection and disease.203 Abnormal lymphocytes may reproduce faster than normal cells or have an increased lifespan beyond what is considered healthy for the body.203 Lymphoma can develop in: the lymph node s, spleen, bone marrow, blood or other internal organs.203 The most common symptoms of lympho ma are swelling of the lymph nodes, fever, weight loss, night sweats, chills, low energy, and itching.203 There are two types of ly mphomas: Hodgkin lymphoma which cons ists of six different types that involve the appearance of R eed-Sternberg cells (abnormally large cells); and non-Hodgkin lymphomas which have more than 61 type s and do not have Reed-Sternberg cells. 203 In 2011, 8,620 Canadians were diagnosed with lymphoma or cancer of the lymphatic system. Three- thousand died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in this same year.152 In Alberta, there were 720 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2011.152 The cause of lymphoma is currently unknown. There are indications that ge netics or exposure to environmental pollutants may trigger the dis ease. In addition, there is evidence that Helicobacter pylori infections can cause some digestive tr act non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as mucosa- - 104 - associated lymphatic tissue lymphomas. There is also evidence that indicates a link between the Epstein-Barr virus and some types of Burkitt's lymphoma.204 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually responds well to treatment providing pati ents with long cancer- free periods. treatmen ts are: watchful waiti ng (a decision to delay treatment in favour of carefully monitoring the disease progression to determine the appropriate intervention), 205 chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapies, bone marrow or stem-cell transplants, and experimental therapies.206 Diagnosing lymphoma usually begins with a phys ical exam where the clinician searches for swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, and groin. The clinician may also examine the liver and spleen for swelling.207 A blood test is conducted to dete rmine the complete blood count and swollen lymph nodes are x-rayed. If lympho ma is suspected, a biopsy is conducted.207 6.8.2 Standard of Care Obtaining a tissue sample thr ough biopsy is the current stan dard of care for diagnosing lymphoma. A sample can be obtained using F NAB, core needle or surgical biopsies.208 Core needle biopsies are performed with a specially tipped needle that extracts tissue the size of a grain of rice.208 During the open or surgical procedur e, the surgeon will extract one or more lymph nodes procuring more tissue than FNAB or core biopsies for analysis.208 FNAB can be conducted in a clinic or hospital by a hematologist, radiologist or surgeon. If the lymph node is deep in the body, a radiologist will usually perform the procedure aided by a - 105 - computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound.208 The doctor will numb the needle insertion area and insert the biopsy needle into the lymph node with the patient lying as still as possible during the procedure.208 The procedure takes between 5 and 15 minutes. Core needle biopsy can be performed by a surge on or radiologist. The clinician will numb the area before making a small incisi on, insert the core ne edle into the lymph node and then removed with the sample. 208 The patient is required to remain as still as possible during the procedure. The procedure takes approximately 20 minutes.208 Open or surgical biopsy is conducted in a clinic or hospital by a surgeo n. If the lymph node is located close to the surface of the skin, a local anesthetic is used to numb the area. If the lymph node is located deeper in the body, the patient may be given a general anesthesia. Once the patient is prepared, a small incision is made to extract either a portion of or the whole lymph node for analysis. The patient will be kept overn ight for observation. The procedure can take from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the location of the lymph node. The risks associated with biopsy are infecti on, bleeding, fluid buildup , and numbness at the biopsy site. 208 Fluid buildup is most common after a ly mph node has been surgically removed from the area between the collarbone and under the arm.208 6.8.3 Transient Elastography Technology One TE system and two RTE systems were used to assess lymphoma patients: Siemens Sonoline Elegra with a 7.5 MHz 8500 with a Pentax EG 3830 endoscopic - 106 - probe, Hitachi HV-900 with a 6.5-13 MHz linear transducer probe (Table 20). All systems and probe types ha ve previously been discusse d. The endoscopic assessment of lymph nodes is an internal app lication of TE whereas the other two methods assess lymph nodes from the surface of the skin. The endoscopy was used to assess lymph nodes in the cervical, mediastinal and abdominal regions.209 The patient is sedated and the endoscope is introduced orally or anally into the region of interest to assess the lymph nodes.209 Table 20 Technology used in Lymph Node Applications Study Country System Transducer Probe Lyshchik 2007210 Japan, USA Siemens 7.5 obe 6-13 MHz (EUP-L54M) 6.8.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence Three papers were reviewed on the use of TE in lymph nodes.210; 211; 212 The studies ranged in size (n = 31 to n = 107) and considered a range of ages (mean ages reported from 41 to 64.6 years of age). Two of the studies used surgical specimens as the reference standard, and the third used FNAB. Additionally, 2 studies used a strain index of 1.5 as the cut-off; the other study did not report cut-off values. The sensitivity of the 3 studies had a small range, from 91.7-98%, whereas the specificity results were broader, 53.4-94.4% (Table 12 in the Tables section). 6.8.5 Conclusion TE had excellent sensitivities and poor to excelle nt specificities in de tecting malignant lymph nodes when compared with biopsy and traditional ultrasound. The various probes are easy to use, - 107 - require minimal training, and allow for a patient to be more rapidly assess ed than FNAB, core or surgical biopsies. TE and RTE in lymph node app lications have the potential to be useful additions to other diagnostic technologies and can potentially decrease the number of biopsy procedures. A reduction in the number of biopsies also reduces the poten tial for biopsy related complications. At this time, there is insufficien t evidence for a full systematic review and meta- analysis. 6.9 Breast 6.9.1 Clinical Condition Over 23,000 Canadians were diagnosed with brea st cancer in 2011. In Alberta, there were 2,100 new cases. 152 Breast cancer is diagnosed when the first sign of a malignant tumor is discovered in the breast.213 Different types of cancer (non-invasive or in situ breast cance r, invasive breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer, or Paget's dis ease of the nipple) can occur in the different tissues of the breast, which ex tends up to the collar bone and from the sternum to the armpit.213 If cancer cells break off from a breast tumor, and en ter the blood stream or lymphatic system, it is called metastasis or secondary cancer, but it is still considered breast cancer.213 The exact cause of breast cancer is yet to be de termined, but several risk factors have been identified. 214 The non-modifiable risk factors are gender (less than 1% of a ll breast cancer cases are men), age, personal history, family history, proliferative or benign br east conditions, breast density, and early menstruation and late menopause.214 Modifiable risk factors are exposure to radiation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormone replacement therapy, body weight, physical activity, alcohol consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.214 - 108 - Early discovery of breast cancer increases an in dividual's chances of successful treatment. The two main methods of breast sc reening are a clinical breast exam and a mammogram, but a genetic test may also be performed.215 A clinical breast exam is a physical examination performed by a healthcare professional.215 A mammogram is a low-dose x-ray of the breast used to document changes in breast tissue undetectable by a physical examination.215 In patients with a family history of breast cancer, a genetic test can determine the presence of genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes).215 There are several treatment options for a patient with breast cancer. The type of treatment is determined by the type and stage of the diseas e and can include a combination of treatments. Local treatments such as surgery and radiation th erapy are administered to a specific region of the body. 216 Systemic treatments are administered to the whole body and include chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and HER-2 therapy. Systemic treatments are used when the cancer has metastasized.216 6.9.2 Standard of Care Biopsy is the current standard of care for di agnosing breast cancer. A tissue sample can be obtained using FNAB, core needle, vacuum-assist ed, or surgical/open bi opsy procedures. FNAB, regular core needle, and surg ical biopsies are the same pr ocedures used for lymph node assessments.217 - 109 - Stereotactic biopsy is a type of core biopsy performed by a radi ologist. The patient lays face prone on a special table with openings for the breasts.217 The region of interest is targeted using a MRI or mammogram. The needle insertion site is numbed with a local anesthetic and a small incision is made.217 An x-ray is used to guide the needle to the region of interest where several samples will be extracted. The clinician will then mark the biopsy location with a small metal clip for future reference. The patient is expected to remain motionless while the biopsy is extracted. The procedure will take approximately 60 minutes to complete. 217 Vacuum-assisted biopsy is performed by a radiologi st or surgeon in a hospital or clinic and can be used with core needle or stereotactic biopsies. 217 The patient can sit or lean on an examination table during the procedure. Some patients may la y face down on a special table with openings for their breasts. Similar to the stereotactic bi opsy procedure, a mammogram, ultrasound or MRI will be used to target the biopsy location.217 The biopsy location will be numbed with a local anesthetic and an incision will be made. A specially tipped hollow probe is then inserted into the breast. Once the probe is in place, tissue is gently vacuumed into the probe.217 Vacuum-assisted biopsy allows the clinician to co llect several samples without re moving the probe. The procedure takes less than 1 hour to complete.217 6.9.3 Transient Elastography Technology The TE and RTE technologies used in breast applica tions that were not previously discussed are Toshiba Aplio XG, Voluson 530, Aixplorer\u00ae, Sonix SP, GE Antares. The Toshiba Aplio XG, and Aixplorer \u00ae, are RTE systems (Table 21). The Voluson 530, Sonix SP, GE LOGIQ 700 and the Siemens Antares all use similar TE technology. The - 110 - probes used in breast applicati ons are usually high frequency to obtain high quality images of masses close to the surface of the skin. TE an d RTE exams follow the same procedures as regular ultrasound exams and take appr oximately 10-20 minutes to complete. - 111 - Table 21 Technology used in Breast Applications Study Country System Transducer Probe Athanasiou (linear) Kadour 2010231 United Kingdom Not Reported 12 MHz (linear) Kumm 2010232 United States Hitachi Korea EUB-8500 6.5-13 MHz Germany Hitachi HV-900 9 (linear) China (EUP-l54M) - 112 - 6.9.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence The application of TE in breast tissue yielded a large number of studies. Thirty-seven papers were found on the assessment of breast lesions to determine malignant and ; 252 Each of the included studies had a sample size equal to or over 30 participants; however, many had large population sizes and included several hundred participants. The studies included used a variety of differe nt scoring systems, such as St rain Ratios (SR's), Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (Bi-RADS) and Itoh, wh ich have been separately reported in the Tables section (Table 13 in the Tables section) . Biopsy was the reference standard in all of the reports. The sensitivities range d from 35.4% to 100.0% and specificities from 33.3% to 98.9% with sample sizes ranging from n=30 to n= 437 and mean ages between 39 and 58.4 years. 6.9.5 Conclusion TE and RTE in breast applications are promising accompaniments to existing diagnostic procedures and provide diagnostic confidence . The reported sensitivities and specificities ranged from poor to excellent diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between malignant and benign tumors. Overall, the technology is easy to use an d a patient can be assessed in a timelier manner than with a biopsy. A systematic review of literature and a pooled estimate of diagnostic accuracy resulting from a meta-analysis are requir ed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of TE and RTE in breast applications. - 113 - 6.10 Other Transient Elastography Applications 6.10.1 Plantar Plantar fasciitis is a pa inful foot condition caused by tight calf muscles that can lead to prolonged or high velocity foot pronation. This may result in the inflammation and thickening of the plantar fascia on the bottom of the foot causing it to lose strength and flexibility.255 Plantar fasciitis has three stages: UI, minimal scar tissue with a normal thickness fascia; UII, increased scarring with a normal appearance to the fascia; and UIII, a swollen fascia with blurry margins and extensive scarring. 256 Treatment for plantar fasciiti s is rest, stretching exercise s, orthotics, a night splint that gently stretches the fascia or surgery in extreme cases.255 6.10.1.2 Standard of Care The standard of care for diagnosing plantar fasci itis is clinical history, examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).256 MRI is a diagnostic t ool that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of internal organs and structur es. The patient or body pa rt is place inside the MRI machine and a digital image is created of th e region of interest. MRI machines are large and expensive.257 6.10.1.3 Transient Elastography Technology A Siemens' Acuson 2000 with a 9 MHz transducer was used to assess bilateral heel pain with the patient lying prone.256 The plantar fascia was analyzed in the longitudinal plane to determine scarring, boundaries and thickne ss of the plantar fascia.256 - 114 - 6.10.1.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence A single study from India was reviewed for the use of TE in plantar fasciitis.256 Twenty-five patients with a mean age of 42 years were assessed. The sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 100% respectively for detecting stages UI and UII of plantar fascii tis (Table 14 in the Tables section). All three modalities easily detected stage UIII. 256 6.10.1.5 Conclusion Limited conclusions can be drawn due to a lack of evidence. However, in the 1 study identified, TE had excellent diagnostic accuracy in detecti ng the early stages of plantar fasciitis when compared to traditional ultrasound a nd MRI. Staging of plantar fascii tis allows clinic ians to track the progression of the condition and inform treatment options. There is insufficient evidence to support a full systematic review a nd meta-analysis at this time. 6.10.2 Rectal Cancer 6.10.2.1 Clinical Condition Twenty-two thousand Canadians were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2011. 152 In Alberta there were 1,820 new cases in 2011.152 Rectal cancer is often referre d to as colorectal cancer because both colon and rectal cancers originate fr om similar cells. The rectum is located below the colon and above the anus. It is 6 inches long and acts as th e holding chamber for stool before expulsion through the anus.258 The exact cause of colorectal cancer is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified. Non- modifiable risk factors are ag e, history of polyps and/or colorectal cancer, history of inflammatory bowel disease, family history of colorectal cancer, genetic syndromes, ethnicity a nd a history of other cancers.259 Modifiable risk factors are diet, - 115 - physical inactivity, type II diabetes, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, growth hormone disorders, night shift wor k, and previous radiation therapy.259 Screening tests that can detect colorectal cancer include guaiac fecal occult blood test, fecal immunochemical test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, CT co lonography, and fecal DNA testing. Treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy, bi ologics, radiation, and immunotherapy.260 6.10.2.2 Standard of Care Digital exam and a tissue sample obtained duri ng a rectosigmoidoscopy are the current standards of care for diagnosing rectal tumors. If a tumo r is identified during a rectosigmoidoscopy, the clinician will extract a tissue sample as part of the procedure.261 The sample is then sent for analysis.261 During a rigid rectosigmoidoscopy, a sigmoi doscope is used to view the rectum.262 The probe is between 25.4 cm a nd 30.48 cm long and 2.5 cm wide.262 The probe is lubricated and inserted into the anus to the region of interest.262 If a mass is detected, a biopsy can be performed using the probe.262 The procedure can take from 30 to 60 minutes and the patient may need to be observed for 1 to 2 hours post procedure.263 Side effects are rare and consist of, severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody bowel movements, dizziness and weakness.263 6.10.2.3 Transient Elastography Technology A single study from Norway was identified for full review.264 A Hitachi EUB-8500 RTE system with a 360\u00b0 EUP-R54AW) with a 5-10 MHz micro convex array probe was used to assess rectal tumors. The probe is similar in design to the rigid sigmoidoscope and the RTE exam is the same as rectosigmoidoscopy, but uses RTE technology. - 116 - 6.10.2.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence Sixty-nine patients were included in the study w ith a mean age of 68 years. The sensitivity and specificity of RTE in differentiating malig nant and benign tumors was 95% and 96% respectively (Table 14 in the Tables section). 6.10.2.5 Conclusion Limited conclusions can be drawn due to a lack of evidence. However, in the 1 study identified, TE had excellent diagnostic accuracy when compared to digital exam, biopsy, and EUS. There is insufficient evidence to support a full systema tic review and meta-analysis at this time. 6.10.3 Postmenopausal Bleeding 6.10.3.1 Clinical Condition Postmenopausal bleeding is vaginal bleeding af ter menopause. Menopause is defined as no menstruation for 12 months in a wo men between the ages of 40 and 58. 265 In most cases the postmenopausal bleeding is not serious, bu t it may indicate a more serious condition.265 Postmenopausal bleeding can be caused by hormone replacement therapy, of the vagina, atrophic endometriosis, endom etrial hyperplasia, non-cancerous polyps, infection, or cancer.265 The condition can be assessed using several di fferent methods such as a speculum exam, a diagnostic test for cervical cancer, transvag inal ultrasound, saline in fusion sonohysterography, endometrial biopsy or hysterosc opy. Treatment is dependent upon th e results of clinical tests.265 - 117 - 6.10.3.2 Standard of Care Transvaginal ultrasound is the standard of care for diagno sing postmenopausal bleeding. A transducer designed to fit into a woman's vagina is used to assess the entire pelvic region.266 The transducer tip is inserted and the patient is re quired to remain motionless during the procedure. The presence of a thickened endometrium is us ually associated with postmenopausal bleeding.267 If a tumor is identified, a sample will be taken during the procedure.266 6.10.3.3 Transient Elastography Technology An Ultrasonix Sonix RP RTE system was used to assess postmenopausal bleeding. The type of transducer probe used was not identified. The RTE procedure is the same as transvaginal ultrasound procedure except RTE technology is used. 6.10.3.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence A single pilot study from the United Ki ngdom was identified for full review. 267 Twenty-nine patients were included in the st udy, but the mean age of partic ipants was not reported. The sensitivity and specificity of RTE in asse ssing postmenopausal bleeding was 50-60% and 90- 94% respectively (Table 14 in the Tables section). 6.10.3.5 Conclusion Limited conclusions can be drawn due to a lack of evidence. However, in the 1 study identified, TE had poor sensitivity but excellent specificity indicating it has a promise as a \"rule-out\" diagnostic test when compared to transvaginal ultrasound. Ther e is insufficient evidence to support a full systematic review and meta-analysis at this time. - 118 - 6.10.4 Acute Appendicitis 6.10.4.1 Clinical Condition Appendectomy's are the most commonly pe rformed emergency surgery procedure.268 Appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendix (a small pouch at the beginning of the large intestine).268 It is usually not a life threatening condi tion, but if left untrea ted it can result in serious illness or death. In Canada , 36 people died of appendicitis in 2008.269 Appendicitis is usually diagnosed by the symptoms, a physical exam, or lab te sts. Other tests may be performed such as an abdominal CT scan or ultrasound.268 If the diagnostic test s indicate appendicitis, an appendectomy is performed by a surgeon to rem ove the appendix. If a CT scan or ultrasound indicates the presence of an infection, the appendix will not be removed until the infection has been successfully treated. 268 6.10.4.2 Standard of Care Traditional ultrasound and CT scan are the standard of care fo r diagnosing appendicitis. The ultrasound is performed using an external prob e over the location of the appendix. A patient undergoing a CT scan will lie on a table under the doughnut shaped CT scanner. A dye may be injected into the patient to better identify the re gion of interest. The CT scanner rotates and sends x-rays through the region of in terest creating thinly sliced im ages. The images are collated by computer to produce an overall image of the regi on of interest. The proce dure can take from 15 to 30 minutes to complete.270 CT scanners are large and expensive machines.270 - 119 - 6.10.4.3 Transient Elastography Technology An Acuson S2000 sonography and ES system 4 MHz convex transducer and 7 MHz linear transducer probes was used to assess acute appendicitis in 40 patie nts (mean age 37 years). The procedure was the same as an external ultrasound procedure except RTE technology was used. 6.10.4.4 Summary of Clinical Evidence A single study from India was identified for full review. 271 The sensitivity and specificity of RTE in assessing acute appendicitis was 100% for each (Table 14 in the Tables section). 6.10.4.5 Conclusion Limited conclusions can be drawn due to a lack of evidence. However, in the 1 study identified, RTE had excellent diagnostic accuracy in identi fying acute appendicitis when compared with traditional ultrasound. There is insufficient eviden ce to support a full systematic review and meta-analysis at this time. 6.11 Summary of Other Applications of Transient Elastography The other applications of TE t echnologies represent a substantia l body of literature. Most of the observational studies were large, have poor to ex cellent sensitivities and specificities, appear to be of good quality and report e nough information to complete a pooled meta-analysis. The 4 publications in the \"Oth er Transient Elastography Applica tions\" section did not contain enough research to merit a full systematic review and meta-analysis. TE and RTE in all the publications was not considered a replacement for biopsy or othe r diagnostic procedures, but as an additional - 120 - assessment tool that provides an increase in precision; therefore, re ducing the number of procedures, such as biopsy, with potential complications. The use of TE and RTE in the assessment of br east tissue had the highest number of relevant studies (n=37) indi cating that TE use in the breast should be prioritized if fu ture systematic reviews focused on TE are undertaken. However, the prioritization of future systematic reviews and meta-analyses on TE technologies should be done in consultation with Alberta clinicians to determine which the clinical uses of TE are th e most likely to experi ence significant uptake.
