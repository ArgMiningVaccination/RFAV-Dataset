Gain more energy and better digestion.", "sitename": "The Naturopathic Co.", "date": "2019-02-15", "cleaned_text": "Some signs that you may need to consider a post-holiday cleanse are recurrent headaches, [low energy](https://thenaturopathic.co/fatigue-low-energy/), body aches, bad [digestive issues](https://thenaturopathic.co/digestive-concerns/), [skin blemishes](https://thenaturopathic.co/skin-concerns/), liver lines, and [brain fog](https://thenaturopathic.co/thyroid/). The colon affects every aspect of your health, and when you have [dysbiosis in the gut](https://thenaturopathic.co/autoimmunity/), many other problems follow. A colon that's overrun by toxins will also have difficulty absorbing nutrients. It's interesting to note that even a few days of making poor food choices (for example, over the Christmas period) can have significant influence on your intestinal microbiota, and will require a cleansing diet to get back on track. There are many different kinds of cleanses, some extreme, all providing different levels of toxin release. The effects of a juice cleanse or a water fast can be very unpleasant and even dangerous if done incorrectly, as the body releases too many toxins into the bloodstream all at once (causing headaches, migraines, etc). However, this cleanse is a very mild version, bringing us back to clean eating by removing all the nasties. Increasing water intake is crucial, in order to flush out unhealthy waste and clear out what we don't want, otherwise it just circulates. The main principles of the cleanse are to strip the diet back to foods that have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body and only intake foods that nourish and support the liver. For 3 days remove: Coffee, alcohol, dairy, sugar, sweeteners, soy, gluten, meat, fried and fatty foods, processed foods. Help your body to flush toxins with gentle exercise: Accelerate the release of toxins with movement such as swimming, walking, yoga, pilates. Add spices to your cooking, and consider herbal support: Spices such as cayenne pepper, nutmeg, turmeric, ginger, cardamom, and clove can be beneficial. Coriander is wonderful for cleansing support. Your naturopath can also provide you with a liver-supporting herbal mix to make the cleanse a whole lot more effective. Ensure adequate rest and sleep time: 8 hours of sleep is ideal during a cleanse. Taking rest time throughout the day will also be important, as your body is working extra hard. You will likely feel tired. Be aware of emotional ups and downs: As toxins release into the bloodstream and the body receives less intake of food than it usually would, it can cause certain emotions to arise. It is not uncommon to feel [irritable and moody](https://thenaturopathic.co/mood/) during a cleanse, so be mindful of allowing yourself extra time for you. Enjoy a bath: Accelerate the release of toxins by enjoying a Epsom salt bath. Again, ensure adequate water intake to avoid dehydration. Consider a infrared sauna session, or a lymphatic massage for even more benefit. Need support?
