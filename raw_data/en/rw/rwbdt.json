In this collection of addresses, discussions, question-and-answer sessions and lectures - running parallel to his major medical cycles - Steiner comments on contemporary medicine's emphasis on experimental, materially-based research and its subsequent lack of attention to therapy. Steiner's intention is not to detract from developments in medical science but to build on them with spiritual science - not quackery but a true art of medicine. The medical practitioner has an important task: diseases must be cured, and it is wrong not to intervene and simply to allow 'karma to take its course'. Speaking to audiences ranging from members of the general public to small groups of medical professionals, Steiner offers new insights into our understanding of human organs such as the brain, kidneys and liver, as well as the efficacy of healing substances including arsenic, sulphur, arnica and essential plant oils. He studies a broad range of specific medical conditions, giving advice on cancer, hysteria, rheumatism, gout, skin eruptions, typhoid, diabetes, haemophilia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, asthma, glaucoma, leukaemia, smallpox, insomnia, and childhood diseases such as measles. His commentaries on a raft of contrasting subjects - such as psychiatry, sexual maturity, memory, poisoning and detoxification - present challenging perspectives for patients and medical practitioners. Steiner's surprisingly non-dogmatic advice on vaccination, for example, gives a refreshingly balanced, and perhaps unexpected, point of view. This volume also includes a lecture on eurythmy therapy, a comprehensive introduction, index and notes, and nine full colour plates of Rudolf Steiner's blackboard drawings.", "sitename": "Scribd", "date": "2013-12-10", "cleaned_text": "Physiology and Healing: Treatment, Therapy and Hygiene - Spiritual Science and Medicine () About this ebook [Rudolf Steiner Press](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/665949905/Rudolf-Steiner-Press) Reviews for Physiology and Healing 0 ratings0 reviews Book preview Physiology and Healing - Rudolf Steiner I PHYSIOLOGY AND THERAPY BASED ON THE SCIENCE OF THE SPIRIT LECTURE 1 DORNACH, 7 OCTOBER 1920 THE speaker has not yet arrived.\u00b9 I hope he'll be here soon, but for now, I don't wish to have you sitting there waiting. It is self-evident that this series of lectures carries particular weight as part of the course. The intention is to take a practical subject and show how our spiritual science with anthroposophical orientation truly can play an effective role in everyday life. Now as everyone knows from personal experience, medicine, medical treatment, is a most important sphere of life, and for this reason if no other we must not fail to take anthroposophy into the field of medicine right from the beginning of our anthroposophical endeavours. In this course we endeavoured to have the individual subject areas covered by people who are qualified specialists also in everyday terms. It is necessary to do so when we, representing spiritual science, present the different subjects to the world, for otherwise they are not taken the way they are meant to be taken. I will therefore try and say a few things about physiology and how it relates to medical treatment until the speaker arrives, doing so from the spiritual-scientific point of view. That was more or less the proposed subject matter. And I want to show you how much spiritual science is needed in the study of medicine and then also in medical practice, in the whole art of medicine. As you know, at our universities the study of medicine is usually preceded by a study of the sciences. The actual study of medicine comes after this. Having got to know the phenomena more of biology and physiology, one then gives consideration to the pathological phenomena, until one finally comes to the subject of therapeutics. Many members of this audience will no doubt know that therapy really gets a poor deal in the process. It is indeed true that with the study of medicine given this scientific approach people concentrate on the natural processes relating to human beings. When the future physicians then come to the subject of pathological processes they do so with a mind concentrated on natural processes and are hardly able to see pathological processes in the right light. Now there is an opinion which I think has come up more or less of necessity in more recent times. We tend to gain a particular view of processes in nature, their inner connection and the underlying causes. In a healthy individual we must therefore under these conditions quite evidently look for certain natural processes in a necessary causal relationship. In a sick person, or let us say in a sick organism, what can we look for but basically also natural processes subject to causal necessity? Yet we are compelled to say that compared to a healthy organism the natural processes in their very obviously causal development of a disease are abnormal, in a way dropping out of the system of causal relationships that exist in a healthy organism. In short, as soon as we enter into the field of medicine doubt and scepticism arise concerning our actual approach to the study of nature when it comes to considering natural events from the modern point of view. Many medical people therefore develop a real scepticism, downright nihilism, as I have said here on other occasions, when it comes to treatment. I have known famous professors at the faculty of medicine in Vienna\u2014at a time when that faculty of medicine was at the height of its glory\u2014who at heart really were nihilists when it came to treatment.\u00b2 They said that one can really only let a disease take its course\u2014and they took the particular disease where such a view does certainly apply, pneumonia, as an example. One can guide the course it is taking with external measures that will ameliorate or promote it, until the crisis comes and the whole then dies down again. Essentially we cannot speak of a cure in the true sense of the word, though people have done so for centuries if not millennia. If such a view were to be consistently taken further, medicine would gradually develop into pure pathology. For in the study of diseases, albeit from the point of view of a natural science based on materialistic thinking, an extraordinary degree of perfection has been achieved in this age of therapeutic nihilism. At this point I'd also warn you against the potential misconception that in Dornach and in spiritual science with anthroposophical orientation we fail to recognize and tend to underestimate the full significance of modern science. That is not at all the case. Someone who has taken even just a brief look at the methods of investigation in pathology in the second half of the nineteenth century and how they have developed can only do so in amazement and admiration for the brilliant, tremendous progress made. Yet beyond this he must also make a very different admission. He has to say to himself: Yes, materialism has arrived. But it cannot meet certain needs in the human heart and mind; nor can it cast an adequate light on vast areas of human insight. Materialism has however had its own kind of mission, I'd say. It has made us develop our ability to experiment and observe in an extraordinarily careful and thorough way. We are entirely indebted to this materialism for our modern pathology, even if it does have that materialistic bias. People will always complain if one is not biased in our present age. As editor of the journal Magazin f\u00fcr Literatur,\u00b3 I was labelled a materialist when I had written an article after Buechner's death that did not condemn him but did indeed express appreciation of his merits. This is what matters when we live with and practise the science of the spirit, that we are able to enter into everything, everywhere finding the thought form, the form of sentience, on which approaches and philosophies that may be complete opposites may draw, and we are also able to appreciate the merits of something which has its root in such a thing as materialism. At the present time\u2014and this is simply the need of our time\u2014we must, however, overcome materialism. There is something else to which I'd like to draw your attention. You will have heard in the lectures given here that we seek to establish a phenomenology in science. You will also have heard, with full justification, that there is need to look for a chemistry free from hypothesis. I am keen to discover if someone might not find that with regard to one thing or another which indeed has to be presented with reference to medicine and the practice of medicine, the discussions do not also cover elements that will seem to him to be hypothetical. But we must first clearly establish the concept 'hypothesis', especially when moving from the study of the inorganic to the organic. What is a hypothesis? Well, let us take a perfectly ordinary thing from everyday life. When I have walked along a road and seen someone along this road and walked on and then did not see him any more I am unlikely to assume at first that this person has disappeared into the ground, something most unlikely to happen. No, I'll look around and perhaps see a house. I can limit my ideas and say to myself: Well, he's gone into that house. I don't see him now, but he's in there. It would be a justifiable hypothesis if I were to take the thoughts, as it were, that come to me as my senses perceive this, and then something occurs that needs further explanation, so that I have to presuppose something, take it as a hypothesis. This will arise from my train of thought but cannot be seen or observed directly, so that it is not a direct phenomenon for me. I would not be setting up a vague hypothesis in making such an assumption, just as I'd not be setting up a vague hypothesis when on using a thermometer I first perceive an increase in temperature, and then see this temperature disappear\u2014due to freezing or something of the kind\u2014and speak of the loss of latent heat. If investigation is to be fruitful it is now and then necessary, therefore, to take the sequence of sensory concepts further. An unjustifiable hypothesis is one where we arrive at ideas where if we take them further, and consider them with insight, it becomes evident that the things on which it is based simply cannot ever be perceived. We must then provide the ideas we arrive at\u2014ideas on atomism, molecularism\u2014with ingredients that can never be perceived, otherwise we would be able to perceive them. For we could never, for instance, cherish the illusion\u2014if there were some kind of process by which it would be possible to see even the smallest particles of bodies\u2014that we could then still explain light as arising from motion. In that case we would actually be taking light into those smallest particles. I would ask you to make occasion at this point to develop a clear idea of justifiably continuing in thought within an experience on the one hand and of establishing unjustifiable hypotheses on the other. To come back once more to that earlier thought, we have to say: We see someone before us whom we consider to be 'normal'. And we see someone else who has fallen ill. We must of necessity acknowledge a process taking its natural course in either case. Yet how does the one process relate to the other? The fact that we keep physiology, pathology and medical treatment separate, as has become the custom in recent times, prevents us from gaining the relevant ideas as we move from one to the other. Apart from this, modern medical people really cannot include the spiritual in their considerations when working with physiology or also pathology, for the spiritual is really something unknown in the modern approach to science. And so it is not included in any of their considerations. It is possible to contrast the two natural processes, one physiological, the other pathological, definitely and clearly, initially in abstract form, choosing certain final forms in pathology, I'd say, and the study of such final forms may perhaps allow us to arrive at fruitful ideas. You need not think of there being an absolute necessity, of it being demanded, when you are at the beginning of a science. This correctness, something we call inner necessity, can only develop in the course of our studies. And we may therefore start at any point, I'd say, if we want to study a particular thing in nature. Let us take a truly extreme case within the sick human organism. One most extreme case which presents many problems in modern medicine is the development of cancer. With this we see\u2014as may also be seen under the microscope\u2014something organic, or at least looking organic, developing in such a way in the ordinary organism that it will gradually destroy life in the rest of that organism. At first all we can say is that within the body of the human organism we see something arise where we see how, rising from unknown depths, something enters into the usual natural course which interferes with the development of that natural course. We may also turn to the other extreme of a pathological organism. We can perceive something arising, something where, in a sense, normal activity in the human organism proliferates, becoming 'unnormal'. We then consider the human organism to be abnormal. I don't particularly wish to operate with the terms 'normal' and 'abnormal', but they will serve our purpose for the moment. In due course of time it would then be evident, if this line of thought were to be taken further\u2014which I hope it won't\u2014that in transition the normal would also simply go over into the 'abnormal', as it is called. Just for the moment it will be reasonable to use the terms 'normal' and 'abnormal'. With reference to the 'normal' human organization we note that in the psyche, too, a specific form of will intent develops, a specific form of feeling and a specific form of thinking. In social life we have gradually let a kind of 'normal' image crystallize out of the ideas we gain from dealing with other people, an image which makes us consider a person as 'normal' who to a certain degree develops his will, feeling and thinking out of his own nature. Concentrating that thought just a little, we will inevitably say to ourselves that if the organism functions too strongly, functioning like a body containing latent heat from which we remove that latent heat and which would then release too much free heat into the surrounding world so that we'd no longer know what to do with this heat\u2014now if the human organism were to function in such a way, sending out too much in this direction, it would of necessity, if it were to present itself to us in reality, have to show the results which we've arrived at in our thinking, though the emotional element always comes into this through the element of feeling. In our thoughts such a human organism would seem to us to be affected by the abnormality we call mania. We see something appear in this human organism which results from powers of organization flooding it, powers that go very much in the direction of sensory qualities. Carcinoma-type developments are something where natural force appears in the organism, segregating itself, as it were, where this organizing power becomes embedded in the organism. On the other hand, the pathological phenomena of mania or the like are something which the organism is not able to hold on to, as it were, something which comes out of the organism. If I were to draw a diagram of this, I would do it by saying: If this is the normal development of the human organism, I'd draw in the occurrence of a carcinomatous growth like this [Fig. 1, below, red], putting something by way of powers of growth in some place or other, powers that now cling to the organism inwardly, so that it must there provide something which otherwise it would provide for the whole organism. Fig. 1 For a diagram of mania I would have to show something welling forth from the organism (blue), something pushing towards the sphere of mind and soul. I have been referring to extreme situations, and you may consider them also in less acute forms. Imagine the problem does not go as far as developing into a carcinoma, but rather a carcinomatous change prevented from going all the way. In that case some organ or other\u2014for these things do not happen in a vacuum, of course, nor in spaces between organs\u2014is taken hold of, but the power which otherwise tends to go inwards and in there emancipate, growing quite independent, unites with the power normal to the organ. The organ is then affected by a disease which we may refer to in many different ways, as has come to be the custom in medicine. Let us assume a tendency towards mania is stopped halfway. The abnormality of the individual's organization does not cause the element of mind and soul to be put outside completely, as is the case with full-blown mania, where it is completely beside itself, as it were, and the thought element emotionally goes its own way. The element which tends towards the other extreme goes only halfway, and we then have the different forms of 'mental illness' as it is called\u2014as it is called, I say\u2014which may take all kinds of different forms, from illusions, which are organic in origin, all the way to states of hysteria and so on where an organic origin is hardly demonstrable, though they do have their basis in the organism. As you can see, the aim has been to consider the phenomena that take us from the normal to the pathological in two different directions. We must consider these phenomena before we can form an opinion about them. Let me now show you from another angle how it is possible to grasp, at least to a degree, what is behind it all, doing so not yet entirely out of the science of the spirit, the methods of which I have referred to as insight in images, inspiration and intuition, but by using a certain instinct, as we might call it, though unless there is a desire to progress to the spiritual-scientific way doing it from instinct will only take us halfway. There is an extraordinarily interesting phenomenon in the evolution of German culture. Leaving aside one's personal view of Schelling as a philosopher, he is an interesting phenomenon in the history of civilization. Perhaps everything he has developed as a philosophy may be wrong and askew, but there was a certain instinct alive in him for natural processes even in areas where people working in ordinary science are not at ease in following events in nature, relying more on a very crude empiricism. Schelling has indeed also tried to think in terms of medicine as occasion arose, and actually devoted quite some time especially to issues relating to healing processes. Little thought has been given in the more recent study of the history of philosophy to how Schelling actually came to leave more abstract and local philosophical deliberations aside and enter, quite instinctively, into a realistic study of nature and even the organic sphere. He actually published a journal in which medical issues were extensively considered. Where did this come from? We can come to understand it if we know, and learn to appreciate in the right way, the profound instincts for gaining insight on which Schelling drew for his truths and his errors. And so we find a remarkable statement made by Schelling, not based on clear insight, I'd say, but hewn from the instincts in his psyche. He said that to gain insight into nature was to create nature. Now if these words were to be realized directly for human insight, we'd find it easy to enter into medicine. If we could have the creative powers entering into our search for insight, if we had powers of creation in our thinking, we would find it quite easy to enter into the field of physiological and pathological phenomena, for we would then be able to observe the steps taken by creative nature, as it were. From the empirical point of view one simply has to say that we are unable to do so. Someone who then takes this further would be able to say that the very fact that a demand like the one made by Schelling cannot be met, going beyond human capacities, is partly the reason why we are not able initially to see into a process of this kind, where new developments arise. Being unable to follow nature's creative work directly with our powers of insight, we are unable to see into the process where new forms, new developments arise. We are thus not immediately able to look into the facts of material processes such as the development of a carcinoma. However, if we rightly bring together this thing which is truly denied us, i.e. our inability to do with the things which do present themselves to us in the carcinomatous process, what a man of genius demands when he says that to gain insight into nature is to create nature\u2014if we bring this together with the phenomena of the carcinomatous process it will become evident how one must tackle processes of this kind. We have to admit that Schelling did not speak from instinct in other respects. Just consider how his utterances were polar opposites. On the one hand we have the words: To gain insight into nature is to create nature, something we are unable to do. On the other hand there are these words: To gain insight into the spirit is to destroy the spirit. So far only people involved in spiritual science have said these words, and even then only in a certain mysterious obscurity: To gain insight into the spirit is to destroy the spirit. Now if we are unable to achieve the creative work of nature, then\u2014initially admitting this merely in analogous form, we may go further into this later\u2014we are also unable, with our human capacities, to destroy the spirit. We cannot penetrate with our powers of insight to the point where the destruction of things spiritual begins. Yet you will have an inkling, I think, that here we have a certain relationship to manic or similar states where something destructive arises in mind and spirit. There is need to look for the connection between the normal human powers that cannot create nature by gaining insight into it, and those that cannot destroy the spirit by gaining insight into it. I have thus shown you the way initially, something which takes us from a normal, but instinctively more deeply stimulated conscious awareness to the relationship of the human being to nature. We shall see that along this road, which I have now indicated, there lies, as we go on, the element we must really look for as we move on from physiology to pathology. Well, I hope that it won't be necessary for me to speak to you about this tomorrow as well, but I will try to take this line of thought further one evening during the next few days, at least in outline. LECTURE 2 DORNACH, 8 OCTOBER 1920 LET me pick up where I concluded yesterday. Reference had been made to an individual who was driven by his philosophical instincts, as it were, from insight in the sphere of mind and soul to a feeling that this sphere related to human existence in a physical body. This was Schelling, and I said that on the basis of these instincts Schelling became involved in practical terms not only in the theory of medicine but also with various forms of treatment. I do not know if this led to greater or less satisfaction, as is the case with physicians who are well prepared. For the question as to how much a treatment really contributes to a person's improvement is in most cases highly problematical unless, of course, one takes the inner view. Schelling did, however, gain a principle in the state of soul engendered out of that instinct, a principle of which we may indeed say that it would be good if it were to become a kind of inner principle for every physician, so that the physician would develop the whole of his practical view of the nature of the human being in sickness and health on the basis of it. I gave you the words Schelling spoke. He simply said that to gain insight into nature was to create nature. I think you'll agree that the first thing to strike one when a man of genius says such a thing is that it is evidently absurd. No one would seriously believe that as an earthly human being in a physical body one would be able to create anything, whatever it may be, that exists in nature by gaining insight into nature. Yes, people are creating things all the time in industry, but there it is not a question of truly creating something in the sense Schelling meant it, but merely of putting together, combining, forces of nature that would give nature the opportunity to be creative herself in a particular way, in a specific arrangement. Essentially, therefore, we have here an absurdity on which a man of genius based really the whole of his thinking. And I quoted other words to you yesterday, words that may be seen as the opposite of 'To gain insight into nature is to create nature', which would be 'To gain insight into the spirit is to destroy the spirit.' Schelling probably did not utter these in such a fundamental way. But when one is again taking up the science of the spirit in a different age, developing one's own spiritual investigation, one realizes that essentially both statements take us back to most ancient inspired insights. Schelling was not an initiate in any way but simply a man of genius. He produced the one statement out of his own instincts. And when we do studies that were not done in Schelling's day this statement immediately brings to mind echoes of the most ancient maxims. This then takes one to the other statement, coming to us as the echo of ancient maxims in a similar way. Both cannot be grasped with our ordinary understanding today. Seen side by side or each on its own, they are really absurd. Yet they point to something of the greatest importance in the human organization in both sickness and health. Looking at the natural world around us, the only thing we can say about finished processes in nature is that to gain insight into nature is at best to recreate nature in our thoughts. We thus really develop this principle which we call our thoughts and which can do no more than recreate nature since it lacks the inner creative power in our thinking, in an inner life filled through and through with thoughts and ideas. But it has already been said that this inner life filled with ideas essentially is merely something which emancipates from the physical and etheric organization as the second teeth develop, something human beings have inside their physical and etheric organism up to that time. The powers at work in that part of us are truly creative in early childhood; they then become attenuated, toned down in the inner life as a world of images or of thoughts and ideas, in short, I'd say, as a cosmic power in our thoughts and ideas that is a dilution of the substantial creativity we had in our physical and etheric bodies. So the element which we come to know from our seventh year onwards simply sits in our organism and organizes things in childhood. There it is actively creative. This creative activity is not such that we can see it creatively at work in the natural world outside; but we see it there being active in our own organism. If the child were to have wisdom already and were able to speak not only about the natural world outside but about the things happening inside him, and understand nature there, he would say what Schelling said: To gain insight into this nature is to create this nature. For the child would simply imbue himself with these creative powers, would be at one with them. And Schelling, with his medical instinct, his physiological instinct, did nothing else but take something which is an absurdity in the whole of later life, taking it from his childhood, and pushing it out, saying, as it were: All this gaining of insight in adulthood is nothing but a feeble tissue of images; if one were able to gain insight as a child, one would have to say: To gain insight is really to be active, to develop creative activity. We are, however, only able to see this creative activity in our own inner life. So what is it really, this creative activity within us, something which a man of genius such as Schelling puts in words in the way I indicated? Now I think you'll agree that genius altogether arises when someone keeps some childlike quality later on in life. People who age absolutely, taking to ageing in a 'normal' way when the relevant age is reached, will never have genius. It is people who take something positively creative and childlike into later life who actually have genius. This childlike quality, positively creative, this creativity based on insight\u2014to put it in what is perhaps a foolish way\u2014does not have the time to turn the search for insight to the outside because it turns those powers of insight inwards and becomes creative. This is the legacy we bring with us when we go through birth to enter into physical existence. And someone like Schelling felt this instinctively. Everyone who gains this kind of vision will know that these things are not, for instance, such that the powers of mind and soul that imbue the organism in childhood and organize it cease to be when the second teeth develop. They are merely going through a stage. They are, as it were, forced down to a smaller measure of activity. We do later on definitely continue to have organizing powers in us, but we have also gained powers to create memory. Those powers come to conscious awareness at second dentition and so free themselves from the organization. Memory has then left the latent state and been released, and our powers of growth, of movement, of balance have become powers of mental vision, which in early childhood had shown the higher degree of activity needed at that time. You can see from this that in normal human development this organizing power, this power of growth, must be transformed in a particular way, and taken down to a given level, to be powers of mind and soul, powers of memory, let us say, and the power to develop thought. If we assume on the other hand that due to some event or other too much of this organizing power active in childhood is held back, with development simply taking a course where not enough of the organizing powers are transformed into memory-creating powers, then they are held fast down below in the organism, are not taken properly into sleep every time the individual goes to sleep, but continue to be active in the organism, bumbling about in the organism from going to sleep to waking up. Doing physiological and phenomenological medical research in the direction which I can only refer to briefly in the short time available for these lectures, one comes to see that in the human organism it is possible for powers that should really go into the sphere of spirit and soul at the right time of life to stay down below in the physical organization. This creates the situation of which I spoke yesterday. If the normal measure of organizing powers is transformed at second dentition, we have a measure of powers in the organism later on in life that can fully organize this organism in its normal configuration and normal structure. But if we do not have this, if we transform too little, then the untransformed powers remain down there, turn up in one place or another, and we get those neoplasms, those carcinomatous neoplasms of which I spoke yesterday. In this way we can follow the process of falling ill, or of being injured, as Troxler put it in the first half of the nineteenth century, of injury in later life. Comparison is then also possible with regard to the situation with childhood diseases, for these clearly cannot have the same kind of origin, seeing that they develop in childhood when nothing has as yet been transformed. Yet once we have come to know the causes of disease in later life we have also gained the ability to observe the situation with the causes of disease in childhood. In a way one sees the same thing, though in a different aspect. We find that there is also too much power of organization in mind and soul in the organism when childhood diseases develop. This shows itself particularly well to anyone who has developed the ability to see things in this direction when considering the phenomenon of scarlet fever, of measles, in childhood. They can then see how something which would otherwise function normally in the child's organism, the element of mind and spirit, begins to bumble about, is more active than it really should be. The whole course of these diseases can be understood the moment we are really able to see how this bumbling about in the organism is the underlying cause of the disease. From there it is not far\u2014please pay careful attention to this, for I never go a step further than the thoughts that have gone before do justify, even if I am only able to refer to things briefly, but I always make it clear how far it is possible to go\u2014I am not saying that a conclusion is drawn here, but only that one is close to giving recognition to something which it is extraordinarily important to recognize for real knowledge. If we have reached the point where we are able to perceive that when disease develops later in life that goes in the direction of neoplasia\u2014meaning that there is too much organizing power, resulting in a surplus, as it were, in an organizational island\u2014we are close to saying to ourselves: If later life thus refers back to earliest childhood, then the principle apparent in childhood refers back to the time before birth, or let us say conception; it refers back to the individual's existence in spirit and soul which he had before being clothed in a physical body. Such an individual has simply brought too much of the spirit and soul element with him from life before being a human being, from life before earth, and this surplus comes into its own in the childhood diseases. In future the only thing possible will be to allow oneself to drift from the fruitless materialistic thinking in which we are caught up today, especially in physiology and therapy, and consider things from the point of view of mind and soul. And it will be found that the things which arise in spiritual science do not do so because the spiritual investigator is not properly based in physical research, being an amateur, as it were, in physical research. In parenthesis I'd definitely say that many who call themselves spiritual investigators are indeed such amateurs, but that is not how it should be. A spiritual scientist does not have to be too limited in his knowledge of physical research to be a spiritual scientist; he will be a spiritual scientist when he is more knowledgeable in that field than scientists usually are. If he understands the phenomena more clearly the phenomena themselves will drive him into the sphere of mind and soul, especially where we have to speak of sickness. Then there are the words 'To gain insight into the spirit is to destroy the spirit'. Well, it really is equally absurd. But these words, too, point to something that has to be perceived and understood. For just as the words 'To gain insight into nature is to create nature' refer us to early childhood, and in fact to the time before birth, if we broaden them in the right way, so the words 'To gain insight into the spirit is to destroy the spirit' refer to the end of an individual's life, to the principle in us that brings death. You only have to subscribe to those words\u2014paradoxically, I'd say\u2014that to gain insight into the spirit is to destroy the spirit, and you'll find that we must not go along with them, and yet they are there in life as something we are always asymptotically coming close to. For someone who does not simply rush into insight-gaining, as we might put it, but develops the right way of knowing himself, to gain insight into the spirit, it means to see, to gain vision of, constant processes of degradation, constant processes of destruction in the human organism. Looking into the creative age of childhood, we see continuous building-up processes which, however, have the peculiarity that they dim the conscious mind. This is why we are half dreaming, half asleep, in childhood, with the conscious mind not fully awake yet. "}
