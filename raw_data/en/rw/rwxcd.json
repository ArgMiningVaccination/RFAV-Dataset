What inspired you to do what you're doing? Honestly, what inspired me originally and what keeps inspiring me is the need I see for healing. And at so many levels: personal, cultural, institutional. Do you think you'll ever change direction? Fundamentally as a being oriented to healing, no, I don't foresee that changing. The form that healing work takes? I expect it to keep changing.

So much creativity is hidden behind the veil of unacknowledged and unexpressed grief. What are you currently listening to, reading, or watching? Punchdrunk, the theatre company. I am fascinated by collective healing, and live immersive theater comes closest to that depth of experience. In the future, when we can be together again, I am most looking forward to holding more large-scale ritual events. Did the isolation influence your creative process?
