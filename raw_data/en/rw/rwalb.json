Further, nearly 12,000 private-sector workers have nonfatal work-related injuries or illnesses daily, more than half of which require job transfers, work restrictions or time away from work. Every day, approximately 9,000 workers are treated in emergency departments due to occupational injuries; 200 of these workers are hospitalized. These injuries are expensive. The 2004 workers' compensation (WC) costs were estimated at $87 billion, 1 an estimate that does not include indirect costs of work-related injuries and illnesses, such as loss of productivity and replacement training. Work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths are preventable. However, in 2006 more than 60,000 of Oregon's 1.7 million workers were injured on the job or experienced a work-related illness. In 2006, 79 Oregonians died after being hurt at work: an average of more than one work-related death per week. Successful approaches to healthier and safer workplaces start with using data to understand the scope of the problem. Surveillance data are used to determine the magnitude of work-related injuries and illnesses, as well as to identify workers at greatest risk and establish priorities for prevention. The Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) Public Health Division (PHD) has been involved in occupational health surveillance since 1988. The Oregon Occupational Public Health Program (OPHP) was established to improve state-based occupational health surveillance by strengthening and expanding existing tracking and prevention partnerships in the public and private sectors. 3introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes OPHP is comprised of four public health surveillance programs: Fundamental: Using data from governmental and partner sources, OPHP generates and publishes 19 occupational health indicators (OHIs) for each year. The OHIs were chosen to highlight specific work-associated disease, injury or other factors associated with occupational health.Burn: The OPHP burn surveillance project is working to reduce the number of occupational burns in Oregon by identifying the occupations, industries and populations that have a high risk of burn injury; helping our partners develop targeted intervention strategies to ensure Oregon workers stay healthy; and sharing intervention strategies with other states.Fatality: The Oregon Occupational Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (OR-FACE) program is a collaboration between PHD and the Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental Toxicology (CROET) at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). The OR-FACE program is responsible for collecting data on all Oregon traumatic workplace fatalities and collaborates with partners to prevent work-related deaths.Pesticide: Oregon has a long and active history of pesticide poisoning surveillance. OPHP continues to perform activities related to Oregon workers' pesticide exposures with the help of the Oregon Pesticide Exposure Safety & T racking (PEST) Program. Oregon's occupational health promotion projects are carried out by a variety of agencies and organizations, including Oregon DHS PHD, Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division (OR-OSHA), insurance carriers, university faculty and staff, community-based organizations and others.4Many sources of data are used for tracking work-related illnesses and injuries, including workers' compensation claims, hospital discharge data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Annual Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) and the Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This Occupational Health in Oregon report presents the state's most recent data to examine trends in work-related illnesses and injuries. This report begins with a brief summary of the most current work force characteristics for our state (between 2004 and 2006, depending on the data source) followed by a section on each of the following conditions or populations: fatal work-related injuries, nonfatal work-related injuries, musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), occupational burns, occupational exposure to lead, acute work-related pesticide poisoning, work-related asthma (WRA), pneumoconiosis (occupational lung disease), malignant mesothelioma, younger workers, older workers, and women in the work force. Occupational injuries Findings There were 79 occupational fatalities in Oregon in 2006, 31 percent of which involved motor vehicle transportation. On average, more than one worker died from a work-related injury every week. Oregon's fatal injury rate exceeded the national rate in 2006 (4.4 per 100,000 workers vs. 3.9 for the United States). Oregon's fatal occupational injury rate has remained fairly stable since 2003.Oregon's nonfatal occupational injury rate has decreased over the past 10 years, from a high of 2,600 injuries per 100,000 workers in 1996 to 1,700 per 100,000 in 2005. Work-related hospitalizations have also decreased over the past five years.5introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Rates of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and back injuries decreased between 2000 and 2006 (from 29 to 16 per 100,000 for CTS and 374 to 364 per 100,000 for back injuries); rates of neck and shoulder injury increased from 208 to 380 per 100,000 between 2000 and 2004.There were 272 work-related burns and 26 hospitalizations in 2006. The rate of work-related burn hospitalization decreased between 2001 and 2006. Recommendations Many strategies could be implemented to reduce occupational injuries and fatalities due to transportation crashes. For example, employer-provided vehicle maintenance programs, recordkeeping of workers' driving performance, and defensive driving training may be effective. Additional strategies for employers, workers and policy makers are available in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Publication 2003-119, \"Work-related roadway crashes - Challenges and opportunities for prevention.\"Oregon's tracking of musculoskeletal disorders needs to be improved. This is particularly important for industry sectors where these injuries are most common, such as trade, transportation and utilities, and health care. An ergonomics standard designed to prevent musculoskeletal disorders could be helpful to reduce the burden of these injuries for Oregon workers. California has implemented this type of standard and has realized both cost savings and health risk reduction.6Toxic exposures Findings Fifty-eight adult Oregonians had elevated blood lead levels (greater than or equal to 25 micrograms per deciliter) in 2005. Rates of adult lead poisoning decreased overall between 2002 and 2005.Incidence of acute work-related pesticide poisoning remained relatively stable between 2000 and 2005, with a slight elevation in reported cases in 2002. Fifty-two Oregon workers reported acute pesticide poisoning in 2005. Recommendations The PHD should continue its lead poisoning prevention programs, particularly because occupations with the potential for work-related lead exposure are projected to grow over the next 10 years. Oregon should adopt primacy for administering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new Remodeling, Repair and Painting rule, to directly regulate training and enforcement for the activities that represent the greatest risk of lead poisoning.Work-related pesticide poisoning surveillance needs to be expanded. The current system may not effectively capture reports of pesticide illnesses by workers who speak languages other than English or who may be concerned about retaliation. Further, workers with disabilities may face additional challenges to know and consistently practice pesticide-safe work practices.7introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Occupational diseases Findings Asthma prevalence among Oregon adults increased from 7.3 percent in 1999 to 9.9 percent in 2005. More than 50 percent of Oregonians with asthma reported that their asthma was caused or aggravated by chemicals, smoke, fumes or dust on the job.Occupational lung disease (pneumoconiosis) contributed to the deaths of 14 Oregonians in 2005. The age-adjusted death rate for pneumoconiosis remained about the same between 2000 and 2004. There were 225 pneumoconiosis hospitalizations in 2005. The hospitalization rate for pneumoconiosis decreased slightly between 2000 and 2005.Work-related cancer is relatively rare, but 39 Oregonians were diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma in 2005. There was no clear trend in incidence of malignant mesothelioma between 2000 and 2006. Recommendations Many studies have shown that work-related diseases are underreported. These data would be more complete if health care providers were required to report occupational diseases to the state public health agency. Many states have this kind of requirement, but Oregon currently does not.8Special populations Findings In 2006, 32,000 youths under 18 years of age worked in Oregon and 134 filed accepted disabling workers' compensation claims. One young worker died on the job in 2004; no youths under 18 died from work-related injuries or illnesses in 2006. Young workers under 18 are more likely than older workers to experience an occupational cut or burn or to be injured in a fall or when struck by an object.In 2006, 432 of 66,000 working Oregonians 65 years or older filed accepted disabling workers' compensation claims. Thirteen older adults died as a result of work-related injuries or illnesses in 2006.Older workers are more likely to be injured in a fall and to suffer a fracture than younger workers. The average time away from work after an injury is 40 percent longer for older workers.Women are more likely than men to experience work-related sprains, strains and tears, as well as musculoskeletal disorders. Women account for a larger proportion than men of workers' compensation claims for the service industry, and in particular for the health services industry. Women are also more likely than men to be injured at work due to assault or violence.9introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Recommendations OPHP should continue to participate in the Oregon Young Worker Health and Safety Coalition, and should advocate for evidence-based interventions by the Coalition members to address the elevated health risks of cuts, burns or falls.Oregon businesses that employ youth should take advantage of local training opportunities for prevention of youth worker injury and illness; for example, the Young Worker Leadership Academies' curriculum developed by the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California at Berkeley.2007's House Bill 2022, which requires Oregon health care employers to report incidents of work-related violence against employees, should be extended beyond 2008; data from this surveillance program should be used to create and deliver interventions to reduce workplace violence in health care settings.

OR-FACE conducts surveillance, investigation and assessment of traumatic occupational fatalities in Oregon and engages in outreach and education to prevent traumatic occupational fatalities and promote occupational safety. OR-FACE has recorded occupational fatalities since 2003 and now has four years of data from 2003 to 2006. In that time, OR-FACE recorded 284 occupational fatalities in 255 incidents. The average fatality rate of 4.0 per 100,000 employed workers over the four-year period is consistent with the national occupational fatality rate of 4.0 over the same period (see Table 2-1).

Priority areas of concern in Oregon fatalities relate to motor vehicle transportation, mobile machinery, logging, machinery, fall hazards, persons outside vehicles and water transportation. A few of these priority areas are indicated in the classification of fatalities by standard codes for industry, occupation and event (see Figures 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3). tradePublic administrationArts/entertainmentFishingAgricultureAdmin/support/waste/remed.ManufacturingConstructionForestry/loggingTransportationFigure 2-1.

Motor vehicle transportation Fatalities in motor-vehicle transportation incidents - defined as events that occur during the vehicle's normal operation- comprised 31 percent of all occupational fatalities. The most prominent types of vehicles involved were semi-trucks with trailers and log trucks. Of the 74 incidents that occurred during 2003-2006, 53 (72 percent) were crashes on paved roads, 13 (17 percent) were crashes on unpaved roads, six (8 percent) involved a person outside the vehicle, and two (3 percent) involved a passenger exiting a moving truck. A majority of the 66 crash incidents occurred in autumn and winter and in the dark or twilight hours. Also, older workers were disproportionately involved in crash events. Workers aged 65 and older comprised 3 percent of the total employed labor force in Oregon, but were involved in 11 percent (nine) of the crash incidents. Mobile machinery Incidents involving various types of mobile machinery in diverse events have been a prominent and persistent area of concern. Specific safety recommendations have been developed for the operation of bulldozers, skidders and forklifts, and tractors. A few incidents have also involved cable rigging failure in towing or lifting operations.21introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Logging Working as a tree faller is one of the most hazardous occupations in Oregon, with an estimated fatality rate of 258 per 100,000 workers. The fatality rate for log truck drivers is only slightly lower, at 239 per 100,000 workers. Of the 38 incidents in logging operations in 2003-2006, 11 (29 percent) involved log trucks, 10 (26 percent) involved fallers, eight (21 percent) involved yarding operations (both skyline and helicopter logging), three (8 percent) involved road construction, and six were in singular events. Machinery A number of incidents each year involved various types of industrial machinery. Most remarkable in these incidents was a common risk factor across different settings where machine maintenance was conducted without first completely shutting down and locking out the machine. Carelessness was occasionally the issue, but in other instances - as with a rock crusher or wood chipper - maintenance was purposely conducted during operation for convenience and speed. In several cases, machines' safety mechanisms were disabled to allow access without shutting down the machine. Fall hazards Fall hazards involve a wide variety of workers. Construction workers, who were involved in 11 (33 percent) of the 33 fall incidents, were the most affected group. Falls constituted the largest event category in construction. Ladders were involved in nine (27 percent) of all fall incidents. Most of the remaining incidents involved working at a height: on a roof, trailer, catwalk, treetop, scaffold or other elevated work area; however, three (9 percent) of the incidents involved ground-level falls. Several fall incidents involved delayed death, with complications due to poor health, medication, pulmonary embolism, heart failure or other interacting conditions. 22Parked vehicles Unexpected movement of a motor vehicle or mobile machinery, distinct from transportation events, was a factor in a number of incidents where the operator or another person was outside the vehicle. During 2003-2006, 21 such incidents comprised 34 percent of the 61 contact events and 8 percent of the total 255 incidents. A person outside a vehicle was the most common type of incident in agriculture, comprising six (26 percent) of 23 incidents in agriculture. Water transportation Over four years, 21 workers drowned in water transportation events; four additional workers drowned while swimming or working near water. The number of water transportation events varied greatly each year. Multiple victims were often involved. About two-thirds of the incidents and three-fourths of the fatalities occurred in the ocean or at a bar to the ocean. Crab boats were the most common type of boat involved.23introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Chapter 3: Occupational injuries 24Nonfatal work-related injuries The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that in 2005 there were 1.2 million injuries and illnesses that required days away from work resulting in a rate of 1,357 per 100,000 full-time workers. In Oregon, the number of nonfatal cases involving days away from work was 19,100, resulting in a rate of 1,700 per 100,000 full-time workers. Both the number of accepted disabling claims and the claims rate per 100,000 workers have generally been decreasing in Oregon over the past five years (see Figure 3-1). Reviewing only the BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) data to estimate Oregon's extent of occupational injuries and illnesses does not present a complete picture. For example, the SOII excludes public sector, self-employed and household workers as well as workers on farms with less than 11 employees.

MSDs do not include injuries caused by slips, strips, falls, motor vehicle accidents, etc. The definition of an MSD includes a sprain, strain or tear; back or other pain or soreness; carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS); and hernia. MSDs also include musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases and disorders when the event or exposure is from bending, climbing, crawling, reaching, twisting, overexertion or repetitive motion. 1 Workplace risk factors for MSDs include repetitive forceful motions, awkward postures, use of vibrating tools or equipment, and manual handling of heavy or awkward loads. Although MSDs can be caused by a single traumatic event, wear and tear over time can also contribute to these conditions. 2 MSDs are more severe than the average nonfatal injury or illness case and cause people to miss more days of work. For example, the median days away from work for an MSD case in 2006 was nine days compared to seven days for all other nonfatal injury and illness cases. 3 MSDs can significantly affect the quality of life for workers both on and off the job, and they are among the most costly work-related health problems. Certain industries and occupations are at higher risk for MSDs. In 2006, the trade, transportation and utilities sector had 34 percent of all MSD cases. The education and health services categories were next with 20 percent, the vast majority of which were health care and social assistance. For occupations, the highest rate of MSDs were found in the nursing aides, orderlies and attendants category (293 per 10,000), followed by laborers and freight handlers (158 per 10,000). T ruck drivers had the highest median days away from work (14 days). 329introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Figure 3-4 illustrates the estimated rate of work-related MSDs in Oregon that result in days away from work, based on BLS data.

Data for 2005 through 2006 is not available for these parts of the body. Source: BLS, SOII Although this annual survey data is a valuable source of information, there are major limitations. For example, it excludes public sector, self-employed and household workers, and workers on farms with fewer than 11 employees. Together these categories may account for 21 percent of the U.S. work force. 4 Thus, it is imperative to supplement BLS data with other sources, such as workers' compensation claims data. 0100200300400 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 YearRate per 100,000 full-time workersNeck, shoulder and upper extremities Carpal tunnel syndrome BackFigure 3-4. Rates of selected work-related musculoskeletal disorders involving days away from work reported by private-sector employers, Oregon, 2000-200630CTS is named after the eight bones in the wrist, called carpals that form a tunnel-like structure. The tunnel is filled with tendons and nerves that control finger movement and hand sensation. When the wrist is used repeatedly for the same task, the protective coverings that surround the tendons may swell and thicken over time. The swollen tendon coverings put pressure on nerves leading to CTS. 1 One symptom of CTS is painful tingling in the affected hand during the night, often painful enough to disturb sleep; another symptom is a feeling of uselessness in the fingers, sometimes described as feeling swollen when no swelling is apparent. 4 CTS cases have a higher burden of lost workdays than other types of injury claims. BLS reports 45 percent of CTS cases experience greater than 30 days away from work associated with their injuries. 5 Figure 3-5 shows the rates of CTS claims from the 2000-2005 Oregon workers' compensation system data.

Burns, which have the potential to do serious damage, are the most expensive work-related injuries to treat. Thermal (heat) and chemical burns are the most frequent types associated with work. 1 In 2004, more than 100,000 persons were treated for nonfatal occupational burns in hospital emergency departments.2 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a median of five missed days from work due to nonfatal occupational heat burns in 2005. 3 Hospitalizations for work-related burns (using a primary payer code of workers' compensation on hospital discharge records) are good indicators of work-relatedness. Figure 3-6 presents the number and rate of work-related burn hospitalizations in Oregon between 2001 and 2006. The number and rate have generally decreased over the time period, although there was a slight increase between 2003 and 2005. Figure 3-6.

Effects of lead include anemia, nervous system dysfunction (neuropathy), kidney dysfunction (nephropathy) and fertility problems. A BLL is the best biological measure of recent exposure to lead. In 2005, 37 states reported approximately 8,900 adults with BLLs greater than or equal to 25 g/dL. This corresponds to a national prevalence rate of 7.2 per 100,000 workers. In Oregon in 2005, 58 adult residents had BLLs greater than or equal to 25 g/dL (or a prevalence rate of 3.3 per 100,000 workers). Ten adult residents had BLLs greater than or equal to 40 g/dL (or a prevalence rate of 0.6 per 100,000 workers) (see Figure 4-1). 7.2 3.3 1.2 0.6 02468 United States Oregon 2005Rate per 100,000 workersPrevalence (all cases) rate BLL 25 /uni03BCg/dL Prevalence (all cases) rate BLL 40 /uni03BCg/dLFigure 4-1.

Industries where workers could be exposed to lead include battery manufacturing, nonferrous foundries, radiator repair shops, lead smelters, construction, demolition and firing ranges. In Oregon, construction and extraction professions are projected to grow by more than 17 percent in the next 10 years. 2 Lead taken home from the workplace also can harm children and other adults living in the home. Lead exposures can occur in hobbies such as making pottery and stained glass, casting ammunition and fishing weights, and renovating and remodeling projects.012345 2002 2003 2004 2005 OregonRate per 100,000 workersPrevalence (all cases) rate BLL 25 /uni03BCg/dL Prevalence (all cases) rate BLL 40 /uni03BCg/dLFigure 4-2.

In the United States, approximately one billion pounds of pesticide-active ingredients are used annually, and more than 16,000 pesticide products are available. 2 The EPA estimates that 10,000 to 20,000 physician-diagnosed pesticide poisonings occur each year among the approximately 3,380,000 U.S. agricultural workers. Agricultural workers, groundskeepers, pet groomers, fumigators and a variety of other workers are at risk for exposure to pesticides including fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides and sanitizers. Also at risk are workers who only occasionally use or are around pesticides and who, therefore, may not be trained in pesticide safety. Surveillance for occupational pesticide-related illness is designed to protect workers by determining the magnitude and underlying causes of overexposure to pesticides in the workplace. Surveillance also serves as an early warning system of any harmful effects not detected by manufacturer pesticide testing. 3 Figure 4-3 shows the rate of work-related pesticide poisoning cases in Oregon between 2000 and 2005. 42References 1 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

WRA is asthma-caused or exacerbated by workplace exposures. It may be related to airway obstruction associated with workplace exposure. 2 The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that at least 11 million workers in a wide range of industries and occupations are exposed to at least one agent known to be associated with WRA. 3 Population-based studies estimate that more than one of seven adults with asthma have that condition due to their work.4 Four states that conducted surveillance for WRA (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey) between 1993 and 1999 reported that the most common types of agents responsible were miscellaneous chemicals not easily classified (e.g., perfumes, odors, glues) at approximately 20 percent. The next most common group was cleaning materials (11.6 percent), followed by mineral and inorganic dust (11.1 percent) and indoor air pollutants (9.9 percent). 2 There are more than 250 substances known or believed to cause or exacerbate WRA, and the list evolves as knowledge increases. 45introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes The following table, adapted from the New York State Department of Health, lists agents responsible for WRA, sorted by which workers might be at risk: Workers at risk Agents Animal handlers Animal urine, dander Bakers Enzymes, flour/grain dust/mites Carpenters Acrylate, amines, diisocyanate, epoxy resins, wood dusts Cleaners/janitors Cleaning materials, dusts, molds Daycare providers Cleaning materials, dusts, latex (natural), molds Electronic workers Amines, colophony, metals, soldering flux Farmers Animal urine, dander, grain dusts, mites, insects Hairdressers Henna, persulfate Health care workers Formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, latex, methyldopa, penicillins, psyllium Laboratory workers Animal urine, dander, feathers, enzymes, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, insects, latex Machinists/tool setters Metal working fluids, oil mists Office workers Cleaning materials, dusts, molds Pharmaceutical workers Cephalosporins, pancreatin, papain, diisocyanates Sawmill workers Wood dusts Seafood processors Crabs, prawns Teachers Cleaning materials, dusts, molds Textile workers Dyes, gums Welders Welding fumes46According to data from the Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), adult asthma prevalence in Oregon increased from 7.3 percent in 1999 to 9.9 percent in 2005. 5 In a call-back survey of adults with asthma, 52.8 percent of those reporting current asthma said their asthma was caused or aggravated by any job they ever had (95 percent CI 47.5-58.0). Further, 13.5 percent (95 percent CI 10.5-16.6) of those reporting current asthma said they either told or were told by their health care providers that their asthma was related to their work. Table 5-1 shows that among call-back participants who were ever diagnosed with asthma, those with WRA were more likely to have had their usual activities limited in the past 12 months as compared to those with asthma not related to work.

Common types of these diseases include asbestosis, coal workers' pneumoconiosis (black lung) and silicosis. Pneumoconioses are usually due to long-term inhalation exposure to mineral dust and often have a long latency period between exposure and disease manifestation. Thus they are often diagnosed in older adults (mainly males) long after the period of exposure has occurred. Pneumoconiosis deaths have declined in the United States over the years. In 1972 there were more than 5,400 deaths, but by 1999 this number had dropped to 2,475. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis was the most frequent type of death between 1968 and 1999, but was replaced by asbestosis in 1998 and 1999. 1 From 1993 to 2002, the annual U.S. death rate (adjusted for age) for all pneumoconioses was 14.0 per million residents older than 15 years of age. Asbestosis mortality rates, unlike other kinds of pneumoconiosis rates, have actually increased. In 1994, the U.S. age-adjusted death rate for asbestosis was 1.71 per million residents; in 2005, it was 2.28 per million residents. 2 It is likely that pneumoconioses are undercounted on death certificates because they are not always recognized by health care providers; they have a long latency period that possibly causes individuals with pneumoconiosis to die of other diseases, and they result in nonspecific symptoms. 3 We can use various methods to examine the epidemiology of pneumoconioses in Oregon. One way is to review the annual hospitalization rate due to these conditions. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations from or with any type of pneumoconiosis has shown some inter-year variation, but has hovered between 72 and 80 hospitalizations per million Oregon residents between 2000 and 2005 (see Figure 5-1).49introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Source: Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems (OAHHS) hospital discharge index (HDI); U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Population Survey (CPS)Figure 5-1.

Exposure to asbestos is the leading cause of this highly fatal cancer. 1 Prior exposure to asbestos, usually from the workplace, has been reported in 62 to 85 percent of all mesothelioma cases. 2 Asbestos is a generic name given to a fibrous variety of minerals that possess flexibility, resistance to degradation, electrical resistance and high tensile strength. These qualities made asbestos useful for a variety of products, such as insulation and fireproofing material, automotive brakes, and cement and wallboard materials. However, asbestos minerals separate into microscopic-size particles that, when inhaled, can cause life-threatening diseases, including MM. Although the use of asbestos-containing products has markedly decreased, these minerals are still found in many residential or commercial settings and can pose health problems to workers and others. 3 The Oregon State Cancer Registry collects data on newly diagnosed cancer cases. Figure 5-3 illustrates Oregon's incidence rates of malignant mesothelioma between 2000 and 2006. All rates are age-adjusted for the 2000 U.S. Census standard population; this is an important consideration because MM has a long latency period between exposure and disease onset. Thus, 20 to 40 years can pass between exposure to asbestos and diagnosis of the disease.53introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Source: OSCaR References 1 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 2004.

There are many definitions of \"young\" worker. For this profile Oregon looked at workers 17 years of age and younger. Young workers are at increased risk of illness or injury when they perform tasks outside of their usual training or work assignments. Also, young workers may lack necessary experience, training or supervision and may not be familiar with work requirements, safe work practices and safe operating procedures. Furthermore, rapid growth and development makes them more likely to be harmed by exposure to hazardous substances. 1 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health estimates that 2.4 million 16- to 17-year-old youth had jobs in 2006. 2 In Oregon there were approximately 32,000 workers 16 to 17 years of age for the same year. Both numbers likely underestimate the true number of working youth since some youth work but are not recorded on payroll. Figure 6-1 presents the percent distribution of workers younger than 17 years of age in the United States and Oregon for the time period 2000 to 2006. 57introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Population Survey (CPS) For 2006, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a total of 5,840 fatalities in the United States due to occupational injuries; of these, 21 occurred in workers younger than 17 years of age for a fatality rate of 0.9 deaths per 100,000 workers. 2 For comparison, 18- to 19-year-olds suffered 106 fatalities in 2006, for a fatality rate of 2.8 deaths per 100,000 workers.

The U.S. population aged 65 and older will represent 20 percent of the population by 2030, or twice their 2000 percentage. 1 As the U.S. population ages, so will its work force. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that there will be 1.2 million more workers 65 years and older in the work force in 2010 compared to 2001. 2 Oregon is a part of this trend toward an aging work force (Figure 6-4). BLS estimates that Oregon will experience a 16 to 25 percent increase in the number of older workers from 2000 to 2010. 2 With life expectancy of those born in the 21st century averaging 83 years, there are 18 years of life after the standard retirement age of 65. These almost two decades of life lead to many reasons why older adults remain in the work force. Some reasons may include changes to Social Security benefits and eligibility, a desire to stay active or a need to pay for living and medical expenses. The profile of injury and illness among older workers is unique. Data show that older workers experience more severe illnesses and injuries while on the job than do their younger counterparts (measured in days away from work) even if the nature and event of the incidents are the same. 3 In 2003, workers 65 and older needed a median of 18 days away from work after a workplace illness or injury compared to eight days for all workers combined. 3 Older workers also have a higher incidence of death than their younger counterparts. In 2006, the fatality rate for workers 65 and older was more than three times the rate of those 64 and younger with 11.2 deaths per 100,000 U.S. workers. 4 In 2004, fatality rates were elevated for 62workers aged 55 to 64 and were even higher for workers aged 65 and older in Oregon. Senior workers comprised approximately 3.7 percent of the labor force in Oregon in 2006 (see Figure 6-4), but comprised 20 percent of all occupational fatalities in 2004 (12 of 61). 5 Oregon workers' compensation data on older workersIn 2006, Oregon workers 65 years of age and older accounted for only 432, or 2 percent, of all accepted disabling workers' compensation claims. Older workers were more likely to be in the service industries, which include businesses such as hotels and motels as well as personal, business, health and legal services (see Figure 6-5). Workers 11 to 64 years of age predominated in the construction industry while the two age groups were relatively proportioned across the remaining industries (Standard Industrial Classification, 1987).

In Oregon, the 2006 female labor force participation rate was approximately 58.7 percent (see Figure 6-7). In 1976, Oregon women accounted for only 20 percent of all workers' compensation claims; by 1996, this number had risen to 32 percent. In 2006, women had approximately 33 percent of accepted disabling claims.**Figure 6-7.

Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) system, a state-based program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), began in 1987 in four states. By 2004, 37 states were participating in the system. Surveillance of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) provides a method to identify industries and occupations where workers are at high risk for exposure to lead. States participating in ABLES require that clinical laboratories report BLL results to a state agency. The lowest BLL to be reported varies from state to state. Laboratory reports include basic demographic information. States use unique identifiers to differentiate between new and existing cases and to account for multiple reports for the same person. In some ABLES states, physicians also are required to report adults with elevated BLLs. Most states follow up reports of elevated BLLs to determine the sources of lead exposure, including the names of employers and additional information about the exposed individuals. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that lead be measured clinically in workers exposed to airborne lead exceeding a certain level. In addition, because laboratories generally comply with the reporting requirement, ABLES programs are believed to identify a substantial portion of lead-exposed workers. However, they do not capture lead-exposed individuals whose employers are not in compliance with the biological monitoring requirements, or individuals tested by laboratories that are not compliant with the reporting requirement.83introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Cancer registries Data on cancer incidence are centralized in registries in all but five states in the United States. The sources of these data include hospitals, physician offices, surgery centers, laboratories and death certificates. Legislation usually requires the reporting of all in situ or malignant neoplasms, but there is some slight variation in reportable cases by state. The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) has developed standards for the operation of registries (e.g., data definitions, data transmission methodologies and quality assurance); some state cancer registries do not yet meet all NAACCR standards for data competencies and quality. Diagnoses are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Census of Fatal Occupational I\u0003 njuries The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) is part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' occupational safety and health statistics program and provides the most complete count of fatal work injuries. CFOI is a federal program that compiles counts of all fatal work injuries occurring in the United States each calendar year. For a fatality to be included in the census, the decedent must have been employed at the time of the event, engaged in a legal work activity or present at the site of the incident as a requirement of his or her job. CFOI tracks all fatal occupational injuries that occur within each state's boundaries, regardless of the worker's state of employment. CFOI also includes data for all fatal work injuries whether the decedent was working in a job covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other federal or state agency, or was outside the scope of regulatory coverage. 84In addition, CFOI counts include workers not subject to OWC, thus any reported numbers among the different agencies that track occupational fatalities will vary. Oregon's CFOI data are comparable to the federal data found on the BLS Web site: www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm. Due to the difficulty in verifying such deaths, fatalities resulting from occupational illnesses are generally not included in the CFOI statistics. County Business Patterns The U.S. Census Bureau annually produces a County Business Patterns (CBP) series, which provides national economic data by industry. CBP data represents the number of employees working in the primary industry of an establishment, regardless of the individuals' occupations within that establishment. CBP data include the total number of establishments, mid-March employment, first quarter and annual payroll, and number of establishments by nine employment-size classes for all counties in the United States and the District of Columbia. CBP data is extracted from the Business Register, the U.S. Census Bureau's file of all known single and multi-establishment companies. The Annual Company Organization Survey and Economic Censuses, which are conducted every five years, provide individual establishment data for multi-location firms. Data for single-location firms are obtained from various programs conducted by the Census Bureau, such as the economic censuses, the Annual Survey of Manufacturers and Current Business Surveys, as well as from administrative records of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Data are obtained for all employees excluding self-employed individuals, employees of private households, railroad employees, agricultural production employees, and most government employees. CBP quantifies full- and part-time employees who are on the payroll in the pay period including March 12. Since 1998, data have been tabulated by industry as defined in the North 85introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes American Industry Classification System: United States, 1997 (NAICS). Data for 1997 and earlier years are based on the standard industrial classification (SIC) system. Current Population Survey The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households representing the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States. It is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPS determines demographics, employment status, weekly hours worked, and industry and occupation of each household member 15 years of age and older. The inquiry relates to activity or status during the calendar week that includes the 12th day of the month. Among the ways BLS makes the survey data available are through the Geographic Profile of Employment and Unemployment annual report and a data analysis program, DataFerrett, that users can download from the Internet. The occupational and industrial classifications of CPS data for 1992 thr ough 2002 were based on the coding systems used in the 1990 Census. Since then, the CPS has changed its coding systems for occupation and industry. More information can be found at www.census.gov. The CPS undercounts certain racial/ethnic workers who have no permanent address or are migratory in nature. Because CPS estimates are based on a survey rather than a complete census of the population, they are subject to sampling error. Death certificates Funeral directors, attending physicians and medical examiners or coroners are usually responsible for the personal and medical information recorded on death certificates. Local registrars assure that all deaths in their jurisdictions are registered and that required information is documented before sending certificates to the state registrar. State registrars number and file the death certificates and forward nonresidents' certificates to the appropriate state. 86All states send death certificate data to the National Vital Statistics System, managed by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.The cause-of-death section on the certificate, which is similar in all states, contains the immediate, contributing and underlying causes of death. Since 1999, these causes have been coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision format. For injury deaths, all state death certificates include a query about whether the incident occurred at work. Hospital discharge data Patient demographics, diagnoses and billing information are contained within hospital medical records. Upon patient discharge from a hospital, these data are computerized using standard formats. Diagnoses are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases system, currently ICD-9-CM.38. Pneumoconioses are considered, by definition, work-related diseases. Most acute-care hospitals participate in mandatory or voluntary systems for compiling discharge data at the state level. While there is no specific query regarding the work-relatedness of any other illnesses or injuries, a useful indicator for work-related injury is workers' compensation insurance as the payer. Hospital discharge data have several limitations for providing information on occupational health. Personal identifiers are not available in most states' data sets, thus repeat hospitalizations of the same individual cannot be readily identified. The ICD classification system by itself can be used to identify only one class of work-related illnesses: pneumoconiosis. Workers' compensation as the payer source is more sensitive to identifying injuries than illnesses. Due to the non-specificity of many occupational diseases or the long latency between exposure and onset of overt disease, illnesses are much harder to associate with a work condition. Discharge data generally do not include hospitalizations of residents previously hospitalized in another state. 87introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes Federal military and veterans hospitals are not included in most state hospital discharge data sets. Oregon's workers' compensation system Oregon law mandates that employers within the state have workers' compensation (WC) for their employees (Oregon Revised Statutes, Chapter 656). Employers can choose one of three options for workers' compensation insurance: self-insurance, insurance through a private company, or insurance through the state fund (now known as SAIF Corporation). Not all Oregon employees are required to have WC coverage (e.g., sole proprietors, private residence workers), nor are all workers captured in the WC system (e.g., federal workers and maritime workers are excluded). Non-disabling claims (also known as medical only) are not required to be reported to the Workers' Compensation Division. WC definitions are: Disabling - Resulting in three or more days lost and/or a change in work duties, hospitalization or likely hospitalization;Non-disabling - Workers' compensation claims not associated with three or more days of lost time or with change in work duties (same as medical only). Poison control centersPoison control centers (PCCs) are available nationwide to provide assistance 24 hours a day to callers with concerns about actual or potential exposure to substances. Most PCCs track calls and manage case information electronically using ToxiCall. Centers submit data on a real-time basis to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) for inclusion in their Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS). In 2002, 64 PCCs representing 99.8 percent of the nation's population submitted data to the AAPCC. PCCs categorize inquiries as human or animal exposures, or non-exposures and information-only. For nearly half of human exposure calls, PCCs follow up to provide further guidance, confirm compliance with recommendations, and 88gather outcome data. The types of information gathered by PCCs include demographics, type of substance(s) involved, symptoms, intentionality of exposure, whether the exposure was work-related, location of exposure (e.g., workplace), and medical outcome. PCCs do not systematically collect information on industry and occupation. Centers such as the Oregon Poison Center (OPC) that use ToxiCall can generate nearly 100 standard reports or create ad hoc reports to meet more specific needs. A significant limitation of PCC data for occupational surveillance is that it is a passive system; i.e., it relies on cases to be reported. To report a case, the poisoned individual or a health care worker has to know about the existence of a PCC, consider it a source of assistance for addressing a work-related illness, and know how to contact the PCC. Because of the passive surveillance system design, it is likely that PCC data underestimate the true extent of work-related chemical exposures. Furthermore, health care workers with more experience in managing work-related poisoning may be less likely to use PCCs. Thus, under-reporting may vary by state to some degree according to the experience and expertise of health care workers. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) \u2014 previously known as the Covered Employment and Wages or the ES-202 program \u2014 is a near-census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information. Employment data represent the number of workers covered by state unemployment insurance laws who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period including the 12th of the month. Excluded from the QCEW are those in the military, the self-employed, proprietors as well as domestic, unpaid family and railroad workers. QCEW data provide figures that represent where individuals work, not where they live. At the national level, QCEW publishes employment and wage data for nearly every North 89introduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notesintroduction & executive summary work force characteristics occupational fatalities occupational injuries toxic exposures occupational diseases special populations tables & figures acronyms technical notes American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry. At the state, county and metropolitan levels, it publishes these data down to the six-digit NAICS industry level, assuming that confidentiality can be maintained. QCEW publishes a subset of its quarterly data through an online data query system and full quarterly industry detail data in ASCII format at all geographic levels. Survey of Occupational I\u0003 njuries and I\u0003 llnesses The national Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the U.S. Department of Labor, provides annual estimates of the numbers and incidence rates of work-related injuries and illnesses among private-sector workers. Information is collected through an annual survey mailed to a stratified random sample of establishments. Employers are asked to provide information on all work-related injuries and illnesses recorded as required under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) record-keeping standard 29 CFR 1904. Recordable injuries and illnesses include those that result in loss of consciousness, one or more days away from work to recuperate, restricted work activity, transfer to another job, or medical treatment beyond simple first aid. More detailed information on worker demographics and the nature and circumstances of the injuries and illnesses is collected for cases resulting in days away from work. The annual survey also collects data on the average number of workers employed and the total hours worked at each establishment, which allows BLS to calculate rates. Since 1996, the survey sample has included approximately 180,000 private sector establishments nationwide. The self-employed, farms with fewer than 11 employees, private households, federal agencies and the military are not covered in the survey. In states that do not participate or choose not to collect public sector data, the survey also does not cover state and municipal 90employees. In addition, it is well recognized that the survey undercounts work-related illnesses, especially long-latency illnesses that may not appear until years after individuals have left their places of employment. There is also some evidence that work-related injuries are underreported.Oregon Department of Human Services Public Health Division Office of Environmental Public Health Occupational Public Health Program 800 N.E.
