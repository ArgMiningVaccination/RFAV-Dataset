Poplar Street Suite A Rogers, AR 72756 Rogers, ajones@artsk12.org School Website : www.artsk12.org About This Handbook AAA administrators, teachers, students, and parents/guardians work on a regular basis to ensure the AAA District Handbook and Code of Conduct contains relevant and up-to-date information for our School Board members to review and approve for the benefit of our AAA families. The purpose of this handbook is to serve as a meaningful reference for our families in regards to life as a student at AAA. The handbook is divided into four parts: 1.) The introduction includes our mission and philosophy statements as well as our ARTS Pledge. 2.) The second section consists of information on how to apply for admission and if selected, how to enroll. 3.) Policies and procedures, State and Federal laws and regulations, and the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE) requirements including: enrollment and compulsory attendance requirements, absence and attendance policies, behavior standards and discipline procedures, dress code, computer-use guidelines, homework and late work policies, wellness and parental involvement plans make up the third section. 4.) The final section is made up of resource and reference materials, including a staff directory and glossary of terms used in the handbook. Upon enrollment and/or at the start of each academic year, AAA students and parents/guardians are provided with a digital copy of the handbook, as well as the opportunity to participate in informational discussions regarding its contents. Paper copies of the handbook are available upon request. All students and parents/guardians will sign the ARTS Pledge which serves as receipt of copy of the handbook and an agreement to abide by the AAA policies and procedures as well as the state and federal laws and regulations that support the ARTS Pledge. Copies of the handbook are available in the central office of each campus and online at artsk12.org.

If you have not had the chance to already, please visit and take a tour of our High School and/or Elementary School campuses to see all the many reasons We ART Proud! Mission Statement : We believe that an arts-based approach to learning promotes creative expression and an enhanced academic experience. Our mission is to provide a rigorous academic program with a purposeful integration of the arts. Arkansas Arts Academy is the ultimate choice for excellence in arts and academics. Aspire! Achieve! Advance! Academic Excellence : Arkansas Arts Academy provides an academically rigorous and innovative curriculum with personalized student learning environments that result in college and career-ready students. AAA has high standards and expectations for all students. Students are challenged to learn in a collaborative environment. Students must demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills and strategies. Student use of 1:1 technology is integrated for all learning. Teachers use data from formative and summative assessments to better determine how to help students learn. Students are expected to demonstrate academic proficiency or excellence through school, state, and national assessments. Students will become lifelong advocates of the arts through their intensive arts engagement. Arts Integration: Arkansas Arts Academy embraces a revolutionary education approach that manifests a unique philosophy centered on arts integration. By offering a rigorous academic curriculum alongside a purposeful integration of the arts, AAA challenges our students to excel academically as well as experience a multitude of creative, artistic fields that will afford students the opportunity to find their passion and drink deeply of innate pursuits. Academics and arts complement each other to improve learning for students. AAA teachers are encouraged to collaborate with one another which gives depth and greater meaning to daily teaching objectives - all of which serves to create an enriching, challenging, and pleasurable academic experience for each of our students. To learn more about our Arts Integration, visit the Walton Foundation website at: http://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/stories/leveraging-the-arts-for-deeper-learnin g. Mastery of the Arts: Arkansas Arts Academy employs teachers in fine arts courses who are willing and able to help students master their chosen art form and understand what being a professional in that field looks like. In addition to hiring an outstanding faculty, we regularly engage professional artists to give special performances and master classes. These events broaden our students' experience of different art forms. Art courses currently taught at AAA include: choral music, dance, theatre, audio production, guitar, bass, percussion, orchestra, animation, piano, 2D art including drawing, design, and painting, 3D art including ceramics and sculpture, culinary arts, and creative writing. Museum Initiative: The Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art is one of AAA's greatest supporters and champions not only by offering world-class learning opportunities for our students, but also by being a source of inspiration for our teachers to integrate disciplines such as the visual arts and art history into the lessons plans of academic core subjects. Our list of museum partners has grown to include: the Museum of Native American History, the Shiloh Museum, Pea Ridge National Battlefield, Compton Gardens, the Amazeum, Peel Mansion, the Rogers Historical Museum, and the Walmart Museum. We also work with the Community Creative Center, Trike Theatre, A+ Arkansas, AAIMS, and the New Design School to enrich our students' education and provide professional development in best practices for our teachers. Our Art School Is: A place that: Allows you to express your art, whatever it is, and teaches you how to improve it. Stresses academics in preparation for college. Teaches you to appreciate the arts. Teaches you to appreciate others. Teaches you respect. Teaches you compassion. Holds you to a high standard. Allows you to shine in your own individual way. Allows you to fit in (there is a place here for everyone). Gives you a venue to perform. Our Art School Is Not : A place to: S tay in the shadows. Escape the pressure of accountability. Coast through school. Not participate in the arts (after all, we are an Arts Academy). Sit back and watch the action. You will be expected to be in the middle of it. Take the bare minimum classes. We require more core classes than some public schools. We teach organizational skills and how to succeed in life. We don't just teach students to be artists, we teach them to be good citizens. We teach the appreciation of the arts. We teach people. We love what we do, and it shows. A.R.T.S Pledge : I pledge to be a scholar of the ARTS by being an: Authentic & adventurous artist, Respectful & responsible representative, Talented & tenacious team-player, and Self-disciplined & smART student! The ARTS Pledge is built upon four character trait statements that all AAA students aspire to become, and each of the statements has a guiding principle or code which is supported by School Board approved policies and procedures as well as State and Federal laws and regulations. By signing the ARTS Pledge , students and their families promise to be key participants on AAA's mission to Aspire! Achieve! Advance! in arts integration, mastery of the arts, and academic excellence! Authentic and adventurous artist among artists who succeeds by actively engaging in learning opportunities for myself and fellow artists and by valuing our intrinsic worth and our right to an excellent education. Code of Conduct: is a pledge to follow rules that remind everyone in the AAA family to conduct ourselves in a dignified manner. The Code of Conduct is made up of classroom rules which, even when they vary among teachers, are clear and direct behavior expectations such as: respect teachers, students and their property, help maintain a clean and safe campus, partake in privileges only as allowed by the teacher, encourage discussions not disruptions, use language and materials that elevate instead of profanity and lewd materials that discriminate, show affection with platonic hugs or by holding hands rather than engaging in inappropriate public displays of affection (PDA), and to dress and present yourself appropriately. Respectful and responsible representative of myself, my family, and my school who follows school and societal rules and grows as an active and engaged citizen. Code of Citizenship: is a pledge to continue learning how to make good decisions so I may become a responsible citizen and productive member of society, specifically by understanding the reason for each of the policies and procedures in our handbook and why it is in my best interest to abide by them. I will actively help keep our school free from discriminatory, dangerous, potentially harmful, and life-threatening behaviors. I will learn the procedures involved in reporting inappropriate, illegal, or destructive behaviors so I may be of help to others, and if I should ever be found to be in violation of any policy or procedure, I will be forthright and accountable in completing my assigned consequence. Talented & tenacious team-player committed to my personal, artistic, and academic goals and those of my peers as we journey together discovering our talents. Code of Ethics: is a pledge to act with integrity and make positive choices for my present and future self by following Safe Campus Procedures, to make educated decisions in regards to my health by following the Nutrition, Wellness and Medication Administration Procedures, and to take extra care with policies that are not rights but privileges such as the Internet Policy, Cell Phone/Computer Policy, Vehicle Use Policy, eating lunch with friends, participating in extracurricular activities, and attending after school events and competitions on our campus or while visiting other schools. This is not an all inclusive list of privileges, only examples. Self-disciplined and smART student actively achieving the highest standards of scholarship & moral excellence.

I pledge to be honest in my academic pursuits, including homework, tests and projects by not cheating or allowing anyone to cheat off of me, and by properly citing and giving credit to the ideas and writings of others. I pledge to be a student of integrity and to never lie or bear false witness so that others may always count on me as a trustworthy and upstanding individual. I also pledge to be honest with myself and others by seeking assistance from teachers, peer mentors, and my family when I need it, and to listen to the school counselors' advice regarding higher education opportunities. Application and Admissions Arkansas Arts Academy is an open enrollment public charter school; it is not a private school and no tuition fees are charged. Any student who is a legal resident of Arkansas is eligible to apply for admission. Enrollment is limited by our charter and a lottery process is necessary to ensure fairness to all potential students. Lottery Forms Students who are interested in attending AAA must first submit an application and receive an official Notice of Acceptance before enrolling. Application for Admittance forms are available at the AAA High School Registrar's office, the AAA Elementary School main office, the AAA District Administration office, and online at www.artsk12.org . Applications may be submitted as indicated on the form and are valid for one school year. Selection If more students apply for admission than AAA has available enrollment capacity, a lottery-style method in which student names are chosen randomly is used to accept students as openings in each grade level become available. After students apply and receive admission, students are ready to officially enroll as AAA students. Notification Students chosen by lottery are notified immediately regarding their acceptance via the preferred communication method(s) selected on the Application Form. If admission occurs mid-school year, the parents/guardians attend a scheduled Enrollment Conference to complete the enrollment process at their earliest convenience. Families that fail to accept the offered position or to complete the enrollment process within the allowed time will be moved to the bottom of the waiting list and the position will be offered to the next available student. If additional applications for admission are completed after the lottery process, the prospective students' names are placed on the appropriate AAA wait list for one calendar year. Lottery/Request for Admission typically begin anew each school year in early spring. Therefore, students' applications must be renewed each year for possible selection in the annual lottery. Reference Admission Policies for open-enrollment charter schools established by Act 993 of 2011; implemented 2011-2012; approved 2017- 2018. Admission and Enrollment Requirements 1. Be a legal resident of Arkansas. The student, parent, guardian, or other responsible person (hereinafter parent/guardian) must be a legal resident of Arkansas. A legal resident is defined as a student who maintains permanent residency four (4) or more days/nights a week in Arkansas and does not do so only to establish residency for school attendance. 2. Provide a social security number. Parent/guardian is to provide a social security number for each student or may request the school to assign the student a nine (9) digit number from the AR Department of Education (ADE). 3. Show proof of student age with one (1) of the following: birth certificate, statement from registrar or county recorder certifying child's date of birth, attested baptismal certificate, passport, affidavit of date and place of birth by child's parent/guardian, military identification, or previous school records. 4. Disclose expulsion history. When completing registration documents, parents are to disclose whether or not the student has ever been expelled from school or party to an expulsion proceeding. If this information is not disclosed and it is discovered that a student was expelled from another school, the student may be immediately dismissed from AAA. 5. Provide proof of immunization or ASDH exemption. Parent/guardian is to provide a certificate from a licensed physician or a public health department acknowledging the student is age-appropriately immunized or if for medical, religious or philosophical reasons, the student does not have proper immunization paperwork, parent/guardian must provide annual exemption certificates issued by the AR State Department of Health. More information may be found in the following Immunization Chart and contact information for the Arkansas Department of Health may be found in the Quick Reference List under ADH, Division of Student Procedures AAA welcomes foreign exchange students (FES) to our campus as we believe our students gain knowledge from having the opportunity to learn about other countries, cultures and customs. AAA has adopted the following guidelines in an effort to ensure the organization and FES understand AAA expectations and requirements: FES: Requirements: Be of school-age (may not have graduated or completed course of study in home country), be referred by an approved agency, provide a current academic transcript in English, be able to read and write fluently in English, and agree to attend a full academic school year at AAA while living with an agency-appointed host family. FES: Approved Agencies: AAA accepts FES only from agencies included on the \"Advisory List\" published by the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel. A maximum of four (4) students will be accepted by AAA each academic school year; a maximum of three (3) from any one (1) agency. FES Credits & Eligibility: FES will be granted a Certificate of Attendance but will not be included in any class ranking lists nor shall a GPA be computed for the student. FES will not be eligible for special programs such as special education services or section 504 accommodations. For more information on how to host a FES, contact the AAA school counselor (see AAA Directory). Transfer Students Grade Placement If a student transfers from a school accredited by the ADE, they will be placed in the same grade-level as they were in the former school. If transferring from another type of school, AAA reviews evidence-based data prior to placing a student in a specific grade, including transcript(s) from former school(s), chronological age (a consideration but not a primary factor), Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), and assessment scores from tests such as the Iowa Test of Educational Development (ITED), Benchmark Exams, and ACT/ACT Aspire. Once a student reaches 9th grade, grade placement is based on the number of credits earned. A sophomore has earned no fewer than six credits, a junior has earned no fewer than twelve credits, a senior has earned no fewer than eighteen, and a graduate has earned all 24 required credits. Each student has the opportunity to earn up to 8 each academic year. SPOT Committee For students transferring in from places other than accredited public schools, the Student Placement of Transfers (SPOT) Committee, led by the principal and comprised of qualified teachers, staff members, and parents, reviews all academic data available in order to make the best and most appropriate grade-level placements. Credits & Grades If listed in the AAA or ADE Core Curriculum, a course may transfer with its letter grade; however, if the course is not listed, it may transfer as credit only or \"pass/no credit\" grade. All students are required to meet the AAA HS graduation requirements. Initial Progress Reports Transfer-in students receive a progress report based on work completed only if they enroll and then attend class for four (4) consecutive weeks which is half of a nine (9) week grading period. If transfer-in students attend AAA for less than four (4) weeks, no progress report is given. If students enter during second or fourth 9-weeks period and attend for four (4) or more weeks, the grade given is based on work completed and will therefore be for only that 9-week period not the semester. AAA must receive a transfer-in grade for the first or third 9-week period in order for students to be given a semester grade. Appeal Process If questions arise regarding credits/grades placement for any student transferring in, the parent/guardian will meet with the principal who will review the reasons for student credit/grade transferred and/or grade placement. Parents/guardians who disagree with the principal's decision may appeal to the AAA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who consults with a qualified placement team before rendering a final decision in writing to the parents/guardians. Legal reference: ACA 6-15-503; Approved 10/4/2011; Effective 10/5/2011 Immunization Schedule Arkansas Act 871 of 1997 requires all K-12 students in the state of Arkansas to be in compliance or in the process of compliance with the following immunization schedule: DTaP Current students: minimum of three (3) doses with last dose on/after fourth birthday.

Eligible students' enrollment and attendance at a post-secondary institution will count toward the required weekly time of school attendance. Each credit hour shall count as three (3) hours of attendance time. This means a three (3) hour course will count as nine (9) hours of weekly, required time of attendance. Excessive Absences Parents are notified by mail when their child has accumulated more than three (3) unexcused absences and by certified mail when their child has accumulated more than six (6) unexcused absences in a semester. Parents/guardians will be reminded that the student may be denied promotion or graduation for exceeding six (6) unexcused absences in a semester. The school may also file a Family In Need of Services (FINS) report with the Department of Human Services in cases of excessive unexcused absences.

Exception/Exemption Petition Parents/legal guardians of minor students and students who are eighteen (18) years of age may submit a Petition for Excessive Absences to the principal if they believe a special circumstance exists regarding the student accumulating more than six (6) unexcused, successive absences per semester. It is the responsibility of the parent/legal guardian, or adult student, to schedule a time to discuss the Petition for Special Circumstance Exception for Absences so they may explain the nature of the extenuating circumstance(s). The principal will review the nature of the situation, the student's attendance history in the past, as well as the student's current academic status before approving or denying the petition. Petition Approved: If the request is approved, documentation will be filed in the student's cumulative file, and the student will not be reported to the Benton County Department of Human Services (BCDHS) and Benton County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (BCPAO). Petition Denied: If the request is denied, the student will be reported to the BCDHS and the BCPAO for violating the Attendance Policy, and the documentation will be filed in the student's cumulative file. Parents/legal guardians or adult students may appeal the Principal's decision to the CEO by completing a written Appeal of Denial of Petition (ADP). The CEO will review the ADP and communicate to the parents/guardians the final and binding decision to the parents/legal guardians within seven (7) school days. Compulsory Attendance Panel Students who accumulate the equivalent of 10 total (excused or unexcused) absences per semester will be required to participate in a Compulsory Attendance Panel hearing to determine whether the student shall receive credit for the class in which they have missed the equivalent of 10 absences. The panel shall consist of members from the faculty, the school board, the school principal, and others as determined by the administration to be relevant to the case. Absence Procedures When a parent/guardian knows a student will be absent in advance of the actual absence, they are to call the Registrar's office and inform them of the upcoming absence. Alternatively, the student must bring a written statement from their parent/guardian and/or a doctor's note to the office or the parent must call or email the school within three days of having been absent. Parents will receive an automated phone call at the end of each day in which their student was reported absent in one or more periods. Excused Absences Absences that are excused are those where a student was on official school business or when the absence was due to one of the following reasons: an illness that could jeopardize the health of other students, a death or serious illness of someone in the immediate family who lives with the student, observance of recognized holidays observed by student's faith, attendance at government agency or medical appointment, exceptional circumstances with prior approval of the principal, absences granted to allow the student to visit a parent or guardian who is a member of the military and has been called to active duty, is on leave from active duty, or has returned from deployment to a combat zone or support posting. *Students who serve as pages for a member of the General Assembly will be considered on instructional assignment and will not be considered absent from school for the day the student is serving as a page. Unexcused Absences and Tardies The following reasons will not be considered excused absences or tardies: oversleeping, student not wanting to attend school or taking a skip day, and other absences not clearly defined as excused in the above section. Students are considered tardy if they arrive in the classroom after the scheduled time for class to begin. When students have missed more than 30 minutes of a class period, they will be reported as absent. Tardies and Admittance to Class Slips AAA Elementary School begins at 8:00 am and ends at 3:00 pm.

A second bus will pick up and drop off 7-12 students at Allen's grocery in Bella Vista, Orchard Park in Bentonville, and Lewis and Clark in Rogers. The third bus will pick up and drop off K-12 students at Toys R' Us in Fayetteville, the Jones Center in Springdale, and the Elm Springs Rd Walmart in Springdale. A time schedule for bus arrivals/departures is available on the website. The buses will be filled through electronic form submission on a first come first served basis. The K-6 bus has 77 available spots, the 7-12 bus has 51 available spots, and the K-12 bus has 47 available spots. Bus Rules and Policies In order to maintain a safe and orderly atmosphere on Arkansas Arts Academy buses, the following rules have been established and must be followed to retain bus riding privileges: 1) Follow directions the first time they are given. 2) Remain properly seated at ALL times. 3) Keep all body parts and objects to yourself and inside the bus. 4) No eating or drinking on the bus, except water. 5) Do not use profanity, rude language or gestures on the bus. 6) Bullying or mean behavior will not be tolerated. 7) All school handbook rules are to be followed. 8) Students must be picked up or dropped off on time at limited bus service stops.* *The bus will wait for 5 minutes for parents to arrive after which they will depart for the next stop. If a student is not picked up on time, they will remain on the bus and be taken back to the K-6 school campus. Parents will be required to pick their student up from the K-6 campus. If the bus has been missed in the morning, it is the responsibility of the parent to ensure the student arrives at school. Failure to utilize the bus for five consecutive days with no communication from parents will result in removal from the bus list. The school will attempt to contact the parent after the second consecutive day. The safety of students during their transportation to and from school is a responsibility which they and their parents share with the bus drivers and school officials. The Arkansas Arts Academy Board of Education wants students and parents to know what is expected of them when they wait for and ride on a school bus. Therefore, these transportation guidelines will be issued at the beginning of each school year and to newly enrolled students. Students and parents who fail to observe these guidelines will be subject to disciplinary action, which could include loss of privileges. The Arkansas Arts Academy will operate on a limited bus service schedule which is defined as making specific location stops in areas selected by the administration. The stop locations will be on the district website and will be included in the distributed transportation guidelines. In the event of an emergency or delay, the school will use the email addresses and cell phone numbers provided on this form to contact parents and guardians. Skate Boards and other Personal Transportation Skate boards must be dropped off in the office upon arrival to school and can be retrieved at the end of the school day. This also applies to roller blades and any other personal transportation devices. Bicycles should be secured on the provided bike rack on campus. Closed Campus Arkansas Arts Academy campuses are closed campuses. This means that students are not allowed to leave the campuses after they arrive for the school day unless they are checked out by a parent/guardian. Parents/guardians can check students out through the Elementary School main office or the High School main office. Parents of students who drive themselves to school may call the main office to give their student permission to check out. Students who are 18 or older may check themselves out, but must document the reason for checking out. When checking out, the reason for leaving school must be clearly stated. That reason will be used to determine if the absence or tardy is excused or unexcused. The registrar may call for clarification if necessary. STUDENTS MAY NOT CHECK OUT FOR LUNCH. If a student misses more than 30 minutes of a class they will be marked absent even if they return to class. If they arrive after class starts they will be marked tardy or absent depending on how late they arrive. Students who leave campus during school hours without authorization, are counted as truant and will be subject to disciplinary action. Visitor Check-In Arkansas Arts Academy welcomes parents and community members on our campuses. Visitors must check-in at the Elementary campus main office or the High School main office. All visitors will be asked to provide an ID and be issued a visitor name tag. These name tags should be worn for the duration of the visit. Visitors are asked to check-out through the Elementary main office or the High School main office before leaving to ensure that they are accounted for appropriately in the event of an emergency. Parent-Teacher Conferences School-wide Parent-Teacher Conferences are held once each semester (see annual school calendar). Teachers may contact parents and schedule individual parent-teacher conferences in order to create academic and/or behavior plans of improvement for students not showing satisfactory academic progress or responding to specific behavior intervention strategies. Likewise, a parent/guardian may request a conference by contacting the teacher. Academic Policies Selecting Classes Elementary students will experience reading, writing, math, science, and social studies each year with their homeroom teachers. In addition, all students will have the opportunity to experience visual art, dance, orchestra, vocal music, piano, guitar, computer science, and theatre on a rotating basis. Secondary students (grades 7-12) will have the opportunity to declare an art focus and select classes based on their interests. Each March students and parents will be issued a Course Catalog which contains a listing of all classes available by grade along with a brief description of the classes. Students and parents will work with teachers and counselors to build schedules that reflect students' goals and interests. Students will select courses for the coming year in order of seniority (i.e., seniors will select first, then juniors, etc.) Students receive schedules prior to the first day of school or upon transfer acceptance and admission. Concurrent Credit Students in grades 9-12 who successfully complete a college course(s) from an institution approved by the ADE may receive credit toward high school grades and graduation at the rate of one high school credit for three (3) semester hours of college credit. Students are responsible for having the transcript for their concurrent credit course(s) sent to AAA in order to receive credit. Transcripts for students who take concurrent credit courses as partial fulfillment of the required full day of classes for students in grades 9-12 are to be received by AAA ten (10) school days prior to the end of the semester in which the course is completed. Students may not receive credit for course(s) they take or credit may be delayed if transcripts are not received on time; this may jeopardize students' eligibility for extracurricular activities and/or graduation. Students are responsible for all costs and transportation related to concurrent credit courses and may retain credit applied to required high school courses from a previously attended, accredited public school. In addition, AAA may offer courses on our high school campus that count as concurrent credit with an affiliated college partner. In this case, the cost of the class is still the responsibility of the student. Schedule Changes Students may request schedule changes on a limited basis. The first two weeks of school are the time for students to decide if they have selected the appropriate class. After the two week window, students must stay in scheduled classes for a semester. If, at semester, the student and/or parent believe a change is necessary, and there is a course option available, the request to change will be reviewed*. Request to Change Course forms are available from the principal. Please understand that for a schedule change to take place, students must show that they have already tried everything in their power to be successful including before/after school tutoring. *Due to recent changes in College Board's process for ordering AP exams, students are not allowed to transfer out of AP courses at semester. The tests must be purchased in October and students must pay the fee for the unused test if not taken in May. Graduation Requirements Arkansas Arts Academy exceeds the graduation requirements set by the state of Arkansas. Smart Core is the default track of all entering freshman. Parents and students may waive the Smart Core track and follow the regular core by completing the Smart Core Waiver form. Doing so may affect a student's eligibility for certain scholarships in the state of Arkansas. Please see the Smart Core form and the Core form on the following two pages for more information about state requirements for each. The Smart Core/Core requirements apply to all students from 2015 forward. In order for students to be promoted to the next grade level, students must complete six (6) credit units per year based on the Core and Smart Core Curriculum requirements.

Students and their parent/guardian have a responsibility for the student's mastery of all subjects and to obtain additional assistance as needed. The learning process is a joint effort between school, student, and parent/guardian. Parents may assist by helping students maintain a positive attitude toward homework, providing students with a scheduled, well-lit, comfortable study environment, showing interest in homework without doing it for them, and helping them acquire the tools to submit work in on time. Make-Up Work Students are allowed to make-up work missed during excused absences, but are responsible for asking teachers for the missed work assignment(s) and for turning in the completed missed work on time for credit. Students are allowed one class period per absent class period to complete and submit any missed assignments. Make-up tests and quizzes are to be rescheduled at the discretion of teachers, but must align with the schedule of missed work to be made up. Late Work Credit All other late work will receive reduced grades in accordance with class syllabus. Semester Final Exemptions Students meeting the following criteria will be exempt from semester tests. In the event that a student is exempt, each quarter will be weighted at 50% of the semester grade. Students earning an A in both quarters with no more than 3 unexcused absences and/or 6 tardies, and no more than 3 missing or late assignments are exempt from semester finals. Students earning at least a B in both quarters with no more than 2 unexcused absences and/or 3 tardies, and no more than 1 missing or late assignments are exempt from semester finals. Students earning at least a C in both quarters with zero absences, zero tardies, and zero missing or late assignments are exempt from semester finals. Semester finals will be comprehensive summative assessments based on the instruction that has taken place in each class. Students who earn exemption are encouraged to take at least one semester final each year to prepare for comprehensive final or mid-term exams in college classes. Grade Reports Regular performance evaluations allow parents/guardians, students and teachers a benchmark for understanding student progress. Parents/guardians and students may follow daily and weekly academic progress by logging into E-School (see Resource Directory). Training sessions on how to log in to the eSchool Home Access Center and use available online tools to track student success will be held periodically throughout the year. Quarterly Progress Reports Grade reports are sent home to parents at the end of each 9-week period. Final report cards for the year will be available online in mid-June after grade verification is completed. Semester grades for students in grades 1-8 are calculated by averaging the two quarter grades. Semester grades for students in grades 9-12 are calculated by weighting each quarter at 40% and the semester final at 20%. Transcript Request Procedure Closed & Cleared Account Prior to withdrawing and/or requesting an official transcript, AAA students must close their accounts with the Registrar by returning all textbooks and/or library books, and paying any money owed for school-incurred fees and/or fines. School records, including transcripts and diplomas, will be held until accounts are properly closed. Transcript Request Form Once the student account in the registrar's office is \"closed and cleared,\" students complete and submit a Transcript Request Form (TRF), available online, at the AAA-HS Registrar's office, and at the AAA District administration office. Grading Scale -- High School Students receive performance grades that reflect the extent to which they have achieved course academic objectives, and students may also receive grades that reflect other educational objectives such as those contained in the district standards and curriculum frameworks. The Arkansas Uniform Grading Scale and numeric values are used to assign grades and determine student grade point averages. (A.C.A. 6-15-902): Letter Grade Percentage GPA value GPA (AP/Honors) value A 90 - 100 4 5 B 80 - 89 3 4 C 70 - 79 2 3 D 60 - 69 1 2 F 59 and below 0 0 Grades of D or Lower Students with grades of D or lower in core classes may be required to attend remediation sessions with peer tutors and instructors before or after school. Standards Based Grading -- Elementary School Students in grades Kindergarten through 6th are awarded a numerical ranking indicating their level of mastery for each essential standard in their grade. These standards based reports are sent home quarterly. This allows parents to visualize the skills and concepts their student is expected to master in each grade and track their progress towards mastery. 3 = Mastered 2 = Progressing 1 = NT = Not Taught Remediation Options Students whose classroom and standardized assessments indicate they may need additional support to achieve mastery with have the opportunity to participate in a variety of remediation options. This may include but are not limited to: literacy camps, extra tutoring before or after school, double blocked classes, access to reading or math interventionists, and access to software designed to reinforce important skills. High School students who fail core courses may enroll in credit recovery through John Brown University. Credit recovery courses are completed online with the supervision of Arkansas Arts Academy counselors. The cost for each course is $50. Students can sign up for these courses through the counselor's office. Extracurricular Policies Eligibility To be eligible to participate in performances and competitions, a student must pass four (4) academic classes the previous semester and earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 based on the previous semester, AND have no more than 2 unexcused absences for the current semester and no school disciplinary suspensions or known felony actions for the current semester. Participation Student participation in such activities should not deprive students of instructional time needed to successfully complete academic coursework; therefore, a student's extra-curricular activities may be curtailed or modified if more instructional time is needed to successfully perform academic work. Practice and competitions will not take place on days when school has been dismissed due to inclement weather or other unscheduled closures. Likewise, rehearsals and practices will not be scheduled for holidays and cannot extend past 8:30 pm. Failure to Attend Any student who fails to attend every class at school on the day of a school-sponsored activity is not eligible to participate or compete in extracurricular activities, including practice sessions scheduled for after school hours. A building administrator may approve exception to allow participation on a case-by-case basis. Any student who participates or competes in a performance, competition, or other school-sponsored activity in violation of this procedure shall be suspended from participation in the next scheduled practice, competition, or activity. Guest Approval If AAA students would like to bring non-AAA students to a school dance or prom, they must first obtain permission from the principal by submitting a completed Out of School Date Application Form to the principal's office before the scheduled event. Completed forms must be signed by an official from the student's home school, or a parent if home-schooled, and returned to the principal no later than 3 days prior to the event. The form can be located on the artsk12.org website under 7-12 school, then documents, or they are available in the main office. Students and/or guests in 9 th grade or younger may not attend prom.

Students will not be allowed to run or hold office in a school activity unless they have a 3.00 GPA for presidency or 2.50 GPA for all other positions. Officers who drop below the aforementioned GPA will be given a warning and allowed four weeks to bring up her/his grades. Discipline Policy The implementation of a meaningful and effective school discipline policy requires a student body who is well informed of what types of behavior are expected, as well as what kinds of consequences are available if ever to be found in violation. Through the incorporation of the ARTS Pledge and the distribution of the student handbook, it is our hope that the AAA Discipline Policy becomes a tool by which students may become more accountable for their actions and one that allows teachers and administrators the chance to facilitate and redirect, instead of lecturing and demanding good behavior. In an effort to maintain a safe atmosphere that is conducive to student achievement, the AAA School Board has approved policies including this Discipline Policy, to help regulate student behavior so as to promote an orderly and respectful school environment, to ensure the uniform and fair enforcement of student discipline, and to make the content readily available for our AAA students and families so they may be well informed of topics relevant to academic success. A.C.A. \u00a7 6-18-502 (5d) The objective of the Discipline Policy is to provide AAA students with clear academic and behavior-related expectations, as well as efficient consequences and effective interventions by incorporating research- based techniques and strategies proven to prevent, discourage, and/or redirect student misconduct. Infraction Levels & Consequence Tiers The infractions are divided into three (3) Infraction Levels based on the severity of negative behavior or code/policy violation. Each level progressively represents more serious types of infractions with Level 1 at the top of the chart being the least serious and Level 3 at the bottom of the chart being the most serious. Each infraction is identified first by one (1) of the four (4) codes (Code of Conduct, Code of Citizenship, Code of Ethics, and Code of Academic Integrity) and/or a supporting policy or procedure - all of which give structure and meaning to the ARTS Pledge made by each student every year at AAA high school. For example, the fourth code is the Academic Integrity Code in which AAA students pledge to be \" Self-disciplined & smART students by achieving the highest standards of scholarship & moral excellence \" which among other things, remind students to be prompt and prepared for class; so, within the Code of Academic Integrity, lies the Attendance Policy. A Level 1 Infraction being late to class is listed as Academic Integrity Code/Attendance Policy: more than five minutes late to class. If the student frequently violates this code and policy, the infraction moves to Tier 2 consequences. Each Infraction Level has a corresponding Tier Response that offers a variety of research-based consequences and intervention strategies. As with infractions, the Tier Responses are listed on a continuum from mild (on the far left in which the teacher meets with the student) to severe (on the far right which recommends expulsion). The teacher/principal may select the appropriate Tier Response and assign a consequence after reviewing daily documentation notes. Using the student from the previous example who was frequently late to class, the Tier Response consequences would begin first with the teacher meeting with the student during school hours, and then progresses with each subsequent infraction to consequences such as referrals to the principal, detention, a larger conference, an Academic Intervention Meeting, in which the parent and key support service staff, including the school counselor and students who volunteer as peer mentors are invited to attend to offer support to the student before the next tardy lands him or her in suspension. The ARTS Behavior Chart provides a variety of consequences in the Tier Response categories so that it may be customized to meet the needs of all students. D isabled students, as defined in state standards, who engage in inappropriate behavior are subject to this Discipline Policy, provided their rights to a free and appropriate public education are not violated. The individualized education plan (IEP) team for each disabled student should consider whether particular disciplinary procedures should be adopted and included in the student's IEP. Unless a student's IEP specifically states otherwise or the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability, the student may be subject to the same behavior standards as all students. For frequent violations or serious infractions, support-centered interventions are recommended with the goal of helping students comprehend how and why to make positive behavior choices. Level 1 -- Classroom Teacher Managed Infractions Level 1 misconduct interferes with the orderly operation of the classroom or a school activity on campus or off campus at a school-sponsored event. These types of infractions are minor and most pertain to classroom rules and are easily addressed by the teacher without interrupting the lesson at hand. So that students may understand that rules are not arbitrarily made, to the left of each infraction is found either the code in the ARTS pledge or a specific policy/procedure as related to a State and Federal law/regulation. Level Infractions Tier 1: Classroom Teacher Managed Consequences a repeated infraction, such as those that interfere with student learning, which despite the use of classroom management strategies has not ceased. Minor damage to school/student property (ex. Writing on desks or walls, leaving gum under desks) Minor damage is defined as damage that is cosmetic or easily fixed without expenditure of funds. misconduct on school transportation, and/or similar off campus school-related event inappropriate dress inappropriate public displays of affection (non-platonic embraces and kissing) Cell Phone Policy: abuse of privilege* Computer Policy: abuse of privilege* Internet Policy: abuse of privilege* Use of Vehicle: abuse of privilege Nutrition/Wellness Policy violation Tardies/Unexcused absences Classroom management strategies and informal documentation* : Prior to formal documentation, the teacher may choose to see if certain types of strategies help prevent or decrease misconduct, such as giving verbal reminders, defining behavior expectations, and assessing environmental factors, and to document in the Discipline Log the effectiveness of each strategy used. Teacher & Student Conference: Teachers initiate formal documentation of misconduct on the Referral Action Plan (RAP) sheet and schedule an informal conference with the student during school hours. The goal of the conference is for the student and teacher to openly discuss the misconduct in which the student is repeatedly engaging, to reflect on how it is in violation of the ARTS pledge, and to find ways to help redirect and prevent the negative behavior. After the conference, the teacher documents any thoughts related to the assessment of the function of misbehavior or the need for counselor support. Parent and Student Written Notification After the second infraction/form of misconduct, the teacher sends written notification to the student and parent/guardian to explain the next infraction will be justification for the student to be referred to the Principal for Level 2 consequences. Referral to principal The third infraction of the same kind is the red flag that marks it is time for the student to be referred for administrative intervention. The teacher checks to see that all relevant information such as strategies used to prevent, correct or redirect such behavior have Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying records, violating copyright laws (**) been recorded on the student's RAP sheet, and then sends the RAP sheet to the Principal. *these violations require intent to abuse the privilege **allows for one (1) violation before proceeding to Level 2. All other infractions are granted two (2) violations before referral to principal or Level 2. *Informal Documentation The point at which a teacher chooses to document student misconduct may vary just as classroom management and teaching styles. AAA Teachers will continue to receive professional development training related to the Discipline Policy which stresses the benefit of frequent and relevant documentation of student misconduct. Such documentation may provide insight into intervention strategies that may immediately support the student's efforts to succeed. Level 2 Administrative Intervention & Support Level 2 misconduct is largely comprised of repeated/cumulative Level 1 infractions, but also includes infractions in which Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions, specifically restrictions and loss of privileges, have proven ineffective in correcting or redirecting student behavior. In Tier 2 the infractions include moderate risks to health, safety and property of the student, staff or community members present during and property involved in the misconduct. Level Infractions & Violations Tier 2 Consequences & Interventions gross misconduct including indecent sexual behavior/exposure purposefully antagonizing peers in person or via social media which results in disruption of learning. use of profanity or abusive language /racial slurs in a defamatory manner. participated in extracurricular activity event without attending school (intentional disregard) left school without permission/truant* (\"skipping school\") grade of D or lower results in an AIM conference which can be conducted digitally. Referral to Principal Tier 2 begins with the formal referral of a student to the principal or assistant principal. After reviewing the referred student's RAP sheet, the principal will meet with the student to assign an appropriate consequence. The principal's decision is based on several factors including the student's grade, academic status, frequency of violations of the same code or policy, the severity or level of the infraction, staff recommendations, and any other documented misconduct exhibited by the student. Restriction or Revocation of Privilege may be a minimum of restricted access for one activity or school day to a semester/year-long revocation and includes but is not limited to: a.) lunch or after school detention without cell phone or social time, the duration of which is at the discretion of the principal b.) loss of privilege related to an extracurricular activity, event, participating in such activities, including performances and practices on and off campus. A minimum of one day of restricted or prohibited access to extracurricular activities, including but not limited to: company performances, practice sessions, competitions, ceremonies, school-sponsored dances such as prom, and any school-related activity on and off campus. c.) confiscation of cell phone for a minimum of one day up to loss of the privilege or revocation for the rest of the semester or academic school year, depending on the severity of misconduct associated with the infraction. Any time that cell phone is confiscated, it is placed in a secure location in the main office and is not released to the student until after school. Some consequences require that the parent/guardian be the designated person to whom the cell phone is released. d.) more restrictive filter or limitation of school-loaned computer e.) in-school suspension to remove student(s) from the environment in which misconduct occurred and allow for more-intensive interventions with counselor/principal. AIM Academic Intervention Meeting , in which the parent is notified and encouraged to attend, includes the principal, teacher, counselor, support staff, student, and peer mentoring representative. During the AIM, the group conducts a preliminary academic review. In addition to assigning the student to lunch or after-school detention for a short-term of one day to one week or long-term of two weeks or more, the AIM may assign one or more of the following to CPR-Life Supports : o C ounselor Check-ins o P eer Mentoring o R emediation/Study Skills Intervention *truant refers to leaving campus without permission after you have arrived as well as refusal to come to school. Level 3 Academic Review Committee & Legal Requirements Level 3 infractions are MAJOR infractions that are reported immediately to the principal who in turn notifies the student's parents/guardians and collaborates with the Rogers Police Department, depending on regulations set by State and Federal law. A student's Level 3 violations and academic status are discussed in the Administrative Review Committees (ARC) during which the appropriate disciplinary action(s) and support are assigned, which may range from in-school suspension to recommendation to the CEO for immediate expulsion.

Consequences & Interventions: Minimum of meeting with Principal and being assigned a restriction or loss of privilege to the maximum of expulsion. Suspension Procedures for Level 3 Intervention Students who are not present at school cannot benefit from the educational opportunities the school environment affords. Administrators, therefore, will strive to find ways to keep students in school as participants in the educational process. There are instances, however, when the needs of the other students or the interests of the orderly learning environment require the removal of a student from school. The Board authorizes the principal to suspend students for disciplinary reasons for a period not to exceed ten (10) school days, including the day upon which the suspension is imposed. The suspension will be out of school. A student may be suspended for behavior including, but not limited to that which: is in violation of school policies; interferes with the safe and orderly educational environment; will result, administrators believe, in substantial interference with a safe learning environment; and/or is insubordinate, incorrigible, violent, or involves moral turpitude. The principal will decide whether or not to suspend a student who will be given written or verbal notice of the charges. If the student denies the charges, he/she shall be given an explanation of the evidence against him/her and be allowed to present his/her version of the facts. If the principal finds the student guilty of misconduct, he/she may be suspended. When possible, notice of the suspension, its duration, and any stipulations for the student's re-admittance to class will be given to the parent/legal guardian or the student if age 18 or older prior to suspension. Such notice shall be handed to the parent/legal guardian(s), or to the student if age 18 or older or mailed to the address in school records. Generally, notice and hearing should precede the student's removal from school, but if not feasible, as where the student's presence endangers persons or property or threatens disruption of the academic process, the necessary notice and hearing should follow as soon as practicable. Out-of-school suspensions shall be treated as unexcused absences, and during the period of suspension students will not be permitted on campus except to attend a student/parent/administrator conference. Students may ask for any assignments missed due to an Out of School Suspension. Those assignments will be due upon return to school. Suspensions initiated by the principal may be appealed to the CEO. Legal References: A.C.A. \u00a7 6-18-507; Goss v. Lopez , 419 U.S. 565 (1975) Expulsion Procedures for Level 3 Intervention The AAA Board of Education may expel a student for longer than ten (10) school days for violation of the school's written discipline policies. The CEO may make a recommendation of expulsion to the Board for student conduct deemed to be so serious that suspension would be inadequate, or where the student's attendance at school would disrupt the learning environment or pose a danger to the welfare of other students or staff. The CEO shall mail a written notice to the student's parent/guardian explaining the reason and length of time that the student is being recommended for expulsion to the Board. The notice shall give the date, hour, and place where the Board will consider and dispose of the recommendation. The hearing shall be conducted not later than ten (10) school days following notice date, except that representatives of the Board and student may agree in writing to a date not conforming to this limitation. The President of the Board or other designated Board member shall preside at the hearing. The student may choose to be represented by legal counsel. The hearing shall be conducted in open session of the Board unless the parent, or student if age 18 or older, requests the hearing be conducted in executive session. Any action taken by the Board shall be in open session. During the hearing, the CEO will present evidence, including the calling of witnesses, which gave rise to the recommendation of expulsion. The student may then present evidence including statements from persons with knowledge of the events relevant to the charges against the student. Formal cross-examination will not be permitted. However, any member of the Board, the CEO, the student, or representative may question the student or anyone else making a statement. The presiding officer shall decide questions concerning the appropriateness or relevance of questions asked during the hearing. The CEO shall recommend the expulsion of any student for a period of not less than one (1) year for possession of any firearm or other weapon prohibited on school campus by law; however, the CEO has the discretion to modify the expulsion recommendation for a student on a case-by-case basis. Parents/guardians enrolling from another school after the expiration of an expulsion period for a weapons policy violation shall be given a copy of the current laws regarding the possibility of parental responsibility for allowing a child to possess a weapon on school property. The parents or legal guardians shall sign a statement acknowledging they have read and understand said laws prior to the student being enrolled in school. The CEO and the Board of Education shall complete the expulsion process of any student that was initiated because the student possessed a firearm or other prohibited weapon on school property regardless of the student enrollment status. Legal Reference: A.C.A. \u00a7 6-18-50 Off Campus Misconduct The school administrators may take disciplinary action against a student for off-campus conduct occurring at any time that would have a detrimental impact on school reputation, discipline, the educational environment, or the welfare of the students and/or staff. A student who has committed a criminal act while off campus and whose presence on campus could cause a substantial disruption to school or endanger the welfare of other students or staff is subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion. Such acts could include, but are not limited to a felony or an act that is considered a felony if committed by an adult, an assault or battery, drug law violations, or sexual misconduct of a serious nature. Any disciplinary action pursued by the school shall be in accordance with the student's appropriate due process rights. Dress Code Dress Code Infractions Self-expression and individuality are encouraged at AAA, but not at the expense of a respectable appearance and proper hygiene. It is important that students come to school dressed in a way that will help them focus and put their best foot forward when meeting professional artists and guests on our campus. The dress code is designed to be applied to all students without distinction to gender. Initial violations of the dress code are Level 1 infractions with Tier 1 consequences; however, repeated and cumulative violations result in more severe consequences. For more information, please refer to your ARTS Pledge and the Discipline Policy. The principal will have a supply of alternative clothing on hand that students may borrow for the day if they are violating school dress code. The following dress code will be enforced: Sunglasses and hats or head coverings are not allowed inside the building (except for documented religious or medical reasons). Midriffs should not be visible. No exposed underwear, buttocks or cleavage: Students are prohibited from wearing clothing while on school grounds during the school day and/or off campus at school-sponsored activities and events that exposes underwear, buttocks, or breasts. This includes sheer clothing that otherwise covers undergarments. Note: This does not apply to costumes or uniforms in a school sponsored activity or event. Legal reference: Act 835 of 2011 Skirts and shorts must be longer than the tips of fingers when arms are relaxed with shoulders down. In jeans with holes, the holes should not be higher than appropriate length shorts or skirts. As long as shorts or pants have pockets (including heavier weight athletic shorts) they may be worn. Garments may be sleeveless provided they cover from the collarbone to the edge of the shoulder. No tank tops or spaghetti strap tops. Undergarments should not be visible. Shoes must be worn while at school. Slippers should not be worn on campus. Cleats or dance shoes may only be worn in the appropriate class. Shoes may not have built in wheels (wheelies). No clothing with lewd or suggestive slogans, including gang-related, tobacco, drugs, alcohol ads/emblems; No pants with words on the seat. No lettering or pictures portrayed that could be deemed offensive to public morals. Special Events Dress code is exactly the same for after-school and off-campus school events as during the school day. For formal events, the following guidelines apply: dresses may not be cut below the bust line, midriffs may not be exposed, dress slits may not exceed mid-thigh, and backless dresses are allowed as long as not cut below the navel. Tuxedos for boys are recommended, but not required. Graduation Prior to graduation ceremony, faculty will check seniors for proper dress (dresses, skirts, or slacks; blouses/shirts with collar; dress shoes) as it is required for ceremony participation. Remember your cap and gown stress unity. Technology Policies Internet Policy & Terms of Use of Privilege AAA is committed to promoting ethical and responsible use of computer and network resources and will not tolerate their misuse. We are committed to adhering to FCC-11-12541 CIPA Order of July 1, 2012 which states that public schools will \"educate minors about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response.\" Access to computer and internet resources is a privilege, not a right, and should be treated as such. Access to the internet is provided to students, teachers, administrators, and other school personnel involved in the educational process. Anyone using the internet system is responsible for its proper use. AAA does not condone the use of inappropriate material that may be obscene, abusive, offensive, inaccurate, etc. and does not permit the use of such material in the school environment. AAA has taken all available precautions to restrict access to controversial materials. In doing so, the school district reserves the right to deem what is appropriate. Filtering System AAA uses a filtering system at the state level that monitors all Arkansas schools to restrict the access of minors to materials that might be harmful. Personnel monitor students during Internet use; therefore, proper supervision is required to monitor the appropriate use of the internet system at school. Right to Monitor All Network Activity With or Without Notice Users should have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the use of these resources on school premises. Email, or electronic documents stored on AAA servers and computers can be subject to open records laws. The school district reserves the right to access any and all data stored on computers attached to the internet to ensure that email and/or computer files do not contain defamatory, abusive, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, offensive or illegal material. The school district also reserves the right to review any material downloaded or in use by any user. The use of the Internet is a privilege, not a right, and inappropriate use will result in a temporary restriction or permanent cancellation of this privilege. The use of your account must be in support of education and research and consistent with educational objective of the AAA School District. Use of other networks or computing resources must comply with the rules appropriate for that network. Transmission of any material in violation of any US or state regulation is prohibited, which includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, threatening or obscene material, or material protected by trade secret, use for commercial activities for profit institutions, product advertisement or political lobbying. Computer Use Violations Resulting In Disciplinary Action Inappropriate use of copyright laws, including sharing of research materials; Employing network for commercial or personal gain or for illegal purposes, sending or displaying offensive pictures or messages containing harassing, obscene, profane or vulgar content; Engaging in cyberbullying; Sharing or altering others' passwords or documents, including cafeteria ID number; Trespassing in others' folders, documents or email; Possession, distribution, or posting of magazines, books, electronic data, or printed material not appropriate for school; Unauthorized installation of software or downloading of files on district computer equipment; Use of e-mail or the Internet without teacher's permission; Downloading files from without a teacher's permission; Tampering with, damaging, or stealing computer hardware, peripherals, or software; Intentionally wasting limited resources; Revealing personal information about yourself or others; Introducing viral or other destructive elements; Identity theft, hacking or circumventing any security systems using district technology resources; Generating, copying, or attempting to introduce any computer code designed to self-replicate, damage or otherwise hinder the performance of any system; Use or attempted use of district technology while access privileges are suspended or revoked. Netiquette Do NOT download anything without teacher permission; reveal personal information or that of any other student or use/attempt to use someone else's account; dismantle, disconnect, remove computer equipment, cables or change computer settings, or remove software, operating systems security programs, or configuration files; use profanity, obscenity, or vulgarity; participate in chat rooms, bypass internet filters, or engage in harassment/ vandalism. Please DO be polite, courteous and respectful during all online sessions; remember each student is responsible for his/her account and that school email accounts/computer use are not private; keep account passwords private, and log off network after each use; report any type of harassment you see online to a teacher. Disciplinary Actions Misuse of the internet is considered at Level 2 violation and will result in the following types of consequences: have his/her account with the Internet temporarily restricted through means of a more restrictive filter or be required to turn in Chromebooks to the principal or assistant principal at the end of each day. In the case of vandalism, financial institutions will be required. Also, anyone in violation of the policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for employees, expulsion for students, and possible referral for prosecution. Students who lose internet/Chromebook privileges are responsible for setting up alternative assignments with their teachers. Warranties AAA School District makes no warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, for the Internet service and will not be responsible for damages suffered or unauthorized costs incurred by student misuse or negligence. This includes loss of data resulting from delays, non-deliveries, delivery errors, or service interruptions caused by negligence, errors, or omissions. Use of any information obtained via Internet is at your own risk. The school district specifically denies any responsibility for the accuracy or quality of information obtained through it services . Legal References: 20 USC A.C.A. 6-21-111 Cell Phone Use Of Privilege AAA students may enjoy the privilege of bringing and using their cell phones at school during the following times: Before 8:20 and after 3:30 in grades 7 or 8; before 8:40 and after 4:00 for students in grades 9-12. During lunch, provided they are not taking pictures or videos of other students and are not assigned lunch detention. In order to help AAA students resist using cell phones during classes, each teacher has a designated cell phone spot where cell phones may safely be stored until the end of class. Students are not allowed to use their phones to take unauthorized videos or pictures of others during school hours. Students must also understand that by bringing their cell phones to school, they are complying with the school's right to search their cell phones if any violations have occurred and/or to hand it over to Law Enforcement if criminal activity is suspected. Legal Reference: A.C.A. \u00a7 6-18-502 (b)(3)(D)(ii) Consequences Students found to be in repeated violations of this policy will be subject to a variety of disciplinary actions, including, teacher conference, referral to the principal, and confiscation of the phone for a period of time at which point the student and/or parent/guardian must sign for the phone's release. After six violations of the Cell Phone Policy, a student may be suspended for up to 10 days. Transportation Policies Requesting Driver's Attendance Form Students may obtain a Driver's Attendance Form from the school office. Student must have a 2.0 GPA for the most recently completed semester to qualify. Please allow 24 hours for processing requests. Parking Regulations For Cars, Motorcycles And Bikes Parking on the Arkansas Arts Academy campus is limited. Students and faculty will be issued numbered parking stickers that correspond with numbered parking spaces in the school parking lots. Stickers can be purchased from the high school office for $50 on a first come, first served basis. Families will be notified of the sale date each year via email, school welcome packet, and social media including the school's website. In addition to the application, students will also need to provide a copy of their current driver's license and insurance card. Once parking on campus has been exhausted, students will be directed to one of the public parking lots in Downtown Rogers. Traveling For School-related Events/Field Trips Students traveling to school-related events or field trips are required to ride with their individual parents or in school provided transportation. Students may not drive themselves to field trip destinations. Failure To Practice Safe Driving Students that drive on campus in such a way as to harm or potentially harm others or damage or potentially damage property will be subject to disciplinary consequences up to and including revocation of parking privileges. Drug & Weapon Free Campus Policy The possession of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and weapons is illegal and unsafe, disruptive to the educational environment, and diminishes the capacity of students to learn and function properly. AAA students may not possess, attempt to possess, consume/use, attempt to consume/use, distribute/sell, attempt to distribute/sell, give to any person, or be under the influence of any substance or item as defined in this Drug and Weapon Free Campus Policy. Furthermore, this policy applies to all students who are on school property, in attendance at school or any school sponsored activity, have left the school campus for any reason and return to the campus, and/or enroute to or from school or off/away from school campus while attending any type of school sponsored activity or event. Drugs: Alcohol, Medications & Tobacco Students may not possess, be under the influence of, or in the act of using, selling, sharing, distributing, storing of drugs, such as LSD, or any other hallucinogen, marijuana, or any \"controlled substance,\" alcohol or alcoholic beverages, medications, including prescription and/or OTC medicine, or tobacco and tobacco-related products. Medication: Students may not possess, use, sell, distribute, manufacture or be under the influence of any form of medication, prescription and/or over-the-counter OTC medications, other than in compliance with the Medication Administration Procedure. It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian and student to correctly register all medications, prescription and OTC, with the school nurse (see Medication Administration Procedures). Tobacco: Students may not possess, use, sell, distribute tobacco in any form, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff, or tobacco-related products such as lighters or matches. This also applies to electronic cigarettes (Act 1099 of 2013) as well as Act 1451 of 2013 which states it is illegal for a minor to use, possess, purchase or attempt to purchase an electronic cigarette device. In accordance with state law Arkansas Code 6-21-609, smoking or use of tobacco or products containing tobacco in any form in or on any property owned or leased by AAA, including parking areas, school buses, trailers, is prohibited by students and adults. Consequences Students who violate the Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco policy may be reported to law enforcement and subject to legal proceedings in addition to Level 3 disciplinary measures which begin with an immediate suspension of 1 to 3 days for the first offense. Parents/guardians will be notified and requested to attend a mandatory conference. Weapons Students are not to possess, handle, or store a club, knife, razor, ice pick, dagger, explosive, pistol, rifle, shotgun, BB gun, pellet gun, automatic firearm, imitation of firearm, or any other such weapons or contraband materials. Students are also not allowed to possess any hand-held laser pointer while on school campus or off campus at any school-sponsored event. Any student discussion involving bringing a gun or weapon to school will be considered an attempt and subject to disciplinary action. Consequences Students who violate the Weapons Policy may receive consequences including parent notification, permanent confiscation of the items, report to law enforcement authorities for possible prosecution and/or consultation (Act 888); immediate 3 to 10 day suspension, and/or expulsion. The principal and District CEO have discretion as to the amount of time and type of consequence assigned from the Tier 3 continuum. Act 567, which states consequence shall be expulsion for no less than one year, is to be taken into consideration; however, school officials may modify expulsion requirements as established in Act 567 on a case-by-case basis. Search & Seizure Procedures If there is a reasonable suspicion that students are in possession of items in violation of the Drug & Weapon Free Campus, the principal has the right to search school property, including buildings, cars, parking lots, and any student personal possessions left in such places. The principal may request the assistance of law enforcement, including trained dogs, to help conduct searches. Personal searches of students may be conducted on campus or off campus if attending a school-related event, and will not be excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and/or the nature of the infraction. A school official of the same sex will conduct personal searches with an adult witness of the same sex present. When possible, prior notice of a search will be given, and the student may be allowed to be present with an adult witness; however, searches may also be done at any time with or without notice or the student's consent. Any evidence found during the search will be seized and disciplinary action will follow as stipulated in the Discipline Policy. ACA 6-18-513 Emergency Preparedness Inclement Weather In the event of inclement weather, please refer to our website, school app, official social media pages or to local television stations for school cancellation or delay information. The administration team will determine if school will be in session by 5:30am. If Rogers Public Schools are closed due to inclement weather, Arkansas Arts Academy will also be closed. Because our families are spread across Northwest Arkansas, we always respect a parents decision to assess local conditions and determine whether or not to send students to school if we are in session. Absences may be excused if parents notify they school the absence was due to inclement weather. Alternative Method of Instruction Act 862 of 2017 allows an open-enrollment public charter school to develop a plan for alternative methods of instruction to be used on days when the superintendent closes school due to exceptional or emergency circumstances. As stated in the legislation, the Commissioner of Education may grant up to the equivalent of ten (10) student attendance days for public school districts that have an alternative instruction plan approved by the commissioner for the use of alternative methods of instruction on days when the public school district is closed. Students will be responsible for completing their assigned work in order to receive attendance credit for that day. Intruder Drill In accordance with ACT 484 of 2013, annual active intruder drills and school safety assessments in collaboration with local law enforcement and emergency management personnel will be performed for students and personnel of all schools. School districts and charter schools shall provide annual training for all of its employees and students, to the extent practicable, in preventing and responding to acts of violence, terrorism, and natural disasters. Fire Drills A long, continuous buzzing sound and activation of strobe lights and/or a fire alert alarm message are the signals to follow the emergency exit plan. Teachers should have a fire exit map in their rooms, posted by the door. Students should leave the classroom in a quiet, orderly manner. Fire Marshals at the High School campus are assigned to help close doors and check the building. Teachers will call roll outside at the designated area to be sure that all students are safe and accounted for. Students must stay in the designated area with their teacher until the return signal is given. Students will be told to return to classes by intercom. Fire drills are conducted on a monthly basis. Tornado Drills An announcement over the intercom will signal a tornado drill. Students should move to areas away from the windows and/or crouch down using their arms to protect their head. The fire exit map of building shows designated safety areas for the classroom in case of a tornado or drill. Tornado drills are conducted three (3) times a year during severe weather season. Health and Wellness Policy The AAA School Board shall cooperate with State, County, and City Health Departments in providing health services for the school. The following Health and Wellness Policy consists of procedures and regulations associated with student illness and injury, homebound issues and medication procedures for students requiring medication administration during school hours. Student Illness & Injury At School If students become ill or injured at school, they will be sent to the nurse's office or the administration office. The parent(s) or guardian will be contacted if necessary, based on the evaluation. (This rule may be suspended for students 18 years or older.) Emergency Medical Services will be called if warranted. An incident report will be filled out by the teacher and an administrator. Students showing signs of illness will be evaluated by the school nurse or an administrator for risk of a communicable disease. Students may be sent home or if at home are asked to notify and not come to school, if they have any of the following symptoms: Fever of 100\u00b0 (F) or above, diarrhea, vomiting or upset stomach, earache, persistent cough, sore throat, rash, runny nose, cold or allergy-like symptoms with fever, sore throat with fever, rash with fever, runny nose, cold or allergy-like symptoms with fever, pink eye, impetigo, scabies, head lice, chicken pox, ringworm. Student Illness & Injury At Home If a student becomes ill at home with a communicable disease or with parasites, they will demonstrate respect for other students by not attending school while they are contagious. Before returning to school, a student must be: symptom-free from nausea, diarrhea, or parasites without medication for 24 hours, or fever-free (below 100\u00b0 [F]) for 24 hours before returning to school, or symptom-reduced and fever-free for 24 hours after receiving antibiotics for a bacterial infection, including pink eye and strep throat. Medication Policy Administration procedures for all student prescription medications, including inhalants and Epi-pens, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) medications, must be administered by the school nurse or designated school employee. The medications are to be stored in the Nurse's Office. Sharing medications as listed in the AAA Medication Policy is a violation of the Weapons & Drugs Free Campus Policy and results in Tier 3 consequences (see Discipline Policy). Prescription Medications Prescription medications will be administered per a qualified medical authority's instruction as indicated on the labeling of the prescription. Prescription medication shall be supplied by the parent and shall have completed required paperwork prior to administration by school personnel. Medication is to be in the original container and properly labeled with the student's name, dosage, frequency and instructions of use. Any change to the medication will require new orders from a qualified medical authority. A parent/guardian or age-eligible student is responsible for checking medications in to or out of school. Medications will not be sent home with a non-age-eligible student under any other circumstance. Only medication prescribed to be given during specific school hours will be administered. (Medications ordered three times daily or less will not be administered at school unless a specific time of day is indicated in the orders.) Medication administration forms are to be updated at the beginning of each school year or as needed. At the end of the school year, any remaining medications must be picked up by the parent/guardian; unclaimed medications will be destroyed by the nurse and a witness. Inhalers : Asthma-diagnosed students who require the use of an inhaler must keep the inhaler in the school nurse's office OR have written permission from the school nurse, doctor, and parent/guardian to carry and administer the inhaler. All inhalers must be labeled with the student's name and original prescription or in the prescription box. All students with inhalers will have an Asthma Action Plan (completed by doctor/parent) and Parental Consent for Inhaler Use on file with the school nurse's office who confirms the student's qualification to carry the inhaler for self-administration before permission is granted. Epi-pens : All students with life-threatening allergies requiring an epinephrine auto-injector (Epipen) must have an extra Epipen available in the school nurse's office along with a physician-signed Allergy Action Plan and a Parent Consent to Administer form. A student may self-carry their Epipen if there is written permission from the doctor and parent. All Epipens shall be labeled with the original prescription or in the original prescription packaging. Legal notice: The AAA Nurse may provide an Epi-pen to students who have proper documentation on file by allowing the student or a staff member authorized on the health care plan to administer the Epipen, or by administering an Epipen to a student who the nurse in good faith believes is having an anaphylactic reaction regardless of the student having filed documentation. In the latter case, AAA, its employees, and physician providing standing protocol are immune from any damage, loss, or liability as a result of an injury arising from the use of the Epipen. In addition, ACT 1437 of 2013 states a licensed physician may issue a certificate under the Insect Sting and Other Allergic Reactions Emergency Treatment Act (A.C.A. 20-13-401 et seq.) authorizing a charter school nurse/employee trained in administration of an Epi-pen to possess and administer Epi-pens. Legal Reference: ACT 757 of 2013; ACT 1437 of 2013 Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications Over-the-counter medications may be administered at the nurse's discretion only with prior written consent of the parent or confirmed phone contact. OTC medications include such items as antacids, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, cough syrups, and cough drops. Self-medication is forbidden regardless of age. No student may self-medicate or carry prescription or OTC medication on their person or in their cars. AAA follows the state law, ACT 1146 of 1995, when administering medication to students and has trained personnel to administer medications under the nurse's oversight. Administration of medication is a service provided in proxy of the parent/guardian by a school employee. Any medication given at school must be dispensed through the official locations designated by the school nurse. According to ACT 1232 of 2013, a student suffering from diabetes may be administered Glucagon by school personnel trained by licensed nurses employed by the school. All medication administration at school must be requested by a parent/guardian in writing. This written authorization relieves the School Board, administration, and individual administering the medication from any civil liability for damages or injuries. Legal Reference: ACT 1232 of 2013 Homebound Students Any student 5 to 21 years old who, because of illness, injury, or the nature and/or extent of his/her handicapping condition, requires homebound or hospital instruction shall, upon approval, receive educational services during the academic year with his/her facility of confinement for as long as the disabling condition prevents the student from safely and adequately attending school. A statement by the attending physician as to the student's diagnosis, reason for confinement, and approximate length of time such services will be needed must be submitted to the special educational supervisor prior to approval. Homebound and hospital instruction is then provided upon approval by the superintendent of the school in which the child is enrolled and the special education supervisor, if they are legal residents of the district. The AAA Plan for Homebound Services contains proper forms and instructions for provision of homebound and hospital instruction. Students shall receive a minimum of twelve hours of instruction per month, with a minimum of three hours each week to be counted for full attendance. Days and times should be distributed to the best advantage of student and teacher. Provision of homebound instructional services is subject to revaluation of eligibility. Services that extend for a period of three months will be required to be reevaluated in terms of continued eligibility and/or referral to more appropriate services. Screenings Vision : Act 1438 of 2005 requires students in grades K, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and transfer students to have an eye and vision screen. Only failure notifications will be sent home. A child who does not pass the screening shall be required to have an exam conducted by an optometrist or ophthalmologist within 60 days of receipt of the screening report and show proof of the exam. Parents needing financial assistance should contact the school nurse. Hearing : Hearing screens are mandated for students in grades K, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and transfer students. Only failure notices will be sent home. Parents have 60 days to show proof that their child was examined by a doctor or audiologist. BMI : Act 1220 requires students in grades K, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to have their height and weight assessed. A parent who refuses to have their child assessed must provide written documentation of the refusal to the school. Parents of all participants will be sent results. Scoliosis : Act 95 of 1989 and Act 41 of 1987 require girls in 6th grade and all students in 8th grade to be screened for scoliosis. Parents of a child who fails the screening will be sent an informative letter stating the need to see a licensed physician. A parent, who refuses to have their child screened, must provide written documentation of the refusal to the school. Students covered under Medicaid/Arkansas Kids 1st will be billed, where applicable, for hearing and vision screenings conducted at school unless the district is notified, in writing, by the parents/guardian to decline within 60 days of receipt of the handbook. This written notice can be sent to: Arkansas Arts Academy Administration, 1110 W. Poplar Street Ste A, Rogers, AR. 72756, Attention: Medicaid Coordinator Nutrition Policy AAA supports research that prescribes a healthy diet and finds nutrition to be a key component in promoting the physical, emotional and mental development of our students. AAA provides healthy breakfasts and lunches at low cost. School meals shall be in compliance with the US Department of Agriculture and State of Arkansas standards for good health. Students may purchase meals by establishing an account in the lunchroom, and students may also bring their lunches. If a student shows poor eating habits or signs of an eating disorder, parents/guardians will be contacted. To ensure all students have a healthy and complete diet, all students and parents/guardians will be informed of the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program. If a student forgets his/her lunch or does not have money in their account to pay for the cost of a meal, the school will assist the student in contacting parents to either bring money or a lunch or an alternative meal will be provided at no cost to the student. If this practice continues on a regular basis, the school reserves the right to discontinue providing the alternative free meal. If a parent or guardian refuses to provide meals, pay for meals, or apply for the Federal Free and Reduced Lunch Program after two contacts by the administration, a report of Child Abuse or Neglect will be filed with local authorities. Students who have food and/or milk allergies must have an annual/current formal note from a physician confirming the status and type of food or milk allergy. Upon receipt of the doctor's note, a substitute food item will be provided. Students are not allowed to bring energy drinks. Student Meal Charging Policy Recognizing the occasional need for students to charge meals, the following guidelines are set in place as a collection procedure for negative balances in student meal accounts. All parents are encouraged to complete the application for free and reduced lunches. First Notice: When a student's lunch account accrues a negative balance, a reminder note is sent home to parents that day. Meals will continue to be provided to the student on a \"charging\" basis. Ala carte items may not be purchased if a student's account has a negative balance. Continued Notice: On the third consecutive day with a negative balance, a phone call will be made to parents or guardians by the Food Service Manager or Director to make arrangements to bring the account current. If they are not reached by phone, an email will be sent if available. If contact has not been made with the parent or guardian or satisfactory arrangements achieved and the student has charged 5 meals or $15.00, the student will be provided and charged for a sack lunch consisting of a sandwich and juice. The parent may be notified at this time that should the account accrue to an amount greater than $50.00 in arrears and a payment arrangement is not achieved, the account may be sent to an agency for collection. Meals will continue to be provided to the student unless the Superintendent makes a decision to stop meal service. Adult Accounts Adults are expected to pay for meals daily or in advance. If an adult account becomes negative a notice will be given to the adult staff member. Arkansas Department of Education Regulations Moment of Silence As an Arkansas charter school, AAA shall observe a one (1) minute period of silence at the beginning of each school day. This moment of silence will occur following the pledge of allegiance. During this Moment of Silence a student may, without interfering with or distracting another student, reflect, pray, or engage in a silent activity. School staff members ensure all students remain silent and do not interfere with or distract another student during the Moment of Silence. Legal Reference: ACT 576 of 2013 Library Materials Arkansas Library Materials Security Law: A.C.A. 13-2-801 et seq. provides support for school libraries in terms of keeping *\"library materials\" secure from unauthorized removal or willful mutilation. This act provides support by allowing charges to be brought against a person who violates school policies that govern library security and provides protection to the employee that detains or questions a person believed to be concealing materials. Legal charges may be brought against persons violating school policies that govern access to library materials. Before a charge can be filed, the library sends written notice that if library materials are not returned, charges will be filed. The act also allows for a person to be detained and questioned if library personnel believe a person has committed an offense or has concealed library material. This law protects library personnel that detain or question any person from civil liability. Challenging Library Materials The parent of a student or district employee (hereinafter complainant) affected by the media selection may formally challenge its appropriateness by following this policy during which the challenged material remains available. Before formal challenges are filed, the complainant contesting the selection requests a conference with the principal and is given a copy of this policy and a Request for Formal Reconsideration Form. Principal Meeting : The meeting may take place no later than five (5) working days from the date of request unless it is by choice of the complainant. In the meeting, the principal explains the selection criteria and how the challenged material fits the criteria, and the complainant explains reasons for objecting to it. If, at the end of the meeting, the complainant wishes to make a formal challenge to the selection, he/she submits a completed Request for Formal Reconsideration Form . Committee Review : The principal, as chair, selects a committee of five (5) or seven (7) licensed personnel with curriculum knowledge and diverse viewpoints to determine if the challenged material meets the criteria of selection. No material is withdrawn solely for the viewpoints expressed within it and will be reviewed in its entirety and not selected portions taken out of context. The principal convenes a meeting after giving time for committee members to review the request and the contested material. Board Final Decision: The complainant is allowed to present the complaint and then the committee meets privately to vote by secret ballot to determine if the material should be removed from the library's collection. A voting majority member writes a decision summary and gives it by hand or certified mail to the complainant. If the decision is to not remove the material, the complainant may appeal the decision to the AAA Board of Directors by filing a written appeal to the CEO no later than 5 working days of written receipt of the decision. The CEO then presents the complaint, the decision summary and an administrative recommendation, if so desired, to the Board within 15 days of the committee's decision. The Board reviews the material and makes a decision, which is final, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the information. (ACT 1786 of 2003) Literature Publication And Distribution Student Publications Publications supported financially by the school or by the use of school facilities or produced in conjunction with a class shall be considered school-sponsored publications. Such publications, as well as the content of student expression in school-sponsored activities, shall be subject to the editorial control of the administration whose actions shall be reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns and adhere to the following limitations: Advertising may not promote products inappropriate for age of audience or tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Material may not be forbidden if offensive portions are found in school facilities like the school library (i.e., quotes taken from books or publications available in the library. Material shall not criticize school personnel if criticism will result in a disruption of school operations. Prohibited publications shall include: those that are obscene as to minors, as defined by state law; those that are libelous or slanderous, as defined by state law, including material containing defamatory falsehoods about public figures, which are made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for the truth; those that constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, as defined by state law; those that incite students to the commission of unlawful acts on the school premises; those that violate school regulations; those that create a material and substantial disruption to the orderly operation of the school; and any hate literature that attacks ethnic, religious, or racial groups. Legal Reference: A.C.A. 6-18-1201 - 1204 Non-school Publications School authorities shall review non-school publications prior to their distribution and will bar from distribution those materials that are obscene, libelous, pervasively indecent, or advertise unlawful products or services. Material may also be barred if there is evidence that reasonably supports a forecast that disruption will likely result from the distribution. Such evidence shall be based on more than unsubstantiated speculation as what \"might\" happen or \"could result\" from the material's distribution. Material that is merely offensive, unpopular, or that stimulates controversy shall not be barred from distribution. Distribution of Literature: The CEO shall establish reasonable regulations governing time, place, and manner of student distribution of literature. The regulations shall: be narrowly drawn to promote orderly school activities, prevent disruptions, and not stifle expression; be uniformly applied to all forms of student literature; allow no interference with school classes/activities; specify time and places where distribution may occur; and not inhibit a person's right to accept or reject any literature distributed correctly. Child Abuse Notification The principal is prohibited from notifying the parent/guardian if there is an official investigation by legal authority dealing with suspected child maltreatment, and parent/guardian is the alleged offender or the investigator provides written documentation that notification is prohibited. State law allows Department of Human Services employees, local law enforcement, or agents of the Crimes Against Children Division of the Department of Arkansas State Police interview students without a court order for the purpose of investigating suspected child abuse. In instances where the interviewers deem it necessary, they may exercise a \"72- hour hold\" without first obtaining a court order. Other questioning of students by non-school personnel will be granted only with a court order directing the questioning, with permission of the parent/guardian, unless the student is eighteen [18] years/older, or in response to a subpoena or arrest warrant. ACT 613 of 2011 If the school reports a student's misconduct to any law enforcement agency or if access to a student is granted to a law enforcement agency due to a court order, the principal will make a good faith effort to contact the student's parent/guardian. If not a case of suspected child abuse, the principal must release a student to a police officer who presents a subpoena or warrant for arrest, to an agent of state social services, or to an agent of a court with jurisdiction and a judge signed court order. The principal then notifies the student's parent/guardian that the student was taken into custody by law enforcement or a social services agency. If unable to reach the parent, the principal will make a reasonable, good faith effort to leave a message with the principal's and the CEO's day and FERPA Student records are the property of Arkansas. Parents/guardians may not remove material from a student's file at any time. The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) governs parental/guardian access to student records. Parents/guardians have the right to inspect and copy student records of students 17 years old and under, but they do not have the right to inspect and copy student records of students 18 years old and older unless granted that right by the student. Custodial and non-custodial parents/guardians have rights to access student records UNLESS a court order exists that bars them from access AND the custodial parent has presented a file-marked legal copy of the court order. Enforcement of \"denied rights to access\" is the responsibility of the custodial parent/guardian. A parent/guardian or student 18 years old or older may challenge the accuracy per federal law by first contacting the CEO; further appeals require the appointment of an independent hearing officer.
