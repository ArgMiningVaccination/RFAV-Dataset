Both efforts focus on underrepresented communities of color and other underserved communities. And second, the Ceo Action Pledge for Diversity & i nclusion, where he joined more than 2,000 Ceo s nationally in support of advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace and reducing health care disparities in the communities that we serve. NATIONAL RECOGNITION Nine of our hospitals have been recognized as a \"Leader\" and \"t op Performer\" by the h uman r ights Campaign (hrC) f oundation's healthcare e quality i ndex (hei) for their commitment to equitable and inclusive care of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGB tq) patients, their families and team members. t his national benchmarking tool evaluates health care facilities' LGB tq-inclusive policies and best practices to provide culturally competent health care of the highest quality.LISTENING TO UNDERSTAND in August 2020, the Diversity, equity and i nclusion department launched a campaign called \"Listening t o understand\" to promote open and candid conversations among team members at h ackensack m eridian Health about racial injustice and social unrest after tragic public events that took place last year. t he goal was to understand how the team was affected and help determine how we, as an organization, would address their concerns both internally and within the community. Key findings were collected and analyzed and are helping to shape continued dialogue and action throughout the network. 100 LEADERS volunteered to facilitate the conversations 71 TEAM MEMBERS participated in 14 live or virtual sessions This data represents the pilot program. Listening to Understand is an ongoing initiative at Hackensack Meridian Health COMMUNITY EVENTS to address vaccine hesitancy amongst diverse populations, hackensack m eridian Health presented a series of very targeted webinars in collaboration with the Diversity, e quity & i nclusion department. t he webinars were uniquely developed for different communities and were presented in multiple languages, including e nglish, Spanish, h indi and Korean. BOARD LEADERSHIP As one of the most diverse states in the nation, we are deeply committed to ensuring that there is quality and opportunity for all in our hospitals and care locations and diverse representation on our board. t his is a priority as we continue to expand our board leaders and members to include many people with diverse backgrounds (view our board leadership on page 40). TEAM MEMBER RESOURCE GROUPS We are proud to offer voluntary groups that are organized around particular shared interests or dimensions of diversity. t hey offer open forums to share innovative ideas, help accomplish business goals, encourage professional development, provide networking opportunities, enhance engagement and strengthen the link within the community. t eam m ember resource Groups are as follows: Aspiring Women Leaders multicultural Pride and Allies veterans Women in Leadership Y oung Professionals 8 CoviD imPACtCOVID IMPACT 8 CoviD imPACt CoviD imPACt 9on march 4, 2020, the first positive case of C oviD-19 was identified in New Jersey at one of our hospitals - h ackensack u niversity m edical Center. No one could have predicted how the pandemic would rapidly escalate from that moment, but it put an indescribable strain on health care systems across the globe. this section offers a snapshot of how C oviD impacted h ackensack m eridian Health. What cannot be summarized on paper is the physical and emotional toll of the pandemic on our team members who worked around the clock in the face of death, loneliness and fear to heal and protect our patients and each other. 157,398 PEOPLE TESTED FOR COVID23,400 INPATIENT ADMISSIONS3,900 PATIENTS IN CRITICAL CARE4,486 INPATIENT DEATHS18,278 PATIENTS DISCHARGED TIMELINE OF COVID/hyphen.case 19 DEVELOPMENTS HMH launches vaccine trials HMH Command Center reopensAUG 27 2020 SEPT 8 2020 LATE OCT HMH launches Keeping America Safe program Wave two hits NJ NOV 16 2020HMH publishes COVID 2. 0 Playbook OCT 12 2020DEC 11 2020 First COVID vaccine gets EU A1st vaccines administered at HMH DEC 15 2020JAN 18 2021DEC 22 2020 U.S. surpasses 24 million conrmed casesNJ surpasses 1 million vaccines administere dHMH Command Center stood down FEB 12 2021FEB 9 2021 HMH surpasses 100, 000 vaccines administere d FEB 22 2021U.S. surpasses 500, 000 deaths JAN 22 2021HMH opens vaccine mega site HMH reache s wave two peak volumeFEB 19 2021 >>>>> Chinese ocials conrm dozens of cases of pneumonia in W uhanHackensack Meridian H ealth Network Command Ce nter stood upDEC 31 2019 JAN 7 2020 JAN 21 2020 Outbreak identied as new coronavirus First U .S. case identied in Washington state MAR 2 2020MAR 4 2020 First case identied in NJ at H ackensack University Medical Ce nterCOVID- 19 pandemic declared by WH O MAR 11 2020 1st death in NJ MAR 10 2020MAR 13 2020MAR 12 2020 Federal government declared national emer gencyHMH administers clinical trial treatment to 1,000th patientHMH opens COVID Recover y Center NJ remove s indoor mask mandate JUNE 7 2020MAY 26 2020 1,000th person dischar ged from HMHAPRIL 28 2020 Network Command Center stood down APR 9 2020Hackensack Meridian Health reached peak patient volume MAY 5 20205,000th person dischar ged from HMH HMH CDI Launches Rapid Response Te stJULY 16 2020 MAY 28 2021>>>>>10 CoviD imPACt one of the biggest challenges of the pandemic was ensuring we had appropriate staffing to properly care for our patients and keep everyone safe. m any team members were not able to come to work, either due to confirmed or suspected C oviD illness or the need to stay home to take care of their own family or children. As the number of team members out of work grew, so did the volume and severity of C oviD patients at our hospitals. We also introduced many new C oviD-specific processes that required additional hands. t o address these staffing issues, several initiatives took place: A dedicated Staffing Command Center and Workforce reassignment office (W ro) were promptly stood up to evaluate how we could reassign existing team members to support C oviD needs. the human resources and nursing leadership teams worked closely with an external partner to secure a large number of clinical agency workers. Support staff were hired at a rapid rate to fulfill the needs of CoviD-specific processes.ALL HANDS ON DECK680 clinical and non-clinical staffing demands were submitted to the WRO from November 2020 - February 2021 420 WRO requests were fulfilled by reassigned network services team members 1,140+ clinical agency workers were hiredNearly 1,000 support staff were hired to handle pandemic- specific roles, such as symptom screening and vaccination operationsTemperature checker/ screener Fit-testing supervisor Family communication specialist Contact tracer Clinical helper Personal protective equipment observerExamples of roles include: CoviD imPACt 11CREATIVELY EXPANDING CAPACITY As the number of C oviD patients rapidly increased, we had to quickly find ways to expand our patient care areas. t his was especially pressing at h ackensack u niversity medical Center - the hospital within our network that treated the most C oviD patients. t he team mobilized quickly to redesign unused patient care areas, most notably the cafeteria, which was converted into a 74-bed specialized care unit. Additionally, the hospital, which typically operates 48 adult intensive Care u nit (iCu) beds, converted medical-surgical units into iCu beds. facility crews working around the clock converted unused spaces into intensive care units to expand total capacity to 167 critical care beds, more than triple the original capacity. o ther hospitals throughout the network added iCu beds in record time as well, while also erecting large tents outdoors to create space for testing and triage as needed. TESTING /DRIVE-THRU SITES We opened several drive thru CoviD testing tent sites to bring safe and convenient testing to our community, including our most vulnerable communities and first responders. t he sites provided CoviD tests free of charge, and more than 6,000 community members have been screened at those sites since m arch. t he sites were staffed by h ackensack meridian Health physicians and other clinicians and community outreach members, who in addition to the tests, helped provide infection prevention education. o pening of the sites not only provided improved access to testing, but also provided a safer environment in physician offices for routine medical care without the concern of potential cross-contamination.CARE BEYOND RECOVERY in July 2020, we opened New Jersey's first center dedicated to assisting C oviD-19 patients who experience lingering effects of CoviD-19 after recovering from the virus. t hrough the h ackensack meridian C oviD r ecovery Center, patients receive a health assessment and are provided a customized care plan, along with coordination with specialists, as needed. t o date, we have not only helped hundreds of people reclaim their lives after CoviD, but have studied the many ways this virus impacts people long- term, even if they experienced a mild or moderate case of the illness. 12 CoviD imPACt1,123 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN OUR COPING WITH COVID SESSIONS300 CALLS PLACED TO THE TEAM MEMBER SUPPORT & NAVIGATION LINE 586 PEOPLE ENROLLED IN OUR EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (as of 10/20/20)581 PEOPLE REGISTERED FOR OUR STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM TOTAL PROJECTED LOAN FORGIVENESS OF $13.6 MILLION SINCE FEBRUARY 2020679 PEOPLE SOUGHT PEER-TO-PEER SUPPORT THROUGH WECARE Data as of April 2021frontline caregivers are faced with physically and emotionally challenging jobs. With the added demands of the pandemic, the number of people who needed support increased exponentially. At h ackensack meridian Health, we formed a team dedicated to team member well-being, and a number of resources were provided that not only focused on emotional health, but social, spiritual, physical and financial well-being. i t was critical that the team knew they could and should reach out for help.teAm memBer WELL-BEING 13VACCINES: A SHOT TO END THE PANDEMIC As C oviD-19 vaccines were in clinical trials and development, plans were being developed at h ackensack meridian Health for mass distribution once approved. in December 2020, when the first C oviD-19 vaccine received emergency use authorization (eu A), we worked in lockstep with the New Jersey Department of h ealth to put our plans into action. o ur hospitals were set up as vaccine distribution sites, and we partnered with the state and National Guard to open the largest vaccine mega- site in the state of New Jersey at the m eadowlands r ace track. As additional vaccines received eu A, we quickly pivoted to add these products to our supply and get more people vaccinated. t hrough our vaccination program, we are committed to \" making C oviD h istory\". 25 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION LOCATIONS 325,823 PEOPLE VACCINATED 611,784 VACCINE DOSES ADMINISTEREDKEEPING AMERICA SAFE CoviD-19 was a challenge not only for hospitals and health networks, but has strained many other businesses, large and small, as they attempted to navigate through all of the information, guidelines and mandates. While essential businesses tried to determine how to remain open and others planned for a safe return to work, we became part of the solution and launched the h ackensack m eridian Health: Keeping America Safe (KAS) program in July 2020. KAS is a comprehensive turnkey solution that provides schools and businesses with a large team of h ackensack m eridian Health experts, including clinical, facilities and marketing experts, that share best practices around C oviD-19 risk. A survey amongst KAS clients resulted in a 95% NET PROMOTER SCORE compared to the service industry standard of 42% 200+ businesses received assistance from the KAS program KAS partnered with the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine and Hackensack Meridian Children's Health teams to guide school leaders in underprivileged communities Words cannot describe what took place in 2020, especially when C oviD first hit and there was little knowledge about how the virus was spreading, what it was capable of and how to properly treat it.

At the time, it was taking days to more than a week to confirm a suspected CoviD case. t he CDi 's test dramatically reduced the time from days to hours. t his development was a game-changer in our emergency response, enabling us to identify positive and negative patients much faster and triage them appropriately. it also helped define risk to our staff and reserve scarce quarantine space for those who really needed it. Throughout the pandemic, THE CDI'S TEST WAS USED MORE THAN 7,500 TIMES - and it has been licensed out for use, meaning likely tens of thousands of more patients were effectively diagnosed.ADVANCING CLINICAL TRIALS CoviD-19 patients at h ackensack meridian Health have had access to many clinical trials throughout the course of the pandemic, from antiviral drugs to immunotherapies, convalescent plasma and more. t he trials include treatments from major pharmaceutical companies, such as the anti-viral r emdesivir and regeneron's monoclonal antibody SPiK e trial, as well as investigator- initiated research aimed at turning the tide against the coronavirus pandemic. t he investigators and clinicians worked on the trials across the network and virtually round- the-clock, especially early in the pandemic. h ackensack m eridian Health experts have been involved in the work since the earliest stages of the pandemic. NEARLY 1,300 PATIENTS WERE ADMINISTERED THESE TREATMENTS in the period when there was no vaccine or fully tested drug for the newly-discovered SARS-CoV2. UNIVERSAL REAL-TIME DATABASE the research team at h ackensack meridian Health developed a CoviD-19 u niversal r eal-time Database. t he database, populated with data extracted from electronic health records of C oviD-19 positive patients throughout our hospitals, has been a tremendous resource for the research community. i t has been used and will continue to be used, to advance knowledge about the epidemiology, presenting features, role of comorbidities in the severity of illness and effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. t he database has resulted in a series of publications that have pointed the way to clinical strategies which may be proven effective with further structured trials and scientific investigations.

Department of Defense. REPRESENTATION IN MAJOR JOURNALS Clinicians across our network have published 139 PUBLICATIONS based on experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic. the publications include best- practice recommendations in the \"new normal\" of preventing new infections, perspectives on how some aspects of medicine are apt to change, and also some case histories from patients infected with the SArS-Co v2 virus. Some of the journals where these papers appear include New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA Internal Medicine, the BMJ, The Lancet Rheumatology, Clinical Infectious Disease and Science Immunology, among many others. through this important work, our clinicians, research scientists, nurses and academics are all contributing their own vital pieces to this enormous puzzle. COVID-19 DRUG DISCOVERY the discovery of new drugs is essential to our short- and long-term strategy to treat patients who develop CoviD-19 disease, especially the susceptible unvaccinated population and immunosuppressed patients who do not mount a strong protective response to the vaccine. in collaboration with m erck and with funding from the National i nstitutes of h ealth, CDi scientists are actively evaluating advanced lead compounds and developing them as potential next-generation drug candidates to treat and prevent disease. CDI VIRUS SEQUENCING AND VARIANT TRACING the team at the CDi tracked mutations and variations early on in the spread of the SArS-Co v-2 virus. t he variant test developed by Nancy Zhao, m.D., Ph.D., along with genome sequencing of virus by the Barry Kreiswirth, Ph.D. lab was instrumental in determining that the \"uK variant\" overtook the previous \"wild-type\" strain of the virus in the early months of 2021, placing our team at the forefront of surveillance in the State of New Jersey. But the CDi team has also been monitoring other C oviD-19 developments, including but not limited to: \"breakthrough cases\" among vaccinated h ackensack m eridian Health team members who became infected with the virus; the case study of an immunocompromised patient who developed some hallmark variations in the virus at the very beginning of the pandemic, in April 2020; and also the careful tracking of a novel variant at the Carrier Clinic in late 2020 which was essentially stamped out, showing the power of careful infection control and ongoing outbreak surveillance. reSeArCh & DiSC overY 17CLiNiCAL reSeArCh hackensack m eridian Health offers studies of novel agents that are not available elsewhere, from promising targeted therapies to immunotherapies.

By sequencing entire genomes for DNA modifications, and analyzing both cancerous and healthy tissues, h ackensack m eridian Health researchers and doctors found that specific locations in the DNA where expression changes (methylation) are imbalanced could be key to risks for cancer and other diseases. t hese findings are according to a collaborative paper in the major journal Genome Biology on June 29 authored by researchers from the CDi , hackensack u niversity m edical Center and John t heurer Cancer Center, and the National Cancer institute-recognized Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Consortium. t he most disease-relevant genetic variants can be hard to localize in widespread scanning of the genome - but by zooming in on key genetic locations associated with these DNA methylation imbalances in multiple normal and cancer tissues, the scientists report they have uncovered promising new leads beneath the broader statistical signals. t his work was also led by Benjamin t ycko, m.D., Ph.D. ONCOLOGY RELATED WORKHACKENSACK MERIDIAN tioNEDUCATION eDuCA tioN march 2018, Seton h all u niversity and hackensack m eridian Health determined that joint ownership of the m edical School was not in the School's best interest.

FROM THE HEART for longtime supporters Sharon and Joseph L. m uscarelle, Jr., it was an easy decision to generously pledge $2.5 million to benefit the h eart and vascular h ospital at h ackensack university m edical Center. for decades, the muscarelle f amily has dedicated its service to the hospital, with Joseph's father serving on the board of then h ackensack h ospital and his mother volunteering at the auxiliary- operated Corner Shop. Before retiring, Joseph also volunteered at the medical center, assisting with surgery admissions and other tasks, devoting more than 15 years of service. h e has also served as a longstanding member of the advisory board to the h eart and v ascular hospital. When Joseph underwent his own cardiac experience, he and Sharon truly understood the complexity of cardiovascular disease and were compelled to make a gift to benefit cardiovascular physicians and patients. i n recognition of the muscarelle family's leadership and generous commitment, h ackensack university m edical Center dedicated and named its comprehensive catheterization facility t he muscarelle f amily Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories.30 teChNoL oGY AND CLiNiCAL iNNov AtioNTECHNOLOGY CLINICAL INNOVATION teChNoL oGY AND CLiNiCAL iNNov AtioN 31HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER performed the first total knee replacement surgery in the nation utilizing the TSolution One\u00ae Total Knee Application by thiNK Surgical, i nc. after the groundbreaking technology received u .S. food and Drug Administration (fDA) approval in o ctober 2019. t he system combines two exclusive innovations to advance total joint replacement surgery to offer a more personal and precise surgical experience. the Association of Academic Physiatrists recognized the Stroke- heArt(tm) t rials at JFK JOHNSON REHABILITATION INSTITUTE as the best research published in 2019 in the field's most prestigious journal. Co-Principal investigators Sara Cuccurullo, m.D., and t alya f leming, m.D., were recognized for their work. Dr. Cuccurullo is vice president and medical director of the JfK Johnson r ehabilitation i nstitute and Dr. f leming is director of the JfK Johnson Aftercare and Stroke recovery Programs. t he study proves the benefit of medically monitored interval cardiovascular training for patients during stroke rehabilitation.JERSEY SHORE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER'S CENTER FOR PARALYSIS AND RECONSTRUCTIVE NERVE SURGERY celebrated a significant milestone of treating its 500th patient with phrenic nerve reconstruction surgery. Surgeon matthew Kaufman, m.D., f ACS is a pioneer in this type of surgery, which helps people with diaphragm paralysis from spinal cord injury, as well as others who have isolated phrenic nerve injuries following surgery, breathe without a ventilator or breath more easily again. Patients have traveled to Jersey Shore u niversity m edical Center from all around the world for this specialized surgery. JFK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER became the first hospital in New Jersey to operate Swoop, a new portable MRI that can be wheeled to the bedside of critically ill patients. m anufactured by h yperfine r esearch, Swoop is the world's first portable mri and enables clinicians to obtain neurological images of critically ill patients at the point of care quickly and conveniently. JERSEY SHORE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER OPENED THE CENTER FOR ADVANCED SKULL BASE SURGERY where an accomplished team collaborates to treat adults and children with tumors and other abnormalities of the cranial base. By combining the expertise of a diverse group of highly trained specialists with the latest technology, the Center for Advanced Skull Base Surgery means patients are able to enjoy a much faster and easier recovery. HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER became the first hospital in the nation to successfully implant the world's first heart failure neuromodulation device, BAroStim Neo. this innovative technology is an effective alternative for patients with Congestive h eart f ailure who are ineligible for other forms of therapy such as Cardiac r esynchronization therapy (Crt). Although 2020 was spent primarily focused on responding to the C oviD-19 pandemic, our team did not stop propelling medicine forward in other key areas. Below is a snapshot of several clinical innovations and new technologies that were brought to h ackensack m eridian Health in 2020 and early 2021. 32 in a continuing effort to advance health care innovation in New Jersey, THREE OF THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE LEADERS ANNOUNCED BRAVEN HEALTHSM, A NEW MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN . Braven health is the first and only New Jersey m edicare plan owned and operated jointly by the state's most trusted health insurer, h orizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey (horizon BCBSNJ) and two of the state's leading health networks, hackensack m eridian Health and rWJBarnabas h ealth. i n early 2021, Braven h ealth made history with its inaugural enrollment, enrolling more members - more than 13,000 - than all New Jersey m edicare Advantage plans did across its eight counties for 2021.A new CT CALCIUM SCORING scan is now offered at several locations throughout h ackensack meridian Health. t his life-saving test provides patients and their health care providers with the most accurate available \"picture\" of their current risk of developing heart disease or experiencing a heart attack. Southern Ocean Medical Center's imaging manager, Kevin Jester, stepped in to test the CT Calcium Scoring Scan before opening it up to patients. Although Kevin has high blood pressure, he had no family history of heart disease or any symptoms of heart disease. A routine heart health check- up six months prior also indicated that all was normal. Kevin's calcium scan results surprisingly revealed he was at high risk for a stroke or heart attack. In follow, up Kevin found out he had one 100-percent artery blockage, and three arteries that were 80-percent blocked. Within a week and a half of getting the calcium scan, Kevin had quadruple bypass surgery. After a week in the hospital and a month of home care, Kevin is doing great. While low-dose spiral Ct scanning has been shown to be effective for lung cancer screening, more than 90% of lung nodules are discovered incidentally on x-ray or Ct scans. RIVERVIEW MEDICAL CENTER'S NEW LUNG NODULE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM features a protocol for the assessment and follow-up of patients incidentally diagnosed with suspicious lung nodules. i ncidental lung nodules detected on Ct scanning are common, however, few centers have formal programs to provide follow-up care. MOUNTAINSIDE MEDICAL CENTER launched the Stereotactic Body Therapy (SBRT) program in April 2020. u sing the t rueBeam\u00ae platform doctors can monitor a patient's position very precisely in real-time. t his new level of precision means patients get exactly the radiation needed to eradicate a tumor, in fewer visits, with fewer side effects. t he r adiation o ncology Department at m ountainside, led by medical director, Brett Lewis, m.D., Ph.D., means patients no longer need to travel for treatment and can receive quality care close to home. SBrt is also offered at several other sites throughout h ackensack meridian Health, showcasing excellence across the network. PASCACK VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER enhanced the r obotic suite of services by adding a Da v inci Surgical System. t he robotic surgical suite now includes one Da v inci Surgical System, the Senhance Surgical System and the two mAK o r obotic arms. the boutique hospital located in the heart of the Pascack valley continues to be a leader in gynecological, general and orthopedic surgery. teChNoL oGY AND CLiNiCAL iNNov AtioN 33HACKENSACK MERIDIAN CHILDREN'S HEALTH had a busy year, introducing several program innovations, especially in pediatric cancer, nephrology and neurosciences. Pediatric Cancer Pediatric oncologists at both Joseph m. Sanzari Children's hospital and K. h ovnanian Children's h ospital are leading cutting-edge clinical research. recent research highlights include: a new therapy that may reduce side effects for children receiving brain cancer treatment a novel therapy program that helps avoid the use of a stem cell transplant, and its toxic effects safer and more effective treatment options for pediatric thrombosis Pediatric Nephrology our two children's hospitals are the clinical coordinating centers for the world's largest registry for crescentic glomerulonephritis. the registry is expected to become an international registry soon and will deliver significant novel discoveries around crescentic glomerulonephritis in the coming years. our two children's hospitals are the country's leading utilizers of a genetic testing panel for kidney disease that is available at no cost to patients. t he goal is to eventually discover a genetic connection to all diagnoses. Pediatric Neurosciences K. h ovnanian Children's h ospital is home to a new program - the state's first Child Neurology r esidency Program. Caring for kids with epilepsy is a priority at h ackensack meridian Children's h ealth. m ultiple studies at Joseph m. Sanzari Children's h ospital are focused on reducing seizures for patients with severe forms of epilepsy. Physicians at the Children's h ospital are also advocating for earlier referral for surgical evaluation in patients with medically refractory epilepsy (mre). Despite its proven efficacy and safety, surgery continues to be dramatically underutilized for patients with mre . 34 fACiLitieS 34 fACiLitieSFACILITIES fACiLitieS 35While we continued to propel medicine and innovation forward during the CoviD-19 pandemic, we also remained on track with a number of important facility advancements.
