We are pioneers in the use of various techniques in health, wellness and pain management. We are involved in training, application and, as a research university, our focus is on seeking the truth in health. Our ultimate goal is to seek truth in various methodologies spanning from ancient wisdom to the present and apply it in the treatment of health imbalances to restore health and wellness. We are held in trust, with the intent to create a secure and unhindered platform to foster and disseminate health, wellness, research, education and healing methodologies for generations to come. 3 Core Reasons To Begin Your Degree ... Reason #1 Join the New Paradigm As A UHSS graduate, you will be part of the new paradigm of healing and belong to a unified and rapidly growing global community of healers. This is the new model: not just \"Naturopathic Medicine\" or \"Spiritual Medicine\"; rather, the best that both have to offer...as a Naturopathic Spiritual Medicine Doctor. This means that you will follow in the footsteps of great healers who came long before commissions were created to attempt to regulate healing. Reason #2 Heal Globally As a UHSS graduate, you will be able to legitimately promote and carry out healing in every corner of the world. Our graduates have the divinely ordained legal right to establish healing centers virtually anywhere in the world (well, in at least in 193 countries where the United Nations presence has guaranteed the freedom of practice through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.) Reason #3 Grow with the Field You will be part of the growing field of \"Health, Wellness and Spirituality\", having received the knowledge and skills to teach and inform others. Within your own institute you will be able to provide healing and guidance to those who seek wellness. Additionally, you will have the potential to earn a position as a mentor in the UHSS, upon approval by the UHSS board. Your education will provide a long-term investment in your future.
