They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. Preprints posted online allow authors to receive rapid feedback and the entire scientific community can appraise the work for themselves and respond appropriately. Those comments are posted alongside the preprints for anyone to read them and serve as a post publication assessment. Use of recently vaccinated individuals to detect bias in test-negative case-control studies of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (preprint) to confounding, [selection bias], and misclassification can be mitigated through careful study design, unmeasured confounding is likely to remain in these observational studies. Phase III trials of [COVID-19 vaccines]have shown that [protection]from [vaccination]does not occur immediately, meaning that COVID-19 [risk]should be [similar]in recently vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, in the absence of confounding or other [bias]. Several studies have used the estimated [effectiveness]among recently vaccinated individuals as a negative control exposure to detect [bias]in [vaccine effectiveness]estimates. In this [paper]we introduce a theoretical framework to describe the interpretation of such a [bias]- [indicator]in test-negative studies, and outline assumptions that would allow the use of recently vaccinated individuals to correct [bias]due to unmeasured ...
