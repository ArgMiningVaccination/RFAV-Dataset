A mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes decreases the body's ability to suppress breast tumors, thereby increasing the risk for breast cancer. Women who inherit a mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes have an approximately 60% increased lifetime risk for breast cancer.BreastThe breast is the tissue that overlies the ribcage and chest muscle. In women, breasts are part of the female reproductive system and are comprised of glandular tissue that produces milk (lobules) in addition to fatty and lymphatic tissue. The female breasts also contain a network of ducts, which convey milk from the lobules to the nipple.Breast CancerIn breast cancer, malignant (cancerous) cells grow abnormally in the breast. If left undetected or untreated, breast cancer can grow into surrounding tissues or metastasize to distant areas of the body. While breast cancer occurs almost exclusively in women, men can also be affected. Signs of breast cancer include a lump in the breast and nipple or breast skin changes. CA 19-9CA 19-9 is a tumor marker used to assess the presence of pancreatic tumors.Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein found in the tissues of a developing baby. Levels of CEA are greatly reduced after birth. High levels of CEA in adults may be a sign of some types of cancer.CD4 + T-helper CellsCD4 + T-helper cells are cells that send \"help\" signals to the other immune cells (ie, CD8+ killer T cells) to make them more efficient at destroying harmful invaders. Also maintain lines of communication with B cells.CD8+ Killer T CellsCD8+ killer T cells are cells that destroy thousands of bacteria and viruses each day. They can even seek out and destroy cancer cells.Checkpoint InhibitorsCheckpoint inhibitors are drugs used to \"release the brakes\" on the immune system, allowing the body to respond more aggressively to cancer.ChemotherapyChemotherapy, often called \"chemo,\" is a treatment with drugs that kill cancer cells. This treatment can be used alone or with surgery and/or radiation.Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells (CAR-Ts)Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) are a type of engineered T cell used in adoptive T cell transfer.

The regular contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm enables the lungs to fill and empty with air.Double-Blind TrialIn a double-blind trial, neither the patient nor the study researchers know who is receiving the experimental treatment.Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)Ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the duct cells. DCIS is typically considered \"pre-cancer\" as it has not invaded the breast tissue or spread in the body. Women diagnosed with DCIS have a very high likelihood of being cured.Ducts of the BreastThe ducts of the breast form a network of tiny tubes that carry milk from the milk-producing lobules to the nipple. Most breast cancers begin in the cells that line the ducts and are therefore called \"ductal cancers.\"Durable Response (DR)Durable response, commonly referred to as DR, is the length of time that a patient experiences a complete or partial response as a result of treatment. EndocrineThe endocrine part of the pancreas releases insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.Endoscopic UltrasoundEndoscopic ultrasound uses a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope that has a built-in miniature ultrasound probe to explore the digestive tract and create visual images with sound waves.Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)Epidermal growth factor receptor, also called EGFR, is a biomarker found in certain patients with lung cancer. Patients with EGFR-positive lung tumors may be candidates for targeted therapies that can improve prognosis and decrease risk for side effects.Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is also called herpesvirus 4. EBV can be transmitted through saliva and other bodily fluids and is associated with diseases such as mononucleosis, lymphoma, and head and neck cancer.Estrogen-Receptor Positive (ER+) Breast CancerIn estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, breast cancer cells receive growth signals from the female hormone estrogen. Hormonal therapies for ER+ breast cancer therefore seek to lower the amount of estrogen in the body and block its action on breast tissue.Exclusion CriteriaExclusion criteria are characteristics that disqualify patients from participating in a clinical trial. These criteria may include gender, age, type of disease being treated, previous treatments, and other medical conditions.ExocrineThe exocrine part of the pancreas produces digestive enzymes that are released into the small intestine. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)Fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, is a screening test that can be performed on breast cancer tissue removed during a biopsy.

Some genetic mutations are associated with some types of cancer.Gland CellsGland cells produce the secretions that constitute many common types of bodily fluid, including semen, mucus, and saliva.Gleason SystemPathologists use the Gleason system to assess prostate tumor cells. By observing prostate tumor cells under a microscope and scoring the different cellular patterns observed, pathologists are able to determine if a tumor is more or less likely to spread. GlucagonGlucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas. Glucagon is released into the bloodstream when blood sugar is low (eg, between meals) in order to release sugar stored in the liver.GlycolipidsGlycolipids are lipids with a carbohydrate attached. Glycolipids provide energy and serve as markers for cellular recognition.Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, commonly referred to as GM-CSF, is a type of cytokine that stimulates the bone marrow to make more immune cells and blood cells. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)Hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF, is a cytokine that is released after tissue injury. In patients with lung cancer, higher levels of HGF may indicate more aggressive disease.Hormone-Lowering TherapyHormone-lowering therapy is also called androgen deprivation therapy or androgen suppression therapy. The goal of this type of treatment is to reduce levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body, as these hormones can make prostate tumors grow. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2)The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) gene makes proteins responsible for maintaining healthy cell growth, division and repair of breast tissue. When there is a mutation in the HER2 gene, HER2 receptors are overexpressed. This overexpression makes breast cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, which can play a role in the development of cancerHuman Papilloma Virus (HPV)Human papilloma virus (HPV) infects the DNA of the skin or mucus membrane and is known to cause head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, and other forms. Of the many known strains, HPV16 and HPV18 are thought to be the most dangerous. IDO Pathway InhibitorsIDO pathway inhibitors block activity of an enzyme called IDO, which has been found in tumor cells. The IDO enzyme is believed to play a role in suppressing the immune system, which may keep the body from fighting cancer effectively.Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/ModulatorsImmune checkpoints play a key role in controlling immune responses. Checkpoint inhibitors can be used to \"release the brakes\" allowing the immune system to respond appropriately to the cancer. This is a \"negative signaling \" approach. Immunotherapies may also stimulate immune responses controlled by these checkpoints. This is a \"positive signaling\" approach.Immune ModulatorsImmune modulators are drugs used to \"step on the gas\" of the immune response, allowing the body to respond more aggressively to cancerImmune SystemThe immune system is a highly evolved network of organs, cells, and molecules that helps defend the body against threats such as bacteria, viruses\u2014and even cancer.Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR)Immune-related complete response is a measure of effectiveness used in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials.

The purpose of these trials may include seeing how a treatment affects the human body and establishing a safe dose.Phase II TrialA phase II trial is an intermediate-stage trial that is composed of less than 100 patients. The purpose of these trials may include determining if a treatment is effective for a particular type of cancer.Phase III TrialA phase III trial is a large-scale trial that generally enrolls more than 100 patients. The purpose of this trial is to compare a new treatment (or a suggested new treatment) with either a placebo product or the current standard of care.PlaceboPlacebo is a \"dummy\" treatment, or sugar pill, that is designed to look like the treatment being tested, but is not active.Preventative Cancer VaccinesPreventative cancer vaccines target infectious agents that cause or contribute to the development of cancer. Similar to traditional vaccines, they help the immune system identify antigens.Progesterone-Receptor Positive (PR+) Breast CancerIn progesterone-receptor positive (PR+) breast cancer, breast cancer cells receive growth signals from the female hormone progesterone. Hormonal therapies for PR+ breast cancer therefore seek to lower the amount of progesterone in the body and block its action on breast tissue.ProstateThe prostate is a gland of the male reproductive system that helps make semen\u2014the fluid that nourishes sperm. Prostate CancerProstate cancer is a type of tumor that forms in the tissues of the prostate. It is one of the most common cancers in men, and usually affects older adults (>65 years of age).Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)Prostate-specific antigen (or PSA) is a protein produced by the cells of the prostate gland. While PSA is found mostly in semen, it is also found in smaller concentrations in the blood. These blood PSA levels are used as part of routine screening to assess a man's risk for prostate cancer. RadiationRadiation, or radiation therapy, uses high-energy particles or waves to destroy or damage cancer cells. One of the most common treatments for cancer, it can be used alone or with other forms of treatment.Randomized TrialA randomized trial is a type of clinical trial in which patients are assigned to groups on a random basis where they receive either the new experimental treatment or the established standard of care (or a placebo).Receptor Protein 4-1BB/CD137Receptor protein 4-1BB/CD137 is found on many immune cells that have been activated.

They are named after the two researchers who discovered them.Regulatory T CellsRegulatory T cells are cells that provide the checks and balances to make sure the immune system doesn't overreact.RemissionRemission refers to a complete or partial disappearance of the signs and symptoms of cancer in response to treatment. It is a period in which the disease is considered under control, but may not be cured. Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN)A serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) is a rare tumor of the pancreas that is usually benign. These tumors are cysts filled with serous fluid.Single-Blind TrialIn a single-blind trial, the patient will not know if he or she is receiving the experimental treatment, but the researcher will know.SkinThe skin is the largest organ in the body. Our skin protects us from the external environment, as well as helping to regulate internal body temperature. The skin is composed of 3 layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis.Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)Small-cell lung cancer, or SCLC, is one of the 2 major types of lung cancer and accounts for 10% to 15% of all lung cancer cases.

It filters blood and provides storage for platelets and white blood cells. Also serves as a site where key immune cells (B cells) multiply in order to fight harmful invaders.Squamous Cell CarcinomaSquamous cell carcinoma is one of the main subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. It accounts for about 25% to 30% of NSCLC tumors.Stages of Lung CancerThe stages of lung cancer are used to determine the extent of disease. Staging is based on whether the tumor is local to the lungs, or has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body\u2014as well as how deeply it has invaded surrounding tissues.StagingStaging is used to determine the extent (or \"stage\") of a person's cancer. It is based on whether the tumor is local to its area of origin, or has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body\u2014as well as how deeply it has invaded surrounding tissues.Stem CellsStem cells are unspecialized cells that have the potential to develop into other cell types during early life and growth. TelomeraseTelomerase is a type of protein found in nearly all cancer cells.

Cancer vaccines specifically stimulate the immune system to attack cancer.Thymus GlandThe thymus gland is a small immune gland situated in the upper chest beneath the breastbone. Functions as the site where key immune cells (T cells) mature into cells that can fight infection and cancer.TNM Staging SystemThe TNM staging system is one of the most common and useful tools used to determine the extent (stage) of a person's cancer. In the TNM staging system, cancer is assigned a letter that describes the tumor, node, and metastasis, and a number that designates its growth and spread into nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant organs. Toll-Like Receptor Ligands (TLRs)Toll-like receptor ligands, or TLRs, are a type of adjuvant immunotherapy used to enhance the body's immune response.Triple Negative Breast CancerTriple negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that does not express receptors for the hormones estrogen and progesterone, or for human epidermal growth factor. Because most breast cancer treatments target one or more of these receptors, triple negative breast cancer may be more difficult to treat.TROP-2TROP-2 is a protein expressed by many forms of cancer.TumorA tumor is an abnormal lump or mass of tissue. Tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs)Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, are a type of white blood cell found in tumors. TILs can be removed from a tumor, enhanced, and then reinfused back into the body where they attack and destroy tumor cells. TIL therapy is considered a form of adoptive T cell transfer. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, also called VEGFR, is a biomarker found in certain patients with lung cancer. Patients with VEGFR-positive lung tumors may be candidates for targeted therapies that can improve prognosis and decrease risk for side effects White Blood CellsWhite blood cells help defend the body against infections. There are many types, and certain cancer treatments (including chemotherapy) reduce the number of these cells. If a person has low white blood cell counts, they can be more likely to get infections.Wnt PathwayThe Wnt pathway is a signaling pathway that is active during embryonic development. Mutations of the Wnt pathway are observed in some cancers. Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)Xeroderma pigmentosum, also called XP, is an inherited (genetic) condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet rays.
