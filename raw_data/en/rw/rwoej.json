It works with the energy of DNA molecules, the deepest levels of the human systems and the life-force that enlivens a person physically, intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. DNA energy impacts the sub-conscious mind to create belief systems which ultimately lead to certain patterns of thinking and behavior. Life experiences can be powerful enough to alter the functioning of DNA energy. The altered flow or function of the energy can cause beliefs that will be either beneficial or harmful. Interrupted, damaged, and malfunctioning DNA energy manifests in symptoms which reduce quality of life and cause enormous challenges... but it can be repaired! DNA Energy Therapy is a systematic technique that isolates negative beliefs, limiting thought patterns, and self-defeating behaviors which stem in the subconscious from the malfunctioning energetic process in the DNA energy. The energy of DNA is accessed to heal, clear, and stimulate it's healthy and optimal functioning. This therapeutic system addresses the core issue thatleads to unhealthy patterns of beliefs, emotions, thoughts or behaviors, then works to create new, life-supporting, empowering beliefs to repattern subconscious thoughts and belief systems and generate new patterns of health and wellness.

DNA Energy Re-Patterning is a process to identify the 'Core Belief'- negative pattern of thinking, feeling, or behaving- that must change. Marilee facilitates the process with compassion and without judgement to release the negative subconscious pattern and prepare for the new pattern of health and empowerment. This effective and unique method quickly identifies the issue that is no longer serving an individual's health\u2014a Core Belief\u2014 then neutralizes it and replaces it with a New Belief that nurtures wellness. This dynamic process harnesses the innate intelligence and wisdom of the body and connects the individual's subconscious with the stored information of balance and health held in DNA. DNA Energy Re-Patterning engages the individual's intuitive wisdom and the intelligence of DNA energy to identify the disturbance created by the limiting Core Belief. Through this interactive process, the core belief and associated disturbance is neutralized and released. The individual is assisted and empowered to create a New Belief that effectively supports health and wellbeing in all aspects of life. The DNA Energy Re-Patterning can be processed in one single session, however, the process can be repeated as many times as needed to effectively address the Core Belief disturbance, to address multiple Core Belief disturbances, or to solidify the New Belief.
