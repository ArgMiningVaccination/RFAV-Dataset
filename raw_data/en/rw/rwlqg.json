A cohort study published in JAMA Network Open determined that pregnant and lactating people tolerated the COVID booster well. Investigators in this prospective online cohort study looked at 17,014 eligible participants. Approximately 11.8% of participants were pregnant when receiving the booster or the third COVID vaccine. The percentage of lactating individuals was 60.4%, while the final 27.8% of participants were neither pregnant nor lactating but were planning a pregnancy. Of the pregnant individuals receiving the booster or the third dose, the most significant proportion, 37.1%, were in the third trimester. The first- and second-trimester ratio was 26.4% and 36.5%, respectively. "}
