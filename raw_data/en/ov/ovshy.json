Infe mation reported relates to: health care manpower in the traditional sector; treatment seeking behavior in a pluralistic medical setting; traditional health beliefs and practices; payment practices; patterns of patient referral; attempts to estAblish an association of healers; attitudes of healers toward paraprofessional training; and possibilities for specific types of cooperation between modern a;id -traditional health sectors. NIRODULTION AND POLCY BACKGROUND As elsewhere in Africa, the Swaziland Ministry of Heal!h has had an ambiguous policy or non-policy attempt intowards traditional healers. There was an 1945-1946, during the colonial administration, to for the regis-pass legislation that would provide tration and taxation of traditional healers, and would attempt to control their activities. Prior to that time and dating back to 1894, all 'witch-docor.ng' was considered illegal in Swaziland. Thus the 1945-1946 proposed legislation would have amounted to official recognition of hzalers on the part of the government, However, due to vigorous opposition f'rom the then director of med ;al services, the ;2gislation never we..t into effect. The late King Sobhuza II was generally supportive of tradilional healing. He felt that Western healing ideas and practices should not simply be accepted uncritically and adopted wholesale to the destruction of traditional Swazi ways. Instead he envi!.ioned the development of a health care systcm that combined the best aspects of both tradition'l and modern medicines, lie also believed that a scientific study of traditional healing should be undertaken before attempting to restric,' or alter practicer, [I]. In 1954, the King issued an executive 'Order-in- Council' which represented the fu::her development of the earlier proposed legislation. The Order dealt with registration, fee payment, referral of patients to clinics, misconduct and malpractice. Registration and taxation of healers began in the same year and records were kept by the Swazi National Council, a traditional executive body under the King. The King called two meetings at the Royal Loba- mba kraal in 1979 and 1981 to discuss the formation of a new structure to guide traditional medicine, These meetings were fo!lowed by a directive to the Ministry of Health to look into ways of organizing healers. The Minister responded by forming a Coin- mission for Traditional Medicine whose function wa-, to recommend ways of organizing and regulating healers. The Commission drafted revised legislation modeled upon that which applies to the modern Medical and Dental Council. The draft dealt with registration, code of conduct, fee paynent, and the formation of an association of healers. The passing of the King in 1982 interrupted the development of the Commission's activities. In the meantime, the Ministry of Health, recog\u00ad nizing acute manpower shfortagcs in the modern health sector, felt that aresearch report was called for focusing on manpower in the traditional health sec\u00ad tor. Through the spunsorship of two U.S. AID snpported projects, Health Planning and Manage\u00ad meit and Rural Water-Borne Disease Control, the authors wenc; asked to consolidate their research findings and collect any further information in order to provide the Ministry with bas.-line data to assess the potential for improved cooperation between the government and traditional hea!tli sectors. METHODOLOGY At the time of the Ministry's request, one of the authors (Green) had been engaged part-time in research focusing on Swazi traditional healers for a period of 1.5 years. Methods included participant\u00ad observation and in-depth interviews with some 20 healers and a rumbei- of their patients. To secure the .'ormation required by the Ministry, a preliminary survey was conducted between August 1982 and January 1983 with the assistance of three Swazi interv*' wers who were trained in open-ended inter\u00ad viewing. 144 hedlers of all major varieties were inter\u00ad viewed in the four major geographic regions o1 Swaziland: 37 in the Highveld, 36 in the Middleveld, 29 in the Lowveld and 42 in the Lubombo region. No adequate sampling frame of healers existed and thus a random or probability sample was not feasible. While the healer sample could have b\" rnre ran\u00ad domized by selecting only the %ehealers who lived in randomly-selected census enumeration areas, time and effort were saved by allowing interviewers to work primarily in areas where they haa kirship connections or where they had interviewed during 1071 1072 EDWARD C. GREN and LYDIA MAKHUHO previous surveys. This also helped minimize suspicion and mistrust on the part of the healers. In addition, a house-to-house census was conduc- ted in 4 rural and 4 peri-urban communities in order to estimate the number of healers in Swaziland, along with certain of their characteristics. All households were cont cted in each of the rural and urban com- munities [2]. A total of 598 residential units in three topographic zones were covered in the census. Due to time limitations, all peri-urban communities surveyed were in the Mbabane area. Thus there was much wider geographical coverage of households in rural areas than in peri-urban areas. Both the survey and the census should be regarded as comprising a pilot study. The other author (Makhubu) has spent several years analyzing traditional medicines for their pharmacological properties. She has also interviewed healers in depth on anthropological topics, and has consulted experts on Swazi law, customs and traditions. VARIETIES OF HEALERS There has been some confusion in the literature on Swaziland over the types of healers that exist. This is due partly to the common term inyarga which is used in both a general and specific seaise; partly to changes in both healer roles and healer terms over time; and partly to the adoption of terms from other languages. There are two basic types of traditional healers in Swaziland today: the Diviners work with spirits who are said to help in both diagnosis and curing. A distinction is made between ancestor spirits (emadloti) and spirits of foreign origin (the most prominent being Emanzawe, Benguni and Tinzunzu), yct both have beneficial functions [4]. The latter may first manifest themselves as dangerous spirits seeking vengeance for killings committed by Swazi ancestors, but they become appeased and 'domesticated' through the process of diviner training (kutfvasa). Diviners nowadays tend to have two, three or perhaps fifteen or more spirits which guide and assist them in their healing practice. Diviners describe a division of labor between the spirits whereby each tends to have a specialized function ranging from guidance in diagnosis to help in collecting overdue patient fees Most divine.rs also treat patients with herbal and other traditional medicines (e.g. animal fats), but it is their specially cultivated relationship with spirits and their attributed divinatory power that dis- tinguishes them from herbalists. Herbalists do not divine, although they may make diagnoses on the basis of physical or mental symptoms. They tend to be more concerned than diviners with medicines per se and with the functions of the human body. Diviners are said to be called or coerced into their profession by an ancestor-sept illness believed to be untreatable by modern or traditional medicine. Sub- mission to the calling is regarded as the only way to survive or find relief from the illness. Diviners study under an experienced diviner-teacher (gobela), who is usually the same person who diagnosed the mystical illness. They study for a period of nearly 3years and they pay a training fee of about U.S. ',200 plus one or more cows and g ',ts. The trainee must also observe strict rules of . during appren\u00ad ticeship, for example, abstinence from marital re\u00ad lations and from certain foods. Clearly, considerable sacrifice and commitment are required in order to become a diviner. There is evidence that the training of diviners has become more institutionalized, standardized and em\u00ad pirically based in recent years. The current trend is for trainees to learn together in groups and to receive considerable training in, herbal medicines. Previously, such healers would go off on their own for extended periods and accquire healing knowledge largely through personal visions and dreams. Herbalists are said to choose their profession vol\u00ad untarily, althoujh a parent or other relative may make the initial decision. Of 30 herbalists who de\u00ad scribed their calling, 9 said a parent or grandparent decided to train them, 7 said they were motivated by a desire for knowledge, 5 said they were motiv',ted by wanting to help or heal people, 5 described dreams or visions, 2 had mystical or prolonged illnesses and 2 said they were motivated by a desire to make money in a respected profession. Over half the herbalists surveyed acquired their skills free of charge from a parent or grandparent; the remainder paid an aver,'ge of U.S. $200 for training under an experience herbalist. Apprecticeship lasted an average of 4 years in both cases. A third type, the Zionist faith healer (umprofeti), arose during the development of Christian sects whose adherents reinterpreted orthodox Christianity in ways that were compatible with traditional culture. The faith healer is not a traditional healer, never\u00ad theless he: (1) shares a common theory of health and disease with traditional healers; (2) divines in a manner roughly similar to that of diviner healers, although God or Angels are said to assist, rather than ancestor spirits; and (.) treats various illnesses, in\u00ad cluding those thought to be 'traditional' or 'African', sometimes by using herbs. However, due to their affiliation with an organized church and the fact that Zionist healing is often incidental to promulgating the faith, faith healers should perhaps be treated separately from traditional healers in matters of legislation and policy [5]. It is noteworthy that there is a certain amount of competition and mistrust among healers, especially beiween different types of healers. For example, diviners often say that herbalists are untrained and unguided by spirits, while herbalists claim that di\u00ad viners go beyond their divining/diagnostic function in trying to cure with herbal m,:dicines that they inade\u00ad quately understand. The survey showed that while only 62/,, of healers engaged in any so;t of mutual referrals, 98%, desired a closer working relation;hip with doctors and nurses, and most of these were already making patierl referrals to clinics. NUMBER AND CIIARA-rERISTICS OF HEALERS Results of the sample census indicate tha, there are roughly 5400 healers outside the 'modern' health sector in Swaziland. Some 50% are herbalists, 40% 1073 Traditional healers in are diviner-healers and 10% are Zionist faith healers; 55% of the total are male and 45% are female. The estimates were derived in the following way: 388 homesteads, representing all the homesteads found in 4 representative rural communities, were surveyed door-tw-door. A total of 32 healers were found, amounting to a healer in 8.3% of homesteads, Assuming a rural population of 500,000 and an average of 10 residents per homestead, there would be a healer in 4150 out of an estimated 50,000 rural homesteads in Swavziland. Similarly, 210 residential units in 4 peri-urban areas around Mbabane were surveyed, 16 of which (7.6%) were found to contain healers. Assuming an 85,000 population in peri-urban areas (based on the 1976 census estimate and allowing an increase of 10,000 in 6 years) and an average of 5 residents per residential unit, then 7.6% of 1700 peri-urban units yields 1292 healers. It should be noted that the larger interview or survey sample of 144 healers consisted of more diviners than herbalists. There were 97 diviners (67% of the total), 38 herbalists (26%) and 9 faith healers (6%). It would seem that either the census areas had an unusually high number of herbalists. or the areas nhosen for interviews had a preponderance of di- viners. It is also possible that the number of home- steads covered in the census were too few to allow conclusions about the relative proportion of healer types to be drawn, or that the method of locating healers for interviewing was somehow biased toward diviners. It may also be that healers were not always certain whether to call themselves diviners or herb- alists since some consider themselves to be both. In any case, a larger census of healers, conducted per- haps in each sub-district of Swaziland or in a random sample of chiefs' areas, should be conducted using explicit definitions of diviner and herbalist. There was more agreement between the two sam- pies regarding breakdown of healer types by sex. Tile survey sample of healers indicated that diviners tend to be female (69%), herbalists tend to be male (82%) and faith healers are always male. The census showed that about 90% of diviners are female, 90% of herbalists are male, and 100% of faith healers are male. OF HEALTH CAREALTERNAIIVE SYSTEMS For most Swazis, illness is caused by sorcery-i.e. the deliberate use of spells and medicines for harmful purposes-or less commonly by ancestral displeasure resulting in the withdrawal of spiritual protection. The two causes are interrelated: if the ancestors withdraw their protectiun, a person becomes vulner- able to dangers around him, including sorcery at- tacks. The interpretation of illness as a disruption in social relations among and between the living and the dead is common to small-scale, traditional societies characterized by close interdependence between kins- men and neighbors for the satisfaction of basic biological and social needs. As long as Swaziland remains a traditional agrarian society, the social theory of illness will retain its strong iafluence. Since the introduction of allopathic or Western medicine in Swaziland, two alternative systems of heath care have developed, traditional and what we shall term modern. This has been in part the result of attempts to suppress traditional healing during th( colonial period, but perhaps more importantly it can be Lttributed to intrinsic incompatibilities between the two health care systems and the foundations upon which they rest. A defacto division of labor has developed between the twc major health sectors. For most Swazis, health problems fall into three categories: those best treated by doctors, those best treated by traditional healers and those that fall in between where either type of treatment-or a combination of the two-may be effective. Inthe survey, traditional healers were asked to identify: (1) diseases that were best treated by traditional methods; (2) the problems or diseases that they are most commonly asked v) treat; (3) the problems or diseases that they as individuals special\u00ad ize in. Most frequrutly ced in all answers were 'Africap' illnesses that have a chronic tiivane, tokoloshe, ku\u00ad habula, sipoliyane), as well as the preparation of luck and fidelity medicines. Even though these illnesses may be associated with symptoms like blood in the urine, arthritic pains, diarrhea or migraine head\u00ad aches, they all involve supernatural causation and are thought to be undiagnosable and untreatable by modern medicine. Diseases designated as best treated by modern medicine include cholera, tuberculosis, heart disease, venereal disease VD of the 'open sore' type was said to be better treated by trad'iional medicine) and bilharzia (if it is not thought to be likhubalo and therefore caused by sorcery). In a separate question on cholera, 76% of healers said that they refer patients to clinics ri.Aher than try to treat a new disease that they do not understand. The survey revealed that doctors are much admired for certain technical capabilities as well as for the medicines they possess. Most commonly cited were various surgical practices, transfusions, and use of X-ray machines. On the other hand, diviners felt that their ability to diagnose the ultimate causes of illness (thereby answering the 'why' or 'why me' qaestions of misfortune) and to perform the increasingly com\u00ad mon femba ceremony-both of which involve culti\u00ad vated relationships with spirits-are skills that are as those that doctors possess. important as HEALING PRACTICES Swazi healing is based on a combination of naturally-derived medicines and ritual. Healers them\u00ad selves emphasize medicines more than rituals. Medi\u00ad cines are derived from both plant and animal sources and they are prepared in a variety of ways, including boiling and burning. Preparations may be taken by a patient in a variety of ways such as vaccination, inhalation, purgative, smoke inhalation, sauna, poul\u00ad tice, and 'sucking out' poi\u00ad son (kumnunya) are common, as are a variety of ritual practices related to driving away spirits and neutral\u00ad izing or redirecting spells. Practiccs may relate to preventive as well as .urative health care. 1074 E'..ARD C. GREEN and LYDIA MAKHIJBU The femba ceremony, which seems to have been borrowed (no doubt with reinterpretation) in recent historical time from groups in Mocambique, consists of drumming, singing, possession-tran.e, 'brushing away' of evil spirits, and physical manipulation of the patient. Preliminary investigation of healing practices was made with a view toward possible interventions by government. That is, government could encourage practices deemed beneficial and discourage practices that may be harmful to patients. Further in- vestigations need to be made into both healing prac- tices and into possible options for government inter- vention. However, several practices can be evaluated at this point. POSSIlBLV HARMIFUl PRACTICES (I) Medicinal enemas (kucatseka) are used to pre- vent and treat several types of childhood diarrhea, sometimes exacerbating life-threatening conditions of dehydration. (2) Induced vomiting (kuhlanta) may be dangerous for patients who have weak hearts, cr for those whose lungs have been weakened by TB. Purgative herbs are sometimes used to *clean out the chest' of TB patients. (3) Traditional vaccination (kugata) is often done with an unclean razor. Rizors 4re commonly left on the ground or floor while the medicine (insiti) is being rubbed into the cuts, contributing to further con- tamination of the razor. Tetanus and hepatitis may result. (4) Some types of traditional medicines, such as the mind-altering Iuhhemane used in psychiatric disor- ders, may be daigerous by themselves. Others may be dangerous if they are taken at the same time as modern medicines. Some traditional medicines used on the ees have had unfortunate and permanent effects. It may be premature to plan or recommend explicit government interventions, but certain relatively un- obtrusive measures could be adopted at this point. For example, the Ministry could influence healers who practice vaccination to sterilize their razors properly in a flame. Or it could attempt to teach healers about the dangers of usinu enema to ty.at used by diviner-healers that are orobably beneficial to at least the patient's mind by reducing fear, uncer\u00ad tainty and stress [7]. There would seem to be no physically harmful effects offemba. (2) Some traditional medicines seem to be effective in treating certain illnesses. For example, there are medicines that may control diarrhea, sedate a patient, ease headache and other pains, and redu.e swellings. Some of these niedicines are currently being analyzed in order to learn more about their effects. (3) Sometimes a patient will stay with a traditional healer for a period of days, weeks or months. This may remov,- the patient from a stressful situation in his family or community and help him recover. (4) Healers may help ease pressure on over\u00ad burdened clinics by treating minor, self-limiting, psy\u00ad chosomatic and certain other kinds of conditions in which traditional therapies are effective and appro\u00ad priate. At the sarr.e time, most traditional healers recognize the superiority of modern medicine in treating illnesses such as cholera, TB, polio, bilharzia and dental problems, and they often advise patients with these problems to go to a clinic or hospital. FES PAID TO HEALERS There has been a good deal of chanPe in practices relating to fees in the last two or so generations. Previously, a cow was paid to a healer only after a patient had been rured, and payment established an enduring relation-nip between healer and patient, one that entitled the patient and members of his home\u00ad stead to free treatment for subsequent illnesses [8]. There were sufficient social controls operating at the local level to ensure that the healer received his initial fee. Increased geographic mobility of healers and a transition to money as a means of payment have helped depersonalize the patiernf--healer relationship and have tended to make stanoardization of fees impossible. The fees that healers charge vary widely nowadays. An attempt was made through the 1954 Order-In- Council to standardize the fees charged for initial diagnosis and for the l.tnba curing ceremony at approx. U.S. $2 and ,5respectively. This has worke.d well enough but these fees seem to account for only childhood diarrheal d:sease, while explaining ,,r\"a a small part of a healer's income. The standardization advocating the use of oral rehydration therapy [6]. In any case, shotcomings of traditional healing should be balanced against its beneficial or useful functions. The same can be said for modern medicine, OR ufees, POSSIBLY BENEFICIAL PRAC~l i( USEFUL Ft.N( TIONS (I) Traditional healers treat the whole person; they do not simply give medicines for particular symp- toms. They know how to calm a patient's fears, explain how and hy he became ill. and perhaps even malte sense of his problems with neighbors and family. Reducin- stress in this way is very importiot in treating mental illness, but it also contributes to the cure and prevention of man, other types of illness. Divining the cause of problems with bones, as well as thejef,'ba healing ceremony, are common methods of a rather low fee for diagnosis has possibly had the effect of predisposing healers to find complex and therefore expensive-to-treat forms of mystical illness in their patients. It is difficult to obtain accurate information on but it is clear that many healers in Swaziland have at least *asmany patients as physicians in private practice, and some have become quite wkealthy by any standards. Patients have been observed paying be\u00ad tween U.S. $120- 130 for treatment of a single cor-li\u00ad tion such as utm.w/,ulh or presumed soul loss. Heal\u00ad ers may charge U.S. $140 for protecting i:homestead (kuibetsela) against lightning strikes from their ene\u00ad mies. And following the diagnostic fee, or even in the absence of a formal diagnosis, there is a basic fee of between U.S. S10-20 to 'open the bags' (in-u/u sikhvana), which formalizes the beginning of any sort of treatment. 1075 Traditional healers in Swaziland The significance of such fee information lies in the light it sheds on healers' motivation. For those who would support efforts to train traditional healers as Rural Health Motivators or Nursing Assistants, it should be pointed out that most healers do not need the relatively low salaries that government employ- ment would provide. Yet if some healers did begin to serve as health extension workers, they would doibt- less expect to receive salaries from the government. This underscores the necessity of proceeding cau- tiously with any plans to modify the role of tradi- tioaal healers. In the absence of baseline data, it is difficult to say whether there are more healers per population now than in the past [9]. Healers themselves believe this to be the case. A quite recent development is the high density of healers in the expanding per-urban areas. Such healers live in close proximity and scrutiny of one another, and they compete vigorously for patients. Yet there seem to be enough patients to go around and healing remains an appealing career option. Several survey respondents remarked that healing is a lucrative ard respectable profession, and perhaps the best one that women and those lacking formal education can aspire to. Several respondents additionally remarked that becoming a healer helped them satisfy their thirst: for knowedge and their altruistic motives. AN ASSOCIATION OF HEALERS Traditional social controls that in the past helped maintain an acceptable cede of conduct among heal- ers have been weakened by the development of labor migration, the transition to a cash economy, urban- ization and other forces of social chang,. For exam- pie, healers in pert-urban areas may dtal with a changing group of clients who themselves are tempo- rary residents of the area. Such clients cannot exert the moral or persuasive force on a healer as could a stable, relatively uncianging group of kinsmen and neighbors. Some years before his death, King Sobhuza 11 began to call for the formation of a professional association of healers, in part to re-establish social control mechanisms that cotidd operate in a mod- ernizing society. In response to the late King, there have been some attempts on the part of healers to organize themselves into lo-al associations. An im- portant motivational factor on the part of such healers seems to be the dcsire to dissociate, hemselves from the frauds, charlatans, and ritual murderers often associated in the wblic mind with traditional healers. At the same time, there is little tradition of formal association or even cooperation among heal- ers in Swaziland. Therefore, some initiative on the part of people from outside the ranks of healers may be necessary in order to encourage and assist the formation of an association. Survey results indicate that 80% of healers ques\u00ad tioned would like to have and a 10% were against joining; 7'/ were undecided; and 2% said an association would probably not work, whatever their own feelings. Although 10% felt that jealousy, competition and mistrust among healers would doom the formation of an association, 51% SSM 11012--E commented that an association would enable them to share their healing knowledge and learn from one another, 10% said it would increase cooperation among healers, 7% said it would help healers get to know one another better, 6% said it would help improve patient care and prevent abuse and the remaining 16% made miscellaneous favorable comments. The authors recommend that government encour\u00ad a.ge and support the formation of a professional association of traditional healers in order to establish a continuing dialogue between healers and govern\u00ad ment, help disseminate information among and be\u00ad tween healers, and improve the quality of healing practices. National associations of traditional healers already exist in a number of other African countries. The formation of an associaticn shouid be viewed as a way of promoting rather than directly control\u00ad ling healing pracZices. The association wuuld be responsible for registration, regulation of fee pay\u00ad ment, and drawing up a code of conduct acceptable to all healers and consistent with accepted good health practices. The following chart suggests an organizational structure at local, di3trict and national levels. Ministry -f Health Ministry of Home Affairs National Committee of Healers Hhohho Manzini Lubombo Shiselweni District District District District Local community under each chief This strut'iore, which is proposed by the Commis\u00ad sion for T:aditional Medicine, established by the Ministry of Health in 1980, envisions the association as an organization to which all healers wouki be encouraged to belong. The proposed organization would enable healers to produce their own code of conduct, criteria for registration, and a fee-paymen' prozedufe acceptable to them. The new legislation proposed by the Commission would make possible the prosecution of those who fail to pay the pre\u00ad scrihed fe-following the accepted procedure. An association of healers should be viewed not only as a way for government to influence traditional healing but as a way to enable healers to run their own affairs in a more organized manner. The proposed com\u00ad position of c mmittces should ensure strong lead\u00ad ership by healers themselves with minimal govern\u00ad ment interference. The following composition is suggested: NATIONAL COMMITTEE Healers-2 from each district Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, or repre\u00ad sentative Perianent Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, or representative Member of the Swazi National Council Registrar DISTRICT COMMITTEE Representative from the local communities who should also choose their own chairman Secretary-to be appointed by the District Coin\u00ad missioner District Commissioner or his representative 1076 EDWARD C. GRN and LYDIA MAKHUBU LOCAL COMMITTEE Healers elected by their peers who reside under one chief Chief's Runner Chief, on voluntary basis. The Chairman of the Natioral Committee should be chosen by the Committee from among the healers' representatives. The Registrar, who should be appointed by the Ministries of Health and Home Affairs, should sere as secretary to the Committee. The inkhundla, a recently created administrative level comprising groups of chiefs from neighboring chieftaincies, may have relevance in the future for a national healers association. For the present, the only pre-existing arganiza:ion of healers are the relatively informal asf,ociations that seem to be found in most chieftaincies. Specifically, most chiefs convene oc- casional meetings of all healers (perhaps excepting Zionist faith healers) in order to discuss matters of interest. Many chieftaincies have representutives (tin- dtuna) of diviners and herbalists respectively who are either elected by local healers or appointed by the chiefs. Informal networks exist among diviners, especially those who were trained by a common teacher, but these are relatively weak and comprise too few indi- viduals to provide a basis for a national association of healers. This is especially true since roughly half of Swaziland's traditional healers are herbalists for whom informal peer networks are even more atten- uated. Moreover, official or other encouragement of network-based groups might exacerbate rivalry and divisiveness that exist among and between diviners and herbalists. Initiative for th formation of an association has already been taken by the late King and by healers themselves at local levels. The Commission for Tradi- tional Medicine, which involves the Ministries of Health and Home Affairs, should now reconvene to consider preparing a stmnary of findings and pro- posals for the Queen Regent. Since traditional heal- ing is intimately tied up with Swazi law and customs, further initiative from the highest level of traditional authority would be perhaps the single most im- portant influence in the formation of a healer's association. At the same time, local level initiatives on the part of healers must continue to be encouraged and assisted by those in government who have the requi- site interest, skills and experience. The Miistries of Health and Home Affairs could identify such individ- uals and request their part-time participation in organizing oi attending meetings of healers. It is also at the local level that matters relating to fees and code of conduct be discussed and agreement taken throuph district committees to the National Committee which will help government formu.,te policy regarding traditional healing. Further, when the Ministry of Health or other ministry wishes to hold serminars with healers, the local committees could provide the organizational basis. REGISTRATION As mentioned above, registration of healers began during the late colonial period when it was recognized .hat 'modern' health care peisonnel would not easilydisplace traditional healers and the latter could not be completely ignored by the government. Registration represented a first step toward recognition of healers and exercizing a modicum of control over their activities. It also provided tax revenues. Since inde\u00ad pendence, the Swazi National Council has continued to register and collect taxes from healers. Healers themselves are favorably inclined toward registration. The survey showed that 82% of healers reported that they were currently registered, 10% were not, and 8% said they had only recently qualified and they intend to register. Even allowing for over\u00ad reporting, the proportion of healers is higher than one might expect for a traditional African society. Regarding reasons cited for registering, 30% of all healers observed that the law would support them in collecting overdue patient fees and would protect them against complairnts of patients or their families. Other common remark7 were that registration con\u00ad fers legitimacy, respectability and authority on heal\u00ad ers, and also allows them to travel and practice healing freely throughout Swaziland and in neigh\u00ad boring countries. Registration classification has in the past been on the basis of how many diseases a healer claims to be able to treat. There has been no recognition, and therefore record, c the type of healer being regis\u00ad tered. It would seem, however, that important role distinctions that healers make among themselves should be recognized ty government. Such dis\u00ad tinctions could, have policy planning implications. For example, several African governments have shown a preference for licensing herbalists rather than diviners, judging the former to be more 'scientific' 110]. While such a suggestion is not being made here, it may be that training approaches for herbalists and diviners will have to be somewhat different. And for the present, knowing the relative proportion and geographic location of practicing herbalists and diviners should give the government an idea of the nature of traditional health care, as well as changes in the system. It would seem moreover that registration should be carried out at the local level where examination of healers' qualifications can be conducted by those familiar with them, e.g. chiefs, assistant chiefs and fellow healers. Healers practicing in per-urban areas should still register through their own chief. Healers who are deemed to be unfit for registration should be allowed to appeal through the District Healer's Committee. POSSIBLE Traditional healing in Swaziland is a coherent, logically consistent system of beliefs and practices that satisfies many of the physical, mental and spirit\u00ad ual needs of those who participate in the system. There are over 5000 healers outside the modern health sector in Swaziland and at least 85% of the population make use of their services. Swazi healing practices are based on a belief system of magic and religion that parallels Western science 1077 Traditional healers in Swaziland and Christianity in its attempt to find order, regu- larity and simplicity in the apparent chaos and ran- domnesr of nature. Put simply, the traditional belief system provides answers to the basic questions that perplex people. Swazi healing also has a strong empirical or naturalistic component that relates to cause and effect observations made in the everyday world. A cumu- lative, empirical body of knowledge relating to med- icines, dose, bone setting techniques and the like is handed down to novice healers through a process of training and apprenticeship. It might be suggested in a general way that the naturalistic or empirical part of traditional heating sector, could be built upon by the modern health since there would be common ground for under- standing. At the same .ine there is much that is different and evenhealing systems, both in underlying and biomedical incompatible between traditional theory and in general practice or technique, The authors believe that limited training of healers The authorstakien tnhat eimetaani o hes can be undertaken on an experimental basis. The training propoed foctines on diarrheal diseases and is outlined below. Opinions are offered in the same section on other potentially successful areas of training. We wish to emphasize, however, that at this stage of the development of knowledge concerning Swazi of Health should tread cau-healers, the Ministry tiously and be very modest in its exceptations. There seem to be several constraints to intersectoral cooper- ation, for example, a bias against traditional healers on the part of doctors and nurses as well as suspicion given our present state of knoledge and the risks involved in engineering changes in the traditional health system, the Ministry of Health should think of cooperation rather than integration as a general strategy. The recommendations made in this report aim to establish a basis for on-going cooperation. As healers begin to organize themselves into representa\u00ad tive bodies and they begin to work more cooper\u00ad atively with modern health care personnel, and after additional research findings become available, it will then be possible to revise or expand Ministry policies regarding traditional healers. COOPERATION AND PARAPROFESSIONAL TRAINING As mentioned above, 98% of healers would like As metion boven theles and like bett r cooperation between themselves and doctors ex\u00ad and nurses. 91% of healers surveyed specifically pressed enthusiasm for the idea ef undergoing some kind of training in modern medicine. The reason most gave was that they wanted to increase their healing skills and learn more about modern medicine. However, several expressed concern that their lack of formal education would make 'communicating with doctors' difficult. Less is known about government health sector attitudes toward traditional healers, although a pre\u00ad liminary survey of physician and nurse attitudes healers indicates considerable negative biastoward 13). These attitudes must be more systematically must be found to overcome atexplored and ways least some bias if intersectoral cooperation is to be the part of traditional helers regarding the mo-successful. on Training seminars for healers is an approach that wetives of the Ministry of Health; yet at this stage lack sufficient knowledge about these and other pos- k dhealers Wen pnstrains, poithe When planning policies regarding traditional heal- ersit is important to make distinction between coop- eration and integration. Cooperation implies a better working relationship between the two health sectors whereby app,'opriate referrals between the sectors hecole*; rc upgne, healer' okills are upgraded, end the culturalse.i-tivity of modern health care workers is increased. The term integration implies a fundamental alteration in both healing systems and in the roles of the respective practitioners, aithough in practice it is the traditional healer who is expected to change. The danger here is that the traditional healer may become a second-rate paramedical worker and thereby cease to carry out his or her important function in the loca function ci, community-a function that has social, psychological and spiritual as well as bodily health dimensions, Such an outcome could be disrupive in multiple ways, including the undermining of a com~munity's capacty to solve its own health problems [Il]. At the same time, the Ministry of Health has been reluctant to identify itself in any way with traditional healers since th lattzr are known to engage in several practices deemed to be unacceptable by public health hisorhimporant thath thlocal standards [12]. In view of this, certain governmental interventions into traditional healing seem inevitable if there is to be any sort of intersectoral association. Thus a certain amount of integration may be a sine qua non. Nevertheless, the authc rs recommend that can take even before an association ofgovernmentis formed. The Ministry of Health, through Health Education Unit, has already planned a series of short seminars for healers in the 4 districts over the next 5 years. The first seminar occurred in June 1983. The overall objective of the seminars is the establishment of a dialogtie between healers and the Ministry which focuses on priority areas of health care, viz. diarrheal diseases, childhood immunization, and maternal/child health, and which will result in atowyecag fifraino igoitet two-way exchange of information on diagnosis, treat- The authors have recommended that training be well lanned in advance, focused on a very few topics aner wherebyanned in ancepouse whereby ated appropriate mannerand con in healers are treated in a collegial manner by Geminar organizers. It is important that traditional beliefs are built upon for educational purposes and that they are not ridiculed. It is also important that training con\u00ad tent, -special!y the initial stages, be of interest to healers themselves. Furthermore, there should be an initial emphasis on curative rather than preventive medicine. As trA part of the seminars, healers have reneived haining in the use of oral rehydration therapy and been given free UNICEF packets of oral re\u00adon anhydration salts (ORS). While th;'. has begun are several reasons to be\u00adexprimental basis, there lieve that Zhe program will be acceptable to healers: (I) Healers have indicated that they would like to have a means by which they could prevent deaths of 1078 EDWARD C. GREEN and LYDIA MAKHUBU patients with symptoms of dehydration from cholera and other d-arrheal diseases; (2) Cholera is already a disease of considerable concern among healers (and the general public) and a disease which 76/, of healers surveyed admit they do not understand and do not attempt to treat; (3) Distribution of ORS packets would constitute an important gesture of trust and cooperation on the part of the government, (4) ORS usage dces not conflict with traditional practices for treating diarrhea. From the Ministry's point of view, diarrheal dis- eases constitute a high priority health zoncern and it is recognized that the widespread use of ORS could significantly reduce mortality (especially in infants) from these diseases. As a result of the authors' recommendations, the Ministry has begun to train healers in ORS use on a pilot basis in selected areas. If a proposed future evaluation shows that healers are using ORS prop- erly, it will be possible to recommend training and ORS distribution on a national basis. Other training content planned by the Health Education Unit thus far relates to immunization against childhood diseases, maternal and child health and diarrheal diseases in general. In a recently initiated program to train traditional healers in Ghana, training sessions were found to be more successful if topics were included that specifically related to traditional healing, e.g. how to store and preserve herbs [141. The Health Education Unit anticipates adopting a similar strategy and has accordingly planned informal exchanges with healers to determine their training interests before finalizing training agendas. It is recognized that healers will be more interestedin curative than in preventive health care. However,ionrequest traditional preventive concepts and practices (e.g. treatment of children with tinyamiatane, a medicinal mixture that is believed to protect against lightning and various other dangers) can be built upon and some cooperation from healers can be expected in areas as childhood immunization and maternal/child health. On the other hand, judging by prevailing attitudes in Swaziland and ihe experience of those who have trained healers elsewhere in Africa, topics such as family planning may be of little initial interest to healers. There is reason to believe that basic first aid would be a fruitful training topic. Healers tend to already have considerable experience in dressing wounds, setting bones, reducing pain and the like; and many patients come to healers in need of first aid. The Baphalali Red Cross has already b~egun first aid training for local volunteers at the community level. A comparative training program for traditional heal- ers, geared specifically for them, could be developed, tried on a ?ilot basis, and then evaluated. Although no data were collected on any interaction between Rural Health Motivators (RHM's) and tra- ditional healers, it woulC seem that the two groups perform different functions and therefore have little mutual relevance. RHM's are concerned with pro- motive health care whereas traditional healers are concerned primarily with curative h .alth care and with illnesses considered 'African'. Some effort has been made (o recruit healers as RHM's, but this has met with little success. The Public Health Unit is now experimenting with making RHM training sessions open to local healers who wish to upgrade their skills, yet still remain traditional healers. This approach seems much more promising. Of course, cooperation must be two-sided. Plans will have to be developed to educate 'modern' health sector persunnel about indigenous healing methods, overcoming communications difficulties, and the best strategies for cooperation. Such planning should follow a systematic assessment of government sector attitudes and perceptions. Future research needs also include further in\u00ad vestigation of traditional healing practices and medi\u00ad cines in order to guide possible government inter\u00ad ventions; an evaluation of on-going training for healers in oral rehydration therapy in orde, to assess the potential health impact of such training; the identification of any traditional healing practices that could be usefully adopted by the modern health sector to improve the quality of curative or preventive health care; and further assessmeit of areas of possi\u00ad ble cooperation, along with plans for initiating and implementing cooperative efforts. It is hoped that the actions already begun by the Swaziland government will lead to sustained cooper\u00ad ation between modern and traditional health sectors, as has been the policy recommended for developing countries by the World Health Organization since the mid-1970s 115]. Acknowledgements---In August 1982, the Permanent Secre- Iary of the Ministry of Health requested a report on traditional healers in Sw~tziland with a view towards assess\u00ad ing the areas and extent of cooperation possible betweentraditional healers and modern health care personnel. Thewas made to the Heath Planning and Management Project, which in turn requested that Drs Edward Green and Lydia Makhubu prepare a report. Both consultants were engaged in research relaing to traditional healing. Dr Green is an anthropologist with the U.S. AID funded Rural Water-Borne Disease Control Project, and Dr Makhubu is a chemist and Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the University of Swaziland. The views expressed in this report are those o' the authors and do not necessarily refiect Ministry policy. FIRFERENCFS I.
