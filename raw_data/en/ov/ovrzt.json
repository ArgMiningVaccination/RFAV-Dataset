In addition, specialized autonomous training units (called Program s) may be formed by faculty from multiple academi c units for the purpose of offering training in a scholarly discipline of common interest not already represented by preexisting units. Training units must propose a detailed plan for classroom research and seminar instruction which comply with the academi c policies and procedures of the Graduate School. A training unit receives approval from the Executive Council upon the recommendation of the Curriculum Committee . Creation of new programs must comply with the BCM \\\\it-ess- tier2a \\bcm-gsbs-database$ \\ElectronicHandbook\\2016.08.01.HandbookAY16-17.doc Academic Prog ram Approval Policy (Section 30.1.02). The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 13 1.7.1 Program Director The Program director is a full- time faculty member appointed by the Department Chair person (if a departmental Program ), or appointed by the Steering Committee (if an interdisciplinary Program ) with the approval of the Dean, and is a member of the Graduate Executive Council. The Program director has oversight of the PhD training unit and coordinates the Graduate Program in his/her department or division with the aid of a Program Committee . This responsibility implies that the Program director represents the department and the students by: 1) Assisting the Admissions Committee in processing applications to the Graduate School; 2) Acting as advisor to graduate students until the student's Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) is appointed; 3) Assisting the Graduate School in recording the student's progress toward the degree and recommending to the Promotions Committee transfer of credit and unusual course loads; 4) Making recommendations to the Dean regarding establishment of TAC s, scheduling and administering of Qualifying Examination s, defense of dissertations, leaves of absence, withdraw als, and awarding the degree; 5) Transmitting administrative forms directly to the Graduate School office; and 6) Transmitting information from the Graduate School office to the graduate students. 1.8 Student Membership in Program s A full -time graduate stu dent is a member of either two or three academic entities, depending upon his or her level of progression to the PhD degree. 1.8.1 Membership in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Upon enrollment, a student becomes a member of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and is subject to the rules defined herein. Continued enrollment shall require satisfactory performance. Dismissal shall be done only by the Dean, upon recommendation of the Promotions Committee and appropriate appeal procedures as described in this Policy Book. 1.8.2 Membership in a Departmental or Interdisciplinary PhD Program Entry into a PhD Program , either Departmental or Interdisciplinary, shall make the student a member of that entity as well. The Program may impose additional policies and performance criteria which strengthen or modify the overall policies of the Graduate School, but those policies may not diminish nor eliminate any academic requirements. Membership in a PhD Program and continuation of an y established financial support shall continue provided that the student is in good academic standing and is making satisfactory academic progress toward the degree. The latter criteria include punctual performance of administrative tasks such as choosing a mentor, appointing a TAC, choosing a scientific research project acceptable to that Committee , and completing required academic documents (such as status reports, Committee meetings and the dissertation) within specified time limits as defined in the policy handbooks of the Graduate School and the Program . Dismissal from the Program shall be done by the Program Director, following review of the student's past and current performance by a Committee appointed by the Program Director. The members of that Com mittee shall include at least one member of the student's TAC . A faculty member who has a conflict of interest in the matter shall not serve. The Committee shall have at its disposal in making its decision (1) a report from the student's TAC recommending dismissal for causes described in their The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 14 report, (2) copies of all Graduate School transcripts of the student and of all progress reports turned in to the Graduate School by that student and (3) any additional research or academic documents it deems necessar y for the proper conduct of the inquiry. If the student wishes to continue enrollment in the Graduate School, the Program is obligated to provide a period of no more than 8 weeks with full stipend and insurance support for the student to transfer to anothe r Program , unless that period of support has previously been granted to the student for the purpose of finding another laboratory. 1.8.3 Membership in a Major Advisor 's laboratory (Revised 03/31/04 , 08/ 01/11) A student shall choose a Major Advisor by mutual agreement, and inform the Program and the Graduate School of this selection. Membership in a laboratory is a privilege; during the student's traineeship time in that laboratory the student and mentor are expected to conduct science and scholarship according to high ethical principles as defined for faculty members in the BCM Faculty Handbook, and the Research Ethics standards defined in the College's Administrative Guide. Continued membership in the mentor's laboratory shall be assumed, unless unforeseen circumstances occur. Those circumstances include (1) loss of funding by the faculty member for the conduct of the research; (2) academic or scientific misconduct by the student or advisor, causing dissolution of the bond of trust between student and facult y member; or (3) other disagreements which break that bond of trust. Mentors and their students should work to construct a mutually agreeable set of expectations for the relationship. However, in the case that a mentor or student wishes to terminate the student's membership in the mentor's lab, the initiating party (student or mentor) must contact the Program Director. In the case that the Program Director is the student's mentor, the Program co-director or a member of the Program's Graduate Education Committee (GEC) shall fulfill the role of the Program Director. The Program Director will review the circumstances in individual private meetings with both the mentor and student to ensure that the differences between the student and mentor cannot be resolved. The Program Director, at his/her discretion, may utilize the thesis Committee as a resource or to request a joint meeting between the two parties. The Request to Leave Laboratory Form will be completed and signed by the Program Director, co -signed by the mentor, student and the student's Committee and sent to the Graduate School for approval. The effective date for leaving the laboratory will be the effective date indicated on the form. The request to leave a laboratory must also contain a signed agreement between the mentor and student concerning the student's authorship status on any publications resulting from the student's work while in the laboratory. Decisions regarding authorship should be made in accord with the Authorship Policy of the College and in the spirit of the Authorship Policy of the Graduate School ( 9.12). After leaving the mentor's laboratory, the Program Director shall assume the temporary duties of advisor, and shall intercede actively to assist the student in finding a new M ajor Advisor . If the action is initiated by the mentor, the mentor must provide the student at least 4 weeks of stipend and insurance support following the official notice of termination of membership in the laboratory. Terminating the membership of a stu dent in a laboratory does not constitute discharge from the Program . If the student wishes to continue enrollment, the Program is obligated to provide an additional period of no more than 8 weeks with full stipend The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 15and insurance support for the student to find another laboratory or to transfer Program s. 1.9 Student Interest Groups (New 07/30/12, Revised 8/24 /15, 08/01/16) Official student interest groups may be designated by the Dean upon the request of the Graduate Student Council or P ostdoctoral Association. The designation as a recognized trainee interest group entitles the group to develop a BCM web page and to use BCM and its logo in publicizing their activities. Interest groups must abide by all college policies concerning use of the BCM name, logo, and internet/social media. BCM students or student groups may from time to time invite outside speakers to address BCM functions. Outside speakers must be approved in advance by the Dean or designee. The names and credentials of proposed speakers, purpose of the presentation, and proposals for any costs such as travel, expenses, and honoraria, must be presented to the Dean or designee for review and approval at least three weeks prior to the event. All outside speakers will be required to meet the professional standards expected of BCM faculty, with evidence based presentations when applicable and complete disclosure of funding and conflict of interest. Students are required to comply with BCM Fundraising Policies (Section 17.1.03) and Student/Trainee Fundraising Project policy (Section 17.1.07). 1.10 Evaluation (Revised 08/30/12) To improve our academic Program s, an internal self -evaluation of individual Graduate Program s and the graduate school as a whole will occur annually. The evaluation will consist of an academic planning and evaluation document that sets Program learning objectives and outcome measurements for the coming year along with an analysis of the previous year's plan and student learning outcomes. Each Program will be provided with a standard set of outcome measurements including student performance in the first -year curriculum, qualifying exam performance, student retention, and publications. Individua l teaching evaluations by students enrolled in each didactic course offered by the graduate school will be conducted at the end of each term. The evaluations of the course and individual instructors will be provided to the course director to help formulat e changes in the course for next year. Each instructor will be provided with a copy of the overall course evaluation and their own teaching evaluations. Teaching evaluations will be considered by the Curriculum Committee during its periodic evaluation of the curriculum (section 2.43), and every five years, in preparation for an external review, the Curriculum Committee will evaluate the curriculum of each Program along with the utilization of the core curriculum with respect to content and quality. Every five years, an external evaluation Committee composed of scientists involved in graduate education will be appointed by the President of the College to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the graduate school as a whole along with individual Graduate Prog rams.

The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 20 3.2 Non-Discrimination Policy (Revised 04/22/03) BCM and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences admits students of any race, sex , sexual orientation. Color, national ethnic origin, disability or age to all the right, privileges, Program s, and activities generally accorded or mad e available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, color, national or ethnic origin, disability or age, in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan Pr ogram s, and other school school- administered Program s. 3.3 Student Disability Policy ( New 8/2 7/15, 08/01/16) BCM provides equal educational access for qualified students with disabilities in accordance with state and federal laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended in 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the BCM Student Disability Policy (Section 23.1.07). 3.4 Acceptance of Admissions Offers (Revised 04/22/03) The BCM Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is a member of the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS). According to the bylaws of the CGS, applicants have no obligation to accept an offer before April 15. While the BCM Graduate Programs can encourage accepted applicants to commit to an offer prior to April 15 to aid the Program in establishing the optimal entering class, the student does not have to declare before that date. The provisions of the CGS state: \"Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15; ear lier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignati on of the appointment at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without first obtaining a written release from the institution to which a commitment has been made. Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer. It is further agreed by the institutions and organization subscribing to this Resolution that a copy of the Resolution should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.\" Applications for Admission to the Graduate School should be addressed to the Graduate School, BCM , One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030. (D eleted last sentence) 3.8/24/20155 Reinstatement of Admission (New 04 /13/06) Students who withdraw or are dismissed for academic reasons, or who receive a terminal M.S. degree from BCM Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences must reapply for admissions before they may be reinstated as a student. A student who is dismissed on thebasis of misconduct is ineligible to reapply. 3.6 Retention of Admissions Records (New 04 /13/06) In accordan ce with Federal Policy (IRS), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences will retain admissions records for a period of three years for all applicants. The admissions records of matriculated applicants (excluding letters of recommendation) will become a p art of the student's permanent file maintained by the Registrar. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 21 ARTICLE 4. FINANCIAL REGULATIONS 4.1 Tuition Tuition for a full -time course of study for one school year (5 terms, minimum of 12 credit hours per term) is set by the Board of Trustees. All s tudents will be charged full tuition during their entire graduate school career. Students who are enrolled for less than the entire academic year are charged on a proportional basis. 4.2 Financial Assistance (Revised 11/15/02, 08/01/16) All students re ceive an annual stipend while enrolled as full time students in the Graduate School. The amount of the stipend and any individual exceptions are established by the Executive Council and Dean. The stipend is continued as long as the student is making progr ess toward the degree. The BCM Financial Responsibilities, Financial Aid Eligibility, and Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Students policy (Section 23.1.02) outlines academic standards for financial aid eligibility. The Office of Student Financial Aid considers all applications for loans with the exception of the Emergency Loan Fund. Emergency Loans may be obtained through the Graduate School office. 4.3 Outside Employment The first obligation of students is to their graduate studies. Students should arrange their financial affairs so that employment during the academic session should not be necessary. However, if the need arises, they should consult their Graduate Program director. 4.4 Financial Responsibility (Revised 08/02/10) Graduate students are expected to conduct their financial affairs in such a manner that their personal accounts and outstanding loans through the Graduate School remain current. Student fees (other than student health insurance, tuition and facilities fee) are the responsibility of the graduate student and must be paid by September 1 and February 1. For non-payment of student fees (by the published deadlines) the student is charged a late fee by Student Account Services and a hold is placed on the student record blocking on- line registration, the posting of grades and production of transcripts. Payment of student health insurance is the responsibility of the BCM organizational unit (Org Unit) that pays the student's stipend. Non- payment of the student health insurance does cause a hold to be placed on the student record however no late fine is imposed. Charges for tuition and the Facilities fee are cleared from the student account when scholarships are applied automatically. The Graduate School processes scholarships at the beginning of each semester (in July and January). The Dean can, at his/her discretion, discontinue tuition scholarships and/or refuse regi stration in those instances where there is no progress toward reducing the indebtedness. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 22 ARTICLE 5. REGISTRATION 5.1 Academic Year The academic year is approximately August 1 to July 31, and terms are designated First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth (one term = 8 weeks' instruction plus one exam week). All students begin their studies in August unless circumstances justify special permission in writing from the Graduate Program director for beginning at another date. The request should be made in writing, by the student, to the specific Program director who, in turn, notifies the Graduate School office. All requests for office -cycle admissions must be approved by the Dean. 5.2 Deadline for Registration (Revised 08/23/04) The student will be billed a $ 25.00 late registration fee when registering after the stated deadline. If a student failed to register before two weeks into the term, they may be administratively withdrawn from the Graduate School. 5.3 Program of Courses 5.3.1 Course Schedule The Graduate Program director approves a student's course schedule each term by signing the registration form. After appointment of the Major Advisor, approval is indicated by the signature of the Program director and the Major Advisor. 5.3.2 Research Rotation Requirement (New 06/15/06) Research rotations begin to teach students how researchers approach biological problems. A rotation is expected to provide an introduction to the laboratory's research goals as well as instruction in basic laboratory skills. Rotations also familiarize the students with different laboratories in their Graduate Program and facilitate the ultimate selection of a thesis advisor. A typical research rotation lasts a whole term, but students may split a rotation in consultation with t he Program director. The Graduate Program determines the number of credits earned in each rotation. In order to maximize the benefits of the research rotations, students are required to complete a minimum of three research rotations in different laborator ies (or three full terms in the case of split rotations). Students and faculty are encouraged to discuss the potential for joining a laboratory during or after the rotation. However, students need the opportunity to explore various laboratories without pressure. Therefore, faculty will make no commitment and will not request commitment for a student prior to completion of three rotation terms. Official appointment of a thesis advisor can be approved only after the completion of three rotation terms. Th e three- rotation requirement is managed and monitored by the individual Graduate Program s, not GSBS. Exceptions: Students may choose to work at BCM during the summer before matriculation and count the summer research as one rotation, pending approval by the Graduate Program director. Permanent employment at BCM prior to matriculation (e.g. as a research technician) cannot be counted as a rotation. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 23 MD/PhD students who participate in research during their initial MD training period may count their experience as one rotation pending approval by the Graduate Program director and in consultation with the MD/PhD Program director. Students who transfer to BCM with their advisor after joining his/her laboratory in another institution are exempt from the three -rotation requirement but are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the work done in other laboratories in their Program . Students may appeal the three -rotation requirement to their Graduate Program GEC and Program director. 5.4 Course Load All students mus t be enrolled for at least 12 hours of credit each term. Students who have been admitted for candidacy and who have a TAC in place, will be automatically registered by their Program administrator for 12 hours of dissertation each term. A student wishing to take more than 17 term hours per term must obtain written permission from their Major Advisor, and have the approval of the Dean. 5.5 Course Changes (Revised 8/27/15, 08/01/ 16) Throughout the first two weeks of a class , registration may be changed with the approval of the Graduate Program director and the Major Advisor and notification of the Graduate School office. These changes are not reflected on the transcript. During the third and fourth weeks of the class , a student may withdraw from a course with the approval of the Graduate Program director and the Major Advisor and notification of the Graduate School office. Withdrawal is designated on the transcript by the symbol WD. Withdrawal after the fourth week , but prior to exam date, must be approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. The notation on the Transcript will be WD. If the Dean does not give permission to withdraw, the notation will be I (incomplete) or F ( Failing) depending on the student's performance to t he date of withdrawal. The institutional Course Repeat Policy (BCM Policy Section 23.1.09) outlines how repeated coursework is listed on student transcripts. 5.6 Dissertation Registration A graduate student may not register for dissertation until a TAC has been appointed, the Qualifying Examination has been successfully Pass ed, and the Program has proposed the student for candidacy. 5.7 Retroactive Credit Credit cannot be given retroactively for a course in which a student was not officially enrolled. 5.8 Inter -Program Transfer (Revised 01/13/97, 07/29/13) Once a student has committed to a specific Program , it is expected that the course of study will be pursued to completion. In exceptional circumstances, students may transfer from one Graduate Program to another upon approval by the director of each of the Program s concerned and by the Dean; however, it is the student's responsibility to present compelling reasons for such a transfer. Before a transfer request can be initiated, all parties must be certain that the resident Program has not been able to address the concerns of the student. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 24 Neither Program will approve such a transfer without consultation between the directors of both Program s. Students are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School administration if they feel that conditions have arisen necessitating an inter -Program transfer, and may appeal disapproval by their current Program to the Dean, who will have the final authority for approval. Any transfer will be noted on the student's permanent record upon submission of \"Interdepartmental Transfer\" form. If the student has been admitted to candidacy prior to transfer, the new Program may require that the student complete all requirements for admission to candidacy in the new Program . 5.9 Audit Students (Revised 11/08/07) BCM graduate students are allowed to attend any courses offered by t he graduate school for no credit and without examination if the instructor approves. No registration is required for informally auditing courses and no indication will appear on the student's transcript. If a student wishes to formally AUDIT a BCM graduate school course, the student must register for a formal AUDIT and obtain permission of their Program director and the course director. Registration is completed by using the Add/Drop Form. For the course to be listed on the student's transcript (without any credit hours awarded toward graduation), the student must submit to the graduate school a course syllabus (dates, lecture titles and lecturer name only) in which the student's attends at 70% or more of the classes is documented by the lecturer's signature for each lecture attended. An AUDIT student may not take examinati ons. If the student Fails to submit an attendance document by end last day of the term, they will be withdrawn from the course and it will not appear on their transcript. Other i ndividuals may audit Graduate School courses under the following conditions: The individual is a full -time student of an institution with which BCM has a reciprocal agreement, or a member of the BC M faculty or staff. Should the auditor be a BCM employee, written consent is required from the faculty employer, the course instructor and the Graduate Program Director. Upon recommendation of the instructor, transcripts will bear the course name and will be marked AUDIT. No more than 15 term hours of audit may be accumulated by anyone other than a full -time student. 5.10 Special Students (Revised 01/16/04) Baylor associated personnel who hold a Bachelor 's or higher degree but who are not students may, with permission, register as Special Students for courses offered by the Graduate School and its Program s. Special Students may not take courses through the reciprocal agreement with another institution. Written consent is required from the faculty employ er, the course instructor and the graduate school. A special student may register for a maximum of 15 term hours of credit. Any credit hours for which grades of C or F are received count toward the 15- hour limit. Petitions for exception should be directed to the Dean of the Graduate School. The performance of special students is subject to review by the Promotions Committee and a grade of C or lower may be grounds for the graduate school to refuse permission for enrollment in subsequent courses. For cour ses with limited enrollment, priority will be given to BCM graduate students. 5.11 Inter -Institutional Student Registration - Reciprocal Agreements (Revis ed 06/15/06 , 07/30/12) In addition to full -time students accepted in the PhD and MD/PhD Program s, matriculated full-time students in a school with which BCM has a reciprocal agreement (Rice University, The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 25 Texas A&M University, University of Houston, The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and The University of Texas School of Me dicine may take courses for credit or may audit courses without going through formal admissions procedures or paying tuition. The established BCM procedures for registration must be followed. BCM graduate students may take graduate level courses at recipro cating institutions under the same conditions . BCM students can register for inter -institutional courses only when the course is approved by the student's Program , offered at the host institution for graduate credit, and when a comparable course is not of fered at BCM. During the registration process (Inter -institutional registration form), the Graduate School will evaluate the effectiveness of inter -institutional course s in supplementing the BCM curriculum and in meeting the overall goals of the student's Program . Registration must be approved by the student's Program , the BCM GSBS, the host institution and the host instructor. BCM students must comply with all of the requirements of the institution offering the course ( e.g., background checks, immunizations, etc.) 5.12 Floating Holidays and Term Breaks (New 08/01/11) Courses, exams, or other required activities will not be scheduled on the four BCM floating holidays (Good Friday, Christmas Eve, Day after Thanksgiving, President's Day) or during graduate school term breaks. For research students, including research rotations, arrangements for floating holidays or other time off should be made with the PI. ARTICLE 6. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 6.1 The Grading System and Assigning Credit (Revised 04/15/98, 04/26/02) Grade Description A Honors Work B Passing Work P Passing Work C Marginal Work MP Marginal Pass -Research Courses Only I Temporary Incomplete Work F Failing Work A grade of C or F does not confer credit toward Graduate School degree requirements. MP only applies to research related courses (Special Projects, Research Rotation and Dissertation). Incomplete (I) is to be used only to represent incomplete work; no oth er use of the grade is to be accepted. The grade may be carried no longer than three terms. After the third elapsed term, the I automatically becomes an F. For all courses that are graded without objective examination (e.g., graded on attendance) only gra des of P ( Pass), F ( Fail) or I (incomplete) can be used. These include but are not limited to Readings (courses numbered 548) and Seminar (courses numbered 466). Grades of P ( Pass), MP (marginal Pass) or F (Fail) are to be used for Special Projects (cours es numbered 435), Research Rotations (courses numbered 549) and Dissertation (courses numbered 550). In all courses ( School of Medicine and Graduate School), all students must be graded on The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 26 the identical criteria. If a Program wishes additional criteria for its students in a required course, such criteria should not be reflected in the recorded grade. Please refer to the institutional Course Repeat Policy (Section 23.1.09) for criteria for calculating repeats in coursework. 6.1.2 Assigning Academic Credit (2/29/12, Revised 8/27/15, 8/01/ 16) The academic calendar of the Graduate School is divided into five academic terms. Each term is of 8 weeks duration followed by one week of exams. Terms 1 and 2 are offered in the fall (August -December), terms 3 and 4 occur in the Spring (January -May) and Term 5 occurs in the Summer (May -July). Credits for coursework (term hours) are awarded on the basis of the Carnegie Unit. A term unit of credit is equal to one hour of lecture, seminar or small group discussion time per week or three hours of laborator y research activity per week. One term credit hour is equivalent to 0.5 semester credit hours. If the calculation of credit hours using the convention specified above is a non- integral number, the credit hours will be rounded to the closest integer. Please refer to the i nstitutional Credit Hour Policy (BCM Policy 23.1.11) for additional guidance on how academic credit is awarded and for overall guidance on the number of credits required for each BCM degree. 6.2 Grade Changes (Revised 08/23/04, 8/27/15, 08/01/16) Grades submitted by the faculty become final on the official date that grades are due each term. Grade changes for other than numerical error are discouraged. If an exam is re- evaluated, all students' answers to the affected sections of the exam are subject to review. Grade alterations affecting one student only, must be justified on the basis of a ma thematical or related error. Requests to change final grades must be submitted in writing by the course Director , with the approval of the Program director, to the Promotions Committee . The request must specifically state the reason for the change. If stu dent concerns regarding final grade are not resolved through discussion with the course director, students may choose to proceed with a formal grade appeal. Guidance for the appeal process, inclusive of timeline, is outlined in the BCM Student Grievances Policy (Section 23.1.08). 6.3 Student Evaluation (Revised 0 6/15/06) Students are encouraged to complete evaluation -of-course/instructor forms at the end of each term , including courses taken at other institutions through inter- institutional agreements (see article 5.11). The Graduate School office shall distribute these forms for each service course to each student engaged in classroom -based course work. Completed forms are to be returned to the Graduate School, before the end of the subsequent term, where they will be collated and sent to the respective course directors. 6.4 Transcripts All grades and academic actions will be permanently recorded on the transcript. Students may be provided with unofficial copies of transcripts. Official copies will be released only by written request of the student to the Registrar's office. 6.5 Unsatisfactory Academic are considered to be making good academic progress unless they have been placed on Academic Warning, Academic Probation or recommended for dismissal. Graduate students are expected to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree. One or more The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 27 credit hours with the grade of C, MP, F, or I makes a student subject to review by the Promotions Committee . The Promotions Committee will take one of the following actions: 1) Place the student on Academic Warning; 2) Place the student on Academic Probation; 3)Recommend the student for dismissal to the Dean; 4) Other action deemed appropriate bythe Promotions Committee . In the case of a grade of MP or F in a r esearch -related course, the student's TAC and Program Director will be notified as soon as possible by the Graduate School. If a TAC has not been established, the Program Director will be notified . The Program Director or designee will meet with the stud ent and mentor. A plan of remediation, signed by student, mentor, program director and TAC (if appropriate) must be submitted to the Graduate School within two (2) weeks of the preceding term's grade submission deadline. Before assigning a grade of F in a research -related course, the mentor must notify the Program director of the reason(s) for the grade, document ing that the student has been given written warning of their unsatisfactory performance and potential remedies. A student must be making good aca demic progress when granted permission to write and at graduation for either the MS or PhD degrees. 6.6 Academic Warning (Revised 04/13 /06, 11/08/07, 07/14/14) Any student who receives one to three credit hours of C, or one instance of MP (in a research -related course), will be placed on Academic Warning by the Promotions Committee . The Promotions Committee will notify the student, in writing, of its decision. To be removed from Academic Warning, the student must retake the required course within one year and obtain a grade of B (P in a research -related course) or better, and must also complete two terms with no grades lower than B (or P in a research -related course). A student who Fail s to comply with the specific conditions of the Academic Warning may be placed on Academic Probation by the Promotions Committee . A student who satisfies the conditions of the Academic Warning will be removed from Academic Warning upon review by the Promotions Committee . 6.7 Academic Probation (Revised 06/21/02, 04/13/06, 11/02/06, 11/08/07, 07/14/14) Any student who accumulates four or more credit hours of C, or receives one or more credit hours of F, or two (cumulative) grades of MP in research- related courses, will be placed on Academic Probation by the Promotions Committee . A student who fail s their first attempt at their Qualifying Examination will be placed on Academic Probation. The Promotions Committee will notify the student, in writing, of its decision. When a student is placed on probation or when a student on probation accumulates additional grades of C or lower, a plan of remediation must be submitted to the Promotions Committee by the student's Program . To be removed from Academic Probation the student must: (1) retake required course(s) within one year and obtain a grade of B or better ( P in a research -related course), or their second qualifying exam, and (2) complete two terms with no grades lower than B (P in a research -related course). A student who fails to comply with the specific conditions of his/her probation will be recommended to the Dean for dismissal from the Graduate School. A student who satisfies the conditions of probation will be removed from Academic Probation upon review by the Promotions Committee. 6.8 Dismissal (Revised 06/23/00, 11/16/01, 04/13/06)The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 28 6.8.1 Dismissal due to poor academic performance (Revised 11/11/99, 11/16/01 , 07/29/13, 07/14/14) A student who receives a grade of C or lower in nine or more term hours of courses, three (cumulative) grades of MP in a research -related course or 9 or more hours of a grade of F in a research -related course will be recommended for dismissal from the Grad uate School after grade verification by the Promotions Committee and Dean. A student who fails to pass their first qualifying examination may be recommended for dismissal to the Dean by the Promotions Committee (see Section 9.8.1). A student who fails to pass their second qualifying examination will be recommended for dismissal to the Dean by the Promotions Committee (see Section 9.8.1). The Dean will notify the student, in writing, of the decision for dismissal. If the dismissal is upheld on appeal, Dism issal is entered on the permanent transcript, along with the student's academic status at the time of dismissal. Outstanding grades of I at the time of dismissal will remain incomplete. The student will have the right to appeal the dismissal as outlined in Section 6.10, and must notify the Dean of the intent to appeal, in writing, within one week of receipt of notification of the dismissal action. 6.8.2 Dismissal for may be dismissed for non- academic reasons that seriously violate the expectations of professional behavior (Section 6.11). After investigation of any allegations, any finding of non- professional conduct will be forwarded to the Promotions Committee f or review and action. After its review, the Promotions Committee may recommend appropriate sanctions or penalties, including a recommendation for dismissal for non- academic reasons to the Dean. The Dean will notify the student, in writing, of the Promotions Committee's recommendation.

This includes, but is not limited to, actions of academic misconduct that occur in the context of meeting academic requirements (courses and Qualifying Examination s), scientific misconduct as defined by the College, violation of College policies, and acts of a criminal nature. 6.11.1 Academic Misconduct (New 02 /07/08, 07/29/13) Academic misconduct is defined as dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism, etc.) that occurs in conjunction with academic requirements such as cou rses or Qualifying Examination s. Allegations of academic misconduct should be made in writing to the Dean. In cases of alleged academic misconduct, the Dean will, within one week, appoint an Investigative Committee consisting of three faculty members and two students to investigate the allegations and report their findings and recommendations to the Promotions Committee (Section 6.8.2). The student has a right to receive a copy of the written allegations of academic misconduct provided to the Investigative Committe e and to respond to the Committee orally or in writing concerning any allegations if he or she chooses. The student may bring a faculty member of their choosing to serve as an advocate. 6.11.2 Scientific Misconduct (New 02 /07/08) Scientific misconduct is defined as \"fabrication, falsification, plagiarism or other acts that deviate from commonly accepted practices within the scientific community for proposing, conducting or reporting research\" (US Public Health Service Regulations). A llegations of scientific misconduct should be reported to the College officer in charge of investigating these allegations using the policies defined by the College. Once the College process has reached a conclusion and any appeals have concluded, any finding of scientific misconduct will be sent to the Promotions Committee for their review and action (section 6.8.2) 6 .11.3 Violation of College Policies (New 02 /07/08, Revised 8/2 7/2015 , 08/01/16) G raduate Students are expected to abide by all College policies that apply to them, including the policies set by the Graduate School, their Program and the College.

When other College entities deal with professional misconduct allegations involving graduate students, the Graduate School Dean should be informed of these allegations if in keeping with confidentiality requirements. Under extraordinary circumstances, where there may be concerns about well -being of the student or others, the Dean may suspend the student while awaiting a final resolution of the allegation by the College. If an allegation is substantiated, the Dean will inform the student, their Program director, and mentor in writing of the responsibilities of students to follow College and Program Policy and may recommend the matter to the Graduate School Promotions Committee if it is judged to be sufficiently serious to serve as grounds for dismissal (section 6.8.2). 6.11.4 Criminal Acts (New 02/07/08) The Dean may recommend review of the status of a graduate student convicted of a criminal offense. If the criminal a ct is judged to be of a serious nature, the Dean may forward the case to the Promotions Committee for their review and recommendation concerning dismissal (section 6.8.2). 6.12 Participation in Extracurricular Activities (New 08/23/04, Revised 08/01/16) Student who participate in extracurricular activities sponsored by the College requiring a significant time commitment including mentoring, recruiting, teaching assistantships, externships, etc. must be making good academic progress and have the permission of their mentor and Program director. 6.13 Student Written Grievance Policy (New 08/ 15/05, Revised 07/30/12, 01/29/15 , 8/27/15, 08/01/16) A grievance is a complaint arising out of any alleged unauthorized or unjustified act or decision by a member of the faculty, member of the administration, or member of the staff which in any way adversely affects the status, rights, or privileges of a member of the student body. A complaint is considered a written grievance whether it is filed on paper, online or on the phone. The burden of proof shall rest with the complainant. Student complaints or grievances should initially be addressed, if possible, by the student discussing the problem with the individual (student, faculty, staff) most closely related to the area of the grievance. Following that, the student should contact the individual's Supervisor, Program Director, Departmental Chair , Associate o r Assistant Dean and the Dean in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. If the problem is not resolved, the student may file a formal written grievance with the Dean of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences using the Student Grievance form . If the problem is not resolved the student is encouraged to contact the Integrity Hotline (855-764- 7292) to file a wri tten grievance with the Office of the Provost. The Integrity Hotline may also be accessed The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 32 through www.bcm.ethicspoint.com .

STUDENT RECORDS 7.1 Maintenance of Student Records (Revised 08/01/16) The Office of the Registrar is responsible for maintenance of all official academic records of students. BCM maintains a file on each student. Included in a student's file are the orig inal application form of the student for admission to BCM, transcripts of any college records, and test scores. Subsequent to the enrollment of the student at BCM, the student file contains enrollment forms, grades, letters of correspondence to other institutions concerning the student, narrative summaries rendered by the faculty concerning the student's academic work, letters indicating actions of the Promotions Committee , communications concerning the scholarships and loans, and other correspondence relating to the student's education at BCM. In addition to written material kept in the student files, BCM maintains, on a The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 33 computer, general information about each student: courses taken, grades, summary statements of academic actions, and enrollment informatio n. BCM's policy regarding creation and maintenance of student records is based upon practice recommended by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Offices. 7.2 Confidentiality of Student Records (Revised 8/27 /15, 08/01/16) It is t he Institutional Student Records Policy (Section 23.1.06) that the material contained in the student records is confidential; transfer of such infor mation within the school is permitted only for legitimate academic purposes. The school complies with the provision of both the Texas Open Records Act of 1973 and the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, and regulations governing educ ational institutions written by the Department of Health and Human Resources. The institution is responsible for ensuring that student academic records are properly secured and trains all staff supporting the education mission in Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), American Association of College of Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges ( SACSCOC ) accreditation requirements. 7.3 Student Access to Records (Revised 08/01/16) A student may examine student records at BCM concerning himself/herself by presenting the request to the Office of the Registrar. These records shall be made available for review by the student as promptly as possible. The records shall be examined in the office in which they are kept, under observation of administrative personnel, and shall not be altered, destroyed, or carried away from the office by the student. Material which relates to more than one individual shall not be made available for direct review, but the student shall be told the information contained in such records which relates to him/her. Former students have the same access to their records as those currently enrolled. A student may obtain a copy of his/her records. 7.4 Challenge of Content Accuracy (Revised 08/01/16) A student may challenge the accuracy of information contained in a record or may challenge information in a record that appears to represent an undue invasion of privacy. In the case of a challenge, the student sho uld meet with the faculty member or administrative official responsible for the information being questioned. The faculty member or administrative official may, through discussions with the student, concur with the challenged points and correct or delete t he information accordingly. If no compromise can be reached, the student may file a grievance (see GSBS policy 6.13). 7.5 Faculty Access to Records (Revised 08/01/16) All review of information in the file of a student in the Office of the Registrar by fac ulty members and administrative officers other than by those persons responsible for keeping the records, requires the signature of the faculty member or administrative official on a written form kept within the student's file and accompanied by the date of review and by a brief statement indicating the reason for review of the records. 7.6 Transfer of Information from Records The student shall be notified prior to the transfer of any information within the student file to persons or institutions other than those associated with or affiliated with BCM. Such The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 34 information may be transferred only: 1) By reason of a valid subpoena or judicial order of a court; 2) To federal or state educational agencies, providing the agency legally requests the information in writing and specifies the purpose for acquiring the information. 3) To organizations responsible for the accreditation of BCM; 4) Upon written request of the student, to persons he/she designates. 7.7 Criminal Background Checks and Health- Related Information (New 02.07.09 , 08/01/16) Although applicants are required to disclose any criminal background on their applications, formal criminal background checks, drug and/or alcohol testing, or vaccination or other health records may be required of students who perform research laboratory, h ospital or clinical setting s. Information obtained from these checks will only be used in accord with state and federal laws. The Graduate School and its representatives w ill hold such information in strict confidence and it will not become part of the student's official file. The student will have the right of access to all information collected and will be afforded the right to challenge its accuracy. In cases where there are findings reported on these checks, the Dean will appoint a Committee consisting of an Associate or Assistant Dean and the Program Director of the student's Program to recommend what if any actions should be taken. Students are required to comply wi th the BCM Influenza Vaccination Policy (Section 18.1.04). ARTICLE 8. RESIDENCY 8.1 Residency Requirements (Revised 06/21/02, 11/02/06) All candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy are required to spend 15 terms (3 years) in residency at BCM with the exception of those students receiving transfer of credit. The residency requirement will be reduced by one term for each 12 term hours transferred. The student who has obtained approval of the full transfer of credit (60 term hours) will have a residency requirement of 10 terms (2 years). Under rare circumstances (for example, the departure of the Major Advisor, so that the student mus t leave BCM to complete his/her research) the residency requirement may be waived upon request. This request must be approved by the Dean and by the Promotions Committee . Completion, in good standing, of the first year's Program in the BCM School of Medici ne may be used by a student in the MD/PhD Program to satisfy one year of the residency requirement in the Graduate School. 8.2 L eave of Absence (LOA) (Revised 01/16/04, 06/14/05, 11/02/06, 08/03/09 ) A student a LOA must submit a completed Leave-of-Absence /Clearance Form to the Graduate Program director prior to the start of the leave. Requests approved by the Program director are submitted for approval to the Dean. A LOA may be granted for a period of up to one year and shall be permanently noted on the student's transcript. If the request for LOA is approved by the Graduate School after the student has completed all the course requirements, including the final examination if applicable, the transcript will reflect the grade earned. Outstanding grades of I at the time of withdrawal will be changed to WD (withdrawn). The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 35 Students on LOA who fail to register within one week of the termination of the LOA shall be administratively withdrawn. A request from the student for an extension to the leave must be submitted in writing to the dean no later than the beginning of the term in which the original leave will expire. When a LOA is granted to a student with incomplete grades, the Promotions Com mittee determines whether or not to extend the time allowed for completing course requirements. Students on a LOA will not be charged tuition. Baylor group health insurance may be continued during a LOA . Release from the group policy during a LOA may be obtained by signing the appropriate forms in the Graduate School Office. (Request for Leave-of- Absence and LOA Clearance Form). Payment for health insurance, if continued during the LOA, must be made by the student prior to the start of the leave. An authorized LOA , for a period of up to one year, may be granted to graduate students who have compl eted their dissertation research, have accepted another position, and plan to complete the writing of their dissertation during the leave. Students on an approved LOA who go into year eight during the leave period will automatically have an extension of the 7 -year rule through the end of their approved leave. Students on an approved LOA which begins after the defense will be granted an automatic extension of the 7- year rule to accommodate the 2 -month period provided for revising their thesis. A student returning to BCM for the purpose of dissertation defense, may petition the Dean for return to active status for the period required to defend the dissertation. (Registration as a full-time student is not required during this period.) Foreign students may be prohibited by selective regulations of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from going on leaves of absence. 8.3 Remote Student Status (Revised 04/15/98, 01/16/04, 08/03/0 9, 08/02/10, 08/01/16) Students who wish to leave Baylor with their Major Advisor and also continue their studies as a full -time Baylor graduate student may do so by becoming a remote student. A remote student's Major A dvisor remains the chair of the student's Committee and must attend each meeting of the thesis Committee and the defense. A local BCM advisor must also be appointed to serve as a local contact. The local BCM advisor must also be a member of the student's TAC . A Remote Student Form must be completed prior to departure and prior to receiving a stipend from the remote institution. Students on remote status without permission may be subject to dismissal. Before a student can be put on remote status, they must be admitted to candidacy. The Major Advisor must also guarantee that the student will continue to receive a stipend and health insurance benefits. Remote students are responsible for all requirements expected of other Baylor graduate students (i.e. status reports, registration, symposium abstracts, etc.). Remote students and their Remote Advisors are required to meet with their thesis Committee every six months. If traveling to BCM twice a year presents financial or logistical problems and if approved by the Program Director, remote faculty advisor, and local faculty advisor at the time of the remote status, a student may be permitted to hold one of the biannual status report meetings by communicating with Committee members over the telephone, or via vide o conferencing , and the Status Report Signature page can be completed by faxing the form to the Committee members for their signatures. The Remote Advisor must also be physically present at the student's dissertation defense. The required travel to BCM for the student and the Remote Advisor for at least one thesis Committee meeting per year and for the final dissertation defense is the financial responsibility of the Remote Advisor. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 36 8.4 Remote Advisor (New 06/14/07 , Revised 08/02/10, 08/01/11, 08/01/16) If a student's advisor leaves the College permanently or is on a LOA or sabbatical that is likely to be of duration of greater than a year, the advisor will become a Remote Advisor and a local BCM advisor will be appointed. The Remote Advisor will be the student's Major Advisor. Remote Advisor status requires the submission of a Remote Advisor Status form which includes a plan that satisfactorily addresses the continued progress of the student toward their degree. Remote Advisor Status requi res approval of the student, the advisor, the thesis Committee , the Graduate Program and the Dean. Students cannot have a Remote Advisor until they have been admitted to candidacy and have been enrolled in the Graduate School for at least three years. The plan accompanying the request for Remote Advisor Status must include the following: (1) the appointment of a local BCM advisor who will have the responsibility of monitoring the student's progress and facilitate communication with the R emote Advisor, t he thesis Committee and the Graduate Program . The BCM advisor will have co- mentor status with the Remote Advisor and serves as a member of the TAC ; (2) an approximate time -line for the student's completion of thesis research and their defense which is acceptable to thestudent's Graduate Program ; (3) a mechanism for local supervision of the student's research, including a description of the role of the local advisor and other BCM personnel that will beavailable to the student on a regular basis; ( 4) a des cription of assigned laboratory space and the student's access to equipment, materials and supplies that will be sufficient to completethe dissertation research; ( 5) a guarantee that the student's stipend, insurance and research expenses will be paid for the duration of their enrollment. The source of the stipend,including any mechanisms for transferring remote funds to BCM to pay for the stipend mustbe described. Ultimately, the Graduate Program will be responsible for ensuring that financial support continues; ( 6) a description of how status reports and thesis Committee meetings will be held. The Remote Advisor must be physically present at BCM for at least one of the status report meetings each year. 8.5 Childbirth/Adoption Accommodation (New 06/15/0 6, Revised 08/01/11, 07/29/13 , 01/29/15 , 08/01/16) A graduate student is entitled to a maximum of eight (8) weeks stipend and benefits continuation from the current financial provider following the birth or adoption of his or her child. Students will not be placed on LOA during childbirth/adoption accommodation. A graduate student who seeks a childbirth/adoption accommodation must submit a completed Childbirth/Adoption Accommodation form to the Graduate Program director prior to the start of the leave. Baylor strongly encourages graduate students to submit requests approximately three (3) months prior to the anticipated childbirth or adoption. Requests approved by the Program director are submitted for approval to the Dean. In most cases, the childbirth/adoption accommodation period will begin on the date specified in the childbirth/adoption accommodation form which is filed with and approved by the Graduate School Office but may be amended as necessary to correspond with the actual bir th/adoption date. If childbirth/adoption occurs prior to the filing of the childbirth/adoption accommodation form, the accommodation period begins on the date of childbirth or adoption. In order to be eligible for childbirth/adoption accommodation, the graduate student is required to provide the appropriate documentation to the Graduate Program director. If the graduate student f ails to provide the appropriate documentation within fourteen days of The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 37 delivery or adoption, the stipend and benefits may be discontinued until the documentation is submitted. The general policies of the school will remain in effect during the period of childbirth/adoption accommodation. During the childbirth/adoption accommodation period, the student may be assigned some reasonable reading, writing, data analysis or other activities that may be accomplished without being present at BCM. The student is expected to make prior arrangements to submit work needed for the completion of any requirements missed during the accommodation period (e. g. status reports or course requirements) when the graduate student returns to the College. If the accommodation requires the student to miss classes or exams, the student may make arrangements to complete these requirements after returning or t he student may withdraw from the course. Accommodations for Breastfeeding Mothers as defined by BCM policy (Section 02.2.50) are available to studen ts. 8.6 Pursuit of Other Degrees While Enrolled in the GSBS (New 08/02/10) Students in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences are expected to devote their academic efforts entirely to the PhD/M.S. Program s. The GSBS does not enroll students on a part -time basis. BCM students may pursue multiple degrees while enrolled as a BCM student only if they are part of an official joint/dual degree Program of BCM (i.e. MD/PhD or School of Medicine Research Track/M. S.). Enrollment at another institution (such as the UT School of Public Health) that may be required as part of a BCM degree Program is permitted as are the completion of courses at other institutions for BCM credit that are covered by a reciprocal agreem ent for education (i.e. Rice, University of Houston, The University of Texas -Houston, Texas A&M, and UTMB-Galveston). ARTICLE 9. PROGRESS TOWARD THE DEGREE 9.1 Oversight (Revised 06.16.08) Students must continue to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. The student should set goals toward completing their studies with the assistance of the TAC and the Director of Graduate Studies their Program . Before appointment of the student's TAC , the Director of Graduate Studies of the student's Program is responsible for advising and mentoring the student. After the appointment of the TAC , the student is under the direction of a faculty preceptor supported by the student's TAC . Through the status report meetings, the TAC regularly reports the student's progress to the Director of Graduate Studies who conveys the status reports to the Promotions Committee of the Graduate School. 9.2 The Major Advisor & TAC (Revised 04/22/03) 9.2.1 Appointment of Major Advisor and Advisor/Student Compact (also see 1.6.4) (New 04/22/03, Revised 06/16/08) The Major Advisor is the Chairman of the student's TACTAC . The Major Advisor is responsible for providing mentorship and direction in helping the student develop research skills and the ability to do in dependent research. The Major Advisor must be selected by the student and the selection must be agreed to by the Major Advisor and the Graduate Program by the beginning of the student's second year (Appointment of Major Advisor Form). The Major Advisor must be present at all meetings of the TAC . The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 38 Upon appointment of the Major Advisor the Student and Major Advisor should review and sign the Compact between Students and their Mentors and return a signed copy to the Graduate School. 9.2.2 Appointment of TAC (Revised 04/22/03, 08/23/04, 11/08/07, 06/16/08) Each student will be provided with advice from a faculty group charged with oversight of the student's academic, technical and professional development. Before appointment of a TAC , the Program 's Gra duate Education Committee shall perform this role. The student's TAC must be appointed by the end of the third term of the student's second year in residence, but it may be appointed earlier and students are strongly encouraged to meet with their TAC as soon as practical after the Committee is appointed. TAC members agree to provide the student with oral and written feedback on their progress two times each year at the TAC meetings and to fulfill their commitment to attend these meetings. This Committee shall consist of a minimum of four members: the C hairperson of the Committee (the student's Major Advisor , who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty with an appointment in a department or Program offering a graduate degree), two additional members of the student's Program , and at least one faculty member (the outside member) who holds a primary academic appointment in a Department that is different from the primary academic Department of the Major Advisor. The Graduate Program Director is an ex officio member of the Committee . Additional members may be appointed at any time. The Committee shall be appointed by the Dean upon written request from the Graduate Program Director, with counsel from the student and the Major Advisor (TAC Form). Requests to change the composition of the TAC are made in writing by the Graduate Program director to the Dean ( TAC Form). The TAC shall be responsible for choosing any additional course work that the student must complete, for monitoring progress made, for requesting transfer of credit, and for petitioning , with the approval of the Graduate Program Director) to the Dean for exception to any academic regulations. The TAC is also responsible for mediating potential disputes which may arise betwe en the student and the Major Advisor. It shall review requests for dismissal of the student submitted by the advisor and approve or oppose such requests. In these cases, a temporary Chairperson will be appointed by the Program director from the TAC member s. The Committee 's decisions shall be reported in writing by the temporary Chairperson to the Program Director who shall inform the Dean regarding substantive changes in the student's progress or status. The Committee administers the final oral examinatio n and approves (by signing) the final copies of the student's dissertation. All members of the TAC must be present at the final defense. In the case of unforeseen extenuating circumstances, the student, Major Advisor, and Graduate Program Director may petition the Dean for an exception. 9.3 Appeal of TAC Decisions (Revised 06/16/08) A student or a Committee member , who disagrees with a TAC decision, may appeal in writing to the Dean. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 39 9.4 Status 06/21/02, 04/22/03, 03/31/04, 06/14/07, 06/16/08 , 01/16/13) Graduate students, second year and above, are responsible for meeting with their TAC and submitting a status report at least twice a year. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure that students receive feedback and direction on their thesis research and to promote a timely assessment of progress toward their degree and to help plan future work. 9.4 .1 Due Dates (Revised 06/16/08, 1/16/13) Status reports for second year students are due in the Graduate School by 5:00 p.m. on the last business day preceding December 24 (Year 2 Fall Status Report) and the last business day in June (Year 2 Spring Status Report). For students third year and above, status reports are due by 5:00 p.m. on the last business day in the month of their birth and the 6-month anniversary of their birth month. For the purpose of these status reports, the month of July will count towards the Fall reporting period (e.g. a 2 nd year student with a July/January birthday should use the form 'Status Report - Year 3 Fall -Year 4 Fall). There are no extensions of these deadlines, but the TAC meeting may be held at any time between the deadlines. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule and hold the TAC meeting so that they are completed before the deadlines. Since scheduling difficulties may be encountered, the student should begin arranging the meeting significantly in advance of the deadlines. Committee members are expe cted to respond to the student's request for a meeting in a timely fashion and to be as accommodating as possible in helping the student arrange the Committee meeting. Unanticipated emergencies and other significant extenuating circumstances may be considered by the Dean on a case-by-case basis. 9.4.2 Status Report Contents (Revised 06/16.08) The Status Report Form, which must be submitted after the completion of the status report meeting, includes a summary of the meeting prepared by the Major Advisor, an evaluation of the student's progress, and a completed signature page. At least five days prior to the thesis Committee meeting, the student will submit to all members of the thesis Committee a succinct written summary of their accomplishments since the last Committee meeting, including significant experimental findings, results and/or difficulties with an experimental approach, and the status of any publications. The status report should also include a brief description of plans for experiments in the coming six months. For meetings held during the spring of the student's fourth year and thereafter, a timeline (Section 9.4.2.1) must be submitted with the status report and reviewed by the TAC . The Graduate School strongly recommends that the status report and the TAC meeting follow the guidelines published by the Graduate School (available from the Graduate School web site). 9.4.2.1 Status Report Timeline (New 06/16/08) The TAC should help ensure that the student is continuing to make timely progress toward the degree. By the spring meeting of the four th year of enrollment, the student, mentor and TAC members must evaluate the student's progress and future plans for completion of the PhD. Before the meeting, the student, in consultation with the mentor, should prepare a timeline that lists graduation requirements and estimated dates of completion, if possible (i.e. June 20XX, summer 20XX , or too early to predict). The timeline, which must be included with the Status Report The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 40 Form, is intended to represent the best estimates at the time it is written. The timeline should be revised and updated n each subsequent status report meeting. The timeline should follow the format guideli nes established by the Graduate School (available from the Graduate School web site). 9.4.3 The Status Report Me eting (Revised 06/16/08) Status report meetings (except under the special circumstances described in Section 9.4.7) must include Major Advisor and at least two other members of the thesis Committee . A Committee member (including the mentor) may be present through teleconferencing or video conferencing arrangements. 9.4.4 Status Repor t Signature Page (Revised 06/16/08) Before the meeting ends, the Chairperson and Committee members will read any notes that might have been taken during the Committee meeting and together they will come to a consensus on the content of the summary statement. Any Committee member who disagre es with the summary and evaluation may append a statement to the status report indicating the basis for their disagreement. The signatures of the mentor, all Committee members and the student on the status report form denotes their presence or absence at the meeting and indicates their agreement with the evaluation and summary statement. If one or more Committee members write a dissenting statement, the signatures on the status report form signify that the Committee members and the student have read the dissenting opinion. If a student disagrees with comments in the summary statement or a Committee member's addendum, he/she may submit a written rebuttal to the status report describing the disagreement. The rebuttal must be submitted within one month of t he date of the thesis Committee meeting with a copy of the disputed status report. The rebuttal statement must be signed by the Major Advisor , all members of the thesis Committee and Program Director in acknowledgment that they have seen it and discussed it with the student. Signatures of the thesis Committee , including the chairman, do not indicate that they agree with the student's objections. The signed statement should be submitted to the Graduate School for inclusion in the student's file. 9.4.5 P ermission to Write granting \"permission to write,\" the student's thesis Committee acknowledges that all key experiments have been completed and that a thesis outline was presented and reviewed which descr ibed a sufficient body of work to merit a PhD if the dissertation and defense are satisfactorily completed. The student, in consultation with the mentor, must present a detailed outline of the thesis to the Committee at least two weeks before the meeting. The outline should present sufficient detail to judge the completeness of the experimental work with a clear indication of which portions of the experimental work are finished and which remain to be completed. The Committee expects that the student will complete all requirements and defend the thesis before the next status report deadline, and a timeline for completion of the written thesis and the oral defense should be set at the time permission to write is granted. Permission to write is not automatic ally renewed, and if a subsequent status report meeting is held, permission to write must be requested again. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 41 Permission to write is granted by completing the permission to write section of the status report form including checking all of the appropriate boxes. The permission to write meeting must be attended by a majority of the student's Committee . If any members of the Committee are not able to attend the meeting, they should review the proposed thesis outline and any proposed experiments and if satisfactory they should sign the form in the appropriate section acknowledging that they concur that the body of work presented in the thesis outline is sufficient. A student must be making good academic progress , including the completion of the required training in the responsible conduct of research (16 hours) when granted permission to write. The ethics requirement can be met by attending the required topics in the Science as a Profession course, the Postdoc Career Development Course, or for Clinical Scientist Training Program (CSTP) students completion of FCI. Ethics training requirements cannot be transferred from other institutions. This requirement will go into effect for students entering in academic year 10 -11. For students entering prior to academic year 10 -11, the completion of ethics training is required for admission to candidacy so that this requirement does not apply to per mission to write status. \"Permission to write\" status does not relieve the student from any academic requirements including submission of status reports, attendance at seminars, retreats, and other activities required by the Program or the Graduate School. 9.4.6 Late Penalties (Revised 06/16/08, 01/16/13, 07/20/13, 07/29/13) The status report meeting is an integral part of a student's progress toward their degree. If a report is not submitted by the deadlines specified for year 2, or year 3 and above students (Section 9.4.1) and the student has had no prior late penalties assessed at previous deadlines, the student will be assessed a $25 fine. If the completed status report is not submitted within 15 calendar days of the original deadline, an additional $50 fin e will be assessed and if still d elinquent after 30 calendar days from the original deadline, the student will receive a grade of F for Dissertation or Special Projects . The thesis committee will be notified of delinquent status reports. On the second instance of status report delinquency, the initial fine will be $50 and if still delinquent, 15 calendar days after the original deadline, the student will receive a grade of F for Dissertation or Special Projects. On the third instance of status report delinquency, the student will receive a grade of F for Dissertation or Special Projects immediately after the original deadline. A grade of F in Dissertation or Special Projects may be sufficient to cause a recommendation for dismissal from the Graduate Sc hool by the Promotions Committee (Section 6.8). The student may appeal the grade of F, any f ines, and/or their dismissal through the appeals process of the Promotions Committee (Section 6.10). 9.4.7 Special Circumstances (Revised 08/02/10, 08/01/11, 01/16/2013) Students who are standing for their final dissertation examination (defense, or submission of a terminal M.S. thesis) no later than three months after their given status report deadlines (Section 9.4.1) may submit the \"Defense of Dissertation Date\" or Application for a Terminal M.S. Form to the Graduate School office in lieu of the status report if it is received in the Graduate School before the status report deadline. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 42 If the defense is not held or the terminal M.S. thesis is not submitted on the sc heduled defense date, a status report becomes due within 2 weeks. In cases of illness or other unexpected circumstances beyond the student's control that prevent the attendance of the student, mentor, or a quorum of the committee (two members, student and mentor ), the Dean may grant an extension of the status report deadline and waive any penalties. Remote students (Section 8.3) or students with Remote Advisors (Section 8.4), will be allowed to have one status report meeting conducted by teleconference wi thout returning to BCM if this is approved by the student's Graduate Program . However, the status report and the Status Report Signature page must be completed. At least one thesis Committee meeting a year must be held with the student present at BCM alo ng with a majority of the thesis Committee present (section 9.4.3), including the local advisor. The Remote Advisor must at least be present by phone or teleconference 9.5 The Seven Year Rule (previously part of 8.1) 9.5.1 Monitoring student progress at the beginning of Year 6 (Revised 08/03/09 , 07/20/13, 08/01/ 16) The purpose of PhD training is for the student to develop the ability to function as an independent researcher. This includes maintaining steady progress toward completing the degree and the development of critical research skills and knowledge. This responsibility is shared among the student, his or her Major Advisor, the TAC and the Graduate Program. Once a student has entered their sixth year of study (including time on LOA), unless they have already recei ved permission to write, the student's Graduate Program (GEC or steering Committee ) will appoint an ex- officio member to the student's thesis Committee from the Program steering Committee or another designated member of their graduate faculty. The student or any member of the thesis Committee may, at any time, request that the Graduate Program appoint an ex- officio member. The Promotions Committee , at their discretion, may place an ex officio member representing the Promotions Committee on the student's TAC to monitor the student's progress toward the degree. The ex-of ficio member must be present at the thesis Committee meetings beginning at the Fall status report of year six and continuing until the student sets a defense date. The role of the Program 's ex-officio member is to monitor the student's progress and to ensure that progress toward degree, including alternative strategies, has been discussed at the Committee meeting and that an appropriate time -line for graduation is presented. The Program's ex-officio member may not vote in any decisions of the Committee . After the meeting, a written evaluation ( ex-officio check list) will be completed by the ex -officio member and submitted to the Program director for review. The Program director should discuss the report with the student and their mentor and submit a copy of the ex -officio rep ort to the Graduate School. The function of the ex officio member is to report to the Promotions Committee and the ex officio member may not vote in any Committee decisions. For students with an appointed ex- officio member , a status report that is not accompanied with a report from the ex -officio member will not be accepted by the Graduate School. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 43 9.5.2 Extension of the Seven Year Rule (Revised 08/03/09 , 07/29/13, 08/01/ 16) No more the 7 years may elapse between matriculation into the Graduate School, excluding leaves -of-absence, and completion of all degree requirements for the PhD degree. At the Spring TAC meeting preceding the beginning of the student's 8th year, the TAC and Graduate Program must request an extension of the 7- year rule by completing and signing the Seven Year Rule extension section of the Status Report Form, including the summary of the circumstances leading to the request. The extension of the seven- year rule must be requested by the TAC at each subsequent thesis Committee meeting. If a student has defended prior to the beginning of their 8 th year, a waiver of the 7- year rule will be granted automatically to accommodate the two-month period for revision between the defense and the submission of the final thesis. After review of the recommendations from the student's Program Director and the Program's ex-officio Committee member, the Promotions Committee will make a recommendation to the Dean concerning request to waive the 7 -year requirement. 9.6 Credit Requirements (Revised 08/03/09) The PhD requires satisfactory completion of 180 term hours. A minimum of 60 term hours of course work is required (includes Special Projects, Research Rotation, Seminar and Readings and other courses). 30 term hours of this requirement must be from courses which either: 1) have a letter grade assignment (\"letter graded\" courses) and be graded A -F by objective crite ria, or 2) are designated by the Curriculum Committee as \"approved Pass/Fail\" graded courses (excluding seminars and journal clubs. Any course counting toward the 30- hour requirement must be approved by the Curriculum Committee . Special Topics courses (co urse number xxx -463) cannot be applied to the 30- hour requirement. At least 24 of the required 30 term hours must come from courses assigning a letter grade; 6 term hours may come from the approved Pass /Fail category. For courses grades on a PASS/ FAIL basis that are offered for graduate credit at another institution or by the School of Medicine, more than 6 term hours of Pass /Fail courses can be used toward the 30 term hour requirement if the courses are required by a BCM Graduate Program and after review and approval by the Curriculum Committee on a case- by-case basis. \"Letter -graded courses\" must be graded A, B, C or F and grades must be assigned by objective criteria, i.e. by examination. Approved Pass /Fail courses must also use specific grading criter ia. While such criteria may not include written exams per se , each approved Pass-Fail course must utilize appropriate assessment tools, consistent with the educational goals of the course: (i.e. a paper, an oral presentation, homework problem solving, etc .). The remaining 120 term hours may consist of any courses approved by the Curriculum Committee and listed by a Program in the catalogue, including dissertation research. Specific required courses might differ among the various Program s as long as they c onform to the above requirements. Specific required courses might differ among the various Program s as long as they conform to the above requirements. At the beginning of the academic year, each Program will inform the Graduate School as to their specific course requirements, including any tracks or groups of flexible required electives and these requirements will be posted on the Program 's web The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 44 site. The Graduate School must be notified prior to any changes to course requirements. Students must repeat any required course when they receive a grade of C or F; however, the Program may determine if elective courses, including flexible requirements, must be repeated. 9.7 Transfer of Credit (Revised 04/22/03, 06/14/05, 08/03/09, 06/18/15, 8/27/15) A student may request transfer of graduate level course work completed (with grades of B or above, satisfactory or Pass ) at another university, provided that the courses were taken within 5 years of the date of matri culation at BCM and a grade of A or B was earned . Only those courses in which a grade is assigned as the result of an examination (not seminar, special projects, or research) will be considered by the Promotions Committee for transfer. A maximum of 60 term hours (30 semester hours) may be submitted for transfer. Of the 30 hours required for Admission to Candidacy, individual Program s may set different limits on the number of hours that may be transferred, but no more than 24 hours of transfer credit will be allowed. Course work completed at a university outside the USA will be considered on a case by case basis. BCM School of Medicine courses that are preapproved for transfer credit by the Promotions Committee will be automatically allowed as transfer credit upon completion of a transfer of credit form. Other School of Medicine courses will be considered by the Promotions Committee on a case- by-case basis. The specific courses transferred will not be listed on the graduate school transcript, only total credit hours transferred. Program s may accept previous course work to satisfy Program requirements without requesting transfer of credit from the Promotions Committee . BCM School of Medicine courses that are offered for Pass /Fail credit can be considered for transfer of credit if they have been reviewed and approved by the Curriculum Committee . Courses that are approved for transfer credit can be used toward the 30 hour of required course work if the course is evaluated by specifi c grading criteria. Additionally, the Graduate School complies with the BCM Acceptance of Transfer Credit Policy (Section 23.1.05) that provides criteria for evaluating, awarding, and accepting transfer credit by examination, advanced standing and professional certificates. 9.8 The Qualifying Examination (Revised 11/13/96, 06/16/08) The purpose of the qualifying exam is to determine whether the student has sufficient general knowledge, oral and written communication skills, and intellectual ability to successfully carry out independent, scholarly research that will satisfy the requirements for awarding of the PhD or M.S. degree. The qualifying exam is administered by the individual Graduate Programs, which also determines the format of the exam. In general, the exam tests the ability of the student to formulate a significant scientific hypothesis, to develop an approach to experimentally test the hyp othesis and interpret the possible results, and to discuss the proposed project with respect to the relevant body of knowledge. All candidates for a degree must take the Qualifying Examination at BCM by the end of their 2nd year of enrollment. Any exception must be approved by the Program director and the Dean. Only full -time students are eligible to take the qualifying exam upon recommendation by the Program director and approval by the Dean (Statement of The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 45 Qualifying Examination Date Form). The Program dir ector shall recommend the examination date, nominate the Examining Committee , and decide whether or not to make the exam public. It is the responsibility of the student to submit the completed Statement of Qualifying Examination Date Form to the Dean for approval prior to the date of the exam. Once the examination date has been set, if any member of the examination Committee finds he/she cannot be present at the examination, he/she must inform the Dean in writing prior to the date of the exam. Transfer students must take the Qualifying Examination at BCM and all exceptions must be approved by the Promotions Committee . 9.8.1 Results of , 08/ 21/14) In the event of Program s using both a written and oral Qualifying Examination , all phases of the examination process must be complete before indicating a result on the \"Result of Qualifying Examination Form.\" Passage, incomplete, or Fail ure of the Qualifying Examination is cer tified by the Examining Committee , the Program director, and endorsed by the Dean (Result of Qualifying Examination Form). There are three possible outcomes of a Qualifying Examination - Pass , Incomplete, or Fail. A Pass is awarded to students who successf ully complete the examination. An Incomplete is used when the Examining Committee determines that the student's performance is inadequate and that additional requirements must be completed to remedy the deficiency. The additional requirements must be specified by the Examining Committee on the Result of Qualifying Examination Form, including a date by which the additional requirements must be completed (the Program director and the Dean must sign the Result of Qualifying Examination Form). After the requirements stipulated by the Examining Committee have been satisfied, the Examining Committee and Program director will notify the Dean using the Result of Qualifying Examination Form and the student's academic record will be updated from incom plete to Pass . If the requirements to remediate an incomplete are not completed satisfactorily, the Examining Committee and Program director will notify the Dean using the Result of Qualifying Examination Form and the student's academic record will be updated from Incomplete to Fail on the date the Program submits written verification of the resolution of the incomplete. A Fail is awarded if the student's performance on the Qualifying Examination is unsatisfactory, either at the initial examination or when an incomplete is resolved with a grade of Fail. Failure of the Qualifying Examination is reported to the Promotions Committee and the student will be placed on Academic Probation. A student who Fails their initial Qualifying Examination may be recommended for dismissal to the Dean by the Promotions Committee . A second Qualifying Examination may be taken only if recommended by the student's Program . Students remain on Academic Probation until successfully completing a second qualifying exam. The second examination must be taken within six months of the initial examination date. In the event of a second Failure, the student will be recommended for dismissal by the Promotions Committee . To appeal this recommendation of dismissal, see Article 6.10. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 46 9.9 Admission to Candidacy for the Degree (Revised 06/23/99, 01/25/02, 06/14/05 , 08/ 02/10) A student is accepted into candidacy only after successful completion of the Qualification Exam and Pass ing the Program required curriculum, including the completion of 60 term hours of which 30 term hours must be in courses that meet the credit requirements as described in section 9.6, and completion of the first two years (8 sessions) of the ethics requirement. The ethi cs requirement can be met by attending the required topics in the Science as a Profession course or in the Postdoc Career Development Course or for CSTP students through FCI. To provide alternative instruction that will meet this requirement, Program s off ering their own ethics training must provide at least 8 contact hours, cover all of the NIH -proscribed topics , and provide at least 30% of the instruction in small group case discussions. Ethics training requirements cannot be transferred from other institutions. This requirement will go into effect for students entering in academic year 10 -11. For student entering prior to academic year 10 -11, admission to candidacy requires completion of the seven required topics presented in the Science as a Professio n course prior to 2010. The TAC must be appointed prior to admission to candidacy. Admission to candidacy must be approved nine months (36 weeks) before the expected date of graduation. A student with transfer credit must have spent at least four acade mic terms in residency before admission to candidacy. He/she must present 48 term hours of course work completed in residence. Admission to candidacy requires approval of the departmental chair and the Dean (Admission to Candidacy Form). Students who are not admitted to candidacy by the end of their second year will be reviewed for potential academic action by the Promotions Committee and Dean. Any exception to the two -year rule must be approved by the Program Director and the Dean. 9.10 Other Examinati ons Program s reserve the right to examine students upon admission or during their studies to determine their qualifications for graduate work. Such examinations shall not be the Qualifying Examination for admission to PhD candidacy, but purely a Program procedure. Based on its evaluation of these exams, the Program may recommend to the Promotions Committee that the student be placed on probation or dismissed from the Program . 9.11 Candidates for the Master of Science Degree (Revised 08/30/01, 0 6/16/08, 01/29/2015, 06/18/15) The Graduate School considers applications for master's degree admission for the Clinical Scientist Training Program (CSTP) and medical students participating in the School of Medicine Research Track (MSRT). A PhD candidate student may request permission to terminate graduate study by completing the requirements for a Master's degree. Eligibility for the terminal Master's degree may be considered when a student is not able to complete the requirements for a PhD degree. The MS requires satisfactory completion of 84 term credit hours and all Program curriculum requirements. Thirty (30) term hours of this requirement must be from courses which either: 1) have a letter grade assignment (\"letter graded\" courses) and be graded A -F by objective criteria, or 2) are designated by the Curriculum Committee as \"approved Pass /Fail\" graded courses (excluding seminars and journal clubs). Any course that counts toward the 30-hour requirement must be approved by the Curriculum Comm ittee as didactic credit. Special Topics courses (course number xxx-463) cannot be applied to the 30- hour requirement.The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 47 At least 24 of the required 30 term hours must come from courses assigning a letter grade; 6 term hours may come from the approved Pass /Fail category. More than 6 term hours of courses graded on a P/F basis that are offered for graduate credit at another institution or by the School of Medicine can be used toward the 30 term hour requirement if the courses are required by a BCM Graduate P rogram and a re reviewed and approval by the Curriculum Committee on a case- by-case basis. \"Letter -graded courses\" must be graded A, B, C or F and grades must be assigned by objective criteria, i.e. by examination. Approved Pass /Fail courses must also use specific grading criteria. While such criteria may not include written exams, each approved Pass -Fail course must utilize appropriate assessment tools, consistent with the educational goals of the course: (i.e. a paper, an oral presentation, homework, problem solving, etc.). The remaining 54 term hours may consist of any course approved by the Curriculum Committee and listed by a Program in the catalogue, including dissertation research. 9.11.1 Qualifications for the T erminal Maste r of eligible to apply for a terminal master's degree, a student must have completed the 30 credit hour coursework requirement and all department curriculum requirements and appointment of TAC .

Mentors are expected to give students and postdocs, even those that are no longer in the laboratory, the opportunity to satisfy all the criteria for authorshi p as specified in the BCM The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 49 Authorship Policy when they have contributed work to a manuscript. The BCM Authorship Policy (BCM 02.9.40 Policy on Authorship) states in part: \"An author is one who has met all of the three criteria a) made a substantial contribution to the conception and design of the project, acquisition of data, the analysis and interpretation of the data, or other substantial scholarly effort; b) participated in drafting and/or revising the Publication critically for important intellectual content; and c) approved the final version to be submitted \" ARTICLE 10. GRADUATION 10.1 Dissertation Examining Committee (Revised 11/11/99, 08/01/16) The Examining Committee is appointed by the Major Advisor, in consultation with the Program director and is approved by the Dean. The Examining Committee shall be composed of the student's TAC , and any additional ex -officio members deemed appropriate by the Major Advisor and Program director. A student must be making good academic progress to schedule the defense dissertation. 10.2 The Dissertation (Revised 08/30/01) The PhD dissertation represents an authoritative contribution to scientific knowledge and demonstrates that the student has the intellectual and technical ability to conduct an independent and scholarly research project. The PhD dissertation is an academic document submitted by the student to the Graduate School following the defense and approval of the entirety of the document by the Dissertation Committee . The Committee members shall indicate their approval of the dissertation by signing on the Approval Page. No signatures may be affixed until all changes are completed as requested by the Committee members. Unanimous approval of the dissertation is required. The dissert ation shall consist of original scientific research carried out by the student. Collaborations or participation by others and the conduct of the work shall be clearly defined. The dissertation shall reach conclusions that are a logical result of the experi ments performed. Sufficient experimental details shall be included to allow the work to be reproduced by an individual skilled in the methodology, from the information provided. The dissertation can include information already published by the student, but this fact must be acknowledged by appropriate references, and the text and data presentations must be reformatted to conform to the dissertation style. Any experimental results obtained by others and included in the original publication must either be exp unged from the dissertation or attributed by name in footnotes or text citations to the original experimenter. The form of the dissertation shall follow a standard format as outlined below. 10.2.1 Format and Organization of the Dissertation (Revised 08/30/ 01) Detailed instructions for completing the dissertation, its defense, submission to the Graduate School, and text format are available from the Graduate School Office in a document entitled, \"Instructions for Submitting a Thesis or Dissertation.\" In those instances when published work is to be incorporated in the dissertation suitable adjustments in style shall be made to bring all sections of the document into a uniform presentation style, including bibliographic citations. The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 50 S ection Name Order Section N ame Order Title Page* 1 Introduction & Background 8 Approval Signature Page 2 Methods & Materials 9 Acknowledgments 3 Results 10 Abstract 4 Discussion 11 Table of Contents 5 Summary & Significance 12 List of Figures 6 Bibliography 13 List of Tables 7 Appendices 14 *For the PhD di ssertation, the Title Page shall bear the exact title of the dissertation, followed by the statement: \"A Dissertation submitted to the Faculty of The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences of BCM in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy by name of student .

Houston, Texas, Month, Year .\" The Introduction and Background (Section 8) shall constitute a literature review which sets the stage for the research and its rationale. The order of sections 9, 10 and 11 may be repeated or combined to facilitate production of the dissertation's chapters from the student's scientific publications. It is usual to choose to combine all methods sections together, but at the student's and Committee 's discretion sections may be kept apart for clarity. Similarly, results and discussion can appear together in discrete chapters separated by content or specific aims. These sections must, howeve r, be reformatted to conform to the dissertation style. Individual chapters may contain their own discussion sections. However, at the end of the dissertation the Summary and Significance section should re -capitulate the salient findings and conclusions of the work and place these observations in the context of current studies in that field. The student is encouraged to use this section to speculate on the work's significance, and/or to recommend future avenues of fruitful experimentation. The dissertation is an academic document submitted by the student to the Graduate School 10.2.2 Defense of the Dissertation (Revised 11/11/99) 10.2.2.1 Scheduling the Defense of Dissertation (Defense of Dissertation Date Form) ( Revised 11/11/99) The student should schedule the dissertation seminar sufficiently in advance so that all members of the Examining Committee can be present. All members of the Examining Committee are expected to be in attendance at the dissertation seminar and defense. C ommittee members should acknowledge their acceptance The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 51 of the examination date by signing and dating the form. Once the date of the examination has been set, members can be excused from attendance only under extraordinary circumstances. Permission to be ab sent from a dissertation defense examination must be requested by the Committee members and acknowledged by the Dean prior to the examination date. 10.2.2.2 Defense of Dissertation ( Revised 11/11/99, 08/02/10) The students must submit the dissertation to t he Examining Committee no less than two weeks prior to the defense. The dissertation should be complete and near to its final form. A public dissertation seminar must be presented before the final defense. In addition, the Examining Committee will meet with the student in either closed or open session (at the discretion of the student's Graduate Program ) for the final dissertation examination. Successful defense of the dissertation shall be indicated by the signatures of the entire Committee and the approval of the Dean (Result of Defense of Dissertation form). If unexpected circumstances prevent the occurrence of the defense, it should be rescheduled as soon as possible. Any status reports that were waived because of the schedule defense become due. If there are any significant deficiencies of the thesis (other than typ ographical errors) that must be corrected before final approval, these should be indicated directly on the form or on attached pages. A single dissenting vote is sufficient grounds for Fail ing the dissertation defense. Failure of the dissertation defense can be appealed to the Promotions Committee by the student or the student's Major Advisor. The Promotions Committee may recommend to the Dean to uphold the Fail ure, award the PhD , appoint a new Committee and examination, or recommend another examination of the student by the same Committee . The defense of dissertation should be satisfactorily completed at least one month before the intended date of graduation. 1 0.2.3 Submission of Completed Dissertation with Revisions (Revised 1/02/06 , 08/ 03/09 , 08/01/16) No later than two months after successful defense of the dissertation and at least one month prior to the annually scheduled graduation ceremony, the amended dissertation must be typed in final form, signed by all members of the Examining Committee and Department Chair , approved by the Dean, and submitted for binding. Any extension of the two month deadline for submission of the final dissertation must be requested by the student prior to the deadline and approved by the Dean. The Graduate School cannot verify completion of the degree until all requirements, including submission and approval of the dissertation are completed. It is the student's responsibility to submit the original and three copies of the dissertation, completely ready for binding, to the Graduate School office in order to complete degree requirements. Students on an approved LOA (after the defense) which is longer than 2- months, shall have an extension of the 2- month dissertation rule through the end of the approved leave. At the time the Dean accepts and signs the dissertation, the student must be making good academic progress , will have completed all academic obligations for the degree and The Graduate School Policy Handbook Revised July 30, 2018 52 will be eligible to have the degree conferred. The official date of graduation will be the day the dissertation was signed by the Dean. 10.3 Financial Clearance During the 4th year of enrollment, student must pay a graduation fee that covers the diploma and academic regalia rental. Other fees payable prior to graduation are binding fees and optiona l microfilm agreements, copyright, and reprint fees. The student must be certified to be free of debts and obligations to the school before the degree can be conferred.

Credits: Variable Term: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Counts for 30 hr. requirement: N Director: Dr. Robert Franklin Human Neuroimaging (GS-NE-400) Neuroimaging has rapidly become one of the most popular and powerful tools for neuroscience. This course surveys a variety of brain imaging modalities, describing what each measures and how the results are used for research. Neuroscience has classically relied on invasive electrode measurements, mostly in animals, to directly map electrical activity in the brain, and modem microelectrode arrays have expanded this method. Two other brain activity measurement schemes, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), provide non-invasive measurements with excellent temporal resolution but limited spatial accuracy. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become tremendously popular because it is non- invasive, involves no ionizing radiation, and offers substantial flexibility. In particular, MRI is used to measure brain structure in a variety of fashions, to measure white-matter connectivity using diffusion-weighted imaging (e.g., DTI), and to measure brain function (e.g., fMRI). Extensive techniques have been developed to localize and probe cortical activity in a variety of specialized areas. Optical imaging techniques have also contributed substantially to our understanding of brain function, mostly as an invasive technique in animal models. Positron-emission tomography (PET) provides additional specialized information about brain function. Students should have introductory physics and calculus capability at the freshman level.

PRO GRAM DESCRIPTION A.Req uired Courses The pr ogram provides didactic training in a variety of areas of Genetics. Requ ired courses for all students include the following : Genet ics A (2 hrs) Responsible Conduct of Research - Year 1 (1 hr) Method and Logic in Molecular Biology (3 hrs) Genetics B (2 hrs) Gene Regulation (3 hrs)Human Genetics (3 hrs) Introduction to Biostatistics for Translational Researchers (3 hrs) Seminars in Molecular & Human Genetics (3 terms) Student Research Seminars (4 terms)A minimum of three Laboratory Rotations (Research Rotations) Requi red courses for students in the regular track include the following (in addition to the courses listed above): Mole cular Methods (3 hrs) Organization of the Cell (2 hrs) Mammalian Molecular Genetics (2 hrs) Requi red courses for students in the BiGSB track include the following (in addition to the courses listed above): Intr oduction to Data Mining (2 hrs) Typi cally, students would complete the required courses, and a minimum of 3 lab oratory rotations (8 weeks each) by the end of the fifth term. Requ irements may be waived by the Graduate Education Committee based on the student's background in var ious subject areas. Students may petition the GEC for such waivers. Seminars in Molecular & Human Genetics is a required course for all first and second -year students. B. Elec tive Courses Stude nts are required to complete a minimum of 60 term hours of course work, of which 30 term hours must be in courses that either have a letter grade assignment or are specifically designated by the Graduate School as \"approved pass/fail\" graded courses (e.g. Method and Logic in Molecular Biology and Research Desig n). Please note that completion of the requir ed courses above will satisfy 23 of the 30 hours; therefore, a minimum of 7 course hour of electives will be requir ed for students entering in 2017. Selection of elective courses will be made in consultation with the thesis advisor or the Director of the Graduate program.136Hi ghly recommended electives include: Int roduction to Data Mining (required for BiGSB track students) Cell Division Development Cancer Neuroscience Immunology Computer- Aided Discovery Methods Practical Introduction to Programming for Scientists Macromolecul es: Structure and Function Gene and Cell Therapy Concepts of Learning & Memory Biology of Aging & Age Related Diseases Research Design Computer-Aided Discovery Methods Introduction to M edical Genetics Tr ansfer of credit for work completed at another university or in another advanced program may be requested. No more than 60 term hours (30 semester) may be submitted for transfer. Transfer credit can only be granted for courses receiving a grade based on performance on an examination. No research or seminar credit will be transferred. Requests for transfer must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies and the GEC for first year students, or the Major Advisor and the student's thesis committee for more senior students. Subsequently, the request is sent to the Promotions Committee of the Graduate School for final decision on acceptance. C. Lab oratory Rotations Laboratory rotations (Research Rotations) are to be conducted in a minimum of three different laboratories. Students who wish to petition for a reduction in the number of required rotationsmay submit a written request for review by the GEC. Incoming students who work full- time for a minimum of four weeks in the lab of a faculty member participating in the MHG Graduate Program may count that work as a research rotation. To request approval for summer work to count as a rotation, the student should submit a written request to the GEC. La boratory rotation (Research Rotation) credit hours are considered course hours by the Graduate School and contribute to the total of 60 credit hours that are required for graduation. Students should expect to spend approximately 3 hours per week per credit hour in thelaboratory during a rotation. The rotation period ends when classes end at the beginning of the study period before exams. Students and faculty should discuss the work schedule of the student, the class time and course load. The specific issue of time off for studying for mid -term and final examinations should be addressed at the time the student is considering doing a rotation in the lab. Major departmental events such as the annual retreat are very important for the students and rotation demands should not compromise their ability to attend these activities. Th e grade of Pass/Marginal Pass/ Fail is given for a rotation. The students should discuss with the faculty how they will be evaluated and should meet to evaluate the student's progress duringthe rotation period a t various points (for example 2 to 3 weeks after the rotation starts, after mid - term and at the end). One of the major purposes of the rotation is to permit students to explorevarious experimental systems and laboratory settings in order to better select a thesis advisor. If a faculty member is unable to take a student for the coming year for thesis research, the student should be advised of this situation. Becau se the terms are only 8 -10 weeks in length, the academic demands are high, and many of the students are inexperienced in laboratory work, much of the \"education\" of the rotation is likely to be introducing students to the overall goals of the laboratory's research and instruction in basic laboratory skills.137 It is expected that the faculty will m ake no commitments or request a commitment from a student prior to the completion of three rotation periods. The students need the opportunity to explore various labs without the pressure of \"losing out\" for a position in a particular lab that has more th an one student interested. D. Sem inars and Retreats 1. Faculty Research Presentations: In the first term, faculty will meet with students to briefly describe their research interests. This activity is not a course and no credit is received;neverthe less it is an integral part of the training program. It is a particularly valuable way for students to learn about research activities of the department and to select future rotation sponsors and potential thesis sponsors. 2.Departmental Seminars: Part icipation and attendance at the departmental seminars and retreats are an important part of graduate training. Student attendance is expected throughout this term as a graduate student and should be strongly encouraged by the faculty preceptor. VII.

Q UALIFYING EXAMINATION Up on completion of the first year of study students will be evaluated on the basis of their academic performance and by completion of the Qualifying Examination. The format of this examination is the definition of a novel research problem and the development of a proposal to address the stated question and hypothesis. The significance, feasibility, and the relationship of the proposal to the literature will be important criteria for evaluation. The Qualifying Examination determin es, in part, the st udent's eligibility for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The examination is designed to test the student's basic knowledge of molecular biology and genetics , as well as assess creat ivity and rationality of research design. The Qualifying Examination will be held near the end of Term 1 of the second year, unless the student petitions the GEC for a delay due, for example, to the need to make up courses that were not passed in year 1 or other extenuating circumstances. Students must take the qualifying examination by the end of their 2nd year of enrollment. Any exception must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies and the Dean. Th e Qualifying Examination Committee will consist of five (5) members; four are faculty (p rimary or secondary appointees) in the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and one member is from outside the Department. The composition of the Qualifying Examination Committee will be formulated by the Director of the Qualifying Examination Commi ttee in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies. The student's advisor may not serve on the student's Qualifying Examination Committee, but is encouraged to attend the examination as an observ er only. The Qualifying Examination is comprised of four parts: 1) Preparation of one written abstract; 2) Preparation of a written proposal based on the abstract; 3) Oral presentation of the proposal; and 4) Oral defense of the proposal. Sample abstracts and proposals are available to stud ents on the MHG web page. Note that effective 2013 the Qualifying Examination was changed from an \"off-topic\" format to an \"in the field\" format as described below. Consequently, the examples from prior to 2013 do not provide ideal guidance for the current format. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STUDENT \"In-the-Field\" format and PI involvement : Students will choose a Qualifying Exam topic that is in the field of their thesis research. The Specific Aims cannot be ones proposed previously or under consideration currently by their PI or members of their lab. The aims can but do not necessarily need to be aims the student will pursue for their thesis research, but must be relevant to the field. The proposal must be strongly rooted in genetics, include a hypothesis and be hypothesis driven. We encourage you to solicit the advice of your advisor and any other members of the scientific community.

Selection of elective courses will be made in consultation with the Pharmacology Graduate Program Committee. Th e following courses are approved by the Pharmacology Graduate Program Comm ittee as electives: FIRST TERM CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF DISEASE (2 HRS) COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS & STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY (6 HRS) METHOD & LOGIC IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (3 HRS) GENETICS A (2 HRS) SECOND TERM CELL DIVISION (2 HRS) GENETICS B (2 HRS) 157 THIRD TERM COMPUTER -AIDED DISCOVERY METHODS (2 HRS) FOURTH TERM BIOINFORMATICS & GENOMIC ANALYSIS (3 HRS) BIOSTATISTICS FOR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCHERS (3 HRS) CELLULAR SIGNALING (3 HRS) INTRODUCTION TO MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS (3 HRS) INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL COMPUTING & MODELING (3 HRS) PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING FOR SCIENTISTS (3 HRS) FIFTH TERM PROTEOMICS & FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS (3 HRS) Facu lty Research Presentations - Each faculty member is given the opportunity to mak e a short presentation to the first year students describing their overall research program. These are informal talks and should last only around 20 minutes. Two faculty members will present twice a week for during the First Term. Attendance is mandatory for first year students. Resear ch Rotations - The primary goals for the research rotations are twofold: First, rotations allow new students to become familiar with research conducted in the laboratories of Pharmacology faculty members. Second, rotations allow students t o familiarize themselves with laboratory procedures, approaches and a variety of research projects. Th e student will select their Major Thesis A dvisor primarily based on these rotations. All students are required by the department to complete four rotations in the first four terms. Students will select laboratories of professors with primary or secondary appointment in the Department of Pharmacology for rotation. At the fifth term, students will either choose their lab of study for their thesis work or participate in one more rotation. Res earch Rotation credit hours are considered course hours (370 -549) by the GSBS and contribute to the total of 60 credit hours that are required for graduation. For every credit hour of laboratory rotation for which a student is enrolled , they are expected to work a minimum of 3 hours per week in the laboratory. Some rotations may require more effort for limited periods of time (evenings or weekends). However, students are NOT expected to be full -time laboratory personnel. In ord er to make the best of the research rotation for both the student and the faculty, they shoul d meet before the rotation begins. If the faculty member will not be the direct supervisor for experimentation, the laboratory supervisor must be present at this meeting and understand the guidelines and requirements for the student's lab rotation. Both the faculty member and student should discuss and sign the Goals for Research Rotation Form and submit it to the PGP Director. The form will go into the student's program file. The form is due by the end of the first week of rotation. Th e rotation period ends when classes end at the beginning of the study period preceding exams. At that time, the student and the faculty member should meet again. In consultation 158 wi th the faculty member, the student is to write a one- page description of the rotation. This will be attached to the Evaluation of Research Rotation Form (from PGP) which is filled out by the faculty member and discussed with the student. Both the faculty mentor and student sign the form indicating that they have discussed it. The form should be sub mitted to the department by the end of the corresponding term's exam week. The grade of Pass/Fail is given for a rotation by the faculty mentor. Resear ch Hours - All students must register for some form of research throughout their graduate career. First year students who are rotating through labs should register for Research Rotation (370- 549). Students who have joined a laboratory, but have not yet been admitted to candidacy should register for Special Projects ( 370-435). Students who have been admitted to candidacy should register for Dissertation Research (370- 550). The total number of hours of research and course credits each term should be at least 12. If the student is not taking courses during a term, they will register for 12 research hours. Jour nal Club - Students will participate in a monthly journal club, led by faculty members. They will be notified of the dates and time by the Graduate Program office. St udent Presentation - All students who have passed their Qualifying Exams are require d to make a formal presentation each academic year. These should be oral talks, not posters. Proof should be given to the Pharmacology Program Office. If the student is nearing the end of the academic year without having presented a talk, then they will be scheduled to do a departmental talk before the end of the year. Dep artmental Retreat - The Department of Pharmacology participates in an annual retreat with the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The research efforts of the faculty, post -doctoral researchers and graduate students are discussed at the retreat. Students are expected to participate in the departmental retreat. First year graduate student participation will be funded by the department. Qualifying Examination The purpose of the qualifying examination is to assess the student's eligibility for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Eligibility is determined by examination of the student's capacity for originality and scientific approach to research as well as his/her knowledge of the core curriculum of Pharmacology. All students must complete the Qualifying Examination processes by the end of their second year of enrollment. Ab stracts - Each student is expected to submit one abstract to the Qualifying Examination Committee by August 1 of their second year. The abstract should cover a topic that the student is considering for development into a dissertation project. Students should submit an electronic document containing the following to the Program office: 1.Background and Significance - Introduce the proposed research problem and highlight the gap in the field that the research proposal w ould fill. ~ 1 page 2.Hypothesis to be Tested - Clearly define the specific hypothesis that the proposal will address. ~ 1 paragraph 3.Specific Aims - List the specific question that the proposal will address and basic statement of the experimental procedures you plan to utilize to pursue answer to the hypothesis. ~ 3 to 5 Specific AimsQuantitative and Computational Biology 2018-19 Curriculum i s designed to meet t he specific n eeds of st udents w ith B.S. degr ees i n biology, m ath, physics, ch emistry, computer s cience, or eng ineering.

In the first year, each term is followed by a one-week break. Course work is required in the following subjects: Molecular Methods Genetics A and B Human Physiology I & II Immunology Gene Regulation Organization of the Cell Method & Logic of Translational Biology Pathophysiology & Mechanisms of Human Disease Animal Model s of Human Disease Introductory Biostatistics for Translational Research Cells Tissues & Organs Ethics, Conduct & Practical Aspects of Clinical Research First year students also participate in laboratory rotations and the Bench -to- Bedside journal club. In general, all required courses are taken in the first year of residence. TBMM Graduate Curriculum - Year 2 and above In the 2nd year of the TBMM program, students begin their Thesis Research Projects , engage in Leadership training and work on their Clinical Projects . Clinical projects continue in year 3, for a total of ten terms. The goal of the Clinical Projects, which are focused on the area of each student's thesis project, is to provide students with direct observation of clinical medicine in practic e in an in -patient or out -patient setting, and with practical knowledge regarding the methodologies by which patient encounters are systematically transformed into useful research data. Typically the mentor for this rotation is the student's clinical co -mentor. Clinical projects include: exposure to clinical medicine, attendance at clinical meetings such as diagnostic consensus conferences or clinical research meetings and exposure to at least one clinical research project . To begin clinical projects, all students are required to complete a yearly background check administer ed through BCM. This allows the program to establish medical malpractice insurance to our students to protect them if legal concerns arise while participating in clinical projects. In general, all the required courses are taken in the first year of residence. Electives that do not fit in year one are generally completed in the second year. 161Last updated October 24, 2017 Graduate Program in TBMM - Policy Handbook Page 26 of 27 In addition, TBMM students are required to complete BCM -required human research subjects (CITI) training and animal training Human Animal \"Biomedical Research - Basic/Refresher, Basic Course\" a.Complete The Integrity Assurance Statement before beginning the course b.Belmont Report and CITI Course Introduction c.History and Ethic al Principles d.Basic Institutional Review Board (IRB) Regulations and Review Process e.Informed Consent f.Social and Behavioral Research for Biomedical Researchers g.Records -Based Research h.Genetic Research in Human Populations i.Research With Protected Populations - Vulnerable Subjects: An Overview j.FDA-Regulated Research k.Conflicts of Interest in Research Involving Human Subjects l.The IRB Member Module - \"What Every New IRB Member Needs to Know\" m.Baylor College of Medicine \"CCM Mandates and Guidelines\" a.Guide to the Ca re and Use of Laboratory Animals b.Public Health Service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals \"BCM USDA Covered Species: Mandates and Guidelines\" a.Animal Welfare Act regulations b.Public Health Service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals c.Pain recognition and alleviation in laboratory animals 162 "}
