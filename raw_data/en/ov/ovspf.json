Where progress has been achieved and areas where continued improvement are needed. INSTITUTIONAL PLANNING Allegany College of Maryland Strategic Plan (2015-2020) was revised in FY17; however, Institutional Priority Two, \"Allegany College of Maryland enhances th e learning and working environment by valuing, supporting, and recognizing a diverse and highly qualified faculty and staff\" still includes Strategic Goal Five: to \"increase cultural competency within the College community.\" Multiple tactics have been implemented and the work continues. The College 's Educational Master Plan (2015-2018, extended to 2019) provides the educationa l roadmap for student success using five Planning Theme; diversity figures prominently in two themes: Learning and Teaching. 1. ACM assists students in their educational success in preparation for transfer, work, or life in a diverse and global society. 2. ACM cultivates a climate that supports every employee, fosters the learning centered college, and enhances diversity in teaching and learning. The institutional division of Instructional & Student Affairs extended its Instructional and Student Affairs Annual Initiatives from FY17, including diversity as a divisional \"goal\": increase cultural competence of faculty, staff, and students. The Diversity Committee, a Special Standing Committee for the College was tasked with accomplishing this goal with the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs acting as liaison between the Diversity Committee and the Educational Master Plan (EDMP) working group. DIVERSITY COMMITTEE FY19 Update The Diversity Committee began meeting during summer 2018 to achieve its primary task for FY19 : revise and administer the cultural competence survey. Last year's survey did not produce much useful data, so the committee decided to overhaul if. Due to continuing scheduling and member workload challenges, the Committee met face -to-face in July, October, December, and February ; other business was conducted via email. The Committee noted the following accomplishments: New members joined while others stepped down. The same small core of members contributed mightily to the group's work, and the same t wo c o-chairs were reappointed. Research/reading was shared liberally among Committee members. Implemented a dedicated email account Developed a calendar of cultural obs ervances Discussed creating a dedicated webpage; deferred to FY20 for institutional upgrade of website Researched already available training options for faculty/staff; deferred to FY20 Reached out to faculty to request existing course/faculty best practice s; one received Administered the diversity survey to students, faculty, and staff Solicited information and offered to support a new academic success initiative for male students of color: Aspiring Young MENtors at ACM. Added that group's leader to the Committee. OFFICE OF STUDENT & LEGAL AFFAIRS Non-Discrimination poster: A new poster dedicated to principles of non-discrimination was created this year for display on campus bulletin boards. Non-Discrimination Statement: Written in collaboration with Human Resources and approved by the Board of Trustees in Summer 2016, the College's non-discrimination statement is fully compliant with state 3and federal law and has been incorporated in its entirety with institutional publications and processes - including Title IX policy/procedures. Allegany College of Maryland does not discriminate against any individual for reasons of race, ethnicity, color, sex, religion or creed, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, genetic information, familial status, disability or veteran status in the admission and treatment of students, educational programs and activities, scholarship and loan programs, or to terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leave of absence, compensation and training. Allegany College of Maryland complies with applicable state and federal laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination and Maryland prohibits retaliation in any form against any person who reports discrimination or who participates in an investigation. Title IX: The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs is also the College's Title IX Coordinator and is thus charged with remaining current on legal/regulatory developments related to gender discrimination and properly addressing reports of sexual misconduct and sex discrimination regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or sexual identity. Discrimination: The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs is charged with remaining current on legal/regulatory developments related to other forms of discrimination and properly addressing reports of discrimination among students, faculty, or staff. A complaint form and process for responding to complaints was developed in Summer 2018. (These documents were adapted from and align closely with corresponding Title IX documents.) The Dean also presents information about hate -bias to each student group with whom the Dean meets at the start of the academic year and in emails to students. EVALUATION OF PROGRESS Allegany College of Maryland has continued a comprehensive review if its assessm ent and planning throughout FY19; this review include d all areas of the College. As noted above in Institutional Planning, the College is dedicated to evaluating progress - particularly regarding the divisional goal to increase cultural competence of faculty, staff, and students. Additionally, the College has created multiple layers of input and review of institutional assessment including new committees, internal processes (including budgetary, academic program review , and operational unit review*), dedicated employee responsibilities, and even new positions charged with shouldering much of the assessment and planning work. *Student Life completed its Comprehensive Unit Review in Spring 2018 and set goals for the next 4 -5 years. Objectives specific to the goal, \"Cultivate a dynamic environment for students to learn and grown that increases involvement on campus\" had 2 measurable objectives: Increase the number of ACM employees and students who attend diversity-rela ted programs. Increase program co-sponsorships with groups on camps that have and can share cultural knowledge. ____________________________________________________________________________________ PART 2 A description of efforts to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff and faculty - Detail initiatives designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students, staff, and faculty. Both campus-wide and program s pecific DEMOGRAPHIC DATA / STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION The charts below highlight the race/ethnic ity in our local community (2015) and among our student body (5 years). As you can see, Allegany College of Maryland has grown in its representation of minorities in the student body and continues to exceed the local population minority population percentage. Allegany County Race/Ethnicity 4provides funding for college access through nonprofit organizations to enhance college and career awareness and college completion for low-income underserved Maryland high school students. 5. Afterschool Program - middle school students (6th, 7th, & 8th grades) enrolled in the Allegany County Public Schools Afterschool Program were invited to ACM for a career exploration program. 6. Naviance - a partnership was es tablished with Hobsons to gain prospective student leads from areas in Maryland and Virginia with a more diverse population. Additionally, Allegany College of Maryland has a variety of programs and special projects that support the recruitment of and services to underrepresented students. A summary is provided below: 1. Pathways for Success is a TRIO Student Support Services project to increase retention, graduation, and transfer rates of eligible students, as well as improve student grade point averages. The program provides a supportive environment on campus for underrepresented students with low-income or first-generation status and students with disabilities. The program offers tutoring in math, science, and writing/English, one-on-one academic advisin g, career advising, transfer advising, financial aid advising, peer mentoring, support groups, and workshops on topics such as financial literacy. 2. Centralized Academic Advising in Rural Appalachia: Ensuring Student Success and Completion (a Title III program) enables the College to improve academic advising services to students, including underrepresented students, to boost their chances for success and will consolidate academic advising services in one location for greater access and more consistent deliv ery. This one -stop advising services center, located in the College Center, includes a wide range of academic advising, career planning, supportive counseling, educational coaching and mentoring services. 3. Consolidated Adult Education and Family Literacy Services offers a variety of programs and services to prepare underrepresented students for high school equivalency and literacy services for family and workforce development. Adults and out-of-school youth without a high school diploma have the option of completing secondary education through GED testing or the National External Diploma Program. Successful students by either approach are issued a Maryland high school diploma. Family literacy services, the second key part of adult education, help adults become literate for employment and self-sufficiency and enable them to become full partners in the educational development of their children. Community outreach is a major emphasis, and the adult education program works with such agencies as the Human Resources Development Commission, Social Services of Allegany County, the YMCA Family Support Center and the local American Job Center. 4. Cyber Technology Pathways Across Maryland is a skills-training and economic-development initiative of the State's Department of Labor and will prepare workers for a growing number of area jobs foreseen in IT. Among the underrepresented population to benefit from the job training offered through CPAM are military veterans and workers made jobless by unfair foreign trade practices. Low-skilled adults, women and other populations underrepresented in cybersecurity and other IT fields are also in the target audience . STAFF AND FACULTY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION Human Resources' current efforts to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented groups include the notice of nondiscrimination and the fact that we are an EEOC employer. HR sends job postings to the Chronicle of Higher Education for faculty positions to help attract all potential candidates that read that publication. We've looked into expanding this advertising to other more minority focused publications; however, funding is extremely limited. According to the most recent data available from the Of fice of Institutional Research, Effectiveness, and Planning (Fall 2017), (Fall 2018), 3.12% of full-time faculty were minority, 1.8% of full- time administrative/professional staff were minority. According to the most recent data available from Human Resources (FY1 9), ACM had the following staffing percentages: FT /Staff Faculty (minority) Staff Total Staff/Faculty including PT (non-white) 2.56% Total Staff/Faculty including PT (minority) 3.74% *non- white does not include Hispanic *minority includes non- white and Hispanic For FY 19 to date (7/1/18 - 4/9/19), Human Resources had the following hiring statistics 32% increase in the amount of minorities applying for positions, but the rate at which they have actually been hired has remained the same. Our veteran's rate of applications decreased 50%, and our disabled's rate of applications decreased by 12.5%. Our female rate of applications and hiri For our applications since 7/1/18, we received 441 applications for our open positions. Total staff/faculty applications (non-white) 16.3% Total Staff/faculty applications (minority) 18.3% Out of the 18.3% minority applications 4% were hired (3 out of 75 applications); 1 applicant hired on faculty the other 2 being staff. The President and Director of Institutional Effectiveness, Research , and Planning conducted the annual internal employee satisfaction survey in Fall 2018 as well as the Chronicle of Higher Education's survey in the hopes of achieving that publication's designation as a Great College to Work For to enhance recruitment and retention. The results are encouraging and show steady progress at the institution.

Additionally, all faculty who teach online or blended classes are required to complete a new self - paced online course, Accessibility and Your Online Course , as well as comply with a new eCourse policy for quality assurance including accessibility standards. For all position types (faculty and staff), the College endeavors to make minority employees feel included and valued. Search Committee Experts HR has compiled a team of search committee experts. This practice was implemented as it was a best practice of several other community colleges in Maryland in addition to nationwide. The training these individuals receive allows them to recognize common recruiting biases, avoid inappropriate topics, to read congruency between candidates' words / expressions / body language, and to point these factors out to other people on their search committees that they have been assigned to . Every search committee is required to have one of these individuals on the committee. These changes were made to enhance this aspect of our institution to help ensure that we hire the best candidates possible for open positions, while also assuring that we maintain non-discriminatory hiring practices. ____________________________________________________________________________________ PART 3 A description of efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty and staff on campus. CURRICULAR INITIATIVES THAT PROMOTE CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN THE CLASSROOM General Education made progress on the Personal & Civic Responsibility recommendations from last year. Beginning March 2018, the Gen Ed Assessment committee began the process of collecting sample assignments aligned with the Personal and Civic Responsibility goal. Attempting to simplify the process, the committee identified a faculty member within each division /program who was teaching a course that listed P&CR as a learning outcome and requested a sample assignment. In review of the assignmen ts, it was determined that a more systematic collection from all faculty was needed to capture the various ways that courses/coursework may emphasize each of the three components of the goal--personal awareness, cultural awareness, and engagement with issu es. For instance, a course project may relate to cultural and personal awareness yet not engagement with issues. A Personal & Civic Responsibility Questionnaire and accompanying Sample Assignments sheet representing each of the three components were finalized and will be launched at the start of the fall 2019 semester. An assessment will take place at the end of the fall semester. The committee also began revisions of the assessment rubric, creating three distinct rubrics that align proficiency level s with those expected at the completion of an associate degree as outlined in the Degree Qualification Profile (Lumina Foundation). Revisions will be completed in August. Revitalize the priority to institutionalize Civic Engagement through use of and collaboration with SL/CE and the Democracy Commitment to increase course-embedded service learning experiences and co-curricular activities. 7 Provide trainings that foster shared understanding of the goal, expectations for proficiency, and teaching and learn ing strategies: Service Learning & Civic Engagement Lunch and Learn held by the Democracy Commitment Committee May 14, 2018. On April 15, 2019 the ACM Carnegie Community Engagement Classification cohort submitted the First-Time Classification application to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. ACM Student Field Trip to the Holocaust Museum and the African American History Museum Aspiring Young MENtors In the fall of 2018, a mini-grant was applied for at Allegany College with the intent to create an organization that is comprised of a group of African-American male mentors to help guide and support other young African -American men on campus. The graduation rate within 4 years for African- American males attending ACM is around 10% as compared to all other populations at 34%. A major goal of this mini-grant was to establish a support group that could impact student success and growth for this population of students. The first cohort had 10 young men who were active in this organization. The group and the advisors developed the formation, structure and goals of the organization detailed below. The advisors, students, and administrators seek a location on campus where the group can establish itself as an entity and provide a permanent identity for the organization. An induction ceremony was conducted in May, 2019 where the 10 young men were recognized as the trailblazers to set the path for future members. Mentoring is an increasingly popular way of providing guidance and support to people in need. Mission: Foster student success through a collaborative network of men dedicated to leadership, mentorship, and a growth mindset at Allegany College of Maryland. Vision: Lead young African-American men at Allegany College of Maryland in achieving their dream. Save the World Fair and Competition An ACM annual college-wide poster board competition focused on student research, solutions, and advocacy addressing issues that confront our community, nation, and world today. Posters include projects that have been developed individually, in groups, or as part of classroom learning experience that has been promoted by instructors. Day of Civility in Allegany County. A day -long event with multiple activities to promote the 15 principles of Choose Civility : Bridge to Civility , Kindness Rocks, \"A House Di vided: How Do We Get the Political System We Want\" Dialogue - FSU ORT Library (ACM students participating), Key Note speaker Dan Buccino - a Choose Civility Founder - from John Hopkins University, and 8 community partners at the \"Showcase of Civility\" with activities and inform ation ( NAACP, Women's Action Coalition, Allegany County Government, Maryland City Government, Allegany Radio, Archway Station, Rehab 1st, FSU). 8th Annual Women's History Celebration This year's theme was \"Women of Peace and Nonviolence\" with a chance to view the \"What Were You Wearing?\" exhibition in the Hazen Gallery. This Exhibition features powerful stories and re-creations of the clothing survivors were wearing at the time of a sexual assault.

Having broken significant social ground in the barbershop community, under the artistic direction of the quartet members, HALO seeks to lead a transformative movement of Community Music Therapy in which barbershop singing (and listening) serves as a metaphorical model by which we as a diverse people in one nation c an learn to heal century-old wounds. We can lead men and women in an initiative and mission to utilize the singing and active listening experience of barbershop music as a framework in which American people, groups, and communities can learn to engage in constructive dialogue concerning socio-political issues\u2014especially those pertaining to race. International Film Festival Allegany College of Maryland Center for Continuing Education and Workforce Development in partnership with World Artist Experiences and the International Division of Maryland's Office of the Secretary of State hosted the eleventh annual \"Bridges to the World\" International Film Festival. These award-winning films were shown in five venues across Maryland: Annapolis, Cumberland, Salisbury, St. Mary's City, and Songs of Separation\" International Cultural Immersion Allegany College of Maryland Center for Continuing Education and Workforce Development in partnership with Rocky Gap Casino offered cultural immersion classes to students visiting from China.

DHR 541 Ethical & Diversity Considerations in use of DSM 5 Mental health professionals are increasingly required to diagnose children and adolescents who have experienced adverse life events (ALEs). ...The 2013 release of DSM -5 resulted in significant changes in the child and adolescent disorders. The DSM -IV categor y of Infancy, childhood and adolescent (ICA) disorders was replaced by a category labelled \"neurodevelopmental\" disorders ...Dr. Munson participated in the clinical trials for the DSM -5, and he will present the details and intricacies of the DSM -5 changes. .... DHR 542 Ethical & Diversity Considerations in Child & Adolescent Intervention Related to ALEs Mental health professionals who treat children and adolescents that have experienced adverse life events (ALEs) have little intervention guidance because credible research on this population is limited and most of the literature is based on descriptive accounts. There are no clearly defined ethical parameters and treatment procedures provided by professional organizations to assist professionals in this practice area. ... Content includes user friendly standardized scales to assess and treat children and adol escents who have experienced ALE's. 9 EMPLOYEE TRAININGS All new, full time Faculty, and all Profession al and Associate Support Staff are required to complete harassment training which includes sexual harassment. Additionally, every new ACM employee is required to receive Title IX training during his/her first year of employment. CCSSE Even with changes to the questions (and elimination of others related to diversity), results from the Spring 2018 Administration of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement included valuable information related to student perspectives of institutional diversity. On a 1(never) to 4 (very often) Likert Scale, students scored the college at 2.24 on the question \"Had serious conversations with students who differ from you\" .16 above all small colleges, and .19 below all colleges. On a 1(very little) to 4 (very much) Likert Scale, students scored the college at 2.77 on the question \"[The College em phasizes] encouraging contact among students from different economic, social, and racial or ethnic backgrounds\". This score is the highest score for ACM in the most recent 4 CCSSE, .12 above all small colleges, and .11 above all colleges. CO-CURRICULAR PROGRAMMING FOR STUDENTS STUDENT CLUBS /ACTIVITIES Allegany College of Maryland, through its Student Government Association, recognized 32 Student Clubs in FY 19. In FY19 we removed 4 clubs from our rosters, which had become inactive and also recognized 4 new clubs (Cyber Security Club, Psychology Club, Science Club and TEAcH - Teacher Education Club). Active clubs that promote diversity include the Student Government Association, Advocates 4 Christ, Choir, Culture Club, NAACP Student Club, Nurse's Christian Fellowship Club, Peace Studies Club, Phi Theta Kappa, Veteran Support Club, Volunteer Club, PRIDE (LGBTQ/Ally Club), and 21 academic-related clubs and honor societies. The Director of Student Life and members of the Student Government Association (SGA) utilize local, state and national presenters/agencies to provide programs to the College community. The Director of Student Life and a small group of students from SGA again attended the National Association of Campus Activities conferences in the Fall and Spring semesters to select various speakers, novelty events, and performers to bring to campus. In FY19, the following programs were presented (often in partnership with other campus groups such as the Democracy Commitment) and were open to all students, faculty, staff, and community members. Several Voter Registration Events - Events to encourage students, faculty, staff and community members to register to vote and to exercise their right to vote. Veterans Day Event - Honor and Recognition Ceremony was held. STI Awareness Day - Held in conjunction with the Nurse Managed Wellness Center and the local Health Department, we offered educational materials and free AIDS/STI testing. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration - During the day, a passive program included the showing of several videos relating to Dr. King as well as a visual timeline display of his life and important events in history. Women's History Celebration - Referenced previously. The 7th annual Save the World Fair - Referenced pr eviously. The annual Focus on Women Awards were once again incorporated into the all- college Student Award Ceremony where numerous other programs and achievements by deserving students are recognized (eg., Service to Children Award (Education), Outstanding Female and Male Student - Athlete Awards). Three students were selected and recognized this year. 10 The Focus on Men Award was again presented this year, which mirrored the Focus on Women Award. One student was chosen and recognized this year. For the eighth year, Allegany College of Maryland continues to sponsor a local AA group which uses classroom space at no charge. International Day of Peace was held by TDC in conjunction with FSU in Sept. 2018. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS /PROMOTIONS Autism Walk This year's Cumberland Tri-State Autism Walk was held at the Cumberland Campus Saturday, April 13 at the track. This event raises money to support various local autism efforts in our region, in coordination with the Jefferson School and Sheppard Pratt. There were free food, drinks, music and moon bounces for the kids. Donations were accepted. METROPOLITAN A.M.E. CHURCH EVENTS John W. Franklin \" Forced Migration: From Africa to the Americas. Do you know where you came from?\" Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration Celebrate African American Heritage; The Importance of Faith throughout Black History CAMPUS COMPACT COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR DEMOCRACY As part of Campus Compact's Community College for Democracy, ACM prioritizes civic learning and democratic engagement for all students. This past year the following projects occurred on campus in support of diversity initiatives under this initiative. \"Brownsville Project\" Transformative Justice Theater This interactive theatre experience explores the story of Brownsville, MD, where race, class, gender and family pride meet, and its social impact on the lives of Brownsville descendants. \"Brownsville Project\" An ACM Student Interaction Opportunity This is a behind the scenes student interaction, where attendees will learn how \"The Brownsville Project\" developed and the deeper intersections of lived experiences that touch the lives of local families.

NAACP #7007\" Freedom Fund Dinner Attend the Local NAACP #7007 Dinner - Keynote speaker talking about Emmanuel Nine, and featuring our local NAACP leaders, supper, & dancing. Campus Compact also sponsored numerous other events and programs related to voting/elections, civic engagement, and public service. . ____________________________________________________________________________________ PART 4 Other initiatives that are central to the cultural diversity plan that are not captured in Sections 2 and 3. CENTER FOR DIVERSITY & STUDENT ENGAGEMENT / STUDENT LIFE Another ongoing feature of Allegany College of Maryland's diversity commitment is the existence and easy availability of the Center for Diversity and Student Engagement, located between the Student Life Office and the Residence Life Office. This space is dedicated to use by students, faculty, and staff for a wide variety of purposes including group meetings, outreach, education/event planning, and more. All students are urged to (1) use the Center for diversity-oriented activities, (2) befriend students who are different from you, (3) attend Center-sponsored events and (4) volunteer to help with Center programming. The Diversity Center is operated under the leadership of the Director of Student Life , who also collaborates closely with the following essential groups: Residence Life, Democracy Commitment, and several student clubs who are dedicated to promoting diversity themed events and programs to students, faculty, and staff. 11 Given the isolated location of the Center, discussions began this year to relocate the Center to a more central space on campus - particularly to a location that allows partnership with the new academic initiative: AYS at ACM. At the writing of this report, final discussions are still occurring with the likelihood of moving the Center during Summer 2019. RESIDENCE LIFE Allegany Colleg e of Maryland offers on-campus apartments for 236 full time credit students of all socio- economic classes (largely low income and first -generation colle ge students), races/ethnicities. geographic roots (mix of students from Maryland's metropolitan region and rural, multi-state locations), and college-preparedness (a significant number of residents take at least one developmental course and numerous residents are enrolled in highly competitive/demanding allied health programs). In order to be as inclusive as possible, Residence Life Staff asks these two questions on the Roommate Matching Form: 1. Gender Identity choices expanded from Male/Female to offer these: Male, Female, Trans or Tran sgender, Another Identity 2. Gender based room assignment choices expanded from Male/Female to offer these: Male, Female, Gender Neutral The application packet includes two pages of questions and short essays; since Residence Life values a highly diverse living/learning community, the questions are designed to both inform prospective students about the community and to identify any particular preparation/education needs of the new residents. Applicants are asked to share their thoughts about building community, getting to know people who are different from themselves, being friends with someone from a rival town or school, and whether there is any group or type of person with whom s/he is unable/unwilling to be friends? To ensure absolute fairness in the selection of residents, demographic data (except for age and gender) is not collected on the applications, and roommate assignments (4 students per apartment) are made based solely upon information from the Roommate Matching Form which includes program/major and elicits particulars of compatibility such as interests, socializing tendencies, study habits, noise, cleanliness, and smoking (ie., the issues which are the most frequent sources of roommate conflict). Any applicant who demonstrates an unwillingness to cohabit with someone from a different race, religion, culture, or other demographic for which discrimination is not permitted is referred to off -campus housing. DONALD ALEXANDER LIBRARY The staff have purposefully developed themed displays and grouped reading materials to promote cultural awareness where the students. Among their projects in 2018-2019: Street Lit collection (created Sept.2018).

Allegany College of Maryland collects data annually from the following reporting sources: Campus Security / Public Saf ety Cumberland City Police Pennsylvania State Police (Bedford County) Student & Legal Affairs (Cumberl and campus) Student Services Director (Bedford campus) The hate crimes data which must be collected includes murder/non -negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, sex offenses (forcible), sex offenses (non-forcible), robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, arson, any crime involving bodily injury, larceny/theft, simple assault, intimidation, and vandalism/destruction of property. The Violence Against Women Act added the following additional crimes and hate crimes: domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The reports must specify the w hether the hate crime targeted by race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or ethnicity/national origin; by federal law, gender identity has been added as a new hate crime category. Crimes also note the location of the crime (ie., on campus, student housing, non-campus, or [adjacent] public property). This data is compiled and submitted electronically to the U.S. Department of Education by October each year . The written report containing both statistics and narrative content is completed each summer, published, and posted online; all students and all employees are notified electronically twice per year. Additionally and in compliance with Maryland law/regulations, a Hate-Bias education/awareness plan was adopted beginning FY19, and the College now submits an annual Hate-Bias Incident Report to Maryland Higher Education Commission. 13 2019 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity MARYLAND HIGHER EDUC ATION COMMISSION SEPTEMBER 201 9 14Total Population 73060 White 2 or more races Black or African American Indian/Alaska Native 107 0.15% Asian 34 0.05% Non-white 9138 12.51% Source: 2016 Census Population Estimates (ACS) Student racial/ethnic distribution Fall 2011 Fall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 Fall 2017 Fall 0.10% 0.00% 0.20% 0.30% Accountability Report The majority of Allegany College of Maryland's underrepresented minority students reside in Willowbrook Woods, ACM's on campus housing facility which is described in Part IV.

Anne Arundel Community College Philosophy Anne Arundel Community College strives to embody the basic convictions of our country's democratic ideal: that individuals be given full opportunity to discover and develop their talents and interests; to pursue their unique potentials; and to achieve an intellectually, culturally and economically satisfying relationships with society. 16Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 2 Section 1: Summary of the institution's plan to improve cultural diversity. Include all majors' goals, areas of emphasis, and strategy for implementation. Engagement Matters: Pathways to Completion In FY2019, Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) completed the third year of its strategic plan, Engagement Matters: Pathways to Completion (2017 -2020). Engagement Matters includes an intentional and focused approach on institutional assessment as the college strives to increase completion by transforming the culture of the institution to ensure equity and that the college remains student -ready and committed to academic excellence. The institutional focus on access, equity, high -quality learning opportunities, and completion aligns well with the 2017 -2021 Maryland State Plan for Postsecond ary Education: Increasing Student Success with Less Debt . The three overall institutional goals in Engagement Matters are: Goal 1: Engagement & Entry - Increase connection and enrollment of all students through a college -wide emphasis on equity, student s uccess and academic excellence. Goal 2: Progress - Increase progress of all students through a college -wide emphasis on equity, student success, and academic excellence. Goal 3: Completion - Increase completion of all students through a college -wide emph asis on equity, student success and academic excellence. In FY2019, AACC's priorities for student success focused on continuing to implement recommendations from strategic planning teams related to fundamentally enhancing the student experience. This inclu ded the following objectives: Continued Focus on Teaching Excellence (including adjunct professional development; continuing to infuse equity into the curriculum/classroom in Model Courses and beyond which touched 13,000 students in fall 2018; improving online course outcomes; and a new, comprehensive approach to course and program assessment). Implemented a new credit course scheduling model that is more student -centric, to contribute to improved student satisfaction, retention and completion. Interfaith space for students. Learning Resources Management is diligently working to locate space and secure funding. AACC was awarded Leader College status from Achieving the Dream (ATD) , a national organization of the largest network of community colle ges working to improve practices in support of whole -college reform. Leader Colleges have shown measurable progress in areas critical to improving success for all community college students. 17Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 3 Faculty expertise and the classroom experience are paramount to understanding and successfully addressing equity gaps. As such, one of the targeted interventions AACC has undertaken over the past several years under Engagement Matters is the Model Course Initiative, which is proving to be fundamental toward implementin g equitable access to high -impact practices in the classroom. The Model Course Initiative focuses on eradicating achievement gaps in highly -enrolled gatekeeper courses in disciplines such as biology, business, chemistry, mathematics, psychology, etc., so i t reaches thousands of students each semester. To ensure a healthy and committed workforce, the College assessed the Campus Climate environment as it relates to diversity, equity and inclusion. Results indicated that more focused employee engagement oppo rtunities were warranted. Innovation spaces and open forums are planned to gather additional information on initiatives , activities and programs to bolster employee morale and ensure that AACC continues to be a great place to work. Each division has made e quity a focus and mindset key to developing a positive, and inclusive culture of work. These opportunities will be indicated in the 2021 -2025 strategic plan currently under development. Section 2: Description of efforts to increase the numerical represent ation of traditionally underrepresented groups among 1) students, 2) administrative staff, and 3) faculty. Initiatives designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented student, staff, and faculty. Students Initiatives: AACC serves approximately 46,000 students who will enroll in more than 2,800 courses, both credit and noncredit, in more than 100 areas of study. The college also offers extensive lifelong learning opportunities and noncredit continuing professional educat ion courses to a diverse population seeking career training or retraining, working to boost basic skills, or pursuing new areas of interest. The college is increasingly diverse, with more than one third of credit students identifying themselves as members of a minority ethnicity. By gender, females make up 60 percent of the student population and 43 percent of the credit student population. The majority of AACC's student population attends part time, comprising 71.9 percent of enrolled credit students. Con sistent with the national trend, the college's enrollment has been challenged as it continues to follow the inverse relationship with employment and improvements in the economy. The college has experienced enrollment decline s since FY 2011, resulting in a flat FY 201 9 budget. Enrollment continues to be driven by the county unemployment rate , and as the county unemployment rate continues to decrease, so ha ve college enrollments . 18Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 4 FY2019 Goal: Develop and implement strategies that will establish directed, intentional and focused attention on enrollment through the Systemic Enrollment Management Matrix (SEM2) charts the enrollment planning process with the objective to identify, devise, and implement a plan that results in an increase in the number of traditional , non -traditional and intergenerational age students who apply and enroll at AACC. The AACC Systemic Enrollment Management Matrix (SEM\u00b2) provides best practices regarding enrollment management effectiveness for all students. The following are t he highlights of initiatives, actions, and accomplishments for FY 2018 -2019 (Arnold, Arundel Mills, and Glen Bernie Towne Center Campuses): AACC Arnold Campus Initiated \"touch points\" (email, mailing, and calling) tactics to convert targeted nontraditional age students by term (Fall, Spring, Summer I, Summer II, Summer III, and Winter).

Hosted Hispanic Business Leaders Breakfast to improve enrollment. Ensured course schedules would allow students to complete in 2 -3 years. We AACC Arundel Mills Campus Identified types of student activities desired, high volume days for student participation, and appropriate potential internal event locations. Identified appropriate bookstore hours that will meet the needs of all students. Initiated and provided SASP, Student Engagement, a nd Health Services Launched AMIL student surveys initiative. AACC Glen Burnie Town Center Campus GBTC student's, like many other students throughout the state, struggle to have enough funds or resources to address their schooling and personal needs. Unfortunately, for some student's it a matter of choosing between books or food in order to navigate successfully through a college education. We recommended that GBTC offer the following: Student \"One -Time\" Grants (these grants could be aligned with services provided by the HelpLink initiative, but not limited to, such as online access codes ). Launched GBTC student survey initiative. 19Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 5 Staff and Faculty Initiatives As a critical component for attracting a diverse applicant pool for faculty and staff positions, the office of Human Resources (HR) in conjunction with the Chief Diversity Officer actively develops outreach efforts by advertising in various national publications and journals for professional associations that are aimed at diverse populations. 2018 -2019 Goal: Develop and implement strategies that establish a workforce that better reflects the wealth of diversity and inclusion in our county and among our administrative staff and faculty. Evaluation: Year to year comparisons support the efforts for diversity and inclusion within our ranks. Progress toward this goal will be evidenced by an increase in the percentage of employees in underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. Detail Data Analysis : Anne Arundel County Maryland has a population of 573,235 according to a vailable metropolitan data3. Of this population 71.8% are white, 6.0% Hispanic, 15.5% African American, 3.5% Asian, 2.8% two or more and 0.4% identify as other. As the table below shows, AACC is moving the n eedle toward parity with the demographic makeup of Anne Arundel County in overall employment. Indicated in the graphs below, show a year to year comparison of our recruitment and retention efforts in the faculty ranks and administrative staff positions. The College has been successful with recruitment and retention of faculty and the data reflect s an almost mirror image of county representation to College representation.

Data in the application pools indicated that people of color were recruited, but not maintained throughout the search process and minimally hired at the conclusion of faculty sear ches. A pilot of new process and procedures began in July 2018 and continued through July 2019. The recruitment manual with updated procedures was completed in August 2019, enhancements include mandatory training of search committee members and chairs, and in faculty searches, the hiring official (Dean) was required to interview all finalists and conclude the search process with an offer to the most qualified candidate. Section 3 : A description of efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultur al awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. Details of 1) faculty and staff cultural training programs, 2) curricular initiatives that promote cultural diversity in the classroom, and 3) co -curricular programming for students. The President, Vice Presidents and Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) provide leadership and strategic direction in creating and nurturing a college climate that is welcoming, inclusive and respectful. The CDO spearheads many efforts and develops collaborations with interna l and external partners to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, staff and faculty on campus. The college celebrates cultural heritage and diversity awareness with a number of activities and professional development throughout the year, below is a partial list for AY201 8: Co-Curricular Programing for Students The college has long worked to identify the best ways to accelerate the diverse student population through program sequences, including: offering proficiency credit, prior learning assessment, and supporting special populations such as Military/Veterans, minority, and first generation students. A multitude of co-curricular programming were offered to students throughout the year. Every program offered below, was open to students and many of their courses offered extra credit for student attendance. 4 Data provided from 2018 -2019 Affirmative Action Plan.

Transitioning to college can be difficult, even more so for the international students, recent immigrants and students for whom English is not their primary language. Expanding AACC's services to support thi s unique student population provides an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to serve students in need, and offers a welcoming atmosphe re. A new program was created, Culture and Language Student Support Program (CLASP), to address this unique population. CLASP Ambassadors are current students, faculty and staff with specific language skills (Spanish, Farsi, and German) who are made availa ble to incoming students outside the College regular business hours to assist in connecting the student to appropriate services inside and outside the College for a smoother transition. Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs The Office of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access and Leadership (IDEAL) hired an Inclusive Excellence Coordinator to deliver, program and create professional development opportunities for all employees and students at the College. 2018 p rograms included: Diversity 101; Fostering an Inclusive Classroom for Students with Disabilities; Understanding and Interrupting Unconscious Bias ; and, L earning and Using Inclusive Language. Each course is registered with the Center for Faculty and Staff Development and credited in employees' pro fessional development plans. The Dreamkeeper's an African American literature book club meet once a semester, including summer , to read and discuss all genres of literature by African American authors and writers. Toni Morrison's Paradise, Ta-Nehisi Coates Between the World and Me , Ann Petry's The Street , were the selections. The group is comprised of a diverse mix of current and retired faculty and staff from the College. Discussions are robust and held during the evening hours on campus to ensure accessibility for all interested parties. The book club is open to everyone and bringing guests is encouraged. 22Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 8 Curricular Initiatives That Promote Cultural Diversity in the Classroom Model Course Project Team s (MCPT) met for year three. The charge for Model Course Project team is to work within a specific course and w ith instructional designers to develop a template for the course that includes: Ensuring existing course outline is current; Ensuring course outcomes are listed on the course outline; Create a common syllabus; Create a menu of assignments that can be used to achieve specified outcomes; Create a menu of assignments that require students to engage with one another, from discussion boards to group work; Identify relevant ways to provide all students with access to required texts, especially the first six week s of classes; Ensure course outlines, assignments, and curriculum in general addresses a variety of identities, to include race, class, gender, nationality, and/or religion as the discipline warrants; and, Create a canvas shell that can be adapted for onli ne, face to face and hybrid use. Culturally Responsive Teaching and learning workshops were offered to the over 50 MCPMT through the IDEAL Office in order to offer resource and support to meet the charge set forth by the Vice President of Learning, Dr. Mi chael Gavin . In conjunction with the five Dean's, Dr. Gavin carefully selected faculty to participate on the Model Course Project team with an understanding that the work would directly impact the College's efforts to eradicate achievement gaps. Gateway co urse, with high enrollment and low success, are selected to have specific attention paid to addressing access issues and barriers that prevent students from being successful. Culturally Responsive Teaching is a pedagogy that recognizes the importance of in cluding students' cultural references in all aspects of learning (Ladson -Billings, 1994). Some of the characteristics of culturally responsive teaching are: Positive perspectives on parents and families. Communication of high expectations. Faculty partici pated in The Culturally Responsive Teaching and Training Program (CRT) delivered by Community College of Baltimore County subject matter experts. CRT enhances both educators' and students' awareness, adds to their knowledge of others, and strengthens their skills so that they can interact effectively with classmates, and colleagues. Below is a sampling of outcomes from fall 2017 -fall 2018: Biology 101 - the equity gap in course success was narrowed by 4.8% for Black/African American and eliminated for Hisp anic/Latino students. Business & Its Environment 111 - the equity gap in course success was eliminated. Computing & Information Technology 100 - the equity gap in course success was narrowed by 4.3% for Black/African American and eliminated for Hispanic/Latino students. 23Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 9 Psychology 111 - the equity gap in course success was narrowed by 4% for Black/African American and narrowed by 1.1% for Hispanic/Latino students. The Curriculum Transformation Project presented the Diversity Institute for the 10th year. This year's Diversity Institute was inspired by Bettina Love's book on social justice and education. We Want to Do More than Survive: Abolitionist Teaching and the Pursuit of Educational Freedom. Using an intersectio nal lens to talk about race in conjunction with variables like class, gender and disability, Love argues that in order to create thriving classrooms we must move beyond gimmicky tactics that teach students to \"survive\" in oppressive structures, for by teaching students to \"succeed\" in a rigged system, we help perpetuate the very structures that produce the inequities that we want to challenge. \"Our students are now taught with the world crumbling around them,\" Love writes, \"to pay their taxes, vote, volunteer, and have good character, wh ich is code for comply, comply, comply. Dark children are told that their good character is dependent on how much they obey\" (70). The Diversity Institute provided space for exploring the institutional structures that perpetuate inequities and discussion o f some of the ways faculty can embolden students, as well as themselves, to challenge structures of oppression. Copies of Bettina Love's were placed on reserve in the Truxal Library as well. Section 4: A statement regarding the campus process for the rep orting of hate -based crimes consistent with federal requirements. Anne Arundel Community College is a microcosm of the world. To that end we were not untouched by negative discord in the environment. In 2017 a Bias Incident Response Team (BIRT) was convene d to address on campus hate bias crimes or incidents. The team is comprised of a Public Safety Officer, Chief Diversity and a Student Conduct representative. The guiding principle s of BIRT is to coordinate a response, provide support to impacted community members and ensure transparency with the campus community in case of a hate/bias crime or incident. We recognize that in order to build trust and mutual respect, it is essential to establish a partnership with the community that we serve. There were five report s of a biased incident in 201 8. Using established campus protocol, the event was, investigated, and assessed for need of campus communication, education or student judicial contact . In two incidents , the perpetrator(s) was/were unknown and no further administrative action was warranted . The remaining two incidents were parking or traffic related. Public Safety endeavors to maintain a safe campus environment and with current construction on campus, some of our community are less than patient with be redirected and longer wait times to find parking. The incidents required no further administrative action, as witness statements supported public safety actions. We have multiple points of contact (phone, office visit, web link) and co nnection for anyone that wishes to report any bias or hate incident on campus. Located at the 24Anne Arundel Community College 201 9 Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity 10 bottom of every page on our aacc.edu web presence is a link to \" Report An Incident \". This link is available through the web site via desktop, IPad or smart phon e. AACC social media is monitored 24 hours a day, by the Public Relations and Marketing department (PRM) for inappropriate content or problematic messaging. Anyone experiencing or finding an issue on campus is encouraged to call or stop by the Public Safet y Office (410 -777 -2440) , Student Conduct Office (410 -777 -1339) or the IDEAL Office (410 -777 -1472) to report any crimes or concerns . 25 P a g e | 1 BCCC Guided by the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee B altimore C ity C ommunity C ollege C ultural D iversity R eport 2018/2019 26 P a g e | 2 Cultural Diversity Plan 2018 -2019 Preface It is with great excitement that we share the Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) plan for cultural d iversity for the next academic year. The newly formed Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee will be the guiding force behind policies, procedures and pra ctices for the institution . While BCCC's strength comes from the many cultures represented on our campus and sites , we still recognize that more can be done to increase areas that remain under -represented . Having a diverse community creates an environment that fosters innovation, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. Most importantly, a diverse community aligns with our mission and vision of educational access, and opportunity for a diverse popul ation of students. We believe that together we can make a real difference. BCCC has an opportunity to be a model for other institutions, not just in the letter of our policies and procedures but in the spirit of our actions, measured by our respect for one another and our differences . Our desire is to foster a safe and inclusive environment for all who choose BCCC . Office of the President About BCCC At Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) we meet students where they are through personal attention with the support of dedicated faculty.

Our Commitment to Diversity Baltimore City Commu nity College is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment in which our students, faculty, and staff learn and w ork. The College's priorities are evidenced by its Strategic Plan, Core V alues, Vision and Mission Statements. Our goals are to recruit and retain more faculty and staff by developing better recruiting strategies and by creating a hospitable campus setting; to nurture an atmosphere of welcome, civility, and respect for differen ces; and to take advantage of the College's quality as a microcosm of the larger world to instill in everyone, but especially students, an understanding of humanity beyond the College. These priorities inform the Diversity and Inclusion Plan. The BCCC Dive rsity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee (DEI Committee) has been charged with ensuring the institution meets these goals in alignment with the Maryland Code, Education \u00a7 11-406. Key Definitions proposed by BCCC's DEI Committee: Diversity - the fact of many different types of things or people being included in something; a range of different things or people. Equity - the commitment, capabilities, and experiences of an institution to equitably serve low income students, students of color, and other at -risk student populations with respect to access, success, and campus climate. Inclusion - the act of taking in or comprising as a part of a whole or group Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Goals This Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan contemplates transfor mational change at the College, and its overarching goals are as follows: 1. Cultivate and sustain a diverse and multicultural student body that is reflective of a global community by recruiting, retaining, and graduating ethnic minority students that are under -represented in higher education. 2. Weave the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion into all aspects of College life. 3. Identify impediments to creating a diverse and inclusive environment, propose solutions to overcome those impediments, an d measure our progress at all levels of the College infrastructure. 4. Ensure a variety of channels are utilized to attract and retain a diverse, qualified, and competitive applicant pool of faculty and staff. 5. Provide a supportive and nurturing learning environment to prepare students to collaborate with diverse communiti es locally and globally in a culturally sensitive manner. 28 P a g e | 4 The five goals delineated above will be achieved by implementing cultural, environmental, and structural changes throughout the College . It is these broad categories that will be targeted over the n ext five years. It is important to note that this plan is for the entire College community. It should not be viewed as limited to any particular group. Many of the recommendations will benefit all and are not tailored to traditional \"diversity\" considerati ons. Transforming the College is a shared responsibility, and this plan reflects that belief. Lastly, accountability measures will be developed by the committee charged with overseeing the plan's implementation.

Through ATD, BCCC i s part of an elite network of more than 200 colleges working to preserve access and assure that their students, especially low -income students and students of color, achieve their goals for academic success, personal growth, and economic opportunity. ATD emphasizes building a culture of evidence, in which colleges use data to identify effective practices, improve student success rates, and close achievement gaps. BCCC is one of six Maryland community colleges in the network . BCCC receives three visits per y ear from ATD's assigned Leadership and Data Coaches which engage faculty and staff from across the College. BCCC's ATD Council, with members representing all major College units, meets monthly and is led by the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Accredita tion Liaison Officer and Director of Institutional Research. Much of ATD's work is built around the belief that community colleges demonstrating strength in seven key dimensions, including \"Equity,\" will have greater success in implementing action plans for student success. Therefore, ATD developed the Institutional Capacity & Assessment Tool (ICAT) for ATD network colleges. The ICAT is an online self -assessment survey designed to help colleges assess their strengths and areas for improvement in the seven key dimensions encompassed in the Institutional Capacity Framework shown below. ATD defines equity as \"the commitment, capabilities, and experiences of an institution to equitably serve low income students, students of color, and other at -risk student pop ulations with respect to access, success, and campus climate.\" BCCC's OIR plan s to continue to administer the ICAT annually in the fall. As discussed in other sections of this report, the College has formed the Cultural Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee to develop a definition of equity, serve as a formal entity to coordinate equity efforts, and facilitate conversations with the College community. The BCCC 2018 - 2022 Strategic Plan's Goal 1, Student Success, is to \"provide equitable access to a learning environment that supports a diverse population of learners and promotes student goal attainment. With the new Strategic Plan, the College's Human Resources Office has renewed its emphasis for professional development offerings related to diversi ty, inclusion, and equity which are provided below. Such workshops include those noted in Chart 1 . Through SkillPort, BCCC's online training tool, the following diversity -related modules are offered: Bridging the Diversity Gap; Your Role in Workplace Diver sity; Facing the Management Challenges of Difficult Behavior & Diverse Teams; Workplace Management - Global HR, Diversity, & Inclusion; Diversity on the Job: Diversity & You; Diversity on the Job: The Importance of Diversity & the Changing Workplace; Under standing Unconscious Bias; Overcoming Your Own Unconscious Bias; Overcoming Unconscious Bias in the Workplace; Maintaining a Cohesive Multigenerational Workforce; Using Communication Strategies to Bridge Cultural Divides; and Culture & Its Effect on Commun ication.

The APA board of offi cers strongly prefers proposals that convincingly demonstrate their potential to decisively impact diversity and inclusion within philosophy . All APA members are invited to submit proposals. The APA strongly prefers proposals totaling approximately $10,000 or $20,000, as the board of the association anticipates funding either one $20,000 project or two $10,000 projects. The board encourages applicants who submit proposals for $20,000 projects to include an alternate project description and budget at the 36 P a g e | 12 $10,000 level. Although the APA normally funds projects for only one year at a time, it welcomes applications for renewal funding in subsequent years. The board of officers will review proposals and make funding decisions in November 2019 . Projects should commence no earlier than January 1, 2020 . The APA will disburse grant funds by June 30, 2020. Disability Inclusion Initiative The Disability Inclusion Initiative was established in 2000 to support individuals with disabilities as they strive to achieve independence, community integration and a better quality of life. The Foundation believes that persons with disabilities have the right to be included in the broader community and the right to opportunities that promote their participation in it. The Foundation's strategy for supporting individuals with disabilities involved four approaches: Improving the distribution of assistive technology devices and/or the availability of related training a nd support services Increasing opportunities for participation in sports, recreation and the arts Improving services to under -served populations such as the elderly, youth in transition, and social and linguistic minorities. Employing a systemic approach t o overcoming barriers to inclusion Since the inception of the Initiative, 160 grants totaling about $3.9 million have been made, benefitting 62 organizations. Hate -based Crime Prevention at BCCC Protected Classes In accordance with The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a hate crime is a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. (In addition to those mentioned above, other categories or identities may be protected depending on where the crime took place; local and state laws may vary and a federal offense may have been committed). Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) is committe d to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive campus community. Every individual is valued and should feel welcomed and included as a member of this community. The Panther CARE Team serves to make sure ALL people at BCCC feel safe to be themselve s. BCCC also strives to provide an educational, working and living environment that welcomes and respects all people. All of us are expected to commit to maintaining a safe, respectful, inclusive, civil and welcoming environment. Acts that go against the core values of the institution destroy the sense of community we all share. Additionally, acts of intolerance do untold and unjust harm to the well -being, dignity and safety of those who are the victims of such acts. How to Report a Bias Incident The Panth er CARE Team receives and responds to reports of bias incidents that have been experienced or witnessed. Reports will be reviewed in a timely manner. All emergencies should be directed to Public Safety or call 911. When reporting an incident , the individua l has the option of reporting it as \"information only\" or \"request for follow up.\" Information only reports are intended to give the Panther CARE Team information on the individuals experience at BCCC. These reports help the Panther CARE Team keep a pulse on the campus climate. Things to report as information only would include hearing insensitive remarks or language not directed at an individual, noticing certain trends of bias that have not targeted a specific individual, etc. 37 P a g e | 13 Reports can be filed anonym ously. However, if the report is filed anonymously it may limit the response the Panther CARE Team can have. Every effort will be made to keep your report confidential. However, the members of Panther CARE, as administrative agents in an educational insti tution, adhere to the laws and standards governing the disclosure of information to third parties both within and external to the College. 381 Carroll Community College Cultural Diversity Annual Report Submitted to the Maryland Higher Education Commission September 1, 2019 Building on the strong foundation established in previous years, diversity, equity, and inclusion remain important priorities for the institution. This report outlines the ways that diversity and inclusion efforts have been systematically and purposefully woven into the student experience, faculty and staff training, programming, and institutional planning and assessment over the past year. Section One: Summary of the Institution's plan to improve cultural diversity Goals Carroll Community College maintains a goal to \"foster campus and civic engagement and a sense of belonging, by providing a safe learning environment that models respect, acceptance, inclusion, and empathy towards diverse ways of thinking and being.\" To that end, efforts supporting diversity, equity and inclusion are embedded in College goals and in planning and activities at all levels and across departments and divisions. The Diversity, Inclusion and Equity Action Plan, adopted in 2018, guides the College's related work. Tasks listed in the Action Plan support priorities outlined in the College's Compass 2020 Strategic Plan, specifically those related to Student Achievement, Enrollment Development and Advancing (Employee) Excellence. The Action Plan is reviewed and updated annually by the Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Diversity and inclusion are components of the College's General Education goals and requirements, with numerous courses incorporating skills and activities to help students \"i dentify their roles as global citizens in a multicultural country and world. \" Further, a select number of these courses carry a diversity designation, indicating that a significant portion of the class covers one or more of the following themes or topics: - Differences across nations and world cultures, especially those outside the Western tradition; - The study of one or more groups that has been historically marginalized on the basis of culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, age, immigration, or geopolitical power; - Intellectual movements that address diversity and systems of injustice. Revised General Education graduation requirements, approved by the General Education Committee for implementation in FY2020 increased the number of designated diversity courses Associate of Arts students must complete at Carroll from one to two. 392 Moving forward, \"prepar(ing) students for diverse work environments and a dynamic, connected global community\" is one of the President's five strategic p riorities, outlined in Compass 2025 and approved in March 2019 by the Board of Trustees. This priority will guide resource allocation and decision making for the next five years. Activities supporting students and employees, as well as ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of those activities, will continue to be a priority across the institution. Areas of emphasis The one-year Carroll Promise Scholarship was instituted as a bridge until the launch of the Maryland Promise Scholarship in Fall 2019. This financial support served 96 students during the year. To better support under-prepared and under-resourced students, Carroll restructured its transitional English Composition and Mathematics sequences utilizing evidence-based practices. Professional development for select faculty and staff was a significant focus this year. As a core group of employees develop their skills and proficiency, programming will expand. Strategies for implementation The Diversity and Inclusion Committee is a recommending body to the President and Executive Team as well as a working committee. The group is further supported by the Associate Vice President of Curriculum and Assessment and the Chief Communications Officer, who serve as direct liaisons to the Executive Team. The charge of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee is to: - Serve as an advisory body, making recommendations to the College regarding the promotion of diversity and inclusion; - Facilitate acceptance, inclusion, and empathy by promoting social justice and diverse ways of thinking and being in all college activities; - Address issues related, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, culture, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, national origin, veteran status, socioeconomic class, religion, and professional status; - Coordinate educational resources and opportunities that foster global and diversity awareness for students, faculty, staff, and the community. Committee membership has evolved to ensure representation across academic disciplines as well as from key functional units and committees on campus, such as Student Life, Human Resources, and Marketing, and the General Education and Instructional Quality committees. As a result of the committee's broad representation, members' daily work can seamlessly support initiatives related to diversity and inclusion. 403 Since June 2017, a .2 FTE faculty Coordinator of Diversity Initiatives has helped to guide the implementation of the College's plan for cultural diversity among faculty. This coordinator also serves as co-chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee in collaboration with the Director of Student Life. During FY2019, the Diversity and Inclusion Committee structure was revamped to include a Steering Team comprised of members from key areas including Student Affairs, Human Resources, Administration, and faculty. This smaller group is more nimble than the full committee and their specialized expertise has been key in guiding and advancing specific requests and needs. The Diversity and Inclusion Committee continues to leverage available resources, including summer stipends for faculty research and project development; Student Life mini-grants to support curricular programming; and professional development and committee funds to support attendance at conferences. In recent years, two faculty have undertaken diversity-related promotion projects. Tapping into resources and structures beyond those specifically earmarked for diversity activities helps subsidize efforts, while also integrating this work in a variety of ways across the institution . Evaluation The College monitors the racial and ethnic diversity of its students and employees, and the academic progress of its students by racial/ethnic groups, through the following regular reports: - Annual Performance Accountability Report to the Maryland Higher Education Commission - Minority Achievement Progress Report to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (every 3 years) - Credit Student Enrollment Diversity Report (internal Institutional Research report) - Student Satisfaction survey, including questions related to campus climate as it pertains to diversity (administered every two years) - Employee Satisfaction survey, including questions related to campus climate as it pertains to diversity (administered every two years) The Student Satisfaction survey was revised with input from an ad hoc group from the Diversity and Inclusion Committee in 2019 to better capture student responses related to diversity and inclusion questions, along with demographic information for respondents. Analysis of this data is underway and results will be shared with campus leadership and the Diversity and Inclusion Committee during the coming months. The in-house Employee Satisfaction survey was not administered this year; rather, Modern Think's \"Great Colleges to Work For\" was used. This nationally-normed survey wil l provide information on how the College compares to other institutions with regard to general workplace climate. 414 The Office of Planning, Marketing, and Assessment regularly provides relevant data to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee as well as campus governing bodies; data are used to evaluate success and identify areas for improvement. A schedule for data presentations to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee has been established and will be fully implemented during FY2020. Achievements Increased access and acceleration have been hallmarks of recent efforts. Financial support, curricular and policy changes that support and enable student progress, as well as a comprehensive student support system have all been implemented. Ongoing professional development for committee members and other key faculty and staff has served to advance understanding of best practices and other related issues. Areas for improvement/Ongoing opportunities Student participation in the committee's work has been sporadic and uneven; further efforts will be made in the coming year to include regular student input. Research into best practices has been applied somewhat inconsistently when planning and evaluating curricular and co-curricular activities; in the coming year, this will be systematized to ensure uniformity and to allow for better tracking of learning outcomes. Professional development will be expanded to include all full-time employees, as well as the Board of Trustees. Section Two: Efforts to increase numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups Carroll Community College remains committed to the enrollment and success of traditionally underrepresented student populations. The College prioritizes recruitment and hiring practices with the potential to increase the diversity of candidate pools. Students As reported on the 2019 Performance Accountability Report (line 10c), in July 2017, 9.6% of the population in the service area was comprised of people of color. During Fall 2018, students of color made up 14.4% of credit enrollment (line 10a). During that same period, 15.2% of non- credit enrollment was comprised of students of color (line 10b). The Carroll Promise Scholarship was a one-year scholarship put in place until the launch of the Maryland Promise Scholarship. This last-dollar scholarship, funded by the Carroll Community College Foundation, supported 96 students during Fall 2018; 75 continued their full-time studies during Spring 2019. Of the participating students, 12.5% were Pell-grant eligible. 425 In Fall 2018, Carroll adopted the co-requisite Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) model for transitional coursework in English composition. Students who would have previously placed into Carroll's transitional Integrated Reading and Writing 2 course now have the option to concurrently enroll in ENGL-101 (College Writing I) along with a supporting ENG-ALP section. The ALP section allows faculty to provide individualized curricular and non-cognitive support to a small cohort of learners. The College also restructured its sequencing of mathematics courses to provide students with appropriate accelerated pathways for transitional and credit-bearing mathematics coursework. These pathways integrate math skills relevant to specific programs of study and scaffold transitional and credit-level courses appropriate to the discipline. A new transitional course, MAT-095, was rolled out in Fall 2018 as the pre-requisite to General Education mathematics courses taken by students in Arts and Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences. The MAT- 095 course combines necessary skills from two existing transitional courses, thus moving students into credit-bearing math courses more efficiently. The long-term impact of these curricular changes to transitional studies at Carroll will be a principle focus during FY2020 as students progress into credit-bearing courses. Placement based on GPA began in Spring 2019; data on this change will be collected and analyzed during FY2020. Dual enrollment at high schools is an important initiative to promote access to all students in the County; Carroll County Public Schools have been active partners in the launch of this initiative . National research shows that students who were dually enrolled in high school are more likely to attend and complete college, to view themselves as college-ready and have the ability to save thousands of dollars on college tuition. In addition, research shows that academic outcomes improve for dually enrolled students who are non-native English speakers and students from underrepresented ethnic and economic backgrounds. During FY2019, eight classes were offered at three area high schools, removing the transportation barrier and minimizing the financial barriers that exist for many students. The program will expand in FY2020 to include three additional high school locations for English and mathematics courses . To date, 29 of the 132 students (22%) registered for Fall 2019 classes are Free and Reduced meal-eligible students. The One Step Away program , funded by MHEC, is intended to identify, re -engage, re -enroll, and graduate near-completers who have stopped out . The College used funding to offer full tuition scholars hips, resulting in 19 graduates during FY2019. The vast majority of those graduates (68%) were non -traditional aged. A comprehensive student support system was piloted in Fall 2018 and fully implemented in Spring 2019. During the initial phase, all students identified as at-risk were targeted for support; going forward, first generation, transitional mathematics students, veterans and pre-health students will be supported through specific interventions. 436 Administrative Staff and Faculty As reported on the 2019 Performance Accountability Report (line 11), the percentage of full-time faculty of color closely mirrors the local population (9.2% and 9.6% respectively). After four years of decline, the percentage of minority full-time administration and professional staff (line 12) increased from 7.1% in Fall 2017 to 8.0% in Fall 2018. The College continues to strive toward best practices with regard to recruiting and hiring. Job descriptions have been updated to be more gender neutral and a diversity statement has been added to each job description. Positions are posted nationwide and video (Skype) interviews are conducted to reach a larger demographic area. Targeted advertising is utilized when requested in places such as Diverse Jobs in High erEd. In addition, the College actively seeks diverse candidates with email advertising via HigherEd jobs. Search committees provide diversity and independent advice to the hiring supervisor. Committee members are drawn from across the campus and can be full- or part-time employees; a student is included when possible. All search committee members receive training on implicit bias as it relates to the hiring process. Areas for improvement/Ongoing opportunities The initial interest in the Promise Scholarship, dual enrollment and the One Step Away program shows promise in supporting students from traditionally underrepresented groups . Data from the initiatives launched during FY2019 will continue to be analyzed and adjustments to programs and supports will be made accordingly. Section Three: Efforts to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty and staff The Diversity and Inclusion Committee coordinates and leads many of the related activities for students, faculty and staff. Topics and events are selected based on student interest as well as current and historically significant events. Additional initiatives, while supported by members of the committee, fall under the purview of other departments. One example is the campus wide Chosen Name Committee, comprised of staff from the Office of the Registrar, Institutional Research and Information Technology. Over the past two years, the group has met to review best practices and build systems to support all students, specifically those who are gender non-conforming. As a result, students and employees are able to opt to use a chosen name and pronoun as they on-board, as well as on-demand at a later date. Chosen names appear on student/employee IDs; names and pronouns are used on class rosters and in systems used on campus by the advising, business and registration offices. Carroll has served as a leader in the State with regard to this initiative and has advised other colleges on how to build their own systems. 447 Faculty/staff training The importance of ongoing professional development for faculty and staff, particularly with regard to cultural competence and intercultural teaching and learning, is well-documented; this was also identified as an area for improvement in the FY2017 annual report and steady progress has been made since. This past year, the College transitioned to Safe Colleges online training platform. All new hires are assigned mandatory Diversity Awareness training; current employees may also take complete the training. Faculty and staff training during FY2019 was focused in two areas: developing Diversity and Inclusion Committee members' cultural proficiency skills and the launch of the Intercultural Teaching and Learning Fellows Program. Diversity and Inclusion Committee members have identified a need to develop their own skills and proficiency around diversity-related topics ; in support of this, time during each meeting was dedicated to a learning activity . Committee members are also encouraged to attend diversity- related programming as a means to develop both personal understanding as well as a sense of community at events. Additionally, the group committed to a common reading for Summer 2019; that will serve as a springboard for a Fall 2019 professional development session. For FY2020, the committee meeting schedule has been reformatted to alternate business meetings and professional development sessions. The Intercultural Teaching and Learning Fellows Program launched in Fall 2018. This program supports professional development of faculty and Student Affairs staff using a learning community model; participants attend relevant local conferences followed by on-campus debriefing sessions. The design of the program has kept expenditures low while allowing participants to learn at a level that is most appropriate for them. The inaugural cohort included representation from five academic departments and two Student Affairs offices. During the year, the nine members participated in 49 off-campus training days; on-campus follow-up sessions provided opportunities for Fellows to consider how new ideas could be implemented on campus. Feedback and data from the inaugural cohort are being analyzed and will be shared with the Diversity and Inclusion and Instructional Quality (professional development) Committees as well as the Executive Team. Eight of the nine Fellows have requested the opportunity to continue in the program for a second year ; they will participate through individual projects and activities in their respective departments, along with monthly meetings and attendance at key professional development events . The second cohort, comprised of six faculty and Student Affairs staff, will begin the program in August 2019. Fellows' activities resulted in an increased network of local resources as well as potential presenters; several have been invited to present on campus for students, faculty, and staff. This 458 has enabled the College to keep current with training topics while advancing the campus' work and learning. While the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and Intercultural Teaching and Learning Fellows are engaged in targeted, sustained learning around diversity-related topics, professional development for all faculty and staff remains a fundamental institutional goal. On a regular basis, conferences and activities of interest are shared via a weekly faculty and staff e-newsletter as well as to the faculty professional development Facebook group. In addition, several professional development sessions for faculty at-large were offered in support of related initiatives: 14 faculty attended \"Developing and Assessing Diversity-Designated General Education Courses\" and nine participated in a two-day Summer Institute workshop on \"Designing for Diversity.\" The Diversity and Inclusion Committee also created and distributed a 2019 summer reading recommendation list. Curricular initiatives The College's recent review and revision of its General Education requirements and learning goals involved significant conversation around topics of diversity. During the course of the review, both criteria and assessment for diversity-designated courses were redefined; all current diversity courses were reviewed and a subset was reaffirmed. Professional development will continue to support the development, delivery, and assessment of diversity-designated courses. The College Library continues to be an important partner in efforts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, providing displays for various events and celebrations and acquiring relevant resources. The non-credit Adult Education program serves a diverse population through its English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) and GED Preparation programs. Classes are available at no cost through grant funds provided by Carroll County Government and the Maryland Department of Labor. The program is part of a county referral network that ensures that the needs of underserved and hard- to-reach populations are met; partners include the Business and Educational Resource Center, Division of Rehabilitative Services, Human Services Programs and the Carroll County Department of Social Services. Further, the program's Career Navigator provides guidance and information to ESOL and GED students, connecting them with resources, career training, and degree opportunities. The non-credit personal enrichment area continues to expand its programming to support the College's diversity initiatives. Examples of courses include: international cooking , history, and world view classes. Based on student feedback, future offerings will be expanded . 469 Co-curricular programming An ongoing goal is to provide programming that moves beyond basic celebrations and passive activities to allow students to authentically engage topics of power, privilege and difference. Partnerships between the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and faculty have proven to be central to this work; efforts continue to tie learning activities to course goals , reinforcing and extending what students are learning while ensuring the events are well-attended. Field trips, film screenings and panel discussions on topics related to current events, identity, relationships, mental health, and disabilities were held throughout the year. Including students, employees and outside experts on panels provided opportunities for a variety of perspectives to be shared. A highlight during the spring semes ter was Factuality, a \"facilitated dialogue , crash course , and board game , all in one, that simulates real life experiences in America. It is played with a rich group of diverse characters that encounter a series of fact -based advantages and limitations based on the intersection of their race, gender, sexual orientation, faith, and class. \" Approxim ately 60 students and 10 employees participated. The response was overwhelmingly positive and this program will be offered as a required training in Fall 2019 for all full -time employees ; an additional student session has also been added . Clubs are an important way for students to develop a sense of belonging while also exploring leadership and other social roles. The Queer-Straight Alliance, German, and African Culture Clubs were all active during FY2019; several Diversity and Inclusion Committee members serve as club advisors. There has been some interest in starting a Latinx Club as well as a Black Student Union; there is strong support for these student-led initiatives . The Carroll Food Locker Program supports current students, faculty and staff with groceries, hygiene products, school supplies, and holiday meals and gifts. During FY2019, 135 clients and 442 family members were served; this marked an increase both in clients (27%) and the number of family members (40%). Areas for improvement/Ongoing opportunities Over the past two years, the Diversity and Inclusion Committee has researched best practices related to student programming; this ongoing learning will continue and expand in order to make activities both meaningful and accessible. In FY2020, methods of capturing data and outcomes related to activities will be researched and piloted. Learning opportunities for the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and Intercultural Teaching and Learning Fellows will continue; plans are also underway to extend offerings to others on campus. To that end, a session on implicit bias is scheduled for early September; members of the College's Executive Team will attend. Further training will be held for all full-time employees 4710 with an invited presenter who will lead the Factuality simulation during Fall 2019; follow-up sessions will be planned and supported by the Diversity and Inclusion Committee . Conclusion As noted in this report, initiatives include curriculum revision, data analysis, expanded faculty and staff training, and community programming. During the past year, efforts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion were woven mindfully and systematically into the fabric of Carroll Community College. 4811 Appendix I Statement on the campus process for reporting of hate-based crimes Visitors and guests of Carroll Community College, including students, employees and others who enter the campus, are encouraged to contact Campus Police at 410-386-8123, or internally at extension 8123. Carroll's Campus Police will respond to any report of a crime, including hate- bias incidents, and will fully investigate and report on the allegations and investigation. If a crime is associated with a hate-bias incident, such as a destruction of property, the crime will also be reported in the College's Annual Security Report (Clery Report). Campus Police takes every opportunity to instruct students and employees how and when to use 8123, and ensure that the number is posted in every classroom, lab and office. Campus security authorities (CSAs) must disclose statistics for offenses that occur on campus, in or on non-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by our College, and public property within or immediately adjacent to our campus and related to the following three categories: 1. Murder/non-negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, sex offenses (rape, fondling, incest, statutory rape), robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. 2. Any bias-related (hate) crimes related to the above listed crimes but also including larceny-theft, simple assault, intimidation, or destruction of property/vandalism. *Hate Crime is defined as a crime that manifests evidence that the perpetrator intentionally selected the victim because of the victim's actual or perceived race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or disability. 3. Any arrests or referrals for weapons violations, drug violations or alcohol violations. Employees in these current functions are notified by the Campus Police that they are federally mandated to report crimes and are provided with Report Forms with instructions for documentation. CSAs are also instructed as to why a student may be more inclined to report crime to them and the specific crimes they are required to report. During FY2019, there were no reported hate-based crimes at Carroll Community College. 491 Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) 2019 Cultural Diversity Plan 502 I. Introduction Cecil College is an inclusive, open -access college committed to academic excellence and service to the greater region. The College provides a supportive learning environment to a diverse body of students as they build the skills and knowledg e to achieve academic success, prepare to transfer, and enter the workforce. Further, Cecil College fosters intellectual, professional, and personal development through lifelong learning opportunities, the arts, and community engagement. Cecil College rec ognizes that a diverse and inclusive campus community promotes learning, respect, and excellence. As such, the College has adopted and takes pride in the following institutional values: Collaboration : We foster a cooperative environment that is collegial , seeks consensus, and builds on the strength of each individual within the College and the community. Compassion : We show care and concern for our students, our community, and each other. Diversity : We embrace diversity, honor shared governance, and foster inclusiveness. Excellence : We seek excellence in all facets of our academic enterprise and operations as we serve the College and community. Innovation : We boldly pursue the most innovative learning environment for our students and community. Integrity : We demonstrate honesty and respect at all times and act ethically in all matters. Stewardship : We honor public trust by being principled stewards of the human, fiscal, and physical resources of the institution. The Cultural Diversity Plan (CDP) is designed to promote and support these institutional values . Since 2012, the plans have been intentionally aligned with the Maryland State statutory provision \u00a711-406 of the Education Article and the College's strategic priorities. The CDP is annually reviewed and assessed by an internal college -wide committee, the College's Multicultural Student Services Advisory Board, and the College's Board of Trustees prior to submission to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). II. Institutional Plan to Impr ove Cultural Diversity The Cecil College 2015 -2020 Strategic Plan f ocuses on student academic achievement and completion, fostering a dynamic learning environment, stimulating resource development that prompts student success, and expanding community alliances. In this plan the College articulates goals designed to strengthen diversity and inclusion on campus , including increasing college access and success , formalizing professional development opportunities that enrich faculty and staff understanding, and generating growth in all foundation and fund development activities to support students and strategic initiatives. This r eport summarizes the progress and accomplishments made over the past academic year and outlines plan for improvement. 513 III. Efforts to Increase Numerical Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups Student Recruitment The College has implemented several projects/initiatives to recruit traditionally underrepresented students . As Table 1 illustrates, Cecil's total student credit enrollment decreased from 2,551 students in 2014 to 2,391 in 2018; at the same time , the enr ollment of nonwhite students increase d from 20.3% in 2014 to 23.3% in 2018. This progress can be attributed to an increase in outreach activities by the College team. The Financial Aid staff presents workshops in English and Spanish for families and prospective students to help th em apply for aid. These events are offered at the high schools as well as at the co unty's libraries. The Admissions staff has a full calendar of events and programs including: attending College and Career Expos; hosting annual High School Tour Days and C ampus Open Houses; organizing campus tours and activities for youth groups such as the Harford County & Cecil County Boys and Girls Club and the Lighthouse Youth Center; and attending numerous community events in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania . The C oordinator for Student Diversity and Inclusion also provides outreach to prospective minority students by hosting Multicultural Meet and Greets; organizing an annual multicultural recruitment day called \" Highlight You; \" providing workshops to high school A VID programs (A dvancement Via Individual Determination ); and attending meetings held by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, local churches, veterans' groups, and special interest organizations such as the Maryland Tri -County Chapter of Federally Employed Women .

These programs and activities include new student orientation, multicultural student welcome reception , academic success seminars, time management workshops, study tips, and test-taking sessions . Some of these workshops are for all students while others focused on underrepresented students specif ically. Adviso rs and faculty also participate in the College's academic monitoring program, an early alert system designed to identify students failing or at risk for failure. Faculty members complete d reports three times during each semester and identif ied contributing factors related to a student's poor performance. Advisors contacted student s for follow -up. In 2018 -29, advisors sent out over 1,500 letters and made over 1,500 phone calls to students who were identified through the academic monitoring process. The Student Life staff offers numerous activities to promote campus engagement. Some of the activities and programs include Hispanic Heritage Celebrations, African American History Month activities, Native American Heritage Celebrations, Black Minds Matter series, Dr. Martin Luther King Day Observance , Minority Student Employability and Completion Workshop s, Skills Building for Writing and Math; Cecil County NAACP Minority Scholarship Night , NAACP Bla ck Expressions Throughout the Generation program, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Scholarship Banquet , and attendance at the Maryland Male Students of Color Conference. Additionally, two cultural student organizations were active throughout the year : the Multic ultural Student Union and CIAO - Cecil's International Affinity Organization. 535 Targeted Intervention provide d to Maryland Higher Education Committee on Performance Accountability Report The College continues to offer the mentoring program , \"Male Students of Color ,\" which was launched in 2017 in response to gaps in persistence and completion rates of African American students. In academic year 2018 -19, the program had 7 faculty/staff mentors and 9 student participants. Each semester new stu dents were invited by email and text to participate in the program. The group met monthly for lunch to discuss academic progress and other topics of interest. In addition to ongoing meetings, the students were invited to attend the annual Maryland \"Male Students of Color Summit\" and to academic and study skills building workshops facilitated by academic advisors. Student participants reported that the program was beneficial to them; nonetheless , College Life staff members were concerned that the program w as not reaching enough students. Consequently, to reach additional students the College launched a one -on-one peer mentoring program for underrepresented students beginning August 2019. The Coordinator of Student Diversity and Inclusion serves as the l ead for planning and implementing the mentoring program in collaboration with representatives from Athletics, Advising, Registration, Financial Aid, Writing Center, Math Lab, and Faculty Senate. Students invited to participate as mentees include new stude nts of color as well as returning students of color who are on academic warning or probation. Students are identified by reports provided by the Office of Institutional Research and are then sent a personalized email inviting them to participate. Interest ed students are matched with a student mentor who has earned at least 12 credits and has a 2.5 GPA. Mentors are selected based on a formal application process including a personal interview with the Director of College Life and the Coordinator of Student Diversity and Inclusion. Mentors are compensated for their time through the Federal Work Study program, if they qualify, or the College's operational budget if they do not. The mentees attend programs and events that focus on the following four topics: navigating campus departments and asking questions, getting acquainted with technology, academic student success, and campus engagement. Additionally, they meet with their mentors on a weekly basis for structured discussion around the activities. Colle ge staff anticipate that it will be challenging to recruit students and to retain them in the mentoring program similar to the challenges with the \"Male Students of Color \" program. The metrics used to monitor the program will be student grade point averag e, persistence rates from fall to spring, and participation in mentoring appointments. At the beginning of the spring 2020 semester, participation and outcomes will be evaluated, and the College may consider mandating participation in the mentoring progra m for students who on are on academic warning or probation. Employees The College has made efforts to recruit and retain a more diverse faculty and staff. Human Resources posts all positions to the diversity packages offered through Higher Ed Jobs and the Chronicle of Higher Education , reaching more than 10 websites designed for recruiting traditionally underrepresented professionals. Members of search committees are selected so that the composition is diverse. 546 Tables 2 -4 (below) show the ethnicity of all full -time employees for the past three years by employment type. The percentage of nonwhite professional staff has increased from 11% to 15.5% and the percentage of nonwhite faculty members has increased from 1 5.5% to 17.3%. In 2019, the College discontinued a contract with an external company for facilities services and hired its own facilities staff members. As a result, t here was a significant increase in the number of classified staff members hired in 2019 . These hires were primarily custodians, groundskeepers, and maintenance workers. The decrease in nonwhites represented in these positions caused the grand total minority percentage to stay flat over the past three years.

Two training modules were added in 2018 related to diversity . Additionally, e mployees are required to acknowledge policies that are pertinent to the fair treatment of all individuals. In 2018, the College administered the \"Great Colleges to Work for Survey\" to all employees. The survey consisted of 70 statements and asked employees for level of agreement from strongly disagree to strongly agree. In response to \"At this institution, people are supportive of their colleagues regardless of their heritage or background\" 93% of responses were positive in comparison to the 2017 Carnegie Association benchmark of 86%. In response to \"The environment at this institution is supportive of the expression of different opinions, styles, and perceptions from all racial, ethnic, religious, spiritual, sexual orientation, disability, ideological/philosophical , political, or multiple groups, \" 89% were positive. There is no benchmar k data for this qu estion because it was one of ten custom questions created by the College. IV. Efforts to De sign and Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness Inclusivity Collaborative The College's \"Inclusivity Collaborative \" was formed in 2016 comprised of faculty and staff who meet to find ways to embrace diversity and inclusion on campus. In the 2018 -2019 academic year, there were twenty -six members . This group is open to all interested faculty and staff , and information r elated to their work and how to get involved is posted on the College portal. The group's primary initiative in the 2018 -2019 academic year was to research and encourage professional development for faculty, staff, and administration on ways to generate productive, respectful discussions across disparate groups, including strategies faculty could take into the classroom. The administration was fully supportive of this endeavor, and in February, 77 full -time and adjun ct faculty members attended a formal training in reflective structured dialog (RSD) by Essential Partners, a platform discussed in The Chro nicle of Higher Education . Since that training, several instructors have implemented RSD in their classrooms, and a community of interested practitioners has formed on 568 campus. In addition, the Inclusivity Collaborative created and administered an anonymo us, optional survey of students to learn what types of topics they would like the opportunity to learn more about or discuss, and in what formats. The survey also sought to identify the degree of anxiety students feel when current hot topics are discussed in academic settings, and if and how we can ameliorate those concerns. In respo nse to the 111 survey s collected , the Collaborative is planning to organize a series of non -partisan, informative, roundtable events around topics important to the 2020 presiden tial election, which will also provide interested students an opportunity for guided reflective structured dialog interaction. New Curricular Initiative In fall 2019, the College is introducing a new, 3 -credit humanities course called \"Introduction to Critical Inquiry\" encouraged for all new students and required for students majoring in General Studies. The course is designed to foster the characteristics of successful academic pursuit s: openness, curiosity, creativity, persistence, an d metacognition. In the context of a common reader and the students' own academic and career goals, students practice critical thought, information assimilation, investigation, discussion, analysis, collaboration, and qualitative and quantitative analysis as they develop the habits of mind and cultural literacy necessary for college and global citizenship. The common reader chosen for the 2019 -2020 academic year is Born a Crime by Trevor Noah . The book is about Noah's experience s growing up in South Africa under apartheid and offers opportunities for discussion and reflection on social, political, and cultural themes. New Co -Curricular Initiative The library will be working with faculty to offer an event called the Human Library . The Human Library event will use volunteers as \"books\" - volunteers who have diverse and interesting backgrounds and who are willing to share their stories. Participants can \"borrow\" the \"books\" to have a candid conversation wi th someone they normally would not have the ch ance to interact with and to ask questions. V. Statement Regarding Campus Process for the Reporting of Hate -Based Crimes Cecil College expects all members of the College community to conduct themselves in a respectful manner toward themselves, faculty, staff, and other students. As in any community, there are rights and responsibilities by which all students must abide. Students have the right to free speech, expression, assembly and association, and to utilize Cecil College resources while registered fo r classes. A statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities that was adopted from a report by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education is listed in the College Catalog and on the College's website. Students also have the responsibility to abide by the Student Code of Conduct (SCC). The Director of Student Life works with the Director of Public Safety to enforce the SCC, and it is shared with students at New Student Orientation and included in the College Catalog , on the website , and in the Student Planner. There are 32 behaviors/actions explicitly described as \"prohibited conduct\" listed in the SCC. The two that cover hate -based behaviors are the following: 579 Harassment or intimidation such as physical or psychological harassment or abuse of any member of the college community or of any guest. Harassment is behavior that either is intended to, or actually does, inflict harm or emotional distress or provoke a violent reaction. Harassment may include use of racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, or per sonal slurs or epithets, or other threatening, intimidating, hostile, or abusive treatment of any person or group of persons in the college community. Abusing a person in any manner, including but not limited to, physical, verbal, sexual, threats, intimi dation, bullying, and/or any conduct which threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person. The College uses SafeColleges to provide an online incident reporting and tracking form that is linked from the College's portal. The system allows facu lty, staff, and students to quickly and easily report incidents on campus. They complete the form online and a report immediately is sent to the Director of Student Life and the Vice President for Student Services and Enrollment Management who follow up o n the report with appropriate individuals. Members of the campus community are also encouraged to file a report with Public Safety or with local law enforcement if they are concerned that a crime has occurred on campus . The Office of Public Safety is responsible for collect ing and publish ing Clery data . They also provide an Annual Campus Safety Report that is posted on the College' s website . All Cecil College officials (staff, faculty, and administers) serve as College Safety Authorities for the purp ose of Clery. 58 Chesapeake College 2019 Cultural Diversity Report Chesapeake College understands that a diverse faculty, staff, and student body will enhance the overall learning experience. The College is proud to see on our campus diversity in race, age, ethnic background, religious choice, and ability. Through curricular and co-curricular activities, students are engaged in an environment that fosters diversity. Both academic and student success faculty, as well as staff, are aware of and committed to creating a learning environment that is respectful of diversity in all its aspects and is a place where differences can be acknowledged and celebrated instead of ignored or hidden. Chesapeake College Cultural Diversity Planning and Assessment The College created its first Cultural Diversity Plan in 2009, reaffirmed its second plan in 2013, and updated it again in 2019 to align with the College's new Strategic Plan priorities and goals. The Diversity Committee, made up of cross divisional representation, was created in 2009 to ensure successful implementation of the college's Diversity Plan. Referencing Senate Bill 438 and House Bill 905, cultural diversity is defined as the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education. The goals set forth in Chesapeake College's 2019-2024 Diversity Plan encompass a broader view of diversity, respecting differences and promoting inclusion of all individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, culture, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, military service, and abilities. This cross-divisional plan, so noted because the responsibility for administration extends across multiple divisions, addresses three of the Strategic Plan priorities. Each priority has a number of strategies to foster overall achievement. The structure is as follows: Priority Strategies Strategic Plan Priority 1: Student Success Improve academic programs to close the minority achievement gap Increase the number of students in traditionally underrepresented groups Ensure achievement of the student learning outcomes of cultural diversity and ethics competencies Ensure adequate supp ort services are provided for \"AT RISK\" student populations Strategic Plan Priority 2 : Programming Expand/enhance credit and non -credit offerings related to diversity and multicultural issues Support transition from non -credit programming (e.g., basic skills or entry level training) into credit coursework Strategic Plan Priority 3: Culture of Excellence Offer a variety of multicultural activities, events and learning opportunities that increase positive interactions and cultural awareness among studen ts, faculty, staff, and the public at -large Increase the number of employees in traditionally underrepresented groups 59 Each goal from the previous Diversity Plan and priority in the new one has a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with it. These indicators are periodically reviewed for currency and applicability. During the 2019-2024 Diversity Plan development, the KPI set was evaluated and modified accordingly. The new plan KPIs are Goal Measurable Outcomes Strategic Plan Priority 1: Student Success Diverse Perspectives Proficiency Ethics Proficiency Graduates' experience re: cultural diversity Graduating students' satisfaction: Inclusiveness Retention Rate: Fall to Fall, Minority Students Program Achievement : persistence: TRiO SSS -Served Students Graduation Rate: Minority students Enrollment: Credit fall minority student headcount percentage Enrollment: Non-credit fiscal year minority student headcount percentage Enrollment: Veteran student s credit fall head count Enrollment: Adult student s credit fall headcount Enrollment: Credit and non -credit s tudents with disabilities fiscal year headcount Enrollment: English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) fiscal year headcount Enrollment: Non-credit senior citizens annual headcount Strategic Plan Priority 2 : Programming Credit and non -credit offerings related to diversity and multicultural issues Enrollment: Transition from non -credit into credit coursework Strategic Plan Priority 3: Culture of Excellence Faculty: Minority full -time faculty Staff: Minority full -time administrators and exempt/non -exempt staff Subject matter experts work with the office of Institutional Research, Planning and Effectiveness to develop annual KPI targets that relate to expectations for the current year. Each target is compared against the actual value to determine progress. Of the 13 measurable outcomes evaluated in FY2018 , five (38.5 %) met their annual targets, 6 (46.2%) did not and two (15.4%) came close. Yet, none of those measures persistently missed their annual targets. Efforts to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups Enhanc ement of diversity within the College remains an important goal and challenge, and is being given increased effort and attention. Chesapeake College's aim is to create an environment where differences are considered assets that make us better teachers, employees, and students. A truly inclusive institution benefits all\u2014 educationally and professionally\u2014 both on campus and within our five county region. 60 In order to ensure that our student body represents the increasingly diverse communities we serve, Chesapeake's marketing and public relations team focuses on intentional marketing strategies for recruitment and outreach among traditionally underserved populations. Over the past year we have implemented those strategies to increase representation in our advertising imagery and language to incorporate inclusion as part of our brand identity. We have also expanded our ad placements and distribution methods to increase accessibility and awareness among minority populations within our service area. Members of our marketing team serve on the Diversity Committee and work closely with the local Multicultural Advisory Committee, Maryland Humanities, Mid-Shore Community Foundation, Talbot NAACP, and other diversity and inclusion focused groups in the community. Minority status in the college's five county service region is often related to lower socio- economic status and areas of extremely limited public transportation. Specific recruitment services included college interest meetings, on-site Accuplacer testing, and registration sessions. Counselors at each of the local high schools were made aware of the visits and services available and were encouraged to promote Chesapeake College to minority, culturally diverse, and first generation college-bound students. Recruitment services included presentations for participants earning their GED, high school college interest meetings and on-site registration at the local public high schools, evening events featuring financial aid and scholarship information, participation at career fairs hosted at the local middle and elementary schools and open house events for both high school and adult students. At the high schools, information was shared with all junior and senior students interested in participating in dual enrollment and students completing their senior year. Additional and targeted information sessions were provided to students enrolled in career pathway programs, too. The career and tech sessions provided updated information on the new skilled trades programs. All events and sessions information were scheduled with the high school counselors and the counselors shared the information with parents via newsletters and text alerts. Career and tech students from Caroline county participated in group tours and presentations provided by the career and tech faculty members. Students were invited to participate in an interactive activity or lesson, ask questions, receive a tour, and have lunch on campus. For the third consecutive year, we hosted a group of Talbot County students participating in the Career Planning Initiative program. Students were divided in groups according to their career interest and attended presentations from the faculty, received tours and ended their time on campus with lunch provided by the Rotary. The Education department hosted a special day for high school students participating in Teacher Academy. The day included presentations, tours, and a panel discussion including faculty, staff, and our Director of Outreach. All students attending the special events received swag bags filled with admissions information and water bottles. Other group tours included elementary and middle students, ESL students from Easton High School, visitors from The Multi-Cultural Center, and students participating in special education programs from the local high schools. In 2019, we hosted the first Saturday Open House for our service area targeting adult learners. Community members from all five counties were invited to attend and participate. Sessions included Chesapeake 101, financial aid, transfer, information on our skilled trades programs, agriculture and environmental science, and non-credit and credit health programs. In addition, 61 we provided tours and hosted a college lane featuring other academic programs, first-year programs, student life, honors, athletics, adult education and ESL programs and services. More than fifty potential students attended bringing parents, spouses, and children, too. Two other open house events featured all of our credit and non-credit healthcare programs. One was provided for students from the local high schools and the other was held in the evening to attract the adult learners. Both events provided presentations from our faculty and included a career lane featuring local employers sharing career information and job opportunities. The Chesapeake College Adult Education Program offered registration and classes in more than 17 locations throughout the communities we serve. More than 380 information and registration sessions were held throughout the year, and in excess of 90 classes were held. Program staff maintained offices at American Job Centers and Family Support Centers in various locations throughout the five counties. They served as a resource to these and other agencies on a daily basis. An appreciation for multicultural diversity and cultural competence is at the core of our program. Our culturally diverse staff is reflective of the population we serve. The leadership team includes two Hispanic individuals and various bilingual members. Collectively, our working languages include: English, Spanish, French, and Swedish. Both program and marketing materials are regularly translated into Spanish, and occasionally into Creole. In addition to social media and printed materials, our program also frequently participates in community events throughout the Mid-Shore region. Student access to language assistance has also benefited from the contributions of a dynamic marketing/public re lations team. Vibrant flyers and social media content are frequently updated and distributed in the community. The entire Adult Education staff has taken Cultural Competence training. Staff members have been instrumental in designing programs that reach out to non-English speaking parents of potential credit level students. The number and level of expertise among our bilingual staff has increased during the past year, and direct access to culturally and linguistically competent staff has enhanced the quality of service (e.g. effectiveness of outreach efforts, frequency of communications, identification of trends and improvement needs). Some of our employees are recognized as cultural leaders and connectors in the Hispanic Community. The ABE-ESL program serves a population of nontraditional and diverse students. As a targeted intervention we utilize intrusive advising strategies to assist our students in overcoming barriers to success and navigating the various systems to achieve their goals of earning a High School diploma credential, improving their English speaking, reading, and writing skills and or entering post-secondary education or workforce training. The obstacles these students face include language, cultural and financial barriers. The majority of these students are potentially first generation college students. We currently track the number of nontraditional students both Adult Basic Education and English Language Learners by using the US-NRS approved CASAS standardized Reading and Math assessments and classify students using Educational Function Levels (EFL) as defined by US-NRS. In addition, we collect specific data on student goals of improving an educational functioning level, earning a High School diploma, entering post- secondary education, workforce training, or gaining employment. Students in the cohort will be contact ed 4 months and 8 months after exiting the Adult Education Program to determine if they 62 have enrolled in Post-secondary education or training. The Adult Education Program enrolled 789 stude nts during FY 2019. ABE and ESL levels five and six are the targets for this intervention, there were 265 students enrolled in these levels. 112 ABE and 153 ESL students. 33 ABE students earned their High School Diplomas in the year while five students were confirmed enrolled and attended in credit or workforce training programs at Chesapeake College. Chesapeake College is an active member of the Talbot Language and Cultural Competence initiative, and the only licensed institution on the Eastern Shore of Maryland that provides The Community Interpreter\u00ae International training (a 40 -hour certificate program). Since last year, seven individuals affiliated with our program have received this training. While learning bilingual communication skills, this training also develops competencies in other cultural areas. Adult Education sponsored a group of eight instructors and Intake Helpers for the Education Department's Command Spanish class \"Requesting Personal Information\" to enhance their interaction with Spanish-speaking students. These classes are also offered to the public. Presentations have been made to community organizations with a diverse focus, such as the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center where we partner for citizenship classes, as well as assistance with the Haitian population. Other efforts include outreach to organizations and agencies representing larger populations of underrepresented communities in all five counties of the service region. These efforts include offering classes to the inmates at Detention Centers, developing close working relationships with ESL Coordinators in the public schools, and the Family Service Coordinators at each Family Support Center. Chesapeake College has continued its partnership with local advocates for health care professionals, and supporters to create a path for deserving, capable, caring, and compassionate individuals to enter the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) program on a fully paid scholarship. T.R.E.E.S. (Training, Recruitment, Education, Employment, and Support) actively sought out suitable candidates for the scholarship whose funds are privately secured. Additionally, Chesapeake partners with the local Eastern Shore Area Health Education Center on Phase Three of the State of Maryland's Employment Advancement Right Now (EARN) grant that provides scholarships for CNA students and the opportunity to establish secondary pathways for students who already have any allied health credential to expand their skill set and professional employment opportunities (CNA trains to become Clinical Medical Assistant or Certified Medicine Aide, etc.). Additionally, the EARN grant provides Mental Health First Aid training that targets Certified Nursing Assistants in our local service area. The CNA students and working professionals represent a wide diversity of ethnicities and nationalities. As a result of these and other efforts over the years, Chesapeake College has been very successful in attracting minority students. The percentage of minority credit students exceeded comparable service area adult population percent in each of the last eight years. In fall 2018, minorities comprised 26.9% of the student body, but only 20.4% of the regional population. Also, in FY2019, 36.7% of all continuing education students were from a minority group. The College strives to recruit, train and support a diverse workforce. Human Resources monitors all employment policies to ensure no barriers exist for employees from diverse backgrounds. Chesapeake College turnover declined last year to 10.6% compared to 2017 which was 13.6%, 63 with minority turnover representing just 1.8 % of the total workforce. Exit interview data is closely monitored and no issues were identified that caused any concern in reference to minority turnover. Human Resources representatives meet with all search committees to explain our commitment to diversity and to encourage search committee members to consider diversity during the selection process. All search committee members receive a packet of information on hiring procedures that includes information on fair hiring practices and allowable questions. Search committee chairs emphasize the college commitment to increasing the diversity of our workforce. These initiatives help demonstrate Chesapeake College's continued commitment to making diversity a priority. In April 2019, the U.S. unemployment dropped to 3.3%, the lowest rate in over 50 years. The local rate was 3.5%, the lowest in almost 20 years. Recruiting for all positions has been challenging during 2018-2019. Attracting and successfully recruiting minority candidates in a tight job market is even more difficult due to the fierce competition for minority candidates. As far as our recruitment efforts are concerned, in addition to the usual sources of advertising, ads are placed in diversity publications such as Diverse Issues in Higher Education. Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the area with graduate programs are contacted when appropriate to support our diversity initiatives. Additional diversity resources were identified this year to include: Academic Keys - KeyVersity Diversity Program, which is designed to help institutions like ours who are actively recruiting candidates in accordance with their diversity plans. Additionally, we used Workplace Diversity Network, which posts to Workplace Diversity.com and Hispanic Outlook. Workplace Diversity has a network of sites which include five additional diverse sources: VeteransConnect.com, DisabilityConnect.com, HispanicDiversity.com, OutandEqual.com, and All Diversity. Because of the College's small size, overall percentages can be impacted greatly by just a few hires and/or terminations. The college currently has 165 full-time staff; 69.7% are females and 20.7% are minorities. Several long term faculty members retired this year, so we have several faculty searches in process. We currently have 53 faculty, 69.8% of which are female and 7.7% are minorities. To illustrate, the addition of one additional minority faculty member might increase the minority percentage by two percentage points. One of our goals for FY2020 is to recruit and hire a half-time Diversity & Inclusion Coordinator. We hope by focusing additional human resources in this area, we can improve both our student and workforce minority demographics. Efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. Both faculty and staff need recurring training and practical ideas for more fully meeting the needs of a diverse population. Specific training efforts during the 2017-2018 academic year focused on the changing demographics in our area to increase faculty members' awareness of the 64 growing Hispanic community. A training held during Spring In-Service combined factual information about Central America in conjunction with reminders of unconscious assumptions held by each individual. In addition, the Diversity Committee obtained funding through the Fulbright Commission's Outreach Lecturing Fund to bring a Nepalese scholar studying in the U.S. to campus for a series of classroom visits and lectures, with one classroom discussion in Cambridge as well as several on the main campus. Co-chairs of the Diversity Committee continued participation with the Maryland Diversity Roundtable, which is a great resource for networking and learning about successful diversity workshops at other community colleges. A major structural change to the Diversity Committee was the approval of the committee as an institutional committee that would fill faculty member obligations for committee service. Five faculty members were appointed to the committee, which added significantly to representation and human power for the committee. In addition, the requirement for a year-end report provided additional accountability to the academic side of the house as well as a meaningful summary of activities to all committee members with recommendations that the committee submit a budget request for FY 2020 and requesting more visible support from senior administrators in recognizing diversity issues as critical to the college mission. Among the general education courses currently electing to assess \"diverse perspectives\", were Cultural Anthropology, Art, Music, and Film classes, Composition, Psychology, and all History courses. Among non-general education courses, faculty who selected this competency were found in Early Childhood Education, Food Preparation, Economics, foreign language courses, Nursing, and Medical Emergencies. Courses designed to specifically teach and assess ethics were often found in practica and workshops, as well as those in counseling, paralegal studies, criminal justice, accounting and business, and clinical experience courses. World Civilization courses (I & II) are among the few general education courses opting to focus on ethics. The IDC course required for most transfer programs included ethical behavior on the assessment reporting schedule for spring 2019. As faculty members move into recommendations and follow up activities that close the assessment loop, we anticipate seeing even higher proficiency levels and increased embedding of activities that not only introduce but reinforce and apply the general education competencies associated with this diversity report. Other courses will be assessed in the summer and fall semesters, giving a broader picture of these educational activities on campus. Other initiatives central to the Cultural Diversity Plan Chesapeake College is currently implementing new approaches to promote multiculturalism in the college and the community. We are reinstating a half-time position of Diversity and Inclusion Coordinator to support the campus's efforts to foster an inclusive campus environment. The Coordinator will work with students, employees, and community partners to improve 65 support for students from culturally diverse and/or underrepresented communities. Also, the Multicultural Advisory Committee, a collaboration between the College and our five counties that brings together leaders in our region, has been reinvigorated. The committee provides feedback to the college and makes recommendations on the academic and service needs of culturally diverse students, explores and secures funding for scholarships to assist culturally diverse students, and initiates and supports programming that provides educational and cultural enhancement opportunities for the college and service region. Because the on-campus and the community groups share many of the same goals, closer cooperation is planned starting with the upcoming academic year. Internal review has clearly shown that college-ready students progress at much higher rates than do developmental students. To that end, the college has continued its policy of allowing the 3.0 high school GPA to override Accuplacer recommendations for placement. This drastically decreases the number of students required to take developmental English and Math. Particularly in English courses, the results are encouraging. The college readiness rates of African-American students have been significantly lower than those of White students. Until recently, less than ten percent of African-American freshmen were deemed college ready and approximately two-thirds required remediation in both English and mathematics. Under the new exemption policy, the college readiness rates for freshmen jumped to a record level in fall 2017 and again in 2018. Particularly noteworthy were 1) the more than doubling of college readiness rates of African-American students, by far the most predominant minority group, (to 16.7%) and 2) the halving of the share requiring English and math developmental coursework (to 36.7%). It is expected that subsequent graduation-transfer rates will rise, but it is still far too early to determine the effects. Developmental English streamlined the curriculum to a single course rather than two in prior years and implemented the nationally recognized Accelerated Learning Program model. Math has a lso piloted an AMP model and will continue exploring fuller implementation in this area as well as other efforts to improve student success. Course success rates have improved as a result, for the college as a whole, but for African-American students in particular. For African- Americans, historic highs were set for both developmental and gateway English courses, and all but one math course. The achievement gaps between Whites and Blacks similarly have shrunk to record lows. The College offers several programs to increase student engagement and success among culturally-d iverse students and strives each year to surpass future targets. Evidence shows that the formal intervention programs yield positive results. The SAIL program (Success And Interactive Learning) gets first-time freshmen actively involved in the college experience. SAIL has several academic and service utilization requirements for participation. Students who complete the program and finish the semester with a quality point average of at least a 2.0 receive a scholarship toward their spring semester tuition. A dedicated FSC/SAIL classroom allowed standardization of the Freshman Seminar Course (FSC) experience and provide SAIL participants with a home of their own, which increased 66 group cohesiveness and allowed expansion of activities at one central location. These programs provide invaluable support for first-generation college students, many of whom are minorities. The FOCUS group (First-Generation Opportunities for Career and Ultimate Success) is geared for first-generation male students enrolled in a career program and provides them with intense exposure to academic support and career exploration activities during the first year in college. In academic year 2018-19, most participants were African-American. Two federally funded TRiO Student Support Services (SSS) Programs, SSS Classic and SSS- STEM, help eligible (first-generation, low-income, or disabled) students stay in school, graduate, and/or transfer to a four-year institution. Services include academic and financial aid advising, career guidance and readiness, tutoring, and cultural and educational events. Students engaged in these programs statistically outperform comparison groups of students who are not in the program in terms of retention and academic performance. The two TRiO SSS programs combined served over 330 students per academic year, one-third of whom were members of a racial or ethnic minority group, and about one in five were African-American. The College also hosted student activities and professional development opportunities that support diversity and inclusion, with activities like performance by Nazu African Dance Company and salsa dance workshops. Staff and faculty participated in activities like a Presidential Symposium on Race, Diversity and Social Justice and Cultural Competency and Language Access training hosted by the MD Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. The campus process for the reporting of hate-based crimes consistent with federal requirements The Chesapeake College Emergency Procedures Guide is printed annually and is available to all employees on the college's Website. It is intended for the use of faculty, staff, and students of Chesapeake College specifically to provide information on how to respond to possible emergency conditions on campus. It covers such areas as bomb threats, chemical spills, crimes, serious injuries or illnesses and fires. Chesapeake College encourages employees to keep the Manual in an easily accessible location at all times, preferably beside the telephone. New employees are made familiar with it as part of their orientation program. Additionally, the Chesapeake College Student Handbook and Academic Calendar , provided free- of-charge to all students, includes information on reporting of crimes and emergency contact numbers. All reports of criminal activity and other emergency situations result in a response by a member of the college 's Department of Public Safety from the Wye Mills Campus or the Cambridge Center. The appropriate emergency response agency will also be contacted to respond if deemed necessary for further investigation. Federal regulations call for colleges and universities to report crime statistics to students, employees and upon request to applicants for enrollment or employment. These requirements stem from the Federal Campus Security Act of 1990 and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (2013 Amendments). In accordance with the U.S. Department of Education Regulations, Chesapeake College distributes an Annual Security 67 and Fire Safety Report to all current students, staff, and faculty. In addition, the report is available to prospective students, staff, and faculty upon request. The Director of Public Safety makes this report available upon request. The Annual Security and Fire Safety Report provides important information regarding campus crime and security, including information about Chesapeake College's Department of Public Safety, drug and alcohol abuse, sexual assault policies, and crime statistics for the previous three years. Relating more specifically to diversity concerns, Chesapeake College strictly prohibits any type of hate crime against any of its faculty/staff, students, visitors, and guests. According to the Federal Campus Security Act of 1990 and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (2013 Amendments), a hate crime includes Clery Crimes that manifest evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator's bias based upon race, religion, ethnicity, natural origin, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Categories of hate crimes include the following: murder/non-negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, rape, fondling, incest, statutory rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson, larceny- theft, simple assault, intimidation, and destruction/vandalism of property. In the event of a hate crime occurrence, a victim, witness, or anyone who discovers the incident is encouraged to contact the college 's Department of Public Safety. Victims or witnesses may also contact the Queen Anne's Sheriff's Office, the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack, Cambridge Police Department, or the Maryland Human Relations Commission. If any of the above crimes are reported to the Chesapeake College Department of Public Safety or local law enforcement, it will be classified as a hate crime by law enforcement if there is sufficient evidence that the crime was committed based on the suspect(s)' bias towards the victim's race, religion, ethnicity, natural origin, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Victims, witnesses, or anyone who discovers a hate crime may report it in person or by phone to the Chesapeake College Department of Public Safety. They may also contact local law enforcement or the Maryland Human Relations Commission in person or by phone. The campus community can be notified and updated of any hate crime by various modes of communication such as Twitter, college email, college voicemail, and computer monitor messaging. After a crime has been reported, the Chesapeake College Department of Public Safety will work in conjunction with local law enforcement officials, or other investigative agencies in conducting hate crime investigations. 68Progress Report for the Cultural Diversity Plan College of Southern Maryland September 3, 2019 The College of Southern Maryland has a long -standing commitment to diversity. Diversity is an express institutional value and goals are constantly developed around promoting understanding of diverse perspectives and cultures both for our students and employees. Some of the activities the college has undertaken over the last year consistent with our college strategic plan and diversity goals are summarized below. Efforts to Increase Representation of Underrepresented Students, Faculty, and Staff Goal Develop and implement strategies to recruit a diverse student body that reflects the demographi cs of the region Increase the number of African- American students who transfer and/or graduate College of Southern Maryland values the diversity of its student body. Our goal is to serve the d iverse needs of the counties' population through our credit and noncredit programs. The MHEC Performance Accountability Report provides the following assessment measure regarding the diversity of the student population at CSM. The nonwhite service area population in July 2018 was 38.6%. The minority student enrollm ent compared to service area population has grown from Fall 2015 to Fall 2018. In Fall 2015 that number was 42%, and that grew to 45% in Fall 2018 despite a decline in overall enrollment across the college. The benchmark for 2020 is 42%, which the college surpassed. The percentage of nonwhite continuing education enrollment has also grown. I n 2015, that number was 30.6% and it has grown to 32.6% in 2018, again despite decreasing enrollments college -wide. Efforts have been made to increase the success of students from underrepresented minority groups. CSM has implemented First Year Seminar course that considers the academic, social integration, an d student success aspects of the first year experience. The course is designed in alignment with best practice s to meet the success and student retention goals o f the college. The course includes an equity and cultural competency component. The course has undergone updates and revisions based on best practices and initial evaluations of the course have indicated increases in the retention rates of all groups through participation. In the first year of its being required, the overall fall- to-fall retention (fall 2017 -fall 2018) for students you successfully completed the First Year Seminar was 64%. For African -Amer ican students, the retention rate for the same period was 62%, virtually eliminating the retention gap. The college's Lead by Example Mentoring Program to identify and support African American students who are marginalized academically an d financially to provide executive leadership and support is continuing. The program is focused on getting these students focused and proactively addressing issues early and seek ing intervention throughout the semester. 69The College has expanded its Men of Excellence program to reach all campuses and 55 African American students participated in the program in the 2018 -2019 AY . 70% of those students achieved a GPA above 2.0 and the college retained 75% of the participants , a significant improvement over the general retention rate. All three campuses have Student Success Centers that provide a comprehensive system of student support services. These services include peer and online tutoring, skills improvement materials, and various testing capabilities to guide students. The colleg e has increased efforts to create transfer partnerships with HCBUs and to partner Men of Excellence students with transfer institutions. Transfer materials are being created that would ensure that the steps for transferring are easy to understand for first generation students. Staff attended the NAACP College Fair and are working on creating a HBCU Week at the college in Spring 2020. These initiatives, among others, have assisted in increasing the African American successful persister rate after four years and the graduation -transfer rate after four years. The persister rate increased from 54% to 59.5% from the Fall 2011 cohort to the Fall 2014 cohort. The graduation -transfer rate increased from 38.5% to 45.1% from the Fall 2011 cohort to the Fall 2014 coho rt. Goal Increase the percentage of minority employees so that the college's workforce better reflects the demographics of the region One of CSM's seven values is Diversity and it values efforts to increase the diversity of its staff and faculty. The e xpressed mission of the CSM's Human Resources and Organizational Development divi sion is to strive to recruit and retain a competent and diverse workforce. The College has had some successes in the recruitment and retention of minority employees. From Fal l 2015 to Fall 2018, the minority percentage of full- time administrative and professional staff has increased from 28.4 % to 32.9%, a healthy increase. In addition, the minority percentage of full- time faculty has increased from 23.5% to 25.4% during that same time period. The diversity office has partnered with Human Resources to develop and utilize an expanded recruitment resource list to include sources targeted to specific ethnicities and gender groups. The resource list intentionally targets underrepresented groups for disciplines important to CSM , allows a higher level of aware ness of the benefits of working at CSM among underrepresented groups , and assists in obtaining a more diverse pool of qualified applicants. Human Resources works closely with search committee chairs to ensure a diverse pool of candidates and finalists for employment and exercises oversight of hiring decisions to ensure fairness, equity and commitment to the College's value of diversity. This past year the college conducted a comprehensive compensation equity study encompassing all staff employees with one of the goals to ensure internal and external equity in pay among all groups, including racial and ethnic minority groups. The results and accompanying adjustments to salarie s confirm that salaries are internally and externally equitable across all groups. 70 Goal Promote cultural diversity learning through academic instruction and programming 1. NSF ATE Grant for Cyber Business : The primary objective of this project is to incorporate a business curriculum and concentration into CSM's Cybersecurity A.A.S degree program. The second objective is to ensure that we recruit, retain, and graduate students who are presently underrepresented within the Cybersecurity profession and that we do so in a climate of connectedness and inclusivity. Recruitment efforts will be diversity -focused and impact 40 students. 2. NSF- S-STEM Scholarship : The S -STEM Scholarship is a grant provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to the College of Southern Maryland that allows CSMD to provide eligible students with scholarships that last the duration of their two -year associate's degree. These scholarships are awarded to academically talented, low -income students intending to pursue a STEM career. Along with other criteria for eligibility , students from underrepresented minority populations ( African American, Alaskan Native, American Indian/Native American, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, and Native Pacific Islander) are encouraged to apply. 3. Cultural and Global Awareness Requirement : Among other curriculum changes, last year, CSM implemented a new requirement of its graduates. Students now must take a 3-credit Cultural and Global Awareness designated course. The objective is to provide opportunities for our students to gain an increased understanding of cultures, while learning to communicate e ffectively across cultural differences in a diverse society and world. The CSM General Education Core Competency states: Recognize the importance of diverse cultures and global and historical perspectives. Courses in this category support the examination of multicultural societies or peoples and help engender a richer understanding of the diverse life experiences of societal groups. Societal groups are identified, but not limited to - race, class, gender, ethnicity, language, and religious orientation. Other Efforts to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness 1. Global Initiatives Committee - Held a program on each campus celebrating native Nepalese culture where students and faculty participate in events. 2. Faculty Diversity Institute - Holds two faculty discussion per Academic Year, one in January and one in May. The group selects two diversity books and holds a days -long discussion twice per academic year about issues related to an inclusive classroom and diversity awareness on campus. 3. CSM hosted the MCCCADA Conference (state wide) , which held sessions/workshops related to diversity: Allyship and Advocacy conducted by Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Description: This a discussion -based training that allows us to identify our conscious and unconscious biases in order to become better allies. Using Diversity and Inclusion Language to Reach Everyone by Presenter: Dr. George Ojie-Ahamiojie, Department Head and Professor of Hospitality Management of Wor- Wic Community College. Description: Thro ugh this presentation, participants will 71know and understand that diversity attributes range from human differences such as age, gender, sex, education, social status, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, and physical abilities and attributes. Inclusive communication is the ability to highlight these diversity attributes, and use them to effectively communicate with different individuals at both private and social environments. Inclusive communication does not use judgment to communicate, but actively and intently uses proper language and labeling, as well as affirmative language to communicate with everyone regardless of diversity attributes the individual possesses. 4. The Student Life and Athletics Department, in conjunction with the Student Associations, hosted the following programs and activities a. Native American Heritage Celebration b. Around the World in 90 Minutes - Featured food and information about traditions and culture from Japan, Brazil and Germany c. Hispanic Heritage Month: Publication on 25 Influential Figures of Our Time d. Black History Month: Publication - 25 Influential Figures of Our Time e. Black History Month Q&A with Dr. Fain f. National Coming Out Day g. Gay Prom: Hosted first SA/CSM sponsored Gay Prom h. Formation of fir st CSM LGBTQI A Advisory Committee i. Conducted 8 Safe Zone trainings (in partnership with Counseling Services) j. Hosted LGBTQIA Regional Conference Hate Based Crimes : Hate based crimes are reported to Public Safety. If the hate - based incident is a crime, it is reported to the local Police and the office of Institutional Equity and Diversity. If the crime involves students, the incident is reported to Student Conduct. Human Resources are contacted if incident involves an employee. An investigation occurs when a report is made and in conjunction with the Police investigation. Hate based crime reports are given the same priority as Title IX reports and immediate response occurs to ensure the safety of the college community. Sanctions are imposed for hate based crime. A daily crime log is maintained and posted in the Public Safety Offices. 72Commun ity College of Baltimore County FY2020 Cultural Diversity Plan CCBC is committed to providing an environment supportive of our diverse population of students, faculty and staff. The college has endeavored over the past decade to develop a number of distinct initiatives reflective of the diverse communities we serve. The FY2020 C ultural Dive rsity Plan details successful efforts to date and outlines specific goals and plans for the coming year to ensure a welcoming environment for all faculty, students, and staff. Section I revi ews CCBC's Strategic Plan as it relates to cultural diversity. Section II present s current statistics regarding the diversity of CCBC's students, faculty and staff. Section III outlines specific programs and initiatives planned for FY 2020. Section IV discusses CCBC policies and procedures on hate crime reporting. Data tables are included in the appendix. SECTION I: CCBC'S COMMITMENT TO CULTURAL DIVERSITY CCBC's commitment to cultural diversity is interwoven within the goals and values of the college's Strategic Plan. Our Mission is to \" ...transform lives by providing an accessible, affordable and high quality education that prepares students for transfer and career success, strengthens the regional workforce, and enriches our community.\" To satisfy that mission, CCBC emphasizes the need for an awareness of cultural diversity in everything that we do. In our Strategic Plan, CCBC commits to nine values . Two values, in particular , relate to cultural diversity: Inclusiveness : We value the diversity of people, cultures, ideas and viewpoints and honor the dignity of all persons. We are committed to preparing students to be active citizens , ready to meet the challenges of an increasing diverse world and a challenging global marketplace. Collaboration : We foster continuous dialogue among students, faculty and staff and support ongoing cooperative relationships with our partners in the community regarding their educational, cultural, and recreational and workforce needs. At CCBC, diversity includ es, but i s not limited to, race/ ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical ability, religion, gender identity and national origin. Our policies and practices are informed by Mary Lodens' work on the various dimensions of cultural diversity. \"The goal fo r an organization is to create an environment where, regardless of one's diversity profile, everyone feels welcomed and where everyone's skills are leveraged. I can also demonstrate through my behavior that I am interested in showing respect, including others in activities, cooperating rather than competing to accomplish goals and taking responsibility for building a comfortable, diversity-positive environment.\" 1 Student success is CCBC's primary goal . The college believes that diversity and cultural awareness play an important role in helping students achieve their goals, both in and out of the classroom. At - 1 Dean, Barbara and Lou, Kimberly. As quoted in Signs of Change - Global Diversity Puts New Spin on Loden's Diversity Wheel. http://www.loden.com/Web_Stuff/Articles_ -_Videos_- _Survey/Entries/2010/9/3_Global_Diversity_Puts_New_Spin_on_Lodens_Diversity_Wheel.html 73risk student populations are a particular focus of efforts to recruit and retain students. Curriculum is reviewed to ensure that diverse viewpoints are encouraged. Outside the classroom, CCBC has developed a wide range of programs to encourage all students to feel comfortable and engaged on campus . CCBC continues to recruit and retain a diverse faculty and staff. The college is committed to a supportive environment for our employees. CCBC also recognizes that a diverse w orkforce shows our community that CCBC is a diverse and welcoming environment. SECTION II: TRENDS AND CURRENT STATUS Students CCBC's student population is diverse in terms of race/ethnicity, gender and age. In FY2018 our total student population was 44.0% White, , 5.4% Asian, and 5.6% Hispanic/Latino.2 CCBC is more diverse than Baltimore County, which in 2017 was 57.2% White and 28.5% African -American/Black .3 Our credit student body has remained racially diverse as total enrollments have fallen in recent years . In the period FY2014-FY2018, students of color increased from 53.0% to 57.2% of the credit student body. African -American/Black enrollment was 38.7% in 2014, increased to 39.2% in 2016 and in 2018 returned to 38.7%. Asian students increased 6.0% to 8.0% of all credit students. Hispanic /Latino students increased from 4.2% to 5.7% of credit students. White enrollment has declined from 46.7% of students in FY2014 to 42.3% in FY2018. While race and gender data on Continuing Education students was incomplete in the past, data collect ion has improved. In FY 2018, 83.1% of students reported race information. Of those that reported, 44.5% were students of color. African-Americans were 27.4% of our Continuing Education students, while Whites were 45.5%. CCBC is also diverse in terms of gender. In FY 2018, female students made up 52.8% of enrolled students. Credit students are 60.0% female, while Continuing Education students are 46.9 % female. In FY2018, the number of Continuing Education students who did not report a gender increased to 14.5%, from 6.1% the year before. This appears to be a data collection i ssue that we are address ing. Analysis of race and gender show areas where CCBC can be more diverse. African - American/Black students are more female than male, when compared to other groups. Considering just credit students, our African-A merican/Black population is 64.8% female, compared to 57.2% for Whites and 60.0% for CCBC as a whole. 4 CCBC has several initiatives directed toward improved recruitment, r etention and success of African -American/Black males . CCBC is open to a wide range of ages, from students still in K -12 to retirees.5 The average age for credit students is 27.9 years old and 46.6 years old for Continuing Education students. Recent 2 Appendix Table 1 has race and gender information for all CCBC students. Table 2 has race and gender information for Credit students. Table 3 has race and gender information for Continuing Education students. 3 See appendix Table 8 for Baltimore County population by race. 4 See appendix tables 1c, 2c, 3c for combined race and gender information. 5 See appendix Table 4 for information on age groups for Credit and Continuing Education students. 74trends have shown growth in th e number of credit students 17 or younger, due to expanded Early College high school enrollment opportunities at CCBC. In FY 2018, 628 students were 17 or younger, compared to 205 in FY 2014. The increase is particularly notable since overall CCBC enrollments declined during the period. Employees CCBC considers a diverse workforce an important part of its overall commitment to diversity. CCBC employees are somewhat less diverse than the racial/ ethnic makeup of Baltimore County. Full- time employees were 33.8 % persons of color in F all 2018, comparable to 41.2% for the overall Baltimore County population.6 African -American/Black employees are 25.4% of CCBC's full-time employees, compared to 28.5% of the Bal timore County population in 2017.7 Hispanic/Latino employees are 2.5 % of CCBC full-time employees, but make up 5.5% of the county population. Asians were 3.4 % of the CCBC workforce, less than the 6.3% of the Baltimore County population. CCBC employees are 62.9 % female. Baltimore County is 52.6% female. Diversity among CCBC faculty members is an important goal. The college recognizes the value of a diverse faculty for its students, workforce and community. The composition of the faculty has not yet reached the college's diversity goal , but has improved in the last five yea rs. Over the past 10 years CCBC has focused on recruit ing a more diverse faculty. Since 2009, f aculty of color have increased from 17.7% to 26.8% in 2018. In that time period, African -American/Black faculty increased from 12.0% to 16.6%. In terms of gender diversity , CCBC faculty are reflective of the student population: 60.4% female in 2018, comparable to 60.0% female for our credit student population. Non-faculty staff is more diverse than faculty. In Fall 2018, non- faculty staff were 37.2 % persons of color, compared to 26.8 % for faculty.8 Support staff at CCBC is the most diverse group of employees, at 41.6% persons of color, followed by professional staff (34.3 %) and administrative employees ( 22.6%) , a small group of only 62 employees. SECTION III: FY20 20 DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES CCBC has implemented a wide range of programs, policies and initiatives to promote cultural diversity for students, staff and the community. Section III discusses the major activities the college has undertaken in the last few years and the new initiatives developed for the coming year. Programs are intended for students, staff and the community we serve. Some activities take place in the classroom, while others occur outside of class. Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs CCBC believe s that faculty and staff training is an integral part of achieving student success. The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) serves as a focal point for faculty professional development. The center offers individual workshops, courses of study, programs, consultations, coaching and mentoring programs to assist faculty and staff in understanding cultural 6 See Table 5 for race and gender information on full -time employees. 7 See Table 8 for Baltimore County race population data. 8 See Table 7 for race and employment category data. 75diversity. CETL has developed an outstanding framework for providing culturally diverse training for full and part- time faculty. CCBC's Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning program (CRT -L) is designed to help faculty and staff develop a learning environment appropriate for a diverse student population. The CRT -L program is delivered in a number of formats, designed for different populations. The CRT- L Seminar provides 24 hours of training for participants over an 8-day period. The specific goals of this training are: (a) To develop faculty understanding of the nature of race and culture, including expressions of race and culture by the students with whom they work; (b) To positively affect faculty's interaction with students by training faculty to manage racial and cultural elements of classroom social exchange; and (c) To improve student success by developing faculty's ability to respond to cultural and racial needs and expectations of the particular students with whom they work. In addition to the CRT-L Seminar, CCBC offers a series of two hour CRT- L Workshops. The workshop series is open to all staff, but is particularly targeted to adjunct faculty. There are currently four modules in the CRT-L Workshop series : Meanings of Culture and Race, Mindsets and Culture, Overcoming Stereotype Threat, and Social Capital and Learning. CRT -L training is also incorporated into the annual events and conferences that faculty and staff attend during the year. CRT -L training and topic discussions are offered at many of our annual events, including Professional Developmental Day, Fall Focus, Developmental and General Education Symposium and the Teaching and Learning Fair. CCBC has partnered with other colleges in the state to advance culturally responsive teaching. The college has hosted the Culturally Responsive Teaching Conference for the last five years . The conference typically hosts 180-250 participants, drawn from colleges across the country, K-12 schools and CCBC faculty and staff. In 2018 a new element was added to the CRT- L Conference, in the form of a 1-day Institute in a train -the-trainers model. Through this institute, CCBC has begun to spread the CRT-L work that we have been doing to other colleges and universities (and in one instance, a high school) who are interested in our model. FY2020 Goals for Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs Offer the CRT -L Seminar to 15 previously untrained CCBC faculty and professional staff. Offer the CRT -L Workshop modules to 40 previously untrained adjunct faculty. Provide CRT- L training to CCBC student leaders and student organizations. Host the FY2020 Culturally Responsive Teaching Conference for about 250 participants drawn from throughout the country. Provide CRT -L training to Johns Hopkins University faculty Continue to offer the CRT- L Institute. The Institute will offer a day of training in the CRT concepts CCBC has developed. 76 Curricular Initiatives Promoting Cultural Diversity A few years ago, CCBC reviewed and revised its General Education program to include l ocal and global diversity among the seven General Education goals. Course curricula are now required to help students develop knowledge and skills to participate effectively in evolving multicultural contexts and to address the challenges in building just, equitable, and productive societi es. The Global Education Initiative promotes inclusion of global and cultural awareness into the curriculum. CCBC has established a Global Education Advisory Board (GEAB) , which develops study abroad opportunities for students, promotes participation in world language courses, and increases opportunities for course projects, service learning and learning communities with a concentration on global and cultural understanding. The Global Education program also offers multiple activities during International Education Week, promotes courses with increased global content, and coordinates intercultural dialog among students. GEAB in partnership with the Office of International Student Services and the Office of Intercultural Engagement established a committee that will focus on increasing the visibility and prominence of CCBC's international initiatives, with an emph asis on student recruitment, retention and success . In 2018, CCBC opened the Center for Global Education in the Hilton Center on the Catonsville campus. The center is designed as a hub for students, faculty and staff to gain knowledge about global issues (workshops, seminars, classes) and to house a growing number of resources for students and faculty related to study abroad experiences. FY2020 Goals for Curricular Initiatives Promoting Cultural Diversity Continue to market the Global Education certificate to enroll 30 new students. Increase short -term study abroad programs and opportunities for students to experience a global world. Continue to support faculty travel abroad through Faculty International Travel ( FIT) grants, so that faculty may enhance the global nature of their clas ses. Programs for Retaining At- Risk Students CCBC recognizes that many students are from at -risk populations. Community colleges are often the initial higher education experience for first generation college students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and minority students. CCBC has developed programs to recruit and retain at -risk students so they can achieve their goals. CCBC's Male Student Success Initiative (MSSI) is a keystone in our efforts to retain at- risk students. The MSSI is intended to increase the persistence rate and improve academic standing of male students at CCBC, primarily students of color and athletes. Services include proactive academic support, the development of emotional maturity and social skills, training in financial literacy, and referral to resources in and outside the college community. The MSSI extends CCBC's existing high -impact practices to include skill-building workshops, study hall and collaborative activities, intrusive academic advising and mentoring to support male students. 77As part of MSSI, CCBC has continued to expand its student orientation course, Academic Development: Transitioning to College (ACDV101), with sections reserved for African American males. These ACDV101 sections are facilitated by faculty who have completed the Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT -L) professional development training. In FY2019, MDRC partnered with CCBC through the Men of Color College Achievement (MoCCA) Project to refine and evaluate ACDV 101 for Male Students of Color and the Male Student Success Initiative (ACDV - MSSI). ACDV-MSSI improves academic outcomes for male students of color by aiding them in developing a supportive network of CCBC faculty and administrators. The MoCCA Project consists of a randomized controlled t rial impact study to detect the effects of ACDV -MSSI on academic outcomes. In FY2019, Baltimore County Public Schools and CCBC opened Baltimore County's first Pathways in Technology Early College High School Program (P- TECH) s chool. A cohort of 60 students, largely low income and minority, enrolled at Dundalk High School in Fall 2018, and in six years or less, P -TECH students will have the opportunity to graduate with a high school diploma and a two- year associate degree at no cost. Tuition, books and fees are all covered by the P- TECH Program, which will also provide students mentoring, workplace visits, paid summer internships and first in-line consideration for job openings with KCI Technologies, Stanley Black & Decker, Alba n CAT and Whiting Turner Construction. CCBC collaborated with Campus Compact Mid- Atlantic, Reading Partners and Baltimore City Schools to implement the CCBC Pathways to College, Career and Civic Readiness Project (PC3R) and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) College Preparation Intervention Program (CPIP). The PC3R project supported the implementation of the Pathways general studies mentoring program and high- impact practices and expanded CCBC's partnerships with Greater Baltimore Title I schools. As a national l eader, CCBC continues to design innovative approaches to Developmental Education. Data analysis has shown that at-risk students and students of color continued to benefit from Accelerated Learning Progr ams in English, reading, and mathematics, enabling students to quickly become college ready \u2014and move into college level \"gateway\" courses. CCBC scaled up accelerated courses in the three disciplines to afford more students opportunities to take developmental and credit -bearing courses as co -requisites. FY2020 Goals for Programs for Retaining At-Risk Students Increase Communication Studies (CMNS) and English (ENGL) course sections included in the Diversity/Global Learning High Impact Practices I nitiative (HIPS) . Continued Partner ship with MDRC through the Men of Color College Achievement (MoCCA), Project to refine and evaluate ACDV 101 for Male Students of Color and the Male Student Success Initiative (ACDV -MSSI) Continued collaboration with Baltimore C ounty Public Schools to deliver a Pathways in Technology Early College High School at Dundalk High School. Cultural Diversity and Campus Life Programs at CCBC Within the Office of College Life, the Student Life Office and the Office of Intercultural Engagement (OIE) are responsible for promoting diversity outside the classroom, cultivating cultural awareness and appreciation for diversity, increasing access and equity for historically 78underrepresented groups and improving CCBC's educational climate as an inclusive and civil community. The Student Life office and the Office of Intercultural Engagement offer academic, social, and cultural support and programs for the entire college community. CCBC does this through programs, annual events, speaker series, book discussions, college sponsored clubs and organizations and other activities. The Office of Intercultural Engagement serves as chair of the CCBC Hate/Bias Incident Response Team commissioned by M aryland Higher Education C ommission to provide instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff to enhance cultural diversity programming and sensitivity. The team developed a plan for the next two years, beginning with Restorative Practices Training during year one . The training provided practical skills to equip students, faculty and staff with the ability to facilitate and participate in difficult conversations , promote and encourage civility in classrooms and community settings, and identify practices that can be incorporated o n a broader scale in offices and departments, such as Human Resources, Office of Student Conduct and Department of Public Safety. CCBC sponsors a range of programs, which facilitates conversation among students, faculty, staff and the community on issues important to cultural diversity. Each semester a new college wide workgroup is formed to read and discuss the book Courageous Conversations About Race: A Field Guide for Achieving Equity in Schools by Glenn Singleton. Members also write their racial autobiography and discuss issues on race, its impact on our lives as well as its impact on the CCBC community. The Office of Intercultural Engagement has developed Mosaic Talks which are offered as in and out of class seminars, workshops, and presentations to build awareness, appreciation, and allyship to diverse student populations and communities. Faculty who find it difficult to broach important yet sensitive cultural issues with students can schedule a Mosaic Talks with O ffice of Intercultural Engagement, to bring issues of diversity, social justice and equity directly into their classroom. Topics range from religious diversity, microaggressions, language variances and codeswitching, LGBT Q and privilege and intersectionality. The Student Life office has developed the Civility Campaign. As part of this campaign, all first- year students in the Student O rientation Course are shown videos to help them understand how to interact with others on campus. The college also uses a website, Lessons on Civility, Culture and Race, for students to learn about their own cultural values and how those values influence points of view and interactions with others. Through the Spotlight Speaker Series , CCBC invites to our campuses speakers who raise awareness about a wide range of topics, present various perspectives and promote values clarification. Over the past several years speakers have included: Cory B ooker (United States Senator ), Nikki Giovanni (renowned poet and writer), and David K. Shipler (author of The Working Poor: Invisible in America). The President's Distinguished African American Lecture Series is an annual event the President hosts during Black History Month to honor the life and work of a nationally recognized African -American citizen. Previous guest lecturers have included: Tarana Burke (activist and founder of the 'me too' movement), Jeff Johnson (journalist),Wes Moore (community advocate), MacArthur Scholar Dr. Lisa Delpit, and Isabel Wilkerson (Pulitzer Prize winner). 79CCBC incorporates many awareness events in to its annual calendar , including Black History Month in February; National Disability Awareness month in October; and International Education Week in November . CCBC also celebrates National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Women's His tory Month, Gay and Lesbian History Month and Native American Heritage Month. CCBC sponsors a college-wide book discussion each year through the Community Book Connection (CBC), open to students, faculty and staff. The goals of this interdisciplinary liter acy program are to enhance student and community learning, to strengthen our common human bonds, and to demonstrate the vital connection between classroom learning and social issues in the broader community. Students are urged to read the book and faculty members are encouraged to include it in their courses. A series of cultural and academic activities \u2014film screenings, theatrical performances, dance and musical concerts, debates, panel discussions, and lectures\u2014 are organized to support the project. The book for FY2019 was Homegoing, by Yaa Gyasi. Among its many its accolades is the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for 2017. Another major e ffort to promote a rich multicultural student experience is through sponsored clubs and organizations. CCBC requires that sponsored clubs be open to all students, banning discrimination on the basis of race, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation or national origin. Among the many recognized clubs that promote and reflect diversity are the African Student Union; American Sign Language Club; Black Student Union; Civic Engagement Rainbow Club, Society of Intersectional Feminists; Student Government Association; Students with Disabilities Club; Women's Initiative for Su ccess and Education (W.I.S.E.); and the Veterans Student Associations. CCBC continues its partnership with the Kettering Foundation. It is a nonprofit foundation rooted in the American tradition of cooperative research. National Issues Forum guides are used to guide the use of the deliberative process. Students look at the costs and consequences of possible solutions to daunting problems, and finding out what we, as a people, will or will not accept as a solution. CCBC has also reestablished its partners hip with Maryland Public Television (MTV) and PBS, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by viewing Independent Lens documentaries. These films are by independent filmmakers from across the country address some of the most important issues of our time, including Native history and culture, access to healthcare, early childhood education, and community organizing and policing. CCBC also promotes A lternative Spring Break programs, which offer students educational and service opportunities in and outside the country. Students interact with different cultures and gain an awareness and understanding of cross- cultural differences. Students have traveled to South Dakota, Maine, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras among other locations. CCBC professional staff are active members of the Latino Providers Network. The Latino Providers Network manages and coordinates a membership community base umbrella organization with over 70 organizations and 200 individual members that provide direct services to the Latino community in the Baltimore Metropolitan Region in the areas of health, education, immigration, business, employment, arts and culture. 80FY2020 Goals on Cultural Diversity and Campus Life Programs Each semester assemble a new cohort of faculty and staff to read and discuss Courageous Conversations About Race: A Field Guide for Achieving Equity in Schools by Glenn Singleton. Increase the number of students attending the orientation program which includes training on civility to help students understand how to interact with others on campus. Celebrate and program events for Black History Month, National Disability Awareness month, International Education Week, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Women's History Month, Gay and Lesbian History Month and Native American Heritage Month. Continue the Spotlight Speaker Series by scheduling at least two speakers who raise awareness and promote values clarification. Select and host a prominent African American for the President's Distinguished African American Lecture Series . Expand the offering of Mosaic Talks to include various workshops and conversations. Provide programming to support the Community Book Connection for FY2020 : Threads from the Refugee Crisis by Kate Evans. Special Services for Diverse or Unique Student Populations The Enrollment and Student Services division provides support for special student populations. These contextualized services increase access and equity for historically under represented groups and improve CCBC's educational climate as an inclusive and civil community. Students with Disabilities CCBC is committed to th e philosophy of non- discrimination for individuals with disabilities. The Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) provides assistance to stu dents with disabilities so they have an equal opportunity to participate in all of our programs, events, activities and services. Among the services provided are sign language interpreters, accommodated testing and note takers. Services are available to both credit and non -credit s tudents. DSS also verifies that the college is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and all other regulatory requirements. Each year, CCBC holds Transition Day, a program in partnership with Baltimore County Public schools that provides information to high school students with learning challenges on transitioning from high school to college. Events held on our Essex and Catonsville campuses hosted approximately 100 students. CCBC also collaborated in the grant funded Pathways project, which provides comprehensive support to individuals with autism enrolled at CCBC. The program has a capacity for 20 students and is expected to be funded for the next several years. DSS pr ovides training to our fa culty and staff on how to im prove accessibility and create an inclusive environment for students with disabilities. These training sessions are held during our annual Fall Focus and Teaching and Learning Fair. DSS works with each department to discuss disability issues to address the unique needs, experie nces and challenges they may have in meeting the needs of students with disabilities. In 2018, we have added training for our public safety officers on working with students with disabilities. National Disa bility Awareness Month, held in October, is a national awareness campaign with the goal of educating the public about disability issues and celebrating the many contributions of people with disabilities. CCBC holds events on our campuses to promote awareness for faculty and students. 81LGBTQ Students CCBC has established an LGBTQ Online Resource Center to support the college's LGBTQ population. The Online Resource center includes resources at CCBC as well as links to national organizations. Efforts to support LGBTQ students are coordinated thr ough the Office of Intercultural Engagement and the Sexual Minorities Advocacy Committee (S.M.A.C). The mission of the CCBC Sexual Minorities Advocacy Committee (SMAC) is to promote awareness of LGBTQ issues, and to provide strategies, methods, and educational opportunities to the CCBC community in order to create a more inclusive, welcoming and supportive environment. Each campus has staff available for LGBTQ students to turn to for help. The P.R.I.S.M. [Proudl y Rallying Behind the Intersectionality of Social Minorities (formerly the Gay Students Alliance)] is among the many student organizations sponsored by CCBC. Safe Zone training sessions provides members of the CCBC community to serve as allies to the LGBTQ student community. CCBC has a Preferred Name policy, available to students and staff. The preferred name is used where available and appropriate, except where the use of a legal name is required. International Students International students are supported through the International Student Services Office (ISS). Services include help with applying to CCBC, college level assessment and placement testing , and assistance in maintaining visa requirements. ISS also helps students adjust to life in the Baltimore area with resources on finding housing and transportation. International students can also find support with student organizations, such as the African Student Union, International Student Association and the Muslim Student Association. CCBC along with institutions across the United States and around the world also hosts events throughout International Education Week, which is a platform to recognize international students, education abroad, and internationalization. FY2020 Goals on Special Services for Diverse or Unique Student Populations Continue to support students with disabilities with special services and classroom supports. Continue to host College Transition events for students with unique needs as they transition from high school to college. Continue to host International Education Week Offer additional Safe Zone training sessions in the coming year. Train 10-15 additional faculty and staff. Add to the Safe Zone training work series by creating Brave & Safe Space training workshops for faculty and staff for the underrepresented groups such as Student Veterans, Undocumented Students and Student Victims of Human Trafficking. Increase the number of International students supported through the Internation al Student Services Office. Promote the Campaign Against Hate and Bias Increase the number of Mosaic Talks presented in classrooms Continue to offer and expand enrollment in the English Language Learner Summer Bridge Program 82Sexual Har assment CCBC is committed to maintaining a learning and working environment for students, faculty, and staff that is free of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is contrary to the standards of the college community, and is a barrier to fulfilling the college's academic mission. Education and awareness are essential to CCBC's efforts against sexual harassment including sexual assault, and the college provides educational materials and programs. Education efforts include the on-going discussion of the sexual harassment policy and an understanding of what constitutes sexual harassment, procedures for addressing alleged sexual harassment, and methods for prevention of sexual harassment. Educational programs are held for new students, faculty and staff members. Ongoi ng educational programs are also held for faculty, staff, and students. The college encourages reporting and seeks to remove any barriers to reporting by making the procedures for reporting transparent and straightforward. The college recognizes that an i ndividual who has been drinking or using drugs at the time of the incident may be hesitant to report an incident because of discipline consequences for his/her/their own conduct. An individual who reports sexual misconduct, either as a complainant or a third party witness, will not be subject to disciplinary action by the college for his/her/their own personal consumption of alcohol or drugs at or near the time of the incident, provided that any such violations did not and do not place the health or safety of any other person at risk. The college may initiate an educational discussion or pursue other educational remedies reg arding alcohol or other drugs. The amnesty policy applies only to the CCBC student conduct process. Increasing the Diversity of CCBC's Employees CCBC recognizes the value of a diverse work force that is reflective of our students and of the community it serves, and the college is committed to welcoming, respecting, and embracing the differences and similarities of employees and students. Each member of the college community is responsible and held accountable for fostering a climate of acceptance, inclusion, respect, and dignity of all persons. CCBC is committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination and harassment of any nature including, but not limited to, racial, religious, sexual orientation, age, gender, national origin, ancestry, veteran status, disability, or any other type of harassment. Harassment is unwanted verbal, physical, or visual conduct relating to an individual's race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran status, or disability. All employees are required to attend Sexual Misconduct Prevention Training annually. Training for supervisors, including New Manager Orientation, provides instruction in non- discriminatory human resources practices, procedures and policies. Ongoing leadership developmental provides an opportunity for faculty and staff with supervisory responsibility to strengthen their competence in managing a diverse workforce. Workshops include topics aimed at managing a multi- generational workforce, conducting equitable internal investigations, coaching employees for success, building trust, managing difficult conversations, and teambuilding. The President's Leadership Academy, a training program for future CCBC leaders, also includes sessions on Human R esources policies and procedures and CCBC's commitment to a diverse workplace. CCBC is committed to ensuring equal opportunity and non-dis crimination in all of its hiring and employment practices. The college has policies and procedures in place to ensure that search and 83hiring practices promote a diverse workforce. These include policies and procedures that ensure positions are advertised in a wide variety of publications and media outlets, and that notices of openings are in traditional and non-traditional forums, including college sponsored job fairs and job fairs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's). The racial and gender diversity of our employees is regularly reviewed and strategies are developed to address underutilization of women and minorities. Procedur es have been developed to ensure a pool of qualified minority candidates. All applicants for administrative, faculty, and classified positions are screened by a search committee that represents a diverse group of college employees under the direction of a Search Committee Chair and a trained Search Specialist. In FY2017, the Human Resources department developed a process to obtain more detailed information from employees and job applicants with disabilities and those who are veterans of the U.S. military. Search committees are required to document that the review of applicants, selection of candidates and candidate interviews were conducted in a non-discriminatory manner. CCBC proactively took steps to remove barriers to employment for qualified workers wit h criminal records, specifically by removing the criminal c onviction history question from the job application\u2014a reform commonly known as \"ban the box.\" The Human Resources departmen t is available to work with employees about workplace conflict and to assure that any complaints of discrimination or unfair treatment are investigated and addressed. Policies and procedures for reporting any issues are included in the employee handbook and are also included on the CCBC employee website. FY2020 Goals on Increasing the Diversity of CCBC's Employees Provide sexual misconduct prevention training to all employees. Monitor compliance with the annual training requirement. Continue to attend local Job Fairs to recruit employees including employees of color, women, veterans and persons with disabilities. Provide s earch specialist training for CCBC staff. Train 10 additional search specialists. Assure recruitment outreach to diverse populations by advertising available positions in a wide range of venues including Monster.com, M ilitary.com, Hire Disability Solutions, Maryland Workforce Exchange, Department of Veterans Affairs, Local Univer sities and Community Colleges, D iverseeducation.com, Diversity Jobs.com , Connect Network, Hispanic Outlook, Latin Opinion, Afro -American , and Higher Education Research Consortium. SECTION IV. CAMPUS PROCESS FOR THE REPORTING OF HATE -BASED CRIMES Reporting incidences of hate crimes are addressed under the Jeanne Cleary Disclosure of Campus Crime Statistics Act (Cleary Act) as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA). At CCBC, t he Department of Public Safety (DPS) works to create and maintain a secure campus climate and to protect personal and college assets. All public safety information required by the Jeanne Clery Disclo sure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act may be found on the Public Safety website at http://www.ccbcmd.edu/Campus- Life-and-Activities/Public -Safety.aspx . 84Officers investigate and report all crimes and incidents that come to their attention. CCBC's public safety staff also works closely with the Baltimore County Police Department and will ask for its assistance when needed or when requested by a victim of a crime. The DPS and Baltimore County Police Department work cooperatively under a Memorandum of Understanding that specifies roles and responsibilities for both agencies. Each public s afety officer receives 16 hours of in-service training annually, which i s four times the number of hours mandated by the State of Maryland. Officers are trained in offense definition, report classification and criminal investigation. Officers are routinely updated on changes to county, state and federal law, and receive peri odic training on sexual assault, hate and bias crimes, dating and domestic violence, stalking and harassment. The Department of Public Safety is staffed by full and part-time uniformed public safety officers 24 hours a day. Each full- time public safety officer is commissioned by the state of Maryland as a Special Police Officer and has full police powers (including powers of arrest) through the statutory and common law of Maryland. The college provides timely security alerts to the college community reg arding offenses or incidents that are reported to campus Public Safety offices, college administrators or local police, and which may represent a threat to students and employees, through Campus Alert, CCBC e- mail, voice mail, and text messaging. Students, faculty, and staff are automatically placed in the alert database when they register for a course, or receive a paycheck from the college. Family and community members may opt-in to Campus Alert. College policy dictates that all crimes or emergencies be reported directly to the Department of Public Safety by calling 443-840-1111. A report may also be made to any college employee (known as a Campus Security Authority) who has a significant interest in student safety, such as a faculty member, dean or director, coach, advisor or other campus official. Any college member who is a victim of a serious crime is also encouraged to report the incident to the Baltimore County Police Department by calling 911 (for emergencies). The Department of Public Safety will investigate and document all crimes in accordance with college policy. 85Commu nity College of Baltimore County FY2020 Cultural Diversity Plan Table 1 a - Race Trends for All Students FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 Race Count % Count % Count % Count % Count % African 0.3% 198 0.3% 195 0.3% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 105 0.2% 113 0.2% 114 0.2% FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 Gender Count % Count % Count % Count % Count % annual fiscal year enrollment files.

INTRODUCTION Frederick Community College (FCC) is a public community college located in the second largest city and the largest agricultural producing county in the state of Maryland. Since 1957, FCC has prepared an increasingly diverse student body to complete their goals of workforce preparatio n, transfer, career development, and personal enric hment . FCC values learning, innovation, diversity, excellence, communit y, integrity, and as described in the College vision statement , \"seeks to transform individuals and communities through learning .\" FCC is a mid -sized institution with close to 9,000 credit students and 7,000 continuing education and workforce development students per year. FCC students come from 75 countries, are 36% students of color, and 27% first -generation credit -seeking students. The College values being the community college in Maryland with the highest graduation and/or transfer rates for students, II. DEFINING AND AFFIRMING DIVERSITY An a ppreciation of diversity and inclusion empowers us to collectively acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of all members of the College community . Diversity i s defined in the College strategic plan, FCC 2020, as \"human differences that affect the success of students, staff, and members of the community. \" Inclusion is involvement and empowerment, where the inherent worth and dignity of all people are recognized. As an institution, we are fully committed to the value of inclusive excellence ; that to be excellent , we must be inclusive. An inclusive institution promotes and sustains a sense of belonging. I t values and practices respect for the talents, beliefs, backgrounds, and ways of living of the members of the College community . FCC aspires to be a leader in the state and the nation fostering an environment that welcomes, supports, rewards, and challenges our community members to think big, be innovative , and lead with authenticity. Listed below are a few of the significant diversity, equity, and inclusion achievements of the institution this y ear: In 2018 -2019, the College underwent a nine -month process of developing a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan for the next five years, 2019 -2024. The plan was developed based on more than 20 stakeholder focus groups and was approved by the Board of Trustees on June 19, 2019. As is discussed more below, the plan focuses on four main domains of diversity, equity, and inclusion , and involves 29 action items that will strengthen the College in terms of equity and inclusion. The College implemented a College -wide protocol for hate -bias incidents and began officially tracking incidents in February 2019. The College Academic Affairs, Continuing Education, and Workforce Development (AACEWD) Master Plan 201 9-2024 also centered the develop ment of cultural and global competencies in our faculty, staff, and students as essential for academic excellence. In 201 8-2019, the College expanded the professional development offerings to faculty and staff around issues of equity, inclusion , and diversity including over 3 0 in-depth opportunities to engage all employees on difficult diversity topics (in 2017 -2018, the 106Pg. 03 Frederick Community College 3 College offered 20 opportunities) including the second summer institute for faculty focused on culturally responsive teaching . The President' s Diversity Advisory Council (PDAC), a College -wide diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) leadership group, met monthly and focused on four main areas of leadership capacity building. These areas included reviewing the research on the value and meaning of DEI for higher education , building and benchmarking a climate of inclusion, and understanding the institutional, local, and national laws, polic ies, and history that frame promising practices in the area of DEI. III. INSTITUTIONAL PLAN TO IMPROVE CULTURAL DIVERSITY As part of the priorities over this past year set by the FCC Board of Trustees , the College underwent a process of developing a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strategic Plan for the next five years . This plan seeks to focus the DEI efforts during the next five years toward four primary goals determined to be realistic, necessary, and in alignment with our values and aspirations as a College community. The goals include: 1. Increase access and success for traditionally underreprese nted students 2. Increase recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce 3. Prepare students for an increasingly diverse community, workforce, and world 4. Ensure a more welcoming and inclusive learning and workplace environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors Under each of these goals , there are specific, measurable, and realistic action items for the next five years. The participatory process with students, faculty, staff, and community members helped the College community to reflect on how the Colle ge is living up to the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and where and how the College can be better. The plan is informed by those documented strengths and struggles, an internal environmental scan, a review of our regional peer institutions, as well as the empirically researched best practices in higher education, specifically at community colleges. The FCC Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2019 -2024 builds on the strengths of the College and targets the highest impact changes that will strengthen FCC for all students, faculty, and staff. The Plan reemphasizes the institutional commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Timelines and Metrics of Success ensure that we continue to make progress toward creating a College cultu re of inclusion, which addresses our challenges and seizes opportunities for innovation. Some of the planned action items include : implementing specific targeted interventions to close the gaps in access and success for racial/ethnic minority students ; an evaluation of our hiring practices to make sure we are hiring the best candidates from the most diverse backgrounds ; enhancing employee development ; strengthening our employee retention efforts ; and preparing our students to be successful in Frederick County and beyond. 107Pg. 04 Frederick Community College 4 IV. EFFORTS TO INCREASE NUMERICAL REPRESENTATION OF TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS Focus on Students FCC has devoted considerable time, attention, and effort to increasing and retaining students of color . As Table 1 illustrates, the percenta ge of credit students of color has increased 11.4% during the past five years . However , headcount enrollment of this population has decreased by 3.8% from fall 2017 -2018. This decline is slightly higher (3.5%) than the general population . Currently, 3 5.6% of FCC credit students and 36.9% of continuing education (non-credit) students identify themselves as non-white students. TABLE 1. CREDIT STUDENTS BY RACE/ETHNICITY FROM 2014 -2018 FCC uses multiple promising efforts to recruit historically underrepresented populations including community -based outreach, bridge programs, pre -college programs, targeted social media outreach, economic -conscious scholarships, as well as English Language Learner (ELL) targeted outreach and scholarships. Additional s pecific recruitment and retention efforts include the following : The Parents Lead program is a scholarship and degree -pathway program at FCC that provides students who might not otherwise be able to a ttend classes due to the cost of childcare the funding and academic support to pursue a degree . The program continues to support a diverse student population . Since its inception in spring 2018, the cohort has 108Pg. 05 Frederick Community College 5 served a population made up of 100% student -parents, 96% women, and 56% students of color . The median reported household income of Parents Lead students is $30,700; 43% above the Frederick County poverty line for a family of four and 63% below the Frederick County ALICE ( Asset Limited , Income Constrained, Employed) household survival threshold for a family of four. Students in this program passed 83% of their attempted credits, withdrew from 7%, and failed 10% . The program retention rate of 92% exceeds that of the average FCC student b y 15%. Continuing Education and Workforce Development (CEWD) maintains an Outreach Committee to forge relationships with a range of community organizations and government agencies serving diverse populations in Frederick County. The goal s of the Outreach Committee are to increase awareness of its programs and the job opportunities available, to communicate opportunities for financial support through FCC and other community organizations, and build upon existing programs in community organizations to offer affordable access and support to potential students. The Outreach Committee has connected with Family Partnership, Advocates for the Homeless, Heartly House, SHIP of Frederick County (Student Homelessness Initiative Partnership) , Frederick County Public Schools ( FCPS ) LYNX (Linking Youth to New Experiences) program , and Frederick County Workforce Services , and will continue to expand outreach efforts annually. The Admissions Office coordinated events for targeted populations across the county, both on and off campus, to build connections between diverse , underrepresented communities and Frederick Community College. Targeted organizations/agencies included the Department of Social Services, Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS), Family Partnership, SHIP (Student Homelessness Initiative Partnership of Frederick County), Centro Hispano, New Horizons, S2M2 (Science, Service, Mentoring and Medicine), Maryland School for the Deaf, Gale House, Frederick Foster Care Services, Fort Detrick, Senior Living, The Ju dy Center, Transition Fairs, Carroll Creek Montessori Public Charter School, and LYNX. Admissions collaborated with the English language Learners (ELLs ) office to provide community outreach to English Language Learners and their families in Frederick County at three targeted high schools. Specific targeted outreach to multicultural students also included the Pathways to the Future Women's Conference, Commun ity Living, Student Athlete Orientation, Explore FCC Day , Bridge to FCC Pilot events, the FCPS Community Resource Fair, the International Student Festival, the Asian Lunar New Year Festival, PASS visits to public high schools, the Frederick Latino Festiva l, the Cultural Arts Fair, and the Convoy of Hope event. Admissions also participated in several large Frederick County -wide outreach events to include college fairs, The Great Frederick Fair, housing fairs, and community education fairs. FCC continues it s strong partnership with FCPS . To expand access and opportunity for college -ready high school students (particularly first generation college students, students of color, and students who participate in the Federal free and reduced meals program), the FCC Board of Trustees developed a 2018 -2019 strategic directive to create an Early College . Starting in fall 2020, the program will offer qualified high school students across the county, including students from groups historically underrepresented in 109Pg. 06 Frederick Community College 6 postsec ondary educational attainment, the opportunity to earn an associate degree and high school diploma simultaneously by attending FCC full -time during their junior and senior years . Early College students will receive a significant discount on tuition for all courses taken during the program and tuition is waived for students who are eligible for Free and Reduced Meals . Other students pay 90% of 75% of the per credit hour rate . Applications from qualified students from underrepresented groups will be supported by FCPS counselors and FCC staff, who will work on a case -by-case basis to address students' challenges around food security and transportation to campus . The College hopes to see the Early College student cohort grow in diversity over time, as has happened with the successful Open Campus and High -School Dual Enrollment programs. The Targeted ESL program at FCC had a productive year that included gains in enrollments, curriculum development, and services for ELLs in addition to community outreach and staff development. Seventy -five (75) classes served students in fiscal year 2019. Additional classes provided preparation for the TOEFL. In an effort to better meet the unique needs of Frederick County ELLs, curricula were developed for seven unique courses. Four were piloted in FY 2018 and three w ere piloted in FY 2019. Beyond new courses, ELLs were supported with new services including an ESL resource website, an ESL lab, drop -in tutoring hours, and spring and fall transitions presentations , which help students to move beyond ELL courses to credit programs . As part of community outreach efforts , onsite testing was provided to Tuscarora High School seniors in cooperation with the Testing Center, and students from FCPS were hosted on a field trip to FCC. Along with providing quality programming and support to ELLs, the Targeted ESL program supported staff development throughout the year. Instructors and staff attended institutional, local, and international trainings. Th e program created two additional administrative positions, the Adult Ed ucation and ESL Coordinator , and the Adult Education and ESL Transition Specialist to streamline processes and provide one -to-one case management support for all ELLs. Students in the T argeted ESL program benefit from strong programming, personalized guidance, and staff who have their best interests in mind. The Mid -Atlantic Center for Emergency Management (MACEM) at FCC serves as a national education and training center specializing in preparedness, planning, and partnerships . MACEM has incorporated topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion in its programming. Emergencies and disaster s are known to disproportionately affect vulnerable population groups such as women and children, those with access and functional needs, as well as non -English speaking populations . In December of 2016, the MACEM began an emergency preparedness outreach pr ogram to FCC ELL teachers and their students. Since the launch of the program, the MACEM has trained nine (9) ELL instructors in emergency preparedness train -the-trainer courses and 38 ELL students in preparedness content. Student retention, success, and graduation are a critical part of the FCC mission . In addition to the focus on inclusion and cultural responsiveness in the Diversity, Equity, 110Pg. 07 Frederick Community College 7 and Inclusion Strategic Plan , the following list includes a few of the ongoing and new retention and success initiatives: o The Office of Multicultural Student Services (MSS) provides interested students with academic and personal support, advising, and a series of activities that focus on enhancing or developing strategies for success . On average, students of color who are engaged in MSS have higher persistence and graduation rates than those who are not engaged. Students who are involved with MSS are 13.5% more likely to be retained than all other students. The purpose of the office is to help ensure a smooth transition to the College and to increase the probability of success for each participant. The office provides identity development and education beyond the classroom experience by hosting cultural engagement programming, including (but not limited to) critical thinking discussions, cultural field trips, study skills workshops, goal setting initiatives, and leadership development retreats . The program offers academic support through personal counseling, intrusive advising, comprehens ive student success alert intervention, academic action plans, and student advocacy by establishing strong mentoring relationships between students and faculty/staff. In addition , MSS provides specialized support and outreach to men and women of color in i ts Big 6 and Elite 8 programs and to high school students with its College Prep program. MSS has also worked to increase access and retention efforts through a targeted scholarship. The scholarship is available for career programs students for whom English is a second language and/or students who have demonstrated a significant financial need. In three years (2016 -2019) there was a 400% increase in the number of scholarships awarded, from four ( 4) to 20. MSS increased its intentional outreach efforts in partnership with other units at the College, including the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion (ODEI), Center for Student Engagement (CSE), and in the classrooms through faculty . MSS effectively addresses access and retention for first year students o f color through the Partnership for Achieving Student Success (PASS) program. With the success of the PASS program, the office worked in partnership with the FCC Foundation to offer a scholarship to successful PASS participants aimed to increase their pers istence and retention rates from year one to two. Within two years of offering this additional scholarship, the retention rate of PASS participants increased from 67% to 70% . o The Veteran and Military Services (VMS) department offers academic and support services for veterans and military -affiliated students enrolling at FCC. Forty -two percent (42%) of the students served in VMS are racial/ethnic minority students. VMS provides a \"One -Stop-Shop\" where students receive information and assistance in one plac e, including processing of veterans educational benefits, academic/social/personal counseling and referrals, academic and social programming, workshops , and a Veterans Center. o The Office of Adult Services (OAS) serves more than 57 % racial/ethnic minority students through its Project Forward Step (PFS) . The PFS provides intake interview and needs assessment, academic advising, career counseling, and support . PFS 111Pg. 08 Frederick Community College 8 operates from an educational case management model, encouraging mid -semester contact and conduct outreach if needed, and provides referrals to College and community organizations and resources to address student financial and personal needs. OAS offers Success Seminars up to six times per year for new (or newer) students, in which students learn from faculty and staff about time management strategies, study tips, and expectations in the classroom. The goal of OAS is to prepare students to succe ed at FCC. Students involved in OAS had higher retention rates (73.3%) compared to the general student popula tion (70%) as well as slightly higher grade point average s. o The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded the College more than $635,000 in grant funding to support the FCC STEM Scholars program . Over the next three years , 90 STEM Scholars will receiv e funding to cover all or most of the cost of attendance, be mentored by STEM faculty, participate in three one -credit learning seminars, and join a campus learning community . STEM Scholars will be open to all low-income, academically talented students who meet the criteria identified for this program . Through admissions , FCC aims to create diverse cohorts that exceed the overall population of first generation students and female students in STEM majors . The scholarship cohorts will increase the likelihood of low -income students completing a degree and entering the STEM workforce , or advancing their academic career. Through community outreach and service work , current STEM Scholars will provide prospective students from similar backgrounds with evidence that a college STEM education is a viable option. A particularly promising STEM Scholars program partner is the FCPS Young Scholars program, which serves students with advanced learning potential from student groups traditionally underrepresented in advanced academics programming , including racial/ethnic minority students. As a service activity, FCC STEM Scholars will serve as community ambassadors to the Young Scholars and other FCPS STEM programs to bridge the gap between high school and college , and help thi s community fully realize the achievement of postsecondary STEM education. o The FCC developmental math and English programming has undergone considerable reform. This initiative directly affects minority and first -generation students, as FCC data and national trends indicate that these groups are often disproportionately impacted by developmental education . As of fall 2017, developmental English courses were conde nsed from a four (4)-course sequence to a single class of either four ( 4) or six (6) credits, enabling students to move into college level English in only one semester , and with fewer credits . This was accompanied by a review of College pre and co -requisit es with the goal of expanding the number of courses students can take while completing developmental English. Developmental math as a series of stand -alone developmental courses has been almost entirely eliminated. The overwhelming majority of FCC students testing into developmental math now take 112Pg. 09 Frederick Community College 9 one (1) of three (3) college level math courses , while simultaneously enrolled in a two (2) credit developmental supplement. Focus on Faculty, Staff, and Administrators FCC strives to attract , employ , and retain talented and diverse faculty, staff, and administrators. Much of the focus for the past six (6) years has been on improving the recruitment of diverse faculty and professional staff. As Table 2 reflects, FCC has increased minority faculty representation from 1 4% in fall 201 3 to 17.1% in fall 201 8 but experienced 1.5% decline in fall 2018 compared to fall 2017 . The data also show the growth of minority full-time administrative and professional staff (from 1 4% to 18%) during the same time , with a decline of 3% between fall 2017 and fall 2018 . Our DEI Strategic Plan includes six (6) action items that address recruitment, hiring, and retention of racial/ethnic minority faculty and staff . The new College hiring process , implemented in 2014 -2015 , continues to focus on recruitment efforts and training all search committee members in implicit bias to ensure a diver se and excellent pool of applicants and finalists . TABLE 2. Employees by Race/Ethnicity Fall 2013 -Fall 2018 Improvements have been , and continue to be made , with respect to recruiting diverse faculty. The following initiatives have been undertaken to grow and retain talented faculty. All hiring is done by search committee s with diverse representation. Search committee members are trained on the College structured recruitment process and unconscious bias, and Human Resources ensures consistent use of the recruitment process. Human Resources reviews search diversity beginning with applicants from the initial pool through first round screening to ensure the minimum requirements do not adversely impact applicants. The Center for Teaching and Learning (CT L) has a robust professional development curriculum designed to inspire fa culty to engage students and support their success through active learning, innovation, and scholarship. One of the four (4) main areas for CTL Teaching and Learning Hours is Culturally Responsive Teaching. FCC offered a Cultural and Global Competency Summer Institute in 201 8 and 2019 for faculty focused on culturally responsive course transformation s in terms of pedagogy, practice, curriculum, and/or policy . The faculty who pa rticipated in the Summer Institute undertook a course transformation focused on pedagogy, curriculum, and policy. In 113Pg. 10 Frederick Community College 10 addition, they had in -depth professional development on culturally responsive teaching and supporting specific populations such as racial/ethnic minority students, students with disabilities, ELLs , LGBTQIA + students, and first generation students , among other populations. Faculty and staff attended the Community College of Baltimore County Culturally Responsive Teaching Conference, the National Conference on Women of Color in the Academy, as well as the National Conference on Race and Ethnicity (NCORE) , among other professional development opportunities. V. EFFORTS TO DESIGN AND CREATE POSITIVE INTERACTIONS AND CULTURAL AWARENESS The College is committed to building student, faculty, and staff capacity to interact effectively and ethically across difference , as evidenced by the following initiatives : 1) A cultural competency course is a graduation requirement for Associate degree -seeking students; 2) All full-time employees are evaluated twice a year on multiple criteria, including their a bility to interact effectively with diverse populations; 3) Co-curricular programming focuses on building student s' and employee s' capacity to engage with diverse ideas, communities, and experiences; 4) Professional development frequently focuses on these topics . In addition to these strategies, FCC developed policies to build a community where it is clear that discrimination is not tolerated , and to build a foundation where one of the essential characteristics of excellence is inclusion . Some of our specific efforts to build capacity to interact effectively and ethically across difference include: The ODEI offered 30 professional development opportunities for faculty and staff . These sessions, ranging from 2-3 hours to full -day engagements, covered topics such as facilitating difficult conversations, understanding language in relationship to inclusion, interrupting unconscious bias, community care after difficult world events, understanding racial equity and justice, supporting English Language Learners, and what inclusion means and looks like when discussing different aspects of identity such as religion, race, disability, or language. The Global Learning Committee offered a monthly professional development series to support faculty and staff in being more globally aware and conscious, how to support students in becoming more globally engaged, and amplifying the global engagement going on a t the College. Led by the Center for Teaching and Learning, the College continued a Campus Book series with The Book of Unknown American s by Cristina Henr \u00edquez in order to strengthen students' abilities to discuss difficult diversity topics across differen ce. The book discussions , which explicitly seek to build students' capacity to understand and engage with diverse perspectives, were well attended with participation of over 300 students, faculty, and staff. Enhancing students' experience of the text and conversation related to its themes, FCC partnered with Frederick County Public Librar ies to adopt The Book of Unknown American s as the 2019 Frederick Reads community book and invited the author 114Pg. 11 Frederick Community College 11 to speak to the community at two public events in spring 2019. Over 350 students, faculty, staff, and community members attended her presentation at FCC, and another 800 community members attended the author's off-campus presentation. In addition to the above -mentioned activities, the Center for Student Engagement ( CSE) collaborate d with College constituents on initiatives involving students, faculty, staff, and community partners in the design and implementation of programs, events, activities, and experiences that support student learning, leadership, and service. Some CSE events promote d diversity and helped students identify and grow their identit y of self and others through planned lectures, workshops, field trips, theater productions, movies and experiential opportunities focus ed on social awareness, diversity, and cultural sensitivi ty and competency. Students i n need of food but not the mean s to purchase sustenance on campus used t he FCC Student Food Pantry . The purpose of the pantry was to alleviate hunger so that students were able to focus on their studies. Students were allowed to visit the pantry once a day and take two items per visit. All food in the pantry was donated by employees of the College. The pantry was visited 2,292 times during the 201 8-2019 academic year. VI. STATEMENT REGARDING CAMPUS PROCESS FOR THE REPORTING OF HATE-BASED CRIMES FCC works to ensure that the campus environment is welcoming, safe, and free of obstacles that disrupt and/or limit the access of the College community to programs, services, events, and/or opportunities that enhance the personal learning goals of everyone . The first level of responding to incident s or behaviors that disrupt learning is throu gh the use of the College \"Student Behavior Incident Report Form,\" which is available to all faculty and staff on the College public we bsite , on Communication Central, and the College employee intranet site. This form cover s a broad range of incidents and behaviors that warrant immediate attention , including discrimination and harassment. In addition to the Student B ehavior Incident Report Form, the C ollege Security website is available to the public and it provides guidance, support, and resources related to College security and emergency response, as well as relevant reports and campus crime statistics. The Annual Campus Se curity Report is accessible on the website and it provides the information needed as part of the Title II Crime Awareness Campus Security Act of 1990 policy ( http://www.frederick.e du/faculty -staff/campus -security.aspx ). Bias/Hate Crime at Frederick Community College In spring and summer 2018, FCC documented , reviewed , and formalized protocol s for hate -bias incidents to strengthen efforts to prevent, report, and respond to incidents of hate /bias. In fall 2019, the College formalized our protocol for hate -bias incidents in a \"Hate -Bias Incident Response Protocol .\" The College prohibits hate/bias activities, including employing language or behavior that is intended to cause harm or threat toward a person based on age, ancestry, citizenship status, color, creed, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, genetic infor mation, marital status, mental or physical disability, national origin, race, religious affiliation, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. 115Pg. 12 Frederick Community College 12 How to Report a Crime To report a crime, individu als are directed to contact College Security at (301) 846-2453 for non - threatening emergencies. For emergencies, individuals are directed to dial 911. In addition to reporting information to C ollege Security and/or the local police d epartment, individuals may report a crime to College officials such as the As sociate Vice President/Dean of Students and the Title IX Coordinator, to name a few. All College officials (staff, faculty, and administrators), serve as \" responsible employees\" and are required to report crimes. The 2018 College Security & Fire Report had no reportable Clery Bias Crime statistics for years 2015 -2017. VII. Future Focus FCC is proud of the work accomplished this year, especially the development of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan , and will continue building and sustaining a diverse and engaged College community through multiple innovative initiatives . A few of the future priorities include: The College has recently formed a partnership with Mid -Atlantic Higher Education Recruitment Consortium to post all College jobs and to assist with diversity outreach. Through this partnership, FCC Human Resources aims to reach a larger pool of applicants, including veterans and persons with disabilities, to ensure the hiring of a talented and inc reasingly diverse workforce. Continued professional development of faculty and staff on topics of cultural responsive ness and aware ness. Implementing the comprehensive Diversity , Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2019 - 2024 . In particular, the main goals this year will include: o Developing and implementing a plan to close the achievement/ opportunity gap for racial/ethnic minority students by 2024. o Reviewing processes for recruitment and hiring to get to and exceed benchmark s for hiring and retaining faculty and staff of color. o Reviewing and strengthening courses that explicitly seeks to build student capacity to interact across difference. o Strengthening campus climate to become even more welcoming and inclusive. The College continues to make deliberate efforts to be intentional in its work of threading diversity, equity, and inclusion into the fabric of the culture of the College and all its activities , and making FCC a place where students and employees , especially those of color, thrive. 116 Garrett College Cultural Diversity Plan 2019 Update and Progress Report Approved and Submitted by the Garrett College Board of Trustees July 16, 2019 117 1 GARRETT COLLEGE REPORT - PLAN FOR PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY Institutional Profile 1.

INTRODUCTION: The role and importance of diversity in higher education has been widely recognized. In 2008, the Maryland General Assembly affirmed the importance of diversity as an educational goal by enacting legislation requiring that every public college and university develop and implement a cultural diversity plan. The 2008 l egislation defines \"cultural diversity\" to mean \"the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been under -represented in higher education.\" The 2013 -2017 Maryland State Plan for Post secondary Education subsequently broaden ed the definition of diversity to also include age, cultural identity, disability, family educational history, gender identity and expression, nationality, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, sex, and socio -economic status. The 2017 -2021 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education: Student Success with Less Debt focuses on diversity in Strategy 4 : \"Enhance diversity by fostering collaborations between Historically Black Colleges and Universities and tradi tionally white institutions \". Garrett College is committed to achieving a culturally diverse student body, faculty, and staff, and a campus environment that values and actively supports diversity , equity and inclusion . The College also strives to ensure that its graduating students are adequately prepared to live and work in a global society comprised of diverse cultures and beliefs. This commitment to diversity is evidenced in a variety of ways , including the College's Mission Statement and Institutiona l Goals , its Strategic Plan, its recruitment practices, and its goals for general education , student development , and the campus environment. II. CULTURAL DIVERSITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN As this report will show, Garrett College has made significant progress toward achieving diversity among its student body, infusing diversity into the curriculum, and creating a campus climate that respects differences and values diversity. At the January 2018 All -College Forum, Garrett College added a new concluding sentence to its mission statement, \" The College respects and cares for students as individuals and as members of diverse groups, and supports their aspirations for a better life \", to illustrate the College's dedication to making improvements as it relates to cultural diversity at the institution. In August 2018, a team of Prince George's Community College administrators agreed to assist Garrett College in assessing its cultural diversity climate and formulating recommendations to improve that climate as a key strategy toward improving student success. The PGCC team - Dr. Charlene Dukes, President; Dr. Lynne Adams, Associate Vice President for Human Resources and Organizational Development; and Mrs. Andristine Robinson, Director of Governance and Diversity - began the project with an extensive document review (GC Strategic Plan, Mission, Vision, Goals, and Values along with applicable internal college reports and trend data). They followed up that review with two campus visits - the first to meet with Coll ege leadership (GC president, Executive Council, College Council and Student Life staff), and the second to meet with student groups. In February 2019, the PGCC team provided GC's president with a comprehensive report summarizing the results of those meet ings as well as providing two sets of recommendations respectively dealing with employee and student engagement. This report was shared with key personnel who subsequently 1.) identified high -priority recommendations for fast -track implementation and 2.) provided input regarding improvements made prior to receiving the PGCC report that proactively addressed various recommendations. This team developed a consensus regarding both Employee and Student Engagement priorities, as well as suggested strategie s to implement those priorities. In the process of reviewing the College's Strategic Plan, it was 119 3 determined that the initiatives that resulted from the PGCC report closely aligned with initiatives I and III from the Strategic Plan: I. Provide appropriate prog rams and services to enable student success and completion, and, III. Ensure the College has the fiscal, human, and physical resources needed to meet its mission. As a result, these initiatives will be used and the goals have been streamlined to support mo re efficient and effective practices toward diversity, equity, and inclusion at Garrett College. The newly developed goals and strategies do provide overlap with those previously established goals addressed in the 2018 report and the College will continue to address those items that need improvement. The College is utilizing Taskstream to monitor plan impl ementation, responsibility, development , and effectiveness . GOALS AND STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING CULTURAL DIVERSITY: Goal 1: To coordinate initiatives for diversity, equity, and inclusion .

Desired Outcome : Two events and/or discussions held by December 2019. Measures : Number of events and/ or discussions held. Status : In February 2019, the College held a Black History Month Program Series. Two s peakers from W est Virginia University came to campus. Fifty total participants attended. -Additionally, two movies were offered to the students with sixty total participants. Apple AirPods were given away as a grand prize. Offering prizes and food helped raise the participant numbers from l ast year's Black History Month program series. Strategy 3: Host roundtable discussions on diversity, equity, and inclusion . Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Equity & Compliance Timeline : FY19 -FY20 Desired Outcome : At least one roundtable, either external as part of the MD Community College Diversity Roundtable group or an internal, held by May 2020. Measures : Number of roundtable discussions held; feedback from participants Status : This is currently in the planning stages. The College would like to have its student Council on Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion created and running so these individuals can participate in these conversations. Goal 3: To identify obstacles to student success and establish a network of support services that will help students to overcome them. (Strategic Plan Goal 1.2) . Strategy 1: Create a \"safe space\" program. (Note: \"safe spaces\" refer to places created for individuals who feel marginalized to come together, and may also indicate a faculty member who does not tolerate violence, harassment or hate speech, thereby creating a safe place for all people (Waldman, Katy -2015)). Responsibility : Dean of Academic Affairs, Dean of Student Affairs Timeline : Summer 2019 - Develop plan; hold at least one training if possible. Desired Outcome : Identify and train f ive t o ten college employees and advertise the \"safe space s\" across campus . 121 5 Measures : Biannual S tudent Opinion Survey; collect statistics on designated \"safe spaces\" and if they are utilized. Status : Two employees, one faculty and one staff, have been trained as certified instructors. One staff member left, so the remaining staff member and the faculty member will develop a training plan and implement in the 2019 -2020 school year. Strategy 2 : Clearly articulated processes and procedures with respect to mental health support. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Student Development Timeline : 2018 -2019 school year Desired Outcome : Employ a mental health counselor to provide support to stu dents in need. Measures : Student survey, demographics/statistics provided by counselor (meeting hours, students served, etc.) Status : Karl Glocker was hired in the spring 2019 semester and holds office hours on Thursdays for students. A contract for Glocker's services has been secured to provide continued services for the fall 2019 semester. Strategy 3 : Explore additional opportunities to increase physical and mental health services on campus. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Stud ent Development Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : One to two new physical/mental health service partnerships formed or one to two existing partnerships expanded for the Spring 2020 semester. Measures : Student surveys, medical transport data, statistics from the Health Department and Mt. Laurel Status : Through the Go 4 Health group, the College already has formed partnerships with the Garrett County Health Department, Mountain Laurel Medical Center, and the Dove Center. Over the past year, some services the Health Department had offered have been discontinued. The College is working to determine if those services are needed, and if so, how to fill in the gaps. Additionally, conversations are being held as to what services may be missing and how the College can work with external resources to meet student needs. The College is examining statistics provided by the on -campus counselor to increase resources around those topics that were most often addressed in sessions, which included anxiety and depression. Strategy 4 : Support students with transportation needs. Responsibility : Director of Student Development Timeline : Long-term, continuous. This can change with turnover or staff changes. Additionally, the need can change based upon student needs. Desired Outcome : Expand number of employees in the transportation rotation and increase publicity of the transportation offerings to address student needs (medical and access to local resources). Measures : Student surveys, transportation statistics Status : For the 2018 -2019 school year, there were five staff members on the rotation; however, the scheduled medical trips were significantly under -used in comparison to past years. For example, one staff member was scheduled to cover eight trips over the 2019 spring semester and did not have to transport once because no students signed -up. The College needs to assess student needs for transport and finding additional funds to cover the trips that are utilized, rather than focusing solely on the number of d rivers available at a given time. 122 6 Strategy 5 : Meet the needs of students in poverty. Responsibility : Dean of Academic Affairs, Dean of Student Affairs, Coordinator of Distance Learning, Director of Equity and Compliance Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : This particular item incorporates several actions in an effort to reduce barriers to success and address financial concerns of students in poverty. These actions include reduced textbook costs or increased OER use, establishing a \"one stop sh op\" on campus, and increasing partnerships with local resources, such as Social Services. Measures : Reduction in course material costs, increased access to offices, Student Opinion survey Status : Several years ago, the College started the Students In Need Group, or S.I.N.G. S.I.N.G is a group of volunteers who provide emergency assistance to students, and sponsors the Food Pantry. S.I.N.G.'s efforts will continue in an effort to aid students in pov erty; however, t he College's main focus at this time concerning this strategy is to reduce and/or eliminate course material costs for students. Current OER efforts have saved our students over $100,000 in course material costs to date. Through grants, the College is looking to institute OER into six courses in the Fall of 2019. On a similar note, Garrett College has signed a three -year contract with eCampus Course Material Solutions. eCampus will manage course materials through a virtual bookstore link on t he Garrett College website. Purchase options can include New, Used, Rental, Digital, and / or Marketplace Price Matching. Purchases can be made using financial aid awards, credit card and / or Pay Pal. Book buy -back would be run through eCampus. Additional ly, eCampus will award an annual $2000.00 textbook scholarship that will be disbur sed at the College's discretion. As the President notes, \"While we do not have a specific timeline in place, my goal is to get GC to a place where all of our courses are low or no -cost for course materials. I think implementing this strategy will increase student access.\" Strategy 6 : Improve access and accommodations for students with disabilities. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Disability Support Services Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : Reduce barriers to success and increase access to education of students with disabilities. Measures : Student surveys, reported grievances Status : In the Summer of 2018, the College installed automatic door openers on seven doorways across campus to increase access to students and the greater community. Currently the College is planning to install openers on the remaining doorways and is developing a plan to provide funding for this project over the next few years. The Disability Support Services office continues to work individually with incoming students to meet needs, as well as, external groups to determine what additional actions the College can take to improve access and accommodations . Goal 4: To provide an actively engaged and relevant college experience for our diverse student population to include credit and non -credit students. (Strategic Plan Goal 1.3) . Strategy 1: Development of a broader range of coursework, as needed . Responsibility : Dean of Academ ic Affairs Timeline : Fall 2019 and ongoing Desired Outcome : 70% of students meet objectives of the Global and Cultural Competency Assessment Measures : Student course assessments 123 7 Status : The following Global and Cultural Competency Learning outcomes were assess ed for the 2018 -2019 school year : 1. Students will demonstrate the ability to identify current global issues and problems from diverse perspectives. 2. Students will demonstrate intercultural communication skills by exhibiting an understanding of cultural differences and similarities. 3. Students will demonstrate the ability to apply their understanding of diverse perspectives by taking action to make a positive social impact in the community. 2019 Cultural & Global Perspective Learning Outcomes Assessment Results Learning Outcome Assessment Results 1 Assessment # Students Evaluated # Students That Met Objectives % That Met Objectives Comments PSY 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 90 67 74% Met Objective SOC 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 43 39 91% Study Abroad Reflection 3 3 100% Met Objective ASI 271 8th LNT Principle Assignment 5 5 100% Met Objective 2 Assessment # Students Evaluated # Students That Met Objectives % That Met Objectives Comments PSY 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 90 67 74% Met Objective SOC 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 43 39 91% Met Objective ASI 101 Land Use Paper 5 3 60% Did not meet objective 3 Assessment # Students Evaluated # Students That Met Objectives % That Met Objectives Comments PSY 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 90 67 74% Met Objective SOC 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 43 39 91% Met Objective Study Abroad Reflection 3 3 100% Met Objective As seen in the table above, all assessed courses, except for one, met the majority of the outcomes and objectives. As noted in the 2017 -2018 annual review there were flaws with respect to the Global and Cultural Competency Assessment (GCCA) pre and post -test that was developed by Dr. Kasecamp, Professor of Psychology, and introduced Fall of 2017. In addition, a recommendation was made to make the assessment digital. In the process of working on converting to a digital format, it was decided that an on -line Cultural & Global Competency training program should be developed that students are required to complete prior to being assessed. Elements of the GCCA will be used as a guide to develop the on -line training program and then to assess perception of knowl edge, actual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors characteristic of having competency in this area (see attached assessment). This training program will be a requirement for all incoming 124 8 freshm en and implemented in the Freshme n Orientation courses. This w ill ensure that all students are being educated about Global and Cultural issues and assessed. Implementation of this program is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2019. Strategy 2 : Build relationships between commuter and residential students. Responsibi lity: Dean of Student Affairs, Student Activities Manager Timeline : On going Desired Outcome : Increase the sense of community and understanding between the commuter and residential student populations. Measures : Attendance data, student surveys Status : Currently in the planning stages. The Student Activities Manager is looking at incorporating \"getting to know you\" or \"icebreaker\" type of activities among the incoming students during orientation that would start the relationship building between commuter and residential students. Strategy 3 : Increase student engagement activities with regard to diversity, equity, and inclusion that would involve engagement with employees and the external community. Responsibility : Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, Equity & Compliance Timeline : On going , long -term Measures : Number of events held; post -event feedback Status : The College is currently in the planning stages for the 2019 -2020 school year. In the 2018 - 2019 school year, the College held events for Black History Month and National Coming Out Day to name a few ; however, participation was low . For all four events held for Black History Month, there were only 54 participants. The College is examining ways to increase participation. The Library regularly does displays for Black History Month and Women's History Month but was limited in LGBTQ resources. Additional resource s have been purchased which will increase the ability to provide increased education on diversity and inclusion topics. Strategy 4 : Improve the residential student experience. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Student Development, Resid ence Life Manager Timeline : On going , long -term Desired Outcome : Increased residential student retention and success Measures : Student retention rates, student opinion surveys Status : 2018 Student Opinion Survey Residence Halls Results 125 9 The 2018 Student Opinion Survey highlighted the areas where the College needed the most improvement, as indicated in the graph above. The College has made much progress in the way of improving the student experience. During the Spring 2018 semester, Garret t Hall was taken off -line for renovations to make improvements, which included installing a community kitchen. Student Life reformatted the residence hall meeting model to have larger meetings on the same night rather than individualized floor meetings. Th e larger meeting format resulted in better attendance and positive feedback from the students. For the opening meeting for the Spring 2019 semester, 93 out of 124 residents attended . Housing selection meetings also saw an increase with 51 students signing up for Fall housing in 2019 compared to 28 in Spring 2018. Additionally, the Residence Hall Manager and student staff provided increased programming opportunities in the 2018 -2019 school year that were well received and attended. Strategy 5 : Connect out -of-town students with the Garrett County community. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Student Activities Manager Timeline : On going , long -term Desired Outcome : Provide students with the opportunity to connect with resources in the county to gain expe rience and expose the Garrett County community to diverse populations and provide learning opportunities for all involved. Measures : Attendance numbers; student surveys Status : Garrett College is working in partnership with the Garrett County Chamber of Commerce to develop various events designed to connect our out -of-area students and acclimate them to the local community, which will help foster inclusion and acceptance. Some of the planned events include: a welcome reception at one of the local busines ses; tours of Garrett County that would assist students in acclimating to the area and seeing its natural beauty and all of the activities that Garrett County has to offer; and a student fair which would provide the Chamber and the College opportunities to make out -of-area students feel welcome and to possibly consider Garrett County as a potential permanent home after graduation. Strategy 6 : Develop agreement with Thread organization. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Enrollment Managem ent & Marketing Timeline : Finalize before Fall 2019 semester in efforts to have a small cohort start in September . Desired Outcome : Two to four students in the cohort for Fall 2019 semester. Measures : Track cohort success; focus groups with cohort and Thread representatives. Status : The Thread organization is a mentoring organization that increases an individual student's success by teaming them with a support system and access to resources. As of June 2019, according to the Director of Enroll ment Management & Marketing, t hree (3) Thread students are planning to attend in the fall. The students will be on campus one weekend in July of 2019 to register and participate in a \"camp\" along with their downstate me ntors and Thread administrators. The Coll ege and the Thread organization are in the process of establishing an MOU that will be finalized before the camp in July. The College is looking to what they learn from this relationship to develop a similar working relationship with students from the SEED Foundation. Strategy 7 : Create formal relationship with international student organization s to expand international student population. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Enrollment Management & Marketing Timeline : Recruitment is curren tly taking place for a small cohort to being at the start of the Fall 2019 semester. 126 10 Desired Outcome : Target of 1 -3 additional international students in Fall 2019. Work toward a plan to double international students successfully recruited for Fall 2020. Measures : Track cohort success; focus groups with the student cohort Status : In the Spring 2019 semester, the College had nine students with F -1 Visas in attendance. In order to increase our international student enrollment, the College is looking to exp and that particular population. The College is in very early conversations and a tentative verbal agreement with LADO International Institute, an English language in stitute based in Arlington , Va. The g oal of the agreement with LADO is to spread the word a bout the College to their students via collateral, and other channels, including two -way visits in the future. Strategy 8 : Improve education around adult expectations. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Student Development Timeline : Implemented in the 2018 -2019 school year; on -going Desired Outcome : 50% reduction in violations and 50% reduction in suspensions/removals through the expectation of improved behavior. Measures : Educational sanction program data; incident reports, sanction data Status : The 2017 -2018 school year had 206 incident reports and 18 suspensions. The 2018 -2019 school year is ending with 80 incident reports and 6 suspensions. Of the 80 incident reports, only four students were sanctioned to complete one of the two e ducational programs concerning alcohol or substance abuse violations . Three students completed the assigned program and one student partially completed. The College expects to continue to see this reduction in the 2019 -2020 school year and hopes to decrease both violations and suspensions/removals by an additional 5%. Goal 5 : To ensure the College is able to attract and retain a diverse, well -qualified, and competent workforce. (Strategic Plan Goal 1.3, 3.3) Strategy 1: Investigate offerings for interpersonal communication skills . Responsibility : Director of Equity & Compliance, Director of Human Resources, Dean of Continuing Education and Workforce De velopment Timeline : Summer 2019 -Fall2019: Investigate offerings and plan/schedule for calendar year 2020 Desired Outcome : 80% completion by designated employees of established course/program by June 2020. Measures : Number of employees who complete trainings; employee feedback; satisfaction surveys Status : The Student Experience Committee noted poor customer/student service as one of nine pain points for students . It was noted in the committee's report that poor communication and lack of communicatio n by the college to the students leads to confusion, frustration, and inaction. In an effort to work toward better student service and relations, the College has begun with training supervisors. A \"Stepping into Supervisor\" series was recently held and ele ven newly appointed supervisors completed the training. One of the sessions was entitled \"Communication Dynamics\" and focused on understanding and building communication skill sets. Further trainings are planned. Strategy 2 : Conduct a compensation and salary equity study. Responsibility : President, Director of Human Resources Timeline : Study begins Fall 2018 in collaboration with Paypoint. Study/review is completed by May 2019. Budgeting should be drafted in accordance with the budget requirements and included for Board approval in June 2019. Plan implementation at beginning of FY20. 127 11 Desired Outcome : Compensation study is completed and implemented to bring Garrett to market standards. Measures : Focus groups, job descriptions, employee satisfaction Status: One of the best ways to attract and retain a qualified, diverse workforce is by offering competitive wages/salary. As of June 2019, Paypoint , the firm hired to complete the study, has completed a job classification phase to review grading for current positions and updated job descriptions, as well as a compensation study to match jobs to internal and external markets. The President has proposed to the Board of Trustees adoption of a four -year rollout of the compensation plan, which will increase compen sation $549,886. FY20 is proposed to fund year 1 of the four -year plan with Board approval. III. RECRUITMENT OF NUMERICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND STAFF Garrett College believes in the importance of making its educational and employment opportunities accessible to minorities. Since Garrett County's population is about 9 8% white, the College has had to look to other geographic areas in order to recruit minority students, faculty, and staff , and it has been very successful with respect to attracting and enrolling minority students. In fall 201 8, minority student enrollment was 23%, which far exceeds the minority representation of Garrett County, which is only about 2%. The College will seek to maintain a minority population of at least 20 % of its total student body . The College continues to focus its efforts on improving minority students' retention and completion rates, which tend to lag behind those of the College's overall student population, especially for Black/African American students . As indicated in the table belo w, the average number of African American completers remains consistent with the average number of minority completers throughout the year. The g oals and strategies indicated in the sections above with regard to the Thread student and international student recruitment efforts will help addr ess minority student enrollment, while the other goals and strategies with aid in retention and completion rates. Minority Student Retention Rates and Number of Completers (IPEDS Data) Fall to Fall Fall-Fall Retention Rate 1st time cohort % increase over FY 13 Fiscal Year Minority Completers Fiscal Year African American Completers 2012 -13 31.2% Baseline 10 7 2013 -14 39.8% 8.6% 13 9 2014 -15 50% 18.8% 10 8 2015 -16 48.4% 17.2% 28 18 34.6% 3.4% -2018 26.5% -4.7% 9 5 2018 -2019 18 15 Garrett College has been much less successful with respect to attracting and hiring minority faculty and professional staff. While the percentages of minorities among Garrett College's full -time faculty and professional staff exceed the representation of minorities within its service area, the actual number of individuals represented by those percentages is very small, due to th e College's small size . For this reason, a personnel change involving a single individual can significantly alter 128 12 the College's minority com position. Of additional c oncern is the fact that while 18 % of the College's student population is B lack/African Ame rican (fall 2018 data), at present, the College has no Black (African Americ an) faculty members and only one Black/African American professi onal staff member . Moreover, due to its location and the demographics of its service area, Garrett College faces som e significant challenges in trying to recruit and retain minority faculty and staff. Nevertheless, by using targeted recruitment strategies, the College hopes to be more successful in attracting minority faculty and professional staff. The Director of Huma n Resources posts job openings on Diversity.com as one strategy to address this concern. Some of the impediments to minority recruitment and retention are : (Please note that these are not limited to the minority experience .) Financial - limited recruitmen t budget, inability to offer competitive faculty and professional staff salaries, lack of monies ear -marked for diversity initiatives. Typically s mall applicant pool of qualified minority candidates combined with intense competition for those candidates . Location - relatively isolated, small, rural college town. Demographics - small, rural minority population. Surrounding area is predominately white. Lack of employment opportunities for spouse or partner. Lack of formal mentoring and retention efforts. Despite the se challenges, Garrett College remains committed to increasing the minority representation among its full -time faculty and professional staff and continues to have this a priority goal. IV. INITIATIVES TO INCREASE CULTURAL AWAREN ESS AMONG STUDENTS, FACULTY, STAFF , and COMMUNITY Garrett College is fully committed to fostering an environment that not only embraces and celebrates cultural diversity, but also one that ensures that all students ar e made to feel welcome and supported in their journey towards academic success . However, certain cultural and ethnic differences may not always be recognized or fully understood, nor do faculty and staff always know how to respond appropriately to such di fferences . In addition, the College recognizes that it must provide faculty and staff with the information and ongoing training, as well as other learning opportunities such as open forums with diverse student populations , necessary to ensure they are adequately equipped to assist all students in achieving success. As evidenced in the section above, increasing cultural awareness with the campus community and beyond has become a primary initiative in the College's efforts. The College has two accomplish ments to highlight from the 2018 -2019 school year . The first is t he Out-Of-Town Student Orientation , which was an endeavor established through a partnership between the College and the Garrett County Chamber of Commerce. Forty out -of-county resident studen ts were hosted to a welcome reception, which included lunch, ice cream, boat tours and activities on the lake. Additional tours were held to businesses and other locations throughout the county and were attended by approximately six students per trip. The main goal of these efforts were to welcome incoming students and to orient them to the opportunities that the local community can provide. The second highlight was the implementation and completion of a foundational course for employees. The course, which was developed in -house and mirrored the course used for students, 129 13 is entitled, \"Introduction to Diversity, Cultural Competency, and Social Justice\". Topics within the course include diversity, equity, inclusion, language and terminology, social justice, a nd microag gressions. The course was made part of a larger \"Employee Compliance Training\" that is completed using Blackboard. As of June 2019, 100% of full -time faculty and staff, and all head coaches had completed the training. The College plans to develop and release further trainings to build upon the skills and knowledge included in the foundational course on a regular basis. Some future topics include: transgendered students, preferred pronouns, and poverty and student success. V. PROCCESS FOR REPORTING CAMPUS -BASED HATE CRIMES Garrett College values its sense of community and expects students and employees to abide by specific regulations that dictate appropriate behavior. Any evidence of prejudice based on religion, sexual orientation, ge nder, disability, or ethnicity/ national origin can be viewed as a hate crime. The process for reporting crime statistics on a college campus is defined under Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article and is consistent with federal req uirements under 20 U.S.C. 1092(f), known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics. The Campus Crime Statistics Act mandates the manner in which statistics are to be collected and the format in which they are to be published. In September of 2018, Garrett College created the Office of Equity and Compliance and adopted an Equity Grievance Policy . The Office of Equity and Compliance oversees the College's compliance with Title IX, Title VI, Title VII, Clery Act , and other federal and state laws, regulations and requirements. The Office of Equity and Compliance serves as a method of recourse to those, be they student, faculty, or staff, who believe that a particular action on the part of a College member has viol ated accepted or stated institutional practices and standards. Garrett College affirms its commitment to promote the goals of fairness and equity in all aspects of the educational enterprise. All policies below are subject to resolution using the College's Equity Grievance Process (EGP). When the responding party is a member of the College community, the EGP is applicable regardless of the status of the reporting party who may be a member or non -member of the campus community, including students, student or ganizations, faculty, administrators, staff, guests, visitors, campers, etc. Any individual who feels they have been a victim of a hate crime or violation of the College 's Equal Opportunity, Harassment, and Nondiscrimination policy can file a report with the Office of Equity and Compliance or anonymously by using the Reasonable Concern reporting form online. 130 HAGERSTOWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CULTURAL DIVERSITY PLAN June 2019 131 INTRODUCTION Diversity can be defined in a wide variety of ways. For the purpose of this document, \"diversity\" is defined as the recognition , appreciation and understanding of individual, group, and cultural similarities and differences that include, but are not limited to age, abilities and disabilities , ethnicity, language, gender, race, nationality, religion, socio -economic status, veteran st atus, and sexual orientation . Issues of diversity permeate many aspects of a campus environment and each is connected with the others. Unless incorporated into core structures of the College through strategic planning efforts, little will change substantively. HCC's strategic goals and action plans help guide achievement and changes in policies and procedures, with the overarching values of equal access and treatment as the foundations. Simply recruiting a more diverse student body without attending to other aspects of campus life, such as intergroup relations, curricular change, faculty and staff professional development, and diversifying faculty and staff, can result in difficulties fo r traditionally under-represented students. Comprehensive institutional change and integrated efforts are critical to provide positive educational outcomes within a climate of acceptance and respect for cultural diversity and equal opportunities for education, training and employment. The College's Mission, Values and Policy Cultural diversity , equal ity in education and equal employment opportunit ies are viewed as integral parts of the mission and purpose of HCC . The mission, values and policy statements encourage and support diversity in the personal , professional and scholastic development and enrichment of all in the College community. Mission Hagerstown Community College ensures equi table access to affordable high quality educational programs, promotes practices and policies that ensure student success, and fosters innovation and collaboration to strengthen its regional workforce and community cultural development. Values The College believes in and teaches the id eals and values of cultural and racial diversity and a democratic way of life. HCC also seeks to cultivate in its students critical and independent thought, openness to new ideas, a sense of self-direction, moral sensitivity, strength through diversity, and the value of continuing education and life-long learning. Diversity Policy Beyond its Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, HCC 's Board of Trustees approved in 2009 the Anti- Discrimination Policy . Committed to a policy of cultural diversity and openness in preventing any form of discrimination , the College proactively through this policy is committed to preventing harassment and providing a genuine learning environment that is receptive to all views and backgrounds. Also addressed in the Code of Student Conduct, t he College does not tolerate any language, action or behavior that is hostile to others. All students have the right to be free from unlawful intimidation or coercion, negative stereotyping and racial, gender or cultural slurs. 132The College's Service Area Being a lead er in the community, HCC takes seriously it s commitment to recruit students and employees of diverse backgrounds . HCC's credit minority enrollment of 27.6 percent in FY19 exceeded that of the county's minority population ( approximately 21.0 percent) . Though Washington County became more racially and ethnically diverse over the last decade, it is still predominantly white and non- Hispanic. Black or African American residents comprise the largest minor ity group, as seen in Table One. Hispanic residents comprise the fastest growing ethnic /racial group in Washington County. Table One Washington County, Maryland Population by Race and Hispanic Origin WASHINGTON COUNTY, MARYLAND Population by Race and Hispanic Origin Population % of Total Total Population (estimates, V2018) 150,926 100.0% 0.3% Islander More Races 4,377 2.9% Ethnicity Hispanic/Latino 7,546 5.0% Minority Status White Minority 31,694 21.0% Source: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/washingtoncountymaryland/PST045218 133SUMMARY AND PROGRESS TO IMPROVE CULTURAL DIVERSITY HCC's strategic plan s have always incorporated goals and action plans for a diver se student body and workforce. HCC annually updates through its unit planning process the strategic plan, revising and adding objectives and action plans as institutional priorities change or are added. The College, through its 2022 Strategic Plan, address es the importance of diversity and multiculturalism by establishing specific goals (2, 3, 4, and 5), objectives and action plans . In doing so, HCC continues to improve its planning/evaluation model and bring about positive change related to improving cultural diversity among students, faculty and staff. Bulleted below each relevant goal of the 2022 Strategic Plan are updates regarding progress with impact on cultural diversity made since FY18 . Institutional policy statements pro vide the overarching foundation for these plans. The Board of Trustees established policies to address issues of diversity, integrity and respect across campus. These policies include: Anti- Discrimination (Policy #4042); Academic Integrity (Policy #4045); Credit for Life Experience (Policy #4017); Discrimination and Harassment (Policy #5032); Expressive Activity (Policy #8068); Sexual Harassment (Policy #8070A) and the Equal Employment Opportunity (Policy #5003). Recognizing the importance of this topic, the Human Resources ( HR) Department implemented an electronic version of annual recertification training on discrimination and harassment for all employees. 2022 Strategic Goal 2 - Maintain a Responsive, Dynamic Curriculum and Teaching Excellence 2.8 Create a learning environment that is respectful of multicultural values and general educational requirements that promote an understanding and appreciation for multiculturalism Action Plans: 2.8a Structure professional development activities for all emplo yees that focus on multicultural awareness and responsiveness, including teaching employees \"best practices\" in serving a multicultural student body (FY18- FY22 ) 2.8b Promote multicultural sensitivity in the classroom among faculty and students (FY18 -FY22 ) 2.8c Develop interactive teaching and learning models that expand student knowledge of and appreciation for multiculturalism, including faculty and student panel discussions, and other College and community events ( FY18 -FY22 ) 2.8d Develop new courses and update curricula to reflect a diversified world view (FY19 ) 2.8e Exhibit a diverse representation of student and employee images in all advertising (FY18 -FY22 ) 134Accomplishments in FY1 9 related to Cultural Diversity: Recognizing the importance of embracing diverse cultures in instruction, HCC offers diversity to its Emerging Issues and Interdisciplinary General Education category, thereby requiring that all degree -seeking students take at least one three- credit course pertaining to multiculturalism and diversity. Examples of relevant course titles include Cultural Anthropology, Latin American History, World Regional Geography, World Religions , Understanding Diversity in the Helping Profession, Diversity and Cultural Issues in Sports and Athletics, and Race and Ethnic Relations in the United States. Student organizations oriented toward increasing awareness of diversity, races and cultures include the Black Student Union and International Club. Other student organizations are encouraged and supported as student leadership arises. The Continuing Education and Business Services division of the College offers a Spanish Drivers Education course. ELL-101, English Composition for English Language Lea rners , was implemented and maintained steady enrollment. 2022 Strategic Goal 3 - Strengthen Sustainable Enrollment Management Systems to Improve Student Retention, Program Completion and Student Success 3.3 Develop and maintain proactive student services support and enrollment strategies to increase the number and diversity of student enrollments Action Plans: 3.3c Develop strategies to continue the growth of minority student enrollments (FY18- FY22 ) 3.3d Develop and maintain ESL and college- level courses (FY19 -FY22 ) 3.3j Continue to provide financial literacy as part of loan counseling and present workshops to selected student groups (FY18- FY22 ) 3.3o Partner with local and regional veterans' organizations to encourage use of credits and benefits earned while in service to complete an associate degree (FY1 8- FY19 ) 3.5 Provide special services to reach out to underserved populations Action Plans: 3.5a Monitor the effectiveness and make improvements to student services programs that assist at-risk students (FY19) 3.5b Implement marketing initiatives specifically targeted at underserved populations (FY1 8-FY20 ) 3.5d Strengthen the (FY18 -FY22 ) 3.5e Expand credit and credit- free short term training programs for those entering the job market or making a career change ( FY18-FY 22) 3.5f Continue to serve the prison populations at the five Western Maryland prisons by providing computer and vocational training (FY1 8-FY22 ) 3.5g Enhance Library and Learning Support Center support for adult literacy programs and ESOL (FY18-FY19) Accomplishments in FY1 9 related to Cultural Diversity: The College's min ority student enrollment in FY19 was 27.6 percent, reflecting a higher degree of ethnic and racial diversity than found in the county (approximately 21.0 percent) . 135 The full -time Multicultural Recruiter position encourages prospective minority students to enroll in either adult education courses, credit courses, or non- credit courses. The Continuing Education division continues to serve traditionally underserved populations through training (e.g., forklift safety at the Washington County Family Center, Spanish Drivers Education course, etc.) . The Director of Financial Aid hosts workshops for low income, at-risk students to encourage participation in higher education by covering federal and state financial aid programs, concerns about borrowing and important deadlines. Additionally, HCC has an additional source of student financial aid via its Opportunity Fund for those who do not qualify for Pell grants or who require additional financial assistance . Events sponsored by HCC to promote multiculturalism and understanding throughout the year included the Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration of Diversity, co-sponsoring the annual Hispanic Festival, Chinese New Year Celebration, Black History Month Celebration, Women's History Month Celebration, Pride Week Celebration, and Irish- American Heritage Celeb ration. Support for student diversity is also evidenced by the range of extra-curricular student clubs and organizations offered through the Student Activities Office, which include the Black Student Union and International Club. The SGA Program Board sponsored activities for Hispanic Heritage Month, Native American Heritage Day, and a Carols from Around the World Holiday Celebration. Two of the College's programs use a case management approach to help remove barriers and providing support for learning. Both the Job Training Student Resources (college funded) and TRiO Student Support Services (grant funded) programs work closely with at-risk students to help them persist, complete their courses and graduate. Both programs serve hi gh-risk populations, of which over 30 percent fall into a minority group. The College 's administrative reorganization to address enrollment growth, sustainability, and student success to enhance a diversified set of programs and services to serve m any different types of students continues to evolve successfully, with overall credit enrollment continuing to show signs of improvement after a couple years of decline. 2022 Strategic Goal 4 - Expand Community and Workforce Development, Strategic Partnerships and Alliances 4.4 Maintain the College's role as one of the premier intellectual, social, and cultural centers in its service region Action Plans: 4.4d Collaborate with the Bester Community of Hope by providing on- site educational programs for participants ( FY18 -FY22 ) 4.4e Expand credit- free arts and cultural programs that meet the needs of the community (FY1 8-FY22 ) 4.4f Plan and sponsor community information forums on issues facing the HCC service area ( FY19 -FY22 ) 4.4g Continue to provide regional leadership for the annual Martin Luther King/Diversity Celebration on the HCC campus, and plan activities throughout the year that promote multiculturalism (FY18 -FY22) Accomplishments in FY1 9 related to Cultural Diversity : HCC provides county leadership for the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. / Diversity Celebration, which has been held annually on campus since 2004. 136 The College has been the co-sponsor of annual Hispanic festival since 2008. The Hispanic organization that co-sponsors the event uses funding from the event to support scholarships for Hispanic students attending HCC. HCC's adult education GED program enrolls approximately 50 percent minority students. In April 2019, HCC hosted a free community panel discussion event promoting awareness of the opioid epidemic that is affecting the nation and the HCC service area in particular. Arranged field trips to both the Holocaust Museum and National Museum of African American History in Washington, DC. The College participated in the Mary land Males Students of Color Summit with both students and employee participants. The Student Government Association, in partnership with the Robinwood Players (theater club) sponsored HCC's first Pride Week in April. 2022 Strategic Goal 5 - Improve Human Resource Development Syst ems, Practices, and Procedures 5.1 Improve recruitment, selection, and orientation processes aimed at securing and maintaining a diverse and competent faculty and staff who are lifelong learners Action Plans: 5.1a Develop policy recommendations as needed through the Human Resources Committee for improved employee recruitment, selection, and orientation (FY18 -FY22 ) 5.3 Promote and provide professional development opportunities to enhance employee performance Action Plans: 5.3f Develop and promote civility and multicultural awareness for all employee and volunteer groups (FY18 -FY22 ) 5.5 Maintain human resources policies and procedures that meet legal requirements and communicate with employees any changes, deletio ns, additions or revisions Action Plans: 5.5b Audit approved policies and procedures to ensure the language is compliant with current federal and state mandates (FY18 -FY22) Accomplishments in FY19 related to Cultural Diversity: In fall 2018, six (7.5 percent ) full -time faculty identified themselves as minorities , compared t o one a decade ago . Of all full- time non -faculty employees , 10.1 percent identified themselves as minorities in fall 2018, which is a slight increase from previous years . The Hum an Resources Department offers an electronic version of annual recertification training on discrimination and harassment for all employees. 137FOSTERING AND INCREASING A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY AND WORKFORCE Student Recruitment and Enrollment The College's minority student enrollment in FY1 9 was 2 7.6 percent, reflecting a higher degree of ethnic and racial diversity than found in the county ( approximately 21.0 percent ). Black/African American students, the largest minority group on campus, comprised 12.2 percent of all FY1 8 enrollments. Additionally, Hispanics/Latinos comprised 6.7 percent of enrollment, which is two percent higher than their proportion in Washington County. Table Two depicts unduplicated headcount enrollment in credit programs by race and ethnicity for FY 2014 through FY 2018.

In accordance with federal regulations under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, institution -wide assessment information, which includes diversity, is available to current and prospective students through the public disclosure site of HCC's Web page. A position in Student Services is dedicated to outreach and recruitment of minority populations. The Multicultural Recruiter, who is Hispanic, visits all local high schools, including English Language Learner (ELL) classes, and hosts information sessions targeting prospective minority students at the local public library and other venues. Information shared includes credit and non- credit education and adult education and literacy. Events sponsored by HCC to promote multiculturalism and understanding throughout the year included the Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration of Diversity, co-sponsoring the annual Hispanic Festival, Chinese New Year 138Celebration, and Irish-American Heritage Celebration. Support for student diversity is also evidenced by the range of extra-curricular student clubs and organizations offered through the Student Activities Office, which include the Black Student Union and International Club. The SGA Program Board sponsored activities for Hispanic Heritage Month, Black History Month, Chinese New Year and Irish -American Heritage Month. Two of the College's programs use a case management approach to help remove barriers and provide support for learning. Both the Job Training Student Resources (college funded) and TRiO Student Support Services (grant funded) programs work closely with at-risk students to help them persist, complete their courses and graduate. Both programs serve high- risk populations, of which over 30 percent fall into a minority group. The Director of Financial Aid hosts workshops for low income, at-risk students selected by high school counselors. This outreach effort is designed to encourage participation in higher education by covering federal and state financial aid programs, concerns about borrowing and important deadlines. The results of these efforts are demonstrated by an increase in unduplicated numbers of minority students r eceiving financial aid as seen in Table Three. In FY1 8, over 70 percent of all enrolled minorities received some form of financial aid. Interestingly, the gap between minority and non- minority students receiving some form of financial aid has continued to close considerably in recent years. In FY14, 70.0 percent of minorities received financial aid, compared to 60.7 percent of non- minorities (a 9.3 percent difference). In FY18 , the gap closed to just 1.3 percent, with 72.3 percent of minorities and 71.0 percent of non- minorities receiving some form of financial aid. 139Table Three Students Receiving Financial Aid by Race, Ethnic ity and Minority Status: FY 2014 - FY 2018 Headcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial 18.8% 14 35.7% 14 57.1% 13 61.5% Two or More Races 239 FAIS Reports, FY 2014 - 2018FY 2018HAGERSTOWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE Students Receiving Financial Aid by Race, Ethnicity, and Minority Status FY 2017 Minority Status TotalFY 2014 FY 2016 FY 2015 Race 140The HCC Work Force The strategic value of diversity among the students, faculty, and local community, is recognized as the College strives to be a leader and catalyst for diverse social, ethnic, and educational experiences. Faculty and administrative position vacancies are typically advertised through minority resources such as Minority Resources Edition of Equal Employment and Civil Rights Journal, and National Minority Update. Additionally, the HR Recruitment Specialist attend s job and career fairs that typically attract large numbers of minorities at locations such as Bowie State University, Morgan State University, Coppin State University and Fort Detrick, Maryland. The College is benefiting from the aforemen tioned recruitment efforts to increase diversity in hiring faculty to provide role models for the increasingly diverse student population. According to the fall 2018 EDS report, 9.4 percent of all full- time employees identified themselves as a minority. Of full- time faculty, there were six minorities ( 7.5 percent), which is an improvement from the last three years. Of all non- faculty full -time employees in f all 2018, 21, or 10.1 percent , were minorities, a pe rcentage that has remained relatively flat over the last six years. Facing the challenge to recruit full -time faculty and administrators of color to provide positive role models and to help create a culturally diverse environment is an institutional priori ty. The region lacks cultural and ethnic opportunities, as well as a significant professional minority population found in the urban and metropolitan areas. Along with employee recruitment, the HR Office is responsible for new hire orientation and employe e training and professional development; and legal compliance with all federal, state and local regulations. One aspect of training for all employees focuses on prevention of discrimination and harassment via completion of an electronic module for annual recertification . PROCESS FOR REPORTING CAMPUS -BASED HATE CRIMES The safety and security of the College community are of vital concern to Hagerstown Community College. Hate crimes manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, disability, ethnicity, or national origin. As part of the efforts to control crime on the campus and to assure a safe environment for students, faculty and staff, the HCC Police Department prepares an Annual Security R eport in compliance with 20 United States Code section 1092 (f), the \"Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.\" The report reflects policies and services designed to provide a safe environment and set a standard of conduct which is most conducive for a safe college campus. The Campus Crime Statistics Act mandates the manner in which statistics are collected and the format in which statistics are published. The categories related to hate crimes on campus include race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity and disability. Since the implementation of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure Act, HCC has had no reportable incidents of any hate crimes. In the event that a hate crime occurs on campus, Campus Police will investigate all reported incidents occurring within their jurisdiction. All reported information will be treated as confidential and security over all police reports and files will be maintained . The Campus Police will assist victims of crimes occurring in other jurisdictions to the limit allowed by law. 141Progress Report on the Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity Submitted to the Maryland Higher Education Commission HARFORD COMMUNITY COLLEGE September 3, 2019 This progress report on Harford Community College's plan to improve cultural diversity is submitted as required by Education Article, \u00a711-406. A Summary of the Institution's Plan to Increase Cultural Diversity Harford Community College (HCC) has valued diversity since its inception more than 60 years ago. The HCC Cultural Diversity Committee (CDC) , created in 2012, was formed with the following specific purposes: 1. Review and update the College's Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity, as required by MHEC; 2. Assess the College's progress toward achieving the goals and implementing the plan; 3. Complete required annual reporting by stated due dates for Board of Trustees approval (MHEC progress report); 4. Identify those programs/services/activities that can have the greatest possible impacts on campus cultural diversity , and recommend how our resources might best be utilized and coordinated to fulfill the campus cultural diversity plan; 5. Identify barriers to achieving greater success in fulfilling the Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity and provide recommendations on how the College can overcome those barriers; 6. Assist in the preparation of funding requests to support cultural diversity activities; 7. Work with governance committees/councils, departments , and offices on promulgating positive cultural diversity practices; and 8. Serve as a clearinghouse and communications center for activities relating to cultural diversity on- and off-campus. The CDC's most recent Plan for Improving Cultural Diversity, 2017 -2020, was developed based on past plans as well as an assessment of current needs on campus. The plan simplifies and streamlines the efforts to improve cultural diversity by proposing the following two goals : 1) Increase campus dialogue on and engagement in critical cultural diversity issues, with an emphasis on deliberat e civility reflective of Harford Community College values, and 2) Employ a variety of assessment methods to understand the campus cultural diversity climate. Both goals are supported by a series of strategies in order to achieve progress. In 2018-2019, t he Cultural Diversity Committee also implemented several changes that incorporate the values of inclusion and equity into its Plan for Improv ing C ultural Diversity on campus. In the spring of 2019, the CDC voted to change its name to the Diversity, Inclusion, Culture, and Equity (DICE) Committee to reflect this new, deliberate emphasis. Review of Diversity Goals 142GOAL 1: Increase campus dialogue on and engagement in critical cultural diversity issues, with an emphasis on deliberate civility reflective of H arford Community College values. Strategy 1 : The DICE Committee plans to offer regular professional development for faculty and staff in critical areas to include Safe Zone training, culturally responsive instructional methods, and closing achievement gaps, as well as critical emerging diversity issues. The Safe Zone Committee was established to improve the campus climate and promote equity for LGBTQ+ students, staff, and faculty. Safe Zone Committee members also serve on DICE , and regularly offer two le vels of Safe Zone training to employees . Recently, DICE and the Safe Zone Committee were invited by the Office of Human Resources to consult on re -imagining the College's New Employee Orientation (NEO) . NEO is a comprehensive program for employees who have recently been hired by HCC. The newly -redesigned orientation is one week in length and include s two full workshops on Equity and Inclusion, as well as the first level of Safe Zone training . The first Equity and Inclusion training session for NEO was held in July 2019, with the majority of respondents requesting additional training on these topics. NEO Equity and Inclusion and Safe Zone training will be offered to the campus community beginning in August 2019; interested employees can sign up for a training session through the online training calendar. In the same manner, DICE will also implement follow -up Equity and Inc lusion training sessions in Fall 2019. Additionally, in May 2019, members of DICE offered a session at the daylong faculty professional development workshop \"Celebration of Teaching and Learning ,\" sponsored by the College's Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CETL ). The session was a highlight and review of the ways in which the Committee implemented its Country of Focus program ( see more below ), as well as an open call to faculty inviting them to participate in the Country of Focus program in the next academic year. DICE also specifically reached out to advisors from the College's non -credit division who work with GED and high school students, to confirm that this segment of the student population might also benefit from infusing the curriculum with an international focus. Strategy 2 : The DICE Committee works to increase opportunities for dialogue on critical cultural diversity issues through a variety of programming. DICE continued its work this year in providing monthly content for its \"Cultural Diversity Corner\" column in The Parliament Call , the newsletter of the Office of Academic Affairs . This year, the column highlighted topics such as gender pronouns, Women's History Month, supporting veteran students in the classroom , and the importance of international education. The column invites the campus community to implement suggested activities, reflect on sp ecific questions, and send feedback to DICE. Though The Parliament Call was unfortunately halted in March 2019 when the Vice President who originated it resigned, the \"Cultural Diversity Corner\" will continue as a feature in the campus' s weekly newsletter, News and Whooo's . In addition, DICE plans to build a webpage for its work, on which it will archive all past columns. Additionally, t he DICE Committee will offer a webinar on equity and inclusion at the faculty Professional Development Day (now referred to as \"Faculty Homecoming\" ) that will be held on August 21, 2019, prior to the start of the fall semester. 143 Finally, a successful guest lecture on the topic of Syria was held in the spring semester (more below). Strategy 3 : The DICE Committee strives to work with faculty to embed diversity in curriculum to help students to think globally, reinforcing the importance of factual information. The DICE Committee continued its discussion with the Accessibility Committee to implement a Universal Design for Learning study on campus. DICE also had a successful year in implementing its Country of Focus program; this program highlights one country every academic year and helps faculty bring issues related to that country into their classes . The country selected is usually one that has been featured in national and international news, with the intent of making current affairs more accessible to students. This year, the country selected was Syria. Faculty found multiple and interesting ways t o use materials related to Syria in psychology, economics, sociology, English, history, and literature classes. For example, psychology students studie d the trauma suffered by refugees of civil war, while literature classes studie d poetry in translation by Syrian poets. History students used Virtual Reality goggles to \"visit\" historic sites in Syria, while research writing students compared op -eds in major American newspapers that took opposing views on the current Syrian civil war. To prepare faculty, the Committee held an introductory session in August for Professional Development Day, and also organized a Professional Learning Community (PLC) in conjunction with CETL. The PLC was a learning community in which faculty shared ideas for how to implement the Country of Focus in that academic year and collaborated on sources. The campus Library compiled a detailed LibGuide on Syria, while the Committee built a Blackboard course in which to post PowerPoints, assignment sheets, and other materials created by Col lege faculty and staff . DICE plans to continue the collaboration with CETL this year for August's Faculty Homecoming, which will feature an introductory session for the Country of Focus for the 2019-2020 academic year. The new country of focus will be Honduras, which was chosen by DICE through a unanimous vote. In relation to its Country of Focus program, the DICE Committee held a very successful presentation and lecture on campus by Syrian -American journalist and civil rights lawyer Alia Malek. Malek is a journalist for magazines such as The Nation and papers such as The New York Times , as well as the author of The Country That Was Our Home: A Memoir of Syria. Over 100 people attended her presentation\u2014more than double what was expected \u2014and the event dr ew attendees from campus, the local community, and beyond. It was a highly successful event; students from several different courses participated, as several professors had linked assignments in their courses to the presentation, and many community members said they had attended because the Syrian civil war is in the news and they wanted to learn more. Strategy 4 : The Committee seeks to define and support mechanisms for augmenting student engagement in issues of diversity. The Committee continues its commitment to HCC's status as an Achieving the Dream (ATD) 144campus. DICE is especially committed to o ne of the seven ATD capacities : equity . The Cultural Diversity Committee's decision to change its name to the Diversity, Inclusion, Culture, and Equity Committee was in fact inspired by ATD's emphasis on equity. During the College's strategic planning process, which took place during the 2018- 2019 academic year, DICE advocated for changing the proposed value of \"Diverse Perspectives\" to \"Equity and Inclusion\" instead. DICE argued this change was critical to provide symmetry between the new strategic plan and the ongoing ATD initiative , both of which are committed to eradicating attainment gaps based on income, race, gender , and ethnicity. The value of \"Equity and Inclusion\" was adopted into the College's new strategic plan , which took effect on July 1, 2019. DICE has also begun collaborating with a group on campus that is drafting a concept paper to establish an Equity and Inclusion Center at HCC ; the plan is to move the proposal forward in the 2019-2020 academic year. DICE also administered a student survey in the Fall 2018 semester to ga uge areas in which the Committee might be able to engage students on issues of diversity (more below). Finally, DICE continues to co- sponsor and collaborate on programming on campus that increases student awareness of diversity. GOAL 2: Employ a variety of assessment methods to understand the campus cultural diversity climate. Strategy 1 : The Committee will employ a follow -up campus -wide survey to understand the campus climate; we will compare new results to results of the previous survey. As planned, DICE implemented a campus -wide Fall 2018 survey of students to assess their awareness and/or concerns regarding dive rsity on campus. The survey used the same questions asked in the 2014 survey, but added some additional questions (based on surveys administered to students by other Maryland schools, including the University of Maryland- College Park). Additionally, a text comment box was included for each question so that students would feel free to add to or clarify questions and responses as they saw fit. The survey was considerate of the current campus demographics of groups who have been traditionally and historically marginalized (see Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 bar graphs below): 145 The DICE Committee completed the analysis of the Fall 2018 survey data and compared results to the Spring 2014 survey data (more details are listed in Appendix D of this report ). The following points highlight key findings from the analysis: 1. Overall, there do not seem to be glaring issues signifying problems with the campus's cultural climate. S tudents generally reported that they feel diversity at HCC is \"Valued and Practiced ,\" which is a consistent finding in both 2014 and 2018. Students also largely reported the following: a. HCC provides a free open and welcoming environment. b. Students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds interact well at HCC. c. Students feel comfortable expr essing their racial and/or cultural identity at HCC . 1462. Additionally , students were asked the following question: \"What improvements, if any, can be made to enhance the level of acceptance and sensitivity for diverse students?\" The following themes were rep orted: Theme Comment count Race and ethnicity 28 Religion 5 Staff, faculty and classroom 55 Student life 66 Discussion 20 Gender 8 Age 11 Disability 6 It should be noted that the most prevalent theme was the \"Student Life\" theme. Overall, students called for more cultural events, discussions about race, and activities \u2014and even recommended a cultural center as well. 3. Students were also asked the following question: \"Within the past year, I have witnessed discrimination (for example, insulting or disparaging remarks) against others based on [Check all that apply].\" It should be noted that this question is asked in a general manner and does not refer to instances of discrimination at HCC specifically. Overall, the majority of students stated they have not witnessed any such remarks. However, there was an increase in students reporting that they witnessed remarks about \"Race\" from 12.9% in 2014 to 16.4% in 2018. These results underscore the importance of promoting continued education and dialogue around these issues at HCC and within the larger community. 4. We can conclude with quantitative evidence that students of color a t HCC feel comfortable saying what they think about issue s related to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, difference in abilities, age, political views, and/or economic status and f eel they belong at HCC at a statistically identical rate to white students. However, the survey also demonstrates (with more than 99.999% confidence) that students of color: a. Feel there are expectations about their academic performance; b. Feel they are ex pected to represent their group; c. Feel that there are no faculty members who represent their group; and d. Feel that they are the only person of their group more often than do white students. These will be themes/areas for the DICE C ommittee to work on in the 2019-2020 academic year , and to share with other departments and programs on campus. 147 Strategy 2 : The Committee will work to add cultural diversity climate questions to the graduation exit survey in order to assess the experiences of graduating Harford Community College students. The Committee has discussed this goal and is still working on ways to implement it. Strategy 3 : The Committee will work with others on campus to establish a process for capturing and responding to information regarding campus cultural diversity climate incidents. DICE has an agreement with the Office of Public Safety to funnel news about hate crime incidents to DICE in order to track whether trends on campus are emerging. The current process on reporting hate crimes is attached to this report. Effort s to Support Underrepresented Students Harford Community College values diversity among its students. HCC's goal is to serve the diverse needs of the county's population through its credit and noncredit programs. My College Success Network is a network of services, events, staff, and faculty geared toward empowering and supporting African American students. The Network was implemented in July 2014 to address the attainment gap that exists between African American and white students. While the program is open to all students, newly -enrolled African American students are specifically invited to participate. All newly -enrolled African American students are assigned to a Student Success Advisor. The Student Success Ad visor provides academic, career, and transfer planning services to students in all majors. Students within the network who require zero to three transitional courses or are low -income or first -generation students are invited to participate in academic coaching, an additional layer of support. Two full -time Academic Success Coaches meet bi -weekly with selected students to establish student success plans, monitor academic progress, and provide cognitive and non- cognitive strategies for success. Academi c coaching is offered as a series of individualized, one -credit courses : Success in College and Beyond, and Personalized Career Exploration. Scholarship money was allocated to cover the academic coaching course tuition and fees so that students do not need to pay for the course. All students in the Network are also connected to cultural programming coordinated through the affiliated Soar2Success Program. For most semesters, students who complete academic coaching are retained at higher rates from fall to fall, persist at higher rates from fall to spring, and earn higher grade point averages (GPA s) than comparison populations comprised of students who did not complete academic coaching. In fiscal year 2020, the My College Success Network will expand its focus from primarily African American students to all students of color. Brochures, marketing materials, and program updates are underway to ensure inclusion and support for all students at Harford Community College. 148My College Success Network Student Acad emic Achievement Semester MSCN Academic Coaching Student GPA Comparison Group of Students GPA Fall 2014 2.39 2.12 Spring 2015 2.05 1.85 Fall 2015 2.19 1.99 Spring 2016 1.79 1.96 Fall 2.24 2.21 Fall 2018 2.41 2.25 Retention and persistence rates for MCSN students also show promise.

The data listed in Appendix C represents the percentage of students served by race/ethnicity for the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 terms. A comparison of the data by terms shows that in Fall 2018 the Learning Center assisted a higher percent of minority students compared to the Fall 2017 term. African American students were the highest minority population serve d in both semesters. Efforts to Recruit and Retain Diverse Employees at HCC Harford Community College values diversity among its faculty and staff. According to the most recently available institutional data, of the 961 college employees (staff, administrators, and faculty), 14.9% are minorities (see chart below) . Employee Class Caucasian Minorities TOTAL # % # % Admin 26 89.7% 3 10.3% 29 Credit Faculty 275 89.3% 33 10.7% 308 Noncredit Faculty 98 89.9% 11 10.1% 109 Staff 419 81.4% 96 18.6% 515 TOTAL 818 85.1% 143 14.9% 961 As a college, we continue to work toward the goal of increasing this number. We have set a benchmark of 20% by Fall 2020. Human Resources continues to use targeted advertising both for under -represented groups and field- specific searches. The College routinely purchases online posting enhancements to reach diversity candidates. Examples include HigherEdJobs ' Diversity and Inclusion e -mails, weekly e -mails sent to more than 330,00 job seekers, and Social Media Upgrade; and The Chronicle of Higher 150Education's Diversity Network, which includes listings on sites such as DiversityandCareer.com, Diversity.com, and DiversityJobs.com. Further, the College recently renewed a contract with localjobnetwork.com, which distributes our postings to a wide variety of local minority, women's , and veteran's organizations. Human Resources works closely with search committee chairs to ensure a di verse pool of candidates and finalists for employment consideration and provides review and oversight for all hiring and promotion decisions to ensure fairness, equity, and commitment to the College's principles of diversity. The College's rate of minority employees has increased from 14.3% to 14.9%; the number of minority credit faculty has increased from 30 to 33, while the number of noncredit faculty has increased from 8 to 11. The College complies with requirements to complete an annual Affirmative Action Plan. Specifically regarding hiring and retention of diverse faculty, t he College's academic deans use strategies to encourage minority recruitment and hiring which include the use of personal contacts, professional associations and advisory board af filiations, direct advertising at institutions with large minority student enrollments, as well as the use of publications that target minorities. Some academic deans have mentored, advised, and supported minority faculty in their work and hired minority f aculty to work with incoming students over the summer to be strong role models. The Office of Human Resources continues to review the applicants selected for interviews by the search committees and makes recommendations to expand gender, age, and ethnic diversity when appropriate. The Human Resources Specialist meets individually with search committee chairs to provide training on the College's search process and online tools. Training includes encouragement to include a diverse group of individuals on sea rch committees to demonstrate a commitment to inclusion and educational equity. In addition, the Office of Human Resources is considering the possible implementation of two new initiatives . The first is an HCC branding initiative at assorted conferences or professional events in which faculty and others participate, as a way of promoting HCC to potential job candidates from underrepresented groups. This idea was first presented at a meeting of the Talent Management Committee, a group of faculty, staff, and administrators who work on, among other issues, ways of attracting and retaining diverse employees. The C ollege is also determining further resources for participating in statewide recruiting events with the H uman Resources MACC professionals' affinity group. Efforts to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness Harford Community College has a very active and successful Soar2Success Program, which helps students of color succeed in their studies and in college life. Some of Soar2Success's activities and events over the 2018-2019 academic year include: 151ICanSucceed - September 2018 ICan Succeed is a half-day empowerment program where students hear from graduates, returning students, faculty , and staff about how to navigate the academic and social demands of college. Students are strongly encouraged to attend. This year's keynote speaker was Jullien G ordon, co- author of The Other 4.0 That Really Matters and No All -Nighters. The Making of the King Holiday - January 2019 The documentary highlight s the life of Dr. Martin Luther King and the movement that led to congressional legislation establishing his birthday as a national holiday. The film feature s Coretta Scott King, Stevie Wonder, and other activists. HerStory: Amazing American Women Pioneers - February 2019 Through the use of live music, narration and archival video, this exhibit celebrated pioneers who overcame enormous odds and changed the course of history. The work highlight ed legends like Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Sara Winnemucca, Sonia Sotomayor and others. In addition to t he theatrical production, wax figures were on loan from the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum of Baltimore MD. Documentaries on the lives of Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell were shown throughout the semester. This event was sponsored by Soar2Success in conjunction with the Hays -Heighe House exhibit Votes for Women: Taking Our Place in Politics . Presentation from King Peggy - November 2018 Peggilene Bartel was working as a secretary at the Embassy of Ghana in Washington, DC, when she was told she had been chosen King of Otuam, a fishing village of 7,000 people. Born in Ghana and now a naturalized U.S. citizen, Bartels had visited relatives but had never lived in Otuam and was not prepared for the news that she had been chosen to succeed her uncle, the late king. Going back for centuries, all of the kings had been men. Her story is chronicled in King Peggy: An American Secretary, Her Royal Destiny, and the Inspiring Story of How She Changed an African Village and was chosen in 2013 for the One Maryland, One Book read. King Peggy's story is also being considered for a motion picture production. Among her accomplishments as the reigning chief, King Peggy has rebuilt the palace, built a high school, installed a water system, and pledged to empower women to care for their families and communities. A book signing was held immediately following the presentation. Green Book - April 2019 The \"Film For Thought \" series showcased Green Book , an Academy Award -winning film that tells the true story of an Italian -American who is hired to drive Dr. Don Shirley, a world- class African - American pianist, on a 1962 concert tour to the Deep South, relying on The Green Book to guide them to establishments deemed safe for African -Americans. Confronted with racism and danger \u2014as well as unexpected humanity and humor \u2014the two men are forced to set aside differences to survive a journey of a lifetime. Exploring Unintended Bias : \"Social and Personal Identities: Cultural Competency in Action\" - April 2019 This session was a collaboration between the Safe Zone, DICE , Disability Support Services, Emerging Leaders , and Student Wellness. The session e xplored how social identities (race, class, 152gender, sexuality, ability, etc.) shape our experiences on campus and in our communities. The workshop focused on the significance of \"identities \" in our everyday lives, and how they play into social norms, inherent biases, and systems of inequality. \"Choose Civility \" Campaign - Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 This campaign was undertaken in conjunction with the Harford County Public Library, Harford County Government, community agencies , and individuals to promote civility. The College's point - of-contact for the Choose Civility campaign is Ms. Sharoll Love. Accomplishments this year include the following: Civility banners purchased and placed in lobbies throughout campus; Distribution of lapel buttons, auto magnets and window clings; An article in The Parliament Call faculty newsletter ; Sidewalk chalking in front of and along the campus walkways; Student reflection on the last act of kindness they provided and received; Screening of Green Book ; and Sponsorship of Unintended Bias workshop. The newly named DICE Committee has promoted the value of cultural diversity , equity , and inclusion on the HCC campus in many ways. The DICE Committee has continued contributing a regular column, titled \" The Cultural Diversity Corner ,\" to the monthly faculty newsletter, The Parliament Call . Each column offers an explanation of the topic, examples of how it affect s students and campus life, research about the issue, and \"thoughts for reflection\" (applying the topic to real -life scenarios in the classroom), all as a way to foster further discussion. The Parliament Call was discontinued in March due to administrative leadership changes, but the column continues as a regular feature in HCC's campus newsletter, News and Whooo's. After the success of the Syria -themed event with journalist Alia Malek as part of the Country of Focus program, the DICE Committee has decided to host a speaker every spring to discuss that year's country. In 2019- 2020, the Committee has selected Honduras as the Country of Focus. The DICE Committee will also be organizing a PLC around this topic, to encourage faculty to embed the country in their courses and curricula. The DICE Committee works closely with CETL to hold regular professional development sessions for faculty around the topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion. DICE has worked on creating a webpage, which will feature an \"Equity and Inclusion Statement\" (which is still being crafted in conjunction with the ATD team , administration, and other constituencies on campus ). DICE has also implemented some technology improvem ents, moving much of its work to a new online forum in Microsoft 365 SharePoint and Teams , which allows committee members to edit documents and take surveys and polls. DICE has a representative on the campus' s newly formed Talent Management Committee, which seeks to review diversity in the hiring process and to ensure fairness and transparency in promotion. 153 List of Appendices A.

[1] 34 CFR 668.46 (c)(3) 156Appendix B Articles from the \"Cultural Diversity Corner,\" a monthly feature in The Parliament Call newsletter from the Office of Academic Affairs ) March 2019 \"Women's History Month\" by Dr. Lisa Tittle March is Women's History Month (WHM ), and this year is particularly special as 2020 is the centennial of the 19 Amendment giving women the right to vote, a right that took 100 years of tenacity and acumen to achieve. According to the National Women's History Alliance website, this year's th eme for WHM is \"Visionary Women: Champions of Peace and Nonviolence.\" Honorees this year include Deborah Tucker, the president of President of the Board of Directors of the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence; Dorothy Cotton, civil rights activist; and Zainab Salbi founder of Women for Women International. These are three of hundreds of women who work in big and small ways to improve the lives of women all over the world. Few would argue that knowing the significance of the contributions of women is an important part of history. One characteristic that all of these women share is the courage to use her voice to implement change, reduce marginalization based on gender, and improve access to information, education, and opportunity. The challenge is how to make these contributions relevant to today's students. How can the typical community college student relate to these daunting accomplishments? Thankfully, great women are using their voice to implement change all the time although it may not be on such a global scale as earning the right to vote or lobbying for policy that protects victims of domestic violence. Instead these women are raising children, caring for their elderly parents, working two jobs, earning degrees, serving in the armed forces, conducting research, or mentoring others. By adding their story and diversity to the workforce, campus, or neighborhood, these \"average\" women are also adding their voices and contributing to history as well. This semester, Hays Heighe House is hosting several events to highlight women's achievements and their contributions to society in areas such as politics, journalism, and literature. Please encourage your students (and yourself, of course) to attend. You can access the schedule of even ts here http://www.harford.edu/community/hays- heighe -house/events.aspx?o=10 . Be sure to thank the tenacious and intelligent women who collaborated to bring these educational opportunities to campus so that people could learn about voices from the past who shaped the future. 157February 2019 \"Choose Civility,\" by Sharoll Love In the spring of 2017 Harford Community College (HCC) articulated its vision on diversity and inclusion as \". . . active, intentional, and ongoing engagement . . . with the purpose of expanding knowledge, cognitive sophistication and empathetic understanding . . .\" This fall, HCC joined Harford County Public Library (HCPL), Harford County Government, and other organizations and individuals throughout the county to embrace and amplify civility. Modeled on Howard County, which began its campaign in 2006, \"Choose Civility\" is a grassroots effort \"designed to uplift our community by promoting respect, restraint and responsibility everywhere in Harford County, including the Internet.\" Guided by researched conducted by P. M. Forni, co-founder of the Johns Hopkins Civility Project, \"Choose Civility\" promotes thoughtfulness and mindfulness in behavior and speech. At the center of civility is empathy, the capacity to place oneself in another's position. A few ways civility manifests itself include showing politeness, patience, understanding, empathy, equality and justice. It may be demonstrated by such simple acts as saying hello to classmates and colleagues or by holding the door for someone. Civility is displayed when someone renders assistance to a person whose car has broken down on the side of the highway or when one helps a person stand up and regain composure after he or she has fallen to the ground! It is also manifested by refusing to silently witness bullying; by engaging in collective actions that address systemic inequities such as poverty, racism, macroaggression s, anti- Semitism and homophobia; or by supporting victims and survivors of sexual assault. Finally, there is a distinct difference between that which is legal and that which is moral. In February, we were honored to have Civil Rights Legend Rev. C. T. Vivian on campus. In service to humanity and exemplifying extraordinary civility, he, along with Dr. King, spent their lives dismantling de-jure segregation, addressing poverty and seeking justice for the oppressed. \"Civility\" messages will continue t o appear across the campus quad, as well as in the Library, Darlington Hall, Susquehanna Center, and along Joppa Hall walkways. Banners have been placed in campus buildings, and information tables have been set up in the Student Center for the distribution of auto magnets, buttons and window signs that amplify the message. Events for next semester include a program that addresses unintended biases and a blockbuster movie highlighting compassion, trustworthiness, tact, restraint, and equality. If you would like to pick up a car or window decal, or share an idea about a potential program, you may do so by stopping by the Office of Student Life. It is located on the lower level of the Student Center. 158In the county, HCPL is sponsoring the Human Librar y, where patrons \"borrow\" people instead of books, allowing individuals to share their unique experiences; the goal of this dialogue is to answer questions, challenge stereotypes, and promote understanding between the people who make up our community. Ripken Stadium is hosting The Longest Table, where one shares a meal with neighbors. Both events are intentional in facilitating interaction with and rethinking assumptions of others. For more information on these and other events, visit https://www.hcplonline.org/choosecivility/ 159Appendix C: Learning Center Usage Report for Visits by Race/Ethnicity The Learning Center provides support to currently -enrolled students in credit and continuing education courses. The following data represents the percentage of students served by race/ethnicity for the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 terms. A comparison of the data by terms shows that in Fall 2018 the Learning Center assisted a higher percent age of minority students compared to the Fall 2017 term. African A merican students were the highest minority population served in both semesters. The continued collaboration and partnerships among faculty Student A ffairs supports the increase in usage by minority populations. The Learning Center partners with My College Success Network, faculty, and the Athletics, Advising, and Student Life offices to promote and provide learning support services.

In Fall 2018, students only were surveyed by DICE, as employees were already being surveyed by the larger C ollege on these issues. As previously noted, in Fall 2018, a text comment box was added to every question so students would feel free to add to or clarify questions or responses if they chose to do so. (Please see section 1 for the Fall 2018 survey that was distributed to students through their student email account.) Student incentives were offered for student participation in the survey; students were randomly selected in a drawing to win one of five twenty- dollar gift cards to Wawa. The Spring 2014 survey yielded 1121 student responses , whereas the Fall 2018 survey yielded 1008 reported student responses (with approximately 809 students actually completing the survey) . Nevertheless, it should be noted that the relatively lower response rate does not impact the comparison of results between 2014 and 2018 because both sample sizes are sufficiently large. T -Tests were utilized to discern if there was a significant difference between the 2014 student responses and 2018 student r esponses. Please note that responses that yielded a significant difference will be reviewed as recommended by the College's Assessment and Planning team (where no significant difference was found, any changes were attributed to chance alone). Overall , it is apparent that HCC students feel that diversity at HCC is \"Valued and Practiced ,\" which is a consistent finding in both 2014 and 2018. Students also largely reported that HCC provides a free and open and welcoming environment, although there was a sl ight decrease within these areas when comparing 2014 results to 2018 results. There was a slight increase from 2014 to 2018 in students reporting that they felt comfortable discussing issues of exclusion or bias with their instructor or other employees at HCC , along with an increase in students reporting that they feel most comfortable on campus with people who look and sound like them. 163Please note the weighted average is a Likert scale --it represents each question's level of agreement. The scale is as follows: Level of Agreement Weight Strongly Disagree 0 Disagree 1 Undecided / Neutral 2 Agree 3 Strongly Agree 4 Please respond to the following statements using your day-to-day Answer Options Wtd Avg Wtd avg p-value Compared to 2014, 2018 response score is/has: HCC provides an environment for the free and open expression of ideas, opinions, and beliefs. 3.48 3.35 0.00 Si gnificantly lower My first impression of HCC's campus was that HCC seemed like a diverse, welcoming place. 3.41 3.29 0.00 Si gnificantly lower At this time, HCC seems like a welcoming environment for people of all races and backgrounds. 3.55 3.44 0.00 Si gnificantly lower Students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds interact well at HCC. 3.34 3.31 0.40 No significant difference At HCC, I have been discriminated against due to my race/ethnicity, either intentional or unintentional. 0.71 At HCC, I have witnessed discrimination due to race/ethnicity, either intentional or unintentional. 0.87 I feel comfortable discussing issues of exclusion or bias with my instructor or other employees at HCC. 2.89 2.99 0.02 Si gnificantly higher I feel comfortable expressing my racial and/or cultural identity at HCC. 3.24 3.25 0.91 N o significant difference I feel most comfortable on campus when I am with people who look and sound like me. 1.88 2.27 0.00 Si gnificantly higher At HCC, I know where to go to discuss issues of exclusion or bias. 2.44 2.48 0.39 No significant difference2014 2018 164 165 166 167 Students were also asked the following question: \"Within the past year, I have witnessed discrimination (for example, insulting or disparaging remarks or behaviors about )... [ Check all that apply ].\" It should be noted that this question is asked in a general manner and does not specifically reference instances of discrimination at HCC. Overall, the majority of students stated they have not witnessed any such remarks. However, there was an increase in students reporting that they witnessed remarks about \"Race \" from 12.9% in 2014 to 16.4% in 2018 (see table below). These results underscore the importance of promoting continued education and dialogue around these issues at HCC and within our community. There was also a decrease in students reporting that they witnessed insulting of disparaging remarks about \"Other ,\" from 6.7% in 2014 to 2.6% in 2018 ( see \"other\" comment themes below). 12.9%16.4% 6.7% 2.6% 0%5%10%15%20% 2014 2018Within the past year, I have witnessed insulting or disparaging remarks or behaviors about: Race Other \"Other\" Comment themes 2014 Count 2018 Count Religion 15 1 Personal Appearance 9 0 Age 5 1 Gender 5 2 Disability 4 1 Race 3 3 Ethnicity 2 3 Military/Veterans 1 0 Education level 0 1 Total directly related comments 44 12 168 As noted in the chart above, there was a general decrease in students ' responses from 2014 to 2018 in the following \"Other\" themes: religion, personal appearance, age, gender, disability, and military/veterans , with religion being the largest decrease from 15 comments in 2014 to 1 comment in 2018. Student were also asked the following : \"Within the past year, I have been the target of insulting or disparaging remarks or behaviors about...[C heck all that apply ]\". Overall, the majority of students generally reported that they have not experienced any such remarks in 2014 (82.9%) and in 2018 (84.5%).

(Please note that the decrease in the perception that populations students belong to are \"missing completely\" from the College environment is a positive result and connotation.) Once the decrease in perceived representation in publications from 2014 to 2018 was discovered , additional analys es were performed comparing the perceptions of white students and students of color. Results indicate that there is >99.9999% confidence that students of color feel they are represented in the College's publications at a lower level than do white students (see next page ). -5.0%p4.9%p7.4%p6.2%p -3.3%p -10.0%p-5.0%p0.0%p5.0%p10.0%p Publications Curriculum Events Faculty Missing CompletelyChange in perceived representation (2014 - 2018) 1702018 Deeper Dive: Representation in College's Publications Yes No Total Yes% White Students 350 242 592 0.591216 Students of Color 118 157 275 0.429091 p- value 0.0001 Students of color feel they are represented in the College's publications at a level significantly lower than do white students.

Staff Faculty Students Visitors to campus Administrators Results reveal that students generally feel respected by staff, faculty, students , and administrators (see chart below). However, there were some decreases from 2014 to 2018 that were noted for faculty (94.9% in 2014 to 92.6% in 2018) and students (90.9% in 2014 and 86.2% in 2018). 171 Students were asked the following question: \"What improvements, if any, can be made to enhance the level of acceptance and sensitivity for diverse students?\" The following themes were reported: Theme Comment count Race and ethnicity 28 Religion 5 Staff, faculty and classroom 55 Student life 66 Discussion 20 Gender 8 Age 11 Disability 6 It should be noted that the most prevalent theme was the \"Student Life\" theme. Overall, students called for more cultural events, discussions about race, and activities , and even recommend ed a cultural center as well. Please see student comments in sections 2-9; note that a comment can be classified under more than one theme. Student demographics were relatively similar in Spring 2014 and Fall 2018 (see charts on next page).

Please elaborate: COMMENT BOX 177Section 2 Student Life Themes Perhaps organizing more events that allows everyone to come together and express their culture and educate others about their background or themselves as an individual It can encourage relationships with people and create a more welcoming environment withi n HCC campus Have more events to get students involved Have more posters or activities within the school make more activities for the community not only one group of people more on campus students activities More activities in the Student center Maybe more clubs or groups that meet to discuss diversity more basketball activities More student events to help socialize Well I feel like the fact that that Harford Community College is doing okay in terms of diversity IF you are considering the fact that its in Harford County Harford County is largely white and most of HCCs students are from Harford County Diversity should be better maybe not just in numbers and in quotas but in centering people of color and their voices and experiences in event talk s school publications in financial aid award programs etc I feel like this has happened some in the past couple of years which is a good start but it would be amazing to see more! In addition to racial diversity however Ive seen a lack of gender divers ity that includes trans experiences there are no gender neutral restrooms that I know of the LGBT org doesnt really host any events and I dont see many people that seem Gender Non-Conforming or Trans like myself Albeit sometimes its not something you can s ee but I havent come across anything trans -related in events publications resource lists and accommodations (like name changes that is different than a students legal name on student IDs in class rosters etc and gender neutral restrooms) That being said I havent felt unsafe or attacked because of my trans identity at HCC aside from the nervousness in bathrooms I feel in EVERY public restroom (not just HCCs) Its more about lack of representation However that is only my experience Ive been blessed with professors that respect my pronouns and gender identity That may not be everyones experience Im not sure Ive mostly seen people with Autism get bullied so possibly having some awareness events or something might help? People dont understand Autism or gather that they might need to be open-minded and be more patient with people regardless of whether or not they know a person has a disability In the student center it would be cool if there was a cultural center Maybe a cultural day / event that has stations to teach the TRUTH about each different race religion group ect More progressive ideas from a vocal and diverse staff so students can hear that their peers are accepting and open -minded to the various cultures throughout campus More focus on anti -bullying not just cultural diversity and discrimination add diversity in some school events When braking students into groups consider group dynamics particularly where clinicals are concerned 178HCC hosting more events that center around panel discussions and conversations about race identity etc Everyone regardless of cultural should be treated equally Have more diverse cultural events I cant think of any HCCs acceptance of all cultures is gre at! The college should be careful in its policies and culture to prevent pursuing diversity excessively as it can lead to a sort of tunnel vision that discriminates against majority groups in the attempt to acheive just representation for minority groups The college should also practice this with thoughts and ideas as well preventing discrimination against groups of particular religious political or scientific beliefs and opinions (unless those beliefs explicitly violate the colleges policies or standards of course) There should be more events centered around what makes us diverse More open activities that encourage diversity such as cultural exhibitions and sports There should be student organizations that increase diversity There should also be student activities to increase awareness and importance of diversity More cultural events Have cultural events for different ethnics groups for an example have an food tasting to engage students of different cultural to their native background and encouraging other students learn about other cultures have events that bring everyone together no matter what demographic we fit into a march for our lives would bring us together as STUDENTS we would come together regardless of any other factors You could do cultu ral events More engagement through social activities I do not think anything serious improvements need to be made HCC is very good at being accepting and sensitive to culture and race I feel as though a lot of this has to come down to the students and the way they were raised in this environment The school offers events and knowledge to help create a diverse atmosphere but it comes down to the students to really aim for it educate yourself about diverse groups or groups other than your own No room fo r ignorance in this day and age Events ran by students HCC does have a good variety of cultural students but the area is still predominantly Caucasian therefore not all the time I feel like I can relate and interact with people that look like me But it also depends on my schedule and my peers schedules as well more events more diverse student activities Increases the amount of student activities throughout the year so people have a better chance of getting to know other students and making new frien ds More Clubs that support the campuses diversity more events that support and empower our campuses diversity it is nice to have the flags of diverses countries as HCC does already the different tea time events at the Hays -Heighe House is a good example of knowing more about foreign countries and culture have more events that talk about diversity 179As a non -credit 65+ year continuing education student it's difficult to comment since I don't get to spend time with a diversified gro up on a regular basis If it seems to be an issue maybe host more events regarding those groups that feel excluded in an effort to bring the issue to a head and to correct it Maybe a mandatory diversity acceptance event? More cultural events I don't k now Student activities has been doing a wonderful job on talking more 180Section 3 Staff, Faculty, and Classroom Themes Make the computer class into section by divide four part that are 15 weeks each for old people Make mini class for old people with learning problems Make 15 week classes into thirty week classes people have more time to study take test and do homework I like the idea of mini classes Each subject is broken up into small area will be able to pass The people will get a certificate and not feel like a loser The cutting down on time between classes is ineffective for students with disablilities Encourage a code of conduct in the classrooms of fairness Helpers for language barriers with difficult classes Have op en communication with students and teachers Have more diverse classes by bringing in more students of color As a member of the general population (cis straight white middle class female) I am not one to ever need these improvements but as a student at hcc I have experienced plenty of diversity I have had classmates and professors that were very diverse and have only had one negative experience with a fellow student when I talking about trans people's I have never seen or experienced anything negative toward the diversity here at hcc Put together people of same races and ages in classrooms It gets lonely sometim es when you are the only elderly or black African in the classroom More classes to teach people about black history and how this world was also built on the things that was created by black people Have teachers that aren't racist and don't insult your r eligion if it's not what they believe Please change the weighting grades for the whole class In addition to racial diversity however Ive seen a lack of gender diversity that includes trans experiences there are no gender neutral restrooms that I know of the LGBT org doesnt really host any events and I dont see many people that seem Gender Non-Conforming or Trans like myself Albeit sometime s its not something you can see but I havent come across anything trans -related in events publications resource lists and accommodations (like name changes that is different than a students legal name on student IDs in class rosters etc and gender neutral restrooms) That being said I havent felt unsafe or attacked because of my trans identity at HCC aside from the nervousness in bathrooms I feel in EVERY public restroom (not just HCCs) Its more about lack of representation However that is only my experience Ive been blessed with professors that respect my pronouns and gender identity That may not be everyones experience teachers understanding to students personal lives Maybe a cultural day / event that has stations to teach the TRUTH about each different race religion group ect More progressive ideas from a vocal and diverse staff so students can hear that their peers are accepting and open -minded to the various cultures throughout campus Focus on class room management regarding obnoxious acting out stu dents Eliminate innuendo snyde jokes by faculty I think the professors need to be taught to care more where to go is racial profiled bring more diversity to teaching staff 181Im only on campus for night classes Im satisfied with the diversity in the bu ildings and classes Im in Practice what is expected by all staff faculty and admin Professors dont show bias in their opinions so students can make their own Sensitivity training for professors more emphasis on diversity within the HCC Community Have open discussions in different classes Make sure professors know the importance of being accepting of ALL of their students and treat everyone with equal respect as well as letting students who seem troubled know that they can talk to them Maybe have more diverse professors more diverse classrooms Teaching people about the sensitivity Make more evening classes available for older students returning to HCC Working adults cannot attend classes in the middle of the workday Diverse teachers I thin k everything is well diverse There are some classes in which I am the only black person so it was a bit uncomfortable initially but you cant help enrollment The classes should have more of a mix instead of being predominantly white Also there should be mo re nonwhite minority's teachers Allow unnecessary political discussion in class to have more then just one sided liberal ideas that insult republicans and anyone else who disagrees with the liberal agenda (mainly professors) More Hispanic people on staff and in recruiting measures All students should if comfortable expressing their beliefs as long as they are not offense Teachers should not put their personal beliefs in there lectures as facts Increasing ethnic diversity in administration faculty staff and in the student community is always leads to a more inclusive academic society Thats exciting and facilitates innovative creative productive holistic thinking and inspires positivity about the future! Teachers need to express all views and not give a ny opinion so that students can choose But I haven't really seen this only heard of it happening Allow those who are in continuing education classes (or have children involved) use the Fitness facility for a small fee The homeschooling community is not represented in the college we are forced to go to Cecil or Baltimore County for classes have more of a diverse staff More classes for them to take together so they know they arent alone Have a discussion of the issues that can arise with diversity wi thin classrooms It should be a safe environment to discuss in Encouraging a diverse student body faculty and administrative inclusion Better respect in the classroom towards students with learning disabilities Faculty seemed to be more aged discriminat ory; more faculty awareness through in -house seminars of their bias in this regard In one class I used to take the instructor slanted the discussion in his direction all the time The nursing school faculty needs to be diverse Having a more relaxed space and environment to relax outside of classes Limit remarks made by professors that are culturally racially and socioeconomically biased I've had two professors in the past year who have exhibited these 182more minority staff and teachers Stop stressing the differences between students It gives them anxiety and causes self esteem issues Hence the body augmentation and self mutilation/ suicidiology isses this generation faces Teach only inclusion without any reason Just because your \"you\" I enjoy your company I have some students who come from different backgrounds in my classes and often I feel as if they are less likely to speak in class because the teachers struggle to understand them More open openmindness amongst staff Mor e diversity In programs IE nursing not just students but staffing programs helping lgbtq+ students on campus and in the classrooms Teachers being more active about disciplining students who make disrespectful remarks to people of color different sexual orientation or gender More class activities and discussions about PWI's and what it's pike for the minority students who go there 183Section 4 Race & Ethnicity Themes Put together people of same races and ages in classrooms It gets lonely sometimes when you are the only elderly or black African in the classroom Have teachers that aren't racist and don't insult your religion if it's not what they believe In addition to racial diversity however Ive seen a lack of gender diversity that includes trans experiences there are no gender neutral restrooms that I know of the LGBT org doesnt really host any events and I dont see many people that seem Gender Non-Conforming or Trans like myself Albeit sometimes its not something you can see but I havent come across anything trans -related in events publications resource lists and accommodations (like name changes that is different than a students legal name on student IDs in class rosters etc and gender neutral restrooms) That being said I havent felt unsafe or attacked because of my trans identity at HCC aside from the nervo usness in bathrooms I feel in EVERY public restroom (not just HCCs) Its more about lack of representation However that is only my experience Ive been blessed with professors that respect my pronouns and gender identity That may not be everyones experience Maybe a cultural day / event that has stations to teach the TRUTH about each different race religion group ect HCC hosting more events that center around panel discussions and conversations about race identity etc where to go is racial profiled The college should be careful in its policies and culture to prevent pursuing diversity excessively as it can lead to a sort of tunnel vision that discriminates against majority groups in the attempt to acheive just representation for minority groups The college should also practice this with thoughts and ideas as well preventing discrimination against groups of particular religious political or scientific beliefs and opinions (unless those beliefs explicitly violate the colleges policies or standards of cours e) considering i am white i do not have any concern because of the equality with others on campus of different races allow for MORE student organizations and/or clubs and/or discussion that represent sexual orientations gender identities race and backgrounds based on home life and/or a persons socioeconomic status i never hear anybody talk about these things other than in the distinguished clubs which i view as a problem especially because of our current political and societal climate Have cultural event s for different ethnics groups for an example have an food tasting to engage students of different cultural to their native background and encouraging other students learn about other cultures Employees at student center help desk could be kinder and rece ptive of ALL races of students I do not think anything serious improvements need to be made HCC is very good at being accepting and sensitive to culture and race Racially diverse advertising BLACK / BI RACIAL REPRESENTATION AND CLUBS BLACK GUEST SPEAKERS HBCU COLLEGE FAIRS BLACK STUDENT UNION!! HANGING UP A BUNCH OF FLAGS DOES NOT MEAN THE CAMPUS IS DIVERSE Stop focusing on diversity of race/gender/sexuality and start focusing on diversity o f ideas 184I wish the students were less racist and more diverse The classes should have more of a mix instead of being predominantly white Also there should be more nonwhite minority's teachers Increasing ethnic diversity in administration faculty staff and in the student community is always leads to a more inclusive academic society Thats exciting and facilitates innovative creative productive holistic thinking and inspires positivity about the future! more minority clubs or organizations Have more e vents that include and encourage students of all race and religion to participate in with each other And have students break apart from their usual friend/culture groups to do fun activities I think everyone is pretty accepting and sensitive of all cult ures and races already Have more activities not just targeted towards certain ethnicities but to include everyone To me I think not sitting racially divided at the cafe would make a huge difference Limit remarks made by professors that are culturally racially and socioeconomically biased I've had two professors in the past year who have exhibited these more minority staff and teachers Im not sure if there is one but maybe a diversity fair or cultu ral fair two times a year (once a semester) to spread racial/cultural awareness I noticed this community college mostly has young people my own age and many white people My old community college of Reading pa included a much more diverse community Student of all ages ethnic backgrounds and many spoke Spanish I really liked having so many different people around me with a diverse community rather then this but I am used to this from attending a university as well I dont think theres much that can be done be cause it depends on the demographics More class activities and discussions about PWI's and what it's pike for the minority students who go there 185Section 5 Discussion Theme Have open communication with students and teachers Maybe more clubs or groups that meet to discuss diversity Im not sure Ive mostly seen people with Autism get bullied so possibly having some awareness events or something might help? People dont understand Autism or gather that they might need to be open-minded and be more patient with people regardless of whether or not they know a person has a disability More progressive ideas from a vocal and diverse staff so students can hear that their peers are accepting and open -minded to the various cultures throughout campus HCC hosting more events that center around panel discussions and conversations about race identity etc More open activities that encourage diversity such as cultural exhibitions and sports Denounce the current toxic political climate and make sure that it does not spill over into the student body if the conversation comes up Diversity is a rich environment for all allow for MORE student organizations and/or clubs and/or discussion that represent sexual orientations gender identities race and backgrounds based on home life and/or a persons socioeconomic status i never hear anybody talk about these things other than in the distinguished clubs which i view as a problem especially because of our current political and societal climate Have open d iscussions in different classes Make sure professors know the importance of being accepting of ALL of their students and treat everyone with equal respect as well as letting students who seem troubled know that they can talk to them Continued talks and o pen conversations I do not have much interaction or intelligent conversation discuss differences I believe the idea of where to go to discuss differences should be made more widely known to the students Equal rights i have a disability and i wanted an advisor ( a normal advisor) not a disability mentor that's cool i do have a disability but i think it should be our choice if we wanna be seen in an office that has a big disability sign up if you guys ACTUALLY wanna do something about that maybe instead of having open glass door and windows make students feel comfortable walking into a disability office where they don't have to be worried if someone they know sees you in the office My personal opinion on it i would but black curitans up and allow students to walk from the back and not through disability i hope you guys can actually work on equal rights I got told that if i wanted a different advisor I'd lose all disability support accommodations which i don't think is fair If i had a choice by now I'm sure I would've been moved on from Hcc but unfortunately i don't have a choice but to stay To not imposed better treatment to any single community To simply promote acceptance integrity and open minded -ness AND do not make a big deal of gender identification More open and helpful for older working students with family Allow unnecessary political discussion in class to have more then just one sided liberal ideas that insult republicans and anyone else who disagrees with the liberal agenda (mainly professors) I don't know Student activities has been doing a wonderful job on talking more openly and accepting of diverse students I'm not exactly the best person to tell you I am disabled but I haven't personally witnessed any discrimination 186Have a discussion of the issues that can arise with diversity within classrooms It should be a safe environment to discuss in In one class I used to take the instructor slanted the discussion in his direction all the time More open openmindness amongst staff More diversity In programs IE nursing not just students but staffing More class activities and discussions about PWI's and what it's pike for the minority students who go there 187Section 6 Age Theme older adults are ignored or discriminated against by HCC Put together people of same races and ages in classrooms It gets lonely sometimes when you are the only elderly or black African in the classroom Equal rights i have a disability and i wanted an advisor ( a normal advisor) not a disability mentor that's cool i do have a disability but i think it should be our choice if we wanna be seen in an office that has a big disability sign up if you guys ACTUALLY wanna do something about that maybe instead of having open glass door and windows make students feel comfortable walking into a disability office where they don't have to be worried if someone they know sees you in the office My personal opinion on it i would but black curitans up and allow students to walk from the back and not through disability i hope you guys can actually work on equal rights I got told that if i wanted a different advisor I'd lose all disability support accommodations which i don't think is fair If i had a choice by now I'm sure I would've been moved on from Hcc but unfortunately i don't have a choice but to stay Make more evening classes available for older students returning to HCC Working adults cannot attend classes in the middle of the workday More open and he lpful for older working students with family Allow unnecessary political discussion in class to have more then just one sided liberal ideas that insult republicans and anyone else who disagrees with the liberal agenda (mainly professors) More hands on ac tivities that welcome all ages & genders Faculty seemed to be more aged discriminatory; more faculty awareness through in -house seminars of their bias in this regard More opportunities for older ( over 40) students to meet at times they attend school usu ally evening and Saturday Holding more events and gathering of people can truly bring people together and remind everyone that everyone is equal and there is nothing wrong with being different I noticed this community college mostly has young people my own age and many white people My old community college of Reading pa included a much more diverse community Student of all ages ethnic backgrounds and many spoke Spanish I really liked having so many different people around me with a diverse community rather then this but I am used to this from attending a university as well I dont think theres much that can be done because it depends on the demographics 188Section 7 Gender Theme Have teachers that aren't racist and don't insult your religion if it's not what they believe In addition to racial diversity however Ive seen a lack of gender diversity that includes trans experiences there are no gender neutral restrooms that I know of the LGBT org doesnt really host any events and I dont see many people that seem Gender Non-Conforming or Trans like myself Albeit sometimes its not something you can see but I havent come across anything trans -related in events publications resource lists and accommodations (like name changes that is different than a students legal name on student IDs in class rosters etc and gender neutral restrooms) That being said I havent felt unsafe or attacked because of my trans identity at HCC aside from the nervousness in bathrooms I feel in EVERY public restroom (not just HCCs) Its more about lack of representation However that is only my experience Ive been blessed with professors that respect my pronouns and gender identity That may not be everyones experience allow for MORE student organizations and/or clubs and/or discussion that represent sexual orientations gender identities race and backgrounds based on home life and/or a persons socioeconomic status i never hear anybody talk about these things other than in the distinguished clubs which i view as a problem especially because of our current political and societal climate Stop focusing on diversity of race/gender/sexuality and start focusing on diversity of ideas To not imposed better treatment to any single community To simply promote acceptance integrity and open minded -ness AND do not make a big deal of gender identification I wish the students were less racist and more diverse More hands on activities that welcome all ages & genders Teachers being more active about disciplining students who make disrespectful remarks to people of color different sexual orientation or gender 189Section 8 Disability Theme The cutting down on time between classes is ineffective for students with disablilities More attention could be brought to places where students could seek assistance (ie learning or disability services) Im not sure Ive mostly seen people with Autism get bullied so possibly having some awareness events or something might hel p? People dont understand Autism or gather that they might need to be open-minded and be more patient with people regardless of whether or not they know a person has a disability Equal rights i have a disability and i wanted an advisor ( a normal advisor ) not a disability mentor that's cool i do have a disability but i think it should be our choice if we wanna be seen in an office that has a big disability sign up if you guys ACTUALLY wanna do something about that maybe instead of having open glass door and windows make students feel comfortable walking into a disability office where they don't have to be worried if someone they know sees you in the office My personal opinion on it i would but black curitans up and allow students to walk from the back and not through disability i hope you guys can actually work on equal rights I got told that if i wanted a different advisor I'd lose all disability support accommodations which i don't think is fair If i had a choice by now I'm sure I would've been moved on from Hcc but unfortunately i don't have a choice but to stay I don't know Student activities has been doing a wonderful job on talking more openly and accepting of diverse students I'm not exactly the best person to tell you I am disabled but I haven't p ersonally witnessed any discrimination Better respect in the classroom towards students with learning disabilities 190Section 9 Religion Theme Have teachers that aren't racist and don't insult your religion if it's not what they believe Maybe a cultural day / event that has stations to teach the TRUTH about each different race religion group ect The college should be careful in its policies and culture to prevent pursuing diversity excessively as it can lead to a sort of tunnel vision t hat discriminates against majority groups in the attempt to acheive just representation for minority groups The college should also practice this with thoughts and ideas as well preventing discrimination against groups of particular religious political or scientific beliefs and opinions (unless those beliefs explicitly violate the colleges policies or standards of course) I think festivals from other religions should be celebrated It will bring a great atmosphere and fun on the campus Have more events th at include and encourage students of all race and religion to participate in with each other And have students break apart from their usual friend/culture groups to do fun activities 191 Howard Community College 2019 Cultural Diversity Plan Report Howard Co mmunity C ollege ( HCC) has had a plan for diversity, inclusion, and equity in place for nearly 30 years .

F. Students - HCC recognizes the critical role of an educational institution in preparing its students to become contributing members and leaders within a global community. In support of the college's mission/vision/values, through instruction and programming, support for a diverse community, and examples by faculty and staff, the college will encourage students to: 1. be respectful of all people and become advocates for the respectful treatment of others; 2. cultivate an appreciation for the differences of others; 3. explore and seek out opportunities to learn about different points of view and human experiences; 4. develop a set of communication competencies to help improve interactions with people of diverse backgrounds; and 5. attend college-sponsored and community diversity programs. 194According to Education Ar ticle \u00a711-4 06 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, an institution that alr eady has a pro gram of cultur al diversity must develop and implem ent a plan for improving the pro gram. A numbe r of recomme ndations were m ade in last year's report to the board of trust ees. The following are some outcomes. Expanded the annual diversity week program to include more co- curricular offerings by faculty and staff members. Began the development of the diversity working guide with tips for cultural sensitivity, inclu sive language, and positioning for social justice. Coordinated programming on campus that included topics including: campus climate, cultural competency, LGBTQIA concerns, immigration, implicit bias, international education, structural racism, and working with students with disabilities. Increased programmatic synergies with Ambiciones, Career Links, Howard P.R.I.D.E., Silas Craft Collegians, and TRIO -Student Support Services. Sponsored the Modern African and Middle Eastern Literature Colloquium for 2018-19. Acquired new diversity training materials with a focus on the topics of cultural competence, gender equity and identity, intersectionality, microaggressions, privilege , and social justice. Increased training for the diversity committee members and college community was offered including featured training on: Building Trust in Diverse Work Environments; Experiencing and Managing Imposter Syndrome; Microaggressions in the Workplace and Classroom ; and Search Committee Procedures. Participated in s tatewide diversity roundtable meetings that have provided a strong platform for networking, as well as learning about other diversity programs. Sponsored Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Week with co - curricular programming that exposed students and the campus community to the contributions of historically black institutions. The week featured a HBCU Transfer Fair with over 20 institutions, including Maryland's four HBCUs. Established the hate and bias incident response team as a subcommit tee of the college's diversity committee to coordinate educational responses to incidents of hate and bias on- campus in conjunction with existing cross -functional teams that address behavioral interventions, student conduct, and employee well -being. While the HCC plan for diversity, inclusion, and equity is already very compreh ensive, and is enhanced ea ch year , there are some add itional i mprovements t hat can be explored . The following are recomm endations for improving HCC's plan for diversity, inclusion, and equity by May 1, 2020: 1951) Implementing the revised plan for diversity, inclusion, and equity and committee policies to effectively position the committee as campus thought leaders in promoting a culture of diversity , equity, and inclusion. 2) Incr ease the o fferings of future diver sity trainings and workshop s. Suggested topics in the upcoming academic year include: immigration, cultural competency, drug use and abuse, diversity in the workplace, free -speech and intellectual discourse. 3) Increase online diversity trainings and programs to expand diversity training opportunities to a larger group of the college community. 4) Contin ue to seek out additi onal meeting times, lo cations and p artnerships f or diversit y events to accommoda te the growing needs of the college. Staff mee tings are also a possible time to h old a diversity activity, particula rly for smaller offices where coverag e may be an iss ue. 5) Continue supporting the office of student life and counseling and career services on \"Food for Thought,\" a monthly discussion series on diversity related topics for the campus community. 6) Continue the expansion of programming and outreach to increase students' exposure to historically black and minority serving institutions to include increased promotion of articulation agreements between Maryland's four HBCUs, additional college tours, and on- campus exposure. 7) Expand opportunities for faculty/staff discussions on diversity related topics, including sponsoring faculty -led reading circles on topics including: immigration, multicultural awareness, at -promise students, and privilege. 8) Implement key recommendations from interviews and surveys of minority employees by the human resources office and the diversity committee. Efforts to Increase Traditionally Underrepresented Groups The student body at HCC is diverse. For fall 2018: RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP n % American Indian/Alaskan Islander 0 0% White 3256 34.4% 2 or More Races 502 5.3% Unknown 378 4.0% As the college examines the progress of those students through the programs, there were some performance gaps. To close those gaps, the college sponsors three initiatives. 1. The Silas Craft Collegians Program (SCCP) is a comprehensive academic leadership, learning community launched in F iscal Year (FY) 2001, specifically 196designed for recent high school graduates who desire the benefits of group centered learning, smaller class sizes and academic support which allows them to reach their true academic potential. The goal of the program is to support the successful completion of an associate's degree or transfer into the a timely manner. A select group of students matriculate through the program together as a learning community, receiving personalized academic support, personal development opportunities, scholarship support, mentoring/coaching and peer reinforcement. Performance metrics include: Retention: One Year After Entry Fall 2016 to Spring 2017: first -time SCCP students: 30.76% (n =16/52) Met benchmark of 30.7 percent . Two Years After Entry Fall 2016 to Spring 2018: first -time SCCP students: 58.3% SCCP students: 23.7% (n =14/59) Exceeded benchmark of 15.6 percent. Three Years After Entry Fall 2015 to Spring 2019: first -time SCCP students: 15.6% SCCP students: 16% (n =8/50) Exceeded benchmark of 15.6 percent. Fall to Spring R etention Fall 2018 to Spring 2019: first -time SCCP students: 84% (n=42/50) Did not meet benchmark of 90 percent. Graduation and Transfer Rate = 45.8% at 3 -years. Craft Class 16 Entering Fall 2016 (n=11/24) Exceeds benchmark of 35 percent. 2. Howard P.R.I.D.E. was established to help close the achievement gap of black males, who are the most \"at -risk\" population within the institution. The program began in fall 2012. It provide s student succes s services to Black male students to assist participants in maintaining good academic standing (a minimum of 2.0 grade- point average), to complete developmental math requirements, and to increase their retention, transfer and graduation rates. Assistance w ith math, particularly developmental math, is a key component of the program. Another significant offering of the program is mentoring. The program helps students develop leadership and personal skills, such as public speaking and interviewing for a job. The program's Black Male Summit is designed to 1) listen to students as they describe their experiences at HCC; 2) identify obstacles that may stand in the way of Black male student success at the college; 3) implement suggestions for improving HCC services and offerings; and 4) provide an opportunity for students to network. In academic year 2018-19 , Howard P.R.I.D.E. served 199 students. Performance metrics include: 197Retention Rate Benchmark: 80 percent of HCC students who participated in Howard P.R.I.D.E. who were enrolled for fall semester and who returned the following spring semester. 78 percent (89/114) retention rate for 2016- 2017 79 percent (125/159) retention rate for 2017- 2018 74 percent (148/199) retention rate for 2018- 2019 Academic Success Rates: 75 percent of students who participated in Howard P.R.I.D.E. will have a fall or spring term GPA of 2.0 or higher. 55 percent (61/110) achieved a 2.0 or higher in fall 2016 47.6 percent (58/123) achieved a 2.0 or higher in spring 2017 79.0 percent ( 148/188) achieved a 2.0 or higher in fall 2017 54.4 percent (87/160) achieved a 2.0 or higher in spring 2018 76.0 percent (151/199) achieved a 2.0 or higher in fall 2018 Success Rate (developmental education math) Benchmark: 60 percent of the students who receive tutoring will earn a \"C\" or better grade in the course(s) for which they were tutored. 68 percent (15/22) success rate for fall 2016 65 percent (22/34) success rate for spring 2017 60 percent (18/30) success rate for fall 2017 60 percent (29/48) success rate for spring 2018 53 percent ( 25/47 ) success rate for fall 201 8 3. Ambiciones , launched in spring 2015, support s the success of Hispanic /Latino students on campus. Ambiciones provides academic and personal support to Hispanic/Latino students by creating a supportive community, and providing referrals to useful resources and assistance in key areas such as: academic advising and tutoring, mentoring and coaching, financial aid, scholarship, and work study opportunities, career counseling and internships, personal counseling, networking with other Hispanic/Latino students and organizations on campus, educational and recreational activities, and workshops. Ambiciones aims to ease the transition from high school to college for first generation students by working with students and their families to guide them through the application and enrollment process. With a growing number of undocumented students enrolling in college under the Dream Act and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, Ambiciones offers guidance for students and their families through the various steps required to ensure compliance with these programs. Ambiciones served 78 students in fall 2018 and 80 students in s pring 2019. The program served 58 students in FY18 and 34 in FY17 . The program has a fall 2018 to spring 2019 retention rate of 85 percent, as compared to a 79 percent retention rate for all Hispanic /Latino students for the same period. In FY18, fall to f all retention for all Ambiciones students was 63 percent as compared to 47 percent for non- participating peers. In fall 2018, 67 percent of program participants had at least a 2.0 GPA as 198compared to 77.8 percent in Fall 2017 . In FY19, 14 students applied for graduation as compared to 20 graduates in FY18. Underrepresented Groups Among Employees The college has set a strategic goal that 24 percent of its full -time faculty positions and 28 percent of its administrative and professional staff positions be held by minorities . Towards that end, the college makes every effort to attract minority candidates to its applicant pools for vacant jobs. That is, HCC specifically targets minority group s whenever possible in its recruitment efforts to increase the chances that the best candidate overall for a position will be a minority. For example, human resources representatives attend a number of job fairs at local colleges with high minority populations, and advertisements are posted on websites that cater to minorities such as Diverse Issues in Higher Education and Hispanics in Higher Ed. Additionally, in each recruitment effort the human resources office searches for minority associations particul ar to that profession, such as the National Association of Black Accountants for an accounting position. The chart below shows the number of minority applicants for vacant positions at the college for the past five years. In each of the last three years at least half of applicants who disclosed their race have been minorities. We believe that the effort to reach minority applicants is one of the driving factors behind the college's improvement in its minority percentages in key positions. As shown in the chart on the next page, the percentage of minorities in full -time faculty positions currently sits at 28.4%, the highest level in the college's records. The college has now met the 24% goal for two consecutive years, and the college hopes for continued progress in the future . Also shown in the chart is that the percentage of minorities in administrative and professional staff positions (as identified by MHEC's Employee Data System data 199is currently at 31.9%, also the hi ghest level in the college's records and above the 28% benchmark. While recruitment of minority candidates has been a focus in recent years, the college is now additionally giving equal attention to retention of minority employees. The human resources office and diversity committee recently surveyed minority employees across campus to assess satisfaction and brainstorm ideas for improving the minority experience for our workforce. The suggestions were reviewed for the implementation of employee resource groups and expand training regarding implicit bias and microaggressions. Efforts Designed to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness among Students, Faculty, and Staff on Campus HCC is proud of its plan for diversity, inclusion, and equity and ongoing campus diversity pro gramm ing. In 2018, the college's efforts to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity were recognized by the Association of Community College Trustees with the national Charles Kennedy Equity Award. Cult ural diversit y continues to be addr essed in a number of ways, including the following, am ong othe rs: A mul eness employ ees and udents thr ough out each y ear, incl uding films, musical performances, lectures, an d discussions, high lighted by an annual \"Diversi ty Wee k\" each spring.

The Plan is a multi-year action plan that the College is implementing over a period of seven years-fiscal years 2014 through 2020. Following Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) requirements for the 2018-2019 fiscal year, the Montgomery College (MC) annual progress report focuses on the following four areas. a. A summary of the institution's plan to improve cultural diversity as required by Education Article \u00a711-406. b. A description of efforts to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among (1) students, (2) administrative staff, and (3) faculty. c.

A statement regarding the campus process for the reporting of hate-based crimes consistent with federal requirements. Introduction Montgomery College is committed to providing a wide array of diversity, equity, and inclusion\u00ad related activities and development programs for its students and employees. The College values continuous learning, professional growth, and high performance and has made it a priority to identify and implement best practices. These best practices have become institutional cornerstones for achieving diversity, inclusion, and institutional excellence. Section 1: Institution's Plan to Improve Cultural Diversity This section includes goals, areas of emphasis, and strategy for implementation. Montgomery College's Diversity Plan, 1 is the College's roadmap for improving cultural diversity for its students, staff, and faculty. In accordance with the College's values of Excellence, Integrity, Innovation, Diversity, Stewardship, and Sustainability, we continue to evaluate our progress using the Plan as the guideposts by which the College measures its success. 1 The College's Plan is its second multi-year diversity action plan covering fiscal years 2014 through 2020 (the first plan covered fiscal years 2009-2012). 1 207By integrating the values of diversity and inclusion into the College's operational, tactical, and strategic plans, the College demonstrates its institutional commitment and can assess its progress, evaluate success, and plan for the future. Equity and inclusion are imbedded in each area of emphasis in the strategic plan which includes: (l) educational excellence; (2) access, affordability, and student success; (3) economic development; (4) community engagement; and (5) assessment and institutional effective ness. Each of the areas noted above are supported by strategic goals and strategic action measures that allow the College to gauge its progress. The College provides educational and academic programs that are designed to develop cultural competence among its students and employees, including required participation by employees in at least one multicultural professional development activity, which is evaluated in annual performance reviews. This requirement is just one of 96 strategic action measures that supports 21 strategic goals related to the College's five areas of emphasis.2 The College is now in the seventh year of its seven-year plan. Progress is evaluated regularly throughout the year and documented in an annual progress report submitted each year to the College's president and to the Board of Trustees for approval. Continued emphasis on diversity and improvement in our work has been highlighted in 2019, under the leadership of Sharon Bland, the College's Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, who led the our first annual Equity Summit, the theme of which was \"From Awareness to Action: Embracing Equity and inclusion at Montgomery College.\" The goals of the Summit were to: foster stronger College and institutional relationships; engage the college community in conversations about the future of equity and inclusion at MC, including how it translates into successful outcomes for our students; expose participates to the inclusive Excellence model and the critical importance of equity, civility, and inclusion in the 2151 century; and develop a toolkit for action. During the day-long summit, participants engaged in Equity Dialogues and heard from dynamic guest speakers such as, Dr. Damon Williams , Chief Catalyst, Center for Strategic Diversity Leadership & Social Innovation/Senior Scholar & Innovation Fellow, Wisconsin 's Equity & Inclusion (Weil) Laboratory at University of Wisconsin-Madison ; Mr. Diego Uriburu, Executive Director, Identity Inc.; Ms. Nancy Navarro, Montgomery County Council President; Mr. Marc Eirich, Montgomery County Executive; and Mr. Timothy Kane, Associate Director for Inclusion Initiatives at George Washington University. Section 2: Efforts to increase Numerical Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups This section of the report details initiatives designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students, staff, and faculty. Below is information related to collegewide a nd program- specific initiatives. a. Students Montgomery College students reflect the diversity of the Montgomery County communit y. Student data for the fall 2017 semester, provided by the College's Office of Institutional 2 For a comprehensive review of the College's strategic plan and corresponding action measures, see www.montgomervco Ilege.edu/president. 2 208Research and Effectiveness, indicate there were 22,875 credit students enrolled at the College. Of that number, 27.4 percent were Black, 24.6 percent were Hispanic, 22.8 percent were White, 11.5 percent were Asian, 0.5 percent were Native American or Pacific Islander, and 3.0 percent were multi-race. In addition, there are 1,546 (6.8 percent) students with reported disabilities attending Montgomery College. Finally, there are 1,898 international students. 3 Student Support Services TRIO Program The Student Support Services Trio program serves non-traditional, underrepresented students who are low-income, first-generation students and students with disabilities. The purpose of the program is to increase retention, graduation, and transfer rates. The program's initiatives and efforts to increase the numerical representation include participation in college recruitment and information events, reaching out to students who meet the eligibility criteria, and seeking referrals from counseling faculty, Welcome Center staff, and faculty. The staff members are culturally diverse and speak multiple languages to serve the diverse student population. Disability Support Services {DSS) DSS Counselors provide a broad range of services to support students with disabilities. Each campus offers bilingual faculty and staff to communicate with deaf and hard of hearing students. Sign Language Interpreters provide support to enable students to participate in curricular as well as extracurricular activities. DSS also offers students the use of a range of technological supports to assist them such as voice recognition, enlarged print and screen magnifiers, voice synthesizers, alternative keyboards, assistive listening devices, Braille conversion and printing, and Kurzweil text to speech software. Each year DSS offers an Information Session for prospective students, parents and educators. This year over 100 people attended the session to learn about the support services, programs, and options available at Montgomery College for students with disabilities. Counseling and Advising Department The Seminar for International Students (STSU 101) .is a course taught by counseling faculty to assist international students in adjusting to college and the American educational system. Departments at each campus are comprised of racially diverse faculty and staff including bilingual Spanish speaking members. Department members are also culturally diverse representing Native American, Latin American, and African cultures. Diversity is a key factor used in assessing new hires to better serve the diverse student population. b. Staff/Faculty The office of human resources and strategic talent management conducted its annual internal assessment and proactively implemented an Affirmative Action Plan (AAP) to ensure accessibility related to the College's employment opportunities. The 2018 AAP4 report indicates that minorities are employed at a rate of 49 .1 % and are represented in 91 % of 81 departments. Women are employed at a rate of 56.7% and are represented in 93% of all departments .. Between 10/01/2018 and 3/31/2019, the College hired 58 people. Of the 58 hired, 62% were minorities and 59% were women. 3 International students are identified using definitions provided by the Institute for International Education. 4 The 2018 AAP data covers the period from October 1, 2018 through the date of this report. 3 209The Fall 2018 demographic data for employees is as follows: 3,115 employees of whom 42% were employed on a part-time basis. Of the total number of employees, 53% were White, 26% were Black, 12% were Asian, 8% were Hispanic, and 1 % was categorized as \"foreign, unknown, or multi-race\" for federal government reporting purposes. Ensuring objectivity and fairness throughout the College's recruitment process is essential to attracting and retaining qualified talent. The College has robust policies and procedures governing the hiring process, which reinforce the College's commitment to increasing the numerical representation of underrepresented groups. Hiring managers are trained in all facets of interviewing and candidate selection, as well as educated regarding employment laws and best practices for attracting and retaining diverse talent. Additionally, we ensure that our search and interview committees are diverse, consisting of individuals with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. The College routinely uses the latest technology to support its recruitment efforts, including various forms of social media designed to target specific audiences. The College continues its targeted recruitment efforts by updating marketing and advertising materials with organizations and/or publications that may prove helpful in attracting diverse groups. For example, promotional materials were created for targeted distribution at association meetings, conferences, networking events, job fairs, and other similar gatherings. In addition, we continue to review a variety of recruitment sources that target minorities. We have modified our account with Latinos in Higher Education magazine so that our career site is swept directly to ensure consistent posting of all positions. We have joined and begun posting positions with the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium, a nonprofit consortium working to advance equity and excellence in the higher education workforce. The College monitors recruitment postings on an ongoing basis to ensure that we are attracting a diverse applicant pool. In addition, we have started tracking applicant demographic metrics on a quarterly basis. This allows us to identify where additional outreach efforts are needed. For fiscal year 2019, of the applicants that self-disclosed, the percentage of minority applicants has increased from 64% to 79%. The percentage of applicants self-disclosing as female was 60%. Section 3: Initiatives to recruit and retain Student Support Services TRIO Program To recruit students, we participate in college recruitment events such as Raptor Rising, MC Information Sessions, Parent Nights, Scholarship Breakfast, Health Fair, and other events. To retain students, we utilize intrusive academic advising, provide tutoring in mathematics, English, reading, social sciences, humanities, and introductory science courses. We track student progress and communicate with students frequently. Combat2College Program As part of our ongoing retention initiative for student veterans, Combat2College, staff has taken an intrusive approach to student retention. Combat2College staff can generate direct referrals for student veterans who require additional assistance with navigating the College, or those who are experiencing academic difficulties and are in need of an intervention. In order to promote student 4 210retention, Combat2College staff review midterm grades of Veterans Administration (VA) education beneficiaries and provide appropriate referrals for students in need of academic interventions, or referrals to resources that can assist with personal hardships. In the months leading up to the start of the fall and spring semesters (August and January) Combat2College staff review files of VA beneficiaries and contact students who have not competed their VA certification paperwork or registered for the upcoming semester, and provide appropriate assistance as needed. Counseling and Advising Department The counseling and advising department developed an online Academic Orientation Program, e\u00ad Intemational Montgomery Advising Program ( eIMAP), for non-native English speaking students. The new online academic program mirrors the program developed for native speakers, allowing students the same convenience to complete the program remotely at any time of day. This program brings parity between American English speaking students and International/Non\u00ad native English speakers, streamlines the onboarding process, and increases access to enrollment at Montgomery College. Boys to Men (BTM) is a mentoring program specifically designed for the retention of African American/Black male students at Montgomery College. The prorgam seeks to foster a greater degree of academic success, student activism, and personal responsibility. BTM provides academic and personal mentoring for the above targeted student population. Participating students also benefit from having their academic progress monitored each semester. The program will have an off campus gathering/activity, as well as a book reading and discussion series. Section 4: Efforts Designed to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness This section contains a description of efforts to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. a. Students -Curricular initiative promoting cultural diversity in the classroom Co-Curricular Cultural Diversity Programming held in 2018-2019: Student Life supports the World of Montgomery Festival with \"Shine Your Light\" activities: Student Life clubs and organizations worked to create and host a tent full of activities for the Montgomery County World of Montgomery Festival, which drew over 5,000 visitors to the Rockville campus on Sunday, October 21, 2018. Volunteers from MC Serves, the Anime Club, Early Childhood Education Club, Engineers Without Borders, Future Female Leaders, Muslim Student Association, and the STEM Ed Club hosted firefly making, paper lantern crafts, henna, face painting, Arabic calligraphy and more. In Harm's Way: Families Seeking Refuge Simulation: The Service-Leaming Program, Women's and Gender Studies, Global Nexus, and Department of World Languages and Philosophy hosted the \"In Harm's Way: Understanding Families Seeking Refuge\" event on Friday, November 16, 2018. A team of 15 student volunteers and co-chairs Nik Sushka and Professor Pat Ruppert met throughout the fall semester to plan the interactive simulation that asks participants, \"What would you do if you were in harm's way?\" Over 100 5 211students, faculty, and staff attended the program where they were guided by student volunteers through several simulation modules, such as Leaving Home, Crossing the Border, and Applying for Asylum. Following the simulation modules, participants broke in to small groups to reflect on their impressions, personal experiences with the issue, and potential next steps to support local immigrant and refugee families. Attendees were also encouraged to bring new blankets that were donated to families served by the Lutheran Social Services Refugee Resettlement Program. Civic Reflection Training & Civic Reflection Discussions: Members of the Student Life office participated in the Civic Reflection training with the Center for Civic Reflection. Staff were trained to use readings, images, and videos to engage people in deep, productive conversation about issues that impact their communities and work in the world, a practice called civic reflection. Staff then hosted Civic Reflections with the leadership cohort Impact MC and at the Rockville Campus Volunteer Fair with students, employees, and community members that focused on topics of social justice and volunteering. City of Rockville Diversity Leadership Workshop: MC students participated in a six-hour workshop with local high school students hosted by the City of Rockville Human Rights Commission. Workshop topics included facets of diversity, internalized oppression, stereotypes and bias, immigration policy, healing racial trauma, and applications of leadership. Mental Health First Aid Certification: Students participated in an eight hour Mental Health First Aid certification that teaches how to identify that a mental health problem may be occurring, how to respond appropriately, and how to be an ally for individuals who have a mental health disorder. Topics included substance use, dependence, and abuse and its relationship to mental health. Opioid and Substance Abuse Training: Students watched the movie Heroin(e) and discussed data and stories of the opioid epidemic, were trained to respond to an opioid overdose, and proposed their own advocacy campaigns to raise awareness and remove stigma of using community and campus resources. Participants also heard from professionals in criminal justice, mental health, and social services fields about their work. Impact MC: Civility Assessment and Dialogue: Leadership program participants assessed their civility skills, then participated in a dialogue with the MC President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion about the role civility plays in creating equitable and inclusive environments and actions we can take to promote civility at MC. Alternative Summer Break: Removing Barriers to Good Health and Well-Being, Workshop on Structural Racism & Health Disparities: Alternative Break students and staff participated in a workshop facilitated by the Steinbruck Center for Urban Studies where they learned about structural racism and its relationship to health disparities in the DC/Maryland region. Students included aspiring nurses, mental health professionals, lawyers, and policy makers who reflected about the role structural racism would have in helping them serve people effectively in their chosen professions. Maryland Male Student of Color Summit 6 212The 3rd Maryland Male Student of Color Summit (MMSOC) was held at the Germantown Campus, October 5, 2018, in response to closing the achievement gap. The gap in academic achievement continues to divide our under-represented male students of color from traditional students. The achievement gap, as reflected in college participation, retention, and graduation rates, threatens damaging consequences for Maryland as these students fail to complete college and obtain well-paying jobs and a comfortable standard of living. Over 300 students, faculty, staff, and community persons from around the State were in attendance. Nearly 200 were male students of color representing Maryland's community colleges and a cohort of students from Clarksburg High School for the mid-day plenary. The MMSOC summit focuses on relevant topics and activities designed to educate, equip, and enlighten participants to strategically increase college and career success of male students of color. The summit showcased a host of thought provoking and interactive workshops as well as inspiring key speakers: awarding winning journalist, John Quinones and student spotlight speaker, Sadiq Ali. ABC News reporter and commentator John Quinones shared the secrets of his exceptional career, which included an odds-defying journey, in which education was a life\u00ad transforming experience. He also narrated some thought provoking insights into human nature and ethical behavior. Mr. Quinones is best known in recent years for his ethics show \"What Would You Do?\" Sadiq Ali, who is the founder of Millionaire Manners Academy , spoke about self-esteem development, relationship building, and youth empowerment. His training organization focuses on leadership, life skills, and career readiness through a framework of interpersonal relationships. Ali has motivated and redirected some of the most troubled youth and formerly incarcerated citizens. African Americans and Ghana. West Africa: Heritage Sites and Community: The Office of International and Multicultural Affairs presented a lecture on the historical and present-day connections between the nation of Ghana and Afro-Descendants from the Diaspora. The topics covered included Ghana's history, heritage sites, pan-Africanism, and the African-Amer ican repatriation movement.

This program was held during Jazz Appreciation Month (JAM). 7 213The MC Asian-Pacific Heritage Month Kick-off Celebration was held at the Takoma Park/Silver Spring Campus on Tuesday, April 23, 2019. MC students, faculty, and staff showcased their countries of origin to the audience. Attendees \"traveled\" with Global Connections to eight different Asian countries: China/Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nepal, Korea, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. During this event, attendees visited interactive exhibits where they participated in hands-on activities such as calligraphy, origami, country quizzes, and food sampling while learning about each Asian country. Attendees signed a book of condolences for the April 2019 Easter Sunday tragedy in Sri Lanka. Afterwards, the book of condolences was presented to the Embassy of Sri Lanka in DC. The festival had 175 attendees and was co-sponsored by the MC Asian Heritage Month Committee. Hispanic Heritage: In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the Office of Student Life and the Humanities Department collaborated to bring Salvadorian singer, songwriter, and storyteller Lilo Gonzalez to Montgomery College. Panera Bread Giveaway: In Collaboration with the SHAW Center and the Office of Student Life, Panera Bread donated food monthly during the Spring semester to assist in minimizing food insecurity for Montgomery College students by providing donated goods from Panera Bread to students. b. Staff and Faculty: Cultural Training The President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion (PACEI) was established in November 2017 to help create an inclusive, civil, and respectful community that achieves equity for all Montgomery College students, employees, and business partners. The committee, which meets monthly, consists of a diverse, multi-generational, and multicultural group of faculty, staff, and administrators who represent all facets of the college community. PACEI members serve on one of the following eight (8) sub-committees: Student Experience and Campus Culture; Business Practices and Procurement; Faculty, Teaching and Curriculum; Human Resources/Recruiting, Hiring, Retention, Succession Planning; Nationwide Peer Institution Best Practices/ Assessment and Evaluation/Resources; Reports and Communication; Training, Dialogue, Events, Celebrations; and Workforce Development and Community Engagement. Over the course of the last academic year, PACEI members participated in a variety of trainings on topics such as Courageous Conversations, Unconscious Bias, Mastering Civility, and Interrupting Micro-Aggressions. Additionally, each sub-committee developed a list of proposed activities the College should \"start, stop and sustain\" as it relates to equity and inclusion. Those recommended actions were approved for implementation by our senior administrative leadership team (SALT). Recommendations included: Professional Development: Montgomery College's Office of E-Learning, Innovation, and Teaching Excellence (ELITE) is dedicated to promoting diversity programs for both faculty and staff. In addition to creating and providing its own diversity programs, ELITE partners with other units and departments to form rich collaborations in diversity awareness for staff and faculty. Below are a few examples from the inventory of events: 8 214 Creating an Inclusive Classroom: This event features panelists who offer strategies to help create an inclusive classroom for specific student demographics. The panelists will speak to how creating an inclusive environment affects student outcomes. The specific student demographics that will be discussed are: Muslim students, female students, and students whose first language is not English. Outcomes for attendees are being able to demonstrate knowledge of how to create an inclusive classroom for at least two student demographics and articulating how creating an inclusive environment affects student performance. Creating Radically Inclusive Course Materials with Universal Design: With the growing diversity of students, have you ever wondered if your course design meets the needs of all your students? Universal Design is an approach to designing course materials and content to honor different learning styles and benefit students with disabilities. Moreover, Universal Design will benefit all students with its flexibility. In this training, you will have the opportunity to learn how to create accessible course content that can be used by all students, including students with disabilities. Outcomes for attendees are being able to apply the principle of universal design for course design in digital format; identify the potential usability and accessibility issues for students in the course development process; and utilize the simple techniques to create accessible digital course content such as course syllabus, PowerPoint presentations, and multimedia files External Differences/Internal Similarities: Communicating Human Values through Religion: Dr. Lauve Steenhuisen is a full teaching professor of theology and women's studies at Georgetown University. She is a scholar of American theologies and religious movements, specializing in feminist and sociological analyses. Her work has been published in Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses and in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs. She has presented her research at conferences and has served as a keynote speaker. Outcomes for attendees are being able to discuss how religious belief is expressed in diverse cultures; identify how religion and culture are interdependent; and explain how religion in many cultures represents core human values. Supporting Success for our iGen students: Student success is the driving theme of our service at MC. Faculty have stepped up to meet the unique needs ofmillennials. Now, iGen students are also in our classrooms. What are their world views, values, and needs that impact teaching and learning? How might we adapt yet again? Outcomes for attendees included being able to identify distinct characteristics of millennials and iGens; apply characteristics to specific teaching practices; and strategize departtnent initiatives that synchronize with changing student demographic. Teaching Students Who Are Challenging: Each semester faculty report that reaching ALL students can be difficult. Students with defined and undefined special needs and classroom behaviors can provide an opportunity to consider new strategies to enhance teaching and encourage a positive classroom environment. Outcomes for attendees are identifying specific student classroom behaviors that are challenging; identifying contributors to challenging behaviors; practicing research-based strategies to address challenging behaviors; content-design and classroom arrangement; classroom policies; cueing students with behavioral challenges; discussing characteristics of positive learning environments; and completing activities that reinforce their ability to respond challenging student behaviors. 215Safe Zone Training is offered via Counseling and Advising. The purpose of the training is to provide faculty, staff, and administrators the opportunity to: gain new understandings of gender, gender identity, gender expression, and the diverse range of sexual and aff ectional orientations; to acquire resources and referral information and practice communication skills for classroom or office discussion or unexpected disclosure. With regard to outcomes, faculty, staff, and administrators learned to foster a welcoming environment for students who are gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning identity (LGBTQI). LGBTQI students often feel unsafe at school, resulting in reduced attendance to avoid risk, bullying, or bias. Wellness Fair and Therapy Dogs: Provided students and individuals the opportunity to connect with a variety of college and community resources that are helpful to managing stress, anxiety, and a variety of behavioral health issues without fear of judgement. Representative Faculty presentations: Dr. Shelley Jones presented \"Teaching El Salvador in the World Languages Classroom\" at the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese in Salamanca, Spain; coordinated Humanities Days on the Takoma Park/Silver Spring campus (impacting 672 students and 80 faculty members); co-led the Global Classrooms Faculty Fellowship in which eight faculty members across the College were guided and trained to produce international virtual exchanges with El Salvador, India, and China. She presented on Global Classrooms at MC at the Going Global, Growing Global: Fostering International Education and Exchange at Community Colleges symposium at Montgomery College in April 2019; collaborated with Salvadoran colleague and Professor of Literature Jorge Aguilar who presented to her intermediate Spanish class about community engagement projects with his students at a correctional facility in El Salvador. The Institute for Race, Justice, and Civic Engagement, led by Dr. Vincent Intondi, hosted the 9/12/18 screening of Selma [Film], the 9/30/2018 guest speaker: Jesse Hagopian, award-winning teacher from Seattle and author of \"Teaching for Black Lives.\" He talked to students and faculty on the importance of Ethnic Studies and developing curriculum to reach a diverse student body. He ordered hundreds of small Puerto Rican flags (Student Life followed suit and did the same) to support Puerto Rico after the hurricane and the US poor response. Students wrote the correct number of people who died on the flags and put them all over campus as a way to say ''Never Forget.\" Non-Credit Programs that support Cultural Diversity In general, our working adult population (average age is 35-36) benefits from a rich array of career enhancement learning and certification earning possibilities. These adult students bring the richness of our communities into the College while building their individual capacity for lifelong community, workforce, and economic development opportunities in their own communities. Noncredit programs provide easily accessible student engagement opportunities that serve our diverse communities for their immediate learning and career aspirations as well as providing a connection to degree programs for continued studies. Many noncredit students continue their studies in degree programs after achieving their early success in noncredit IO 216programs. A recent study by the Office of Institutional Research shows that over a given two year period there are approximately 3,900 instances of a Montgomery College student taking a noncredit course prior to taking a credit course. Noncredit experiences significantly contributes to the rich diversity of our student body. Program examples: Adult ESL and GED programs meet students with limited English proficiency or adult basic education needs where they are. Students from around the world take advantage of the grant\u00ad funded programs offered in the noncredit areas. The Maryland Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training (MiBEST) programs have been very successful in accelerating career skill mastery even for students with limited English proficiency or basic education. A contextualized program of study combines technical skills development with language or basic education skill development through a unique team teaching format. The Refugee Training Center programs serve newly arriving immigrants through language skill development, acculturation of community norms, career development, and independent living skills. The Graduate Transitions Program serves post high school individuals with learning disabilities. Students work on strengthening communications and workplace skills through a unique two-year program of study. Many students go on to work experiences with the Montgomery County Project Search initiative. The Hispanic Business Training Institute provides instruction in Spanish for several technical and business career fields. Students are able to advance in their career fields while strengthening English language skills. The GED preparation program offered at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility and the Pre-Release Center provide basic educational skills development for individuals while they are incarcerated. Upon graduation with the GED diploma, these students receive scholarships to attend Montgomery College. Our Lifelong Learning Institute provides lifelong educational enrichment opportunities for our community members fifty years of age and beyond. More than 10% of the college credit and noncredit students are in this age group. Section 5: Reporting Hate-Based Crimes This section contains information concerning the process for reporting hate-based crimes, consistent with federal requirements as defined under Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article and consistent with 20 USC \u00a7 1092(f) known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (\"the Act\"). \"All students and employees are encouraged to report if they are the victim of a crime, observe a crime in progress, or believe a crime may be in progress. If a life-threatening emergency is taking place, call 9-1-1 first, then call the Office of Public Safety at the appropriate campus. Officers are required to record any crime information reported to them and do not have authority to maintain complete confidentiality. However, special consideration is given to complainants and victims who prefer to remain anonymous. Personal identifying information will not be published and only shared with College officials 11 217on a need-to-know basis.\"5 All hate-based crimes reported to Public Safety staff, typically via telephone, in-person, walk-up, or by written correspondence will be assessed to determine if a Timely Warning or advisory needs to be issued. The report is then forwarded to appropriate personnel such as the Dean(s) of Student Development, Title IX Coordinator, and/or the Director of Employee and Labor Relations, and Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer. External Law Enforcement will be notified of the report and coordinate an investigation if deemed appropriate. The report will be recorded and retained by Public Safety and resulting statistics will be printed in the College's Annual Security Report. The College's commitment to compliance with these federal requirements is reinforced by several College policies, including College Policy 31002-HateNiolence Activity and its corresponding College Procedure, 31002CP-HateNiolence Activity. Adoption of policies and implementation of corresponding procedures is a collaborative effort, involving input from the College offices of General Counsel; Planning and Policy; Public Safety; Compliance, Risk, and Ethics; Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management; under the leadership of the Office of the President. Policies are reviewed and adopted by the Board of Trustees and implemented through corresponding procedures, which are adopted by the President. Montgomery College has taken several actions to ensure compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), and all implementing regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Education (34 CFR Part 668.46). The College's Annual Security Report is prepared and distributed by the Office of Public Safety based on crimes reported to its staff, as well as crimes reported to campus officials designated as Campus Security Authorities under the act, and crimes reported to local law enforcement authorities. By October 1 of each year, the College's report is posted online with a link at the College's homepage, and is made available to each member of the College community via email communication. The Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics routinely monitors the College's efforts to fulfill the requirements of the law. In addition, articles, trends, and safety tips are regularly publicized through College media, public service announcements, student newspapers, and targeted messages on radio and television. Crime prevention programs, including reporting procedures and related materials, are made available to students, staff, and faculty by the College's Office of Public Safety. For example, such information is delivered at both new-student and new-hire orientations, as well as being made available through student resource and compliance fairs. In summary, the College's strategy for information dissemination concerning processes and procedures for hate-based crime reporting is multifaceted and designed to provide critical information to various audiences using several methods, and employing available technology. 5 Montgomery College Annual Security Report, January I-December 31, 2016 Prepared by The Office of Public Safety and Emergency Management 12 218219220 Prince George's Community College Cultural Diversity Annual Report July 18 , 2019 _________________________________________ Dr. Charlene M.

The plan was continued for an additional two years - one year in keeping with the college's decision to do so with the overall strategic plan and another year while the Cultural Diversity Committee developed a new three -year plan. This report also includes accomplishments from the first year of the new strategic plan for FY2019 -FY2021 . Prince George's Community College is one of only two community colleges in the state of Maryland that services a credit student body made up primarily of minority students. However, the College continues to focus on those areas that require attention to insure that our diversity mirrors that of the county, to the extent possible, and continu es to educate students to be fully engaged in a diverse nation and world. PGCC has long recognized the importance of equal opportunity and diversity in education and includes diversity as one of the College's core values. This means that the College prom otes opportunities to expand the worldview of students and employees through exposure to and a greater understanding of all peoples, cultures, and lifestyles. This also means that members of the College co mmunity collaborate across the C ollege while under standing that everyone brings something to the table. Values Excellence - We strive to ensure quality outcomes through rigorous learning experiences designed to develop the mind and build character through civic engagement and service learning. Success - We believe all individuals have the potential to realize their goals. Diversity - We promote opportunities to expand our worldview through exposure to and greater understanding of all peoples, cultures and lifestyles. Respect - We treat every person with t he same humanity, courtesy, and civility that we expect for ourselves. Professionalism - We believe all individuals will approach their responsibilities ethically, fairly and with high standards. Lifelong Learning - We promote learning and development at a ll stages of life. We believe learning takes place at all times both inside and outside of the classroom. We honor and embrace all forms of learning, both formal and informal. Prince George's Community College understands that fulfillment of its missio n to facilitate access to higher education entails, in part, working towards a culturally diverse student body in proportions approximating service area ethnic and racial characteristics. The College also understands the importance of a diverse workforce. Therefore, demographic information is regularly tracked on students and employees. The PGCC student population generally reflects the demographics of its primary service area, Prince George's County. For FY2018, (71.4%) of the credit students identifie d as \"Black or African American\" and an additional 11.9% identified as \"Hispanic/Latino.\" With respect to employees, the trend over the last five years indicates African American/Non -Hispanic new hires most prevalent with an average of 55.99% among all un derrepresented groups. There was a slight uptick of individuals identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander with an increase of 0.90% from FY2016. While the trend shows a slight increase in hiring individuals identifying as Hispanic, efforts continue to engage and attract Hispanic and other minorities to the faculty and staff. 2244 MISSION STATEMENT The college's current vision and mission are as follows. Vision Prince George's Community College is the region's premier center for innovations in learning, community engagement, and strategic partnerships that inspire educational, career, and personal success. Mission Prince George's Community College provides affordable, high -quality learning experiences that support personal, professional, and educational development for diverse populations contributing to the economic equity and cultural vibrancy of our community. COMMITTEE ON CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND DEFINITION OF DIVERSITY The Committee on Cultural Diversity oversees the institutional cultural diversity plan that coincides with the College's strategic plan and provides a framework for achieving diversity goals with specific strategies to create a climate that embraces diversity beyond culture. The plan has mission -driven goals for improving diversity wi th specific areas of emphasis that include diversity training and education, infusing diversity into the curriculum, recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in the workforce and the student population, and programmatic efforts focused on creat ing an inclusive environment. Enhancing knowledge and understanding of students from diverse faith and non -faith backgrounds is also a goal of the plan. During the 2013 -2014 academic year, the Ad Hoc Committee on Cultural Diversit y developed the following definition of diversity: Prince George's Community College supports and embraces cultural diversity, understood as the creation and promotion of an inclusive, non -discriminatory environment for everyone. We accept and value differences, includin g differences in age, race, national origin, ethnicity, religious affiliation, political beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic background, and ability/disability. We strive for growth and success for all of our students, employees, b usiness partners, and the community. This definition was shared with the college community in multiple venues and was ultimately approved by the Board of Trustees. ASSOCIATIONS AND AWARDS Prince George's Community College is a member of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education (NADOHE), the Mid -Atlantic Diversity Officers in Higher Education (MADOHE), the Maryland Community College Diversity Roundtable of which the director of Govern ance and Diversity 2255 serves as one of two co-chair s, and the Washington Regional Task Force Against Campus Prejudice (WRTF) . The director of governance and diversity serves on the Professional Development Committee, Chapter Support Subcommittee and Bylaws Committee for NADOHE, and on the Bylaws Comm ittee for MADOHE. On September 29, 2018 , during the 19 th National Role Models Conference sponsored by Minority Access, Inc., Prince George's Community College was one of less than 40 colleges and universities across the country recognized as an institutio n committed to diversity for 2018 . This was the 4th consecutive year that the College has received this award. EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMERICAL REPRESENTATION OF TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION GOAL 1. Attract, recruit and retain highly qualified employees and students to create a culturally diverse college community. TASKS COMPLETED EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT Prince George's Community College 's hiring trends over the last three years slightly mirror the demographics of the county's projected 2017 census. As we focus on diversity and inclusion, the last four years shows a slow progression toward hiring individuals from underrepresented groups. However, there is a decline in the African American/Non - Hispanic populat ion in the workforce. While the trend shows an increase in hiring individuals identifying as Hispanic, continued efforts are required to engage and attract Hispanic and other minorities for faculty and staff positions. Ethnicity of PGCC Workforce FY 18 FY 2.20% 2266 The College's recruitment efforts focus on diversity and inclusion, with targeted emphasis on attracting individuals from underrepresented groups. On average, Prince George's Community College's racial demographics is on par with the county's ethnicity representation except for individuals identifying as Hispanic or of Latino heritage. The Recruitment Department continues to leverage its partnership with the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC). The relati onship benefits the College by providing an opportunity to post positions directly on the HERC website, access to their CV/resume search database which allows for targeted searches for individuals seeking employm ent with experience matching the College's vacancies. Additionally, the partnership with HERC lends to the ability to post the positions on various diversity sites affiliated with DirectEmployers, which maintains relationships with a host of diversity, disability, military and social media sites. Prince George's Community College's Division of Human Resources and Organizational Development (HROD) held its first annual spring 2019 job fair hosted by the Recruitment Department. The event highlighted employment opportunities that exist here at the co llege. The primary focus was on digital advertising designed to reach job seekers residing in Prince George's County and neighboring 64% 1%4%0%3%18%12% Ethnicity of Prince George's County (Census 2017) Source: US Census Bureau Black or African American alone, 64.60% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 1.10% Asian alone, 4.60% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, .20% Two or Mor Races, 2.70% Hispanic or Latino, 18.50% White alone, not Hispanic or Latino, 12.70% 2277 states.

Examine alignment of the college's definition of diversity within academic course offerings. TASKS COMPLETED This year, the Curriculum S ubcommittee took the steps toward completing the first goal of the FY19 - FY21 diversity plan related to curriculum. This goal was developed as a result of the elimination of the diversity assignment in the PAS 1000 course and the need to understand how Prince George's Communit y College students experience diversity in their course work at the College. The subcommittee met to revie w the current course catalog to determine courses in all Pathways tha t aligned with the College's d iversity definition. After reviewing the catalog, the subcommittee chose five courses that met the alignment criteria . Since one of the Pathways offered at the College is Professional and Personal Development , it was decided to add a workforce development course to the list. The subcommittee looked for a diverse set of courses where all students are represented . In doing so, the members noticed that in the continuing education course selected, diversity was being taught in many different ways. Consequently, this first phase of course assessment will re present both credit and non -credit offerings. The committee has also received the cooperation of faculty teaching the courses. Subcommittee members will begin working with faculty in those areas this coming fall semester. The intent is to examine how students experience learning about diversity in these courses. Additionally, the subcommittee plans to develop a survey to distribute to students in each class to obtain their feedback. A new set of courses will be examined for the spring semester 2020. The six courses the subcommittee chose to examine in F all 2019 are as follows: RAD 1530 - Clinical Radiography I - List implications of cultural diversity in the healthcare setting. BMT 2720 - Managing Workplace Diversity - Define diversity and diversity consciousness. -Identify communication methods in a world of diversity. CJT 1530 - Community Policing - Explain the interactions between police and various diverse groups, the media and other entities. HLE 2220 - Human Sexuality - Analyze gender issues in various societies -Evaluate issues related to sexual orientation SOC 2400 - Intro to Public Policy Health and Health Care Policy - Relate how race, ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status and region impact healthcare outcomes -Explain histor ical root causes of health disparities associated with race, ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and region . ESL 628- Know your English Language Learners - Students will be taught to incorporate dynamic and interactive teaching methods into lesso n plans, how adults acquire a second or other language, the characteristics of English language learners in the U.S., and teaching best practices. 23414 While divers ity was not being taught in the PAS 1000 course, the Diversity C ommittee continued to have the diversity cards distributed to the students enrolled in the PAS 1000 course for both fall and spring semeste r. The diversity cards include the diversity logo and the approved College definition of diversity. The goal of disseminating the cards was to bot h promote the official definition and to spread awareness of the definition to all first year students taking PAS 1000. INTERFAITH UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION GOAL 1 . Enhance knowledge and understanding of students from diverse faith and non -faith backgrounds. TASKS COMPLETED Interfaith programs were held throughout the fall and spring seme sters. This year's 9/11 National Day of Service and Rememb rance program was he ld on September 11, 2018 . The day included \"A Walk to Remember 9/11 Interactive Exhibit .\" Through the present ation of images and documentary videos, participants learned about the attacks in NYC, DC, and PA and the ultimat e sacrifices made by so many on that tragic day in 2001. There was also a Chalk4Peace activity that allow ed an opportunity to draw the community together to find common ground. Participants were able to draw their vision of peace and healing on large strips of brown paper that we re later placed on display. A Field Trip to the Underg round Railroad Experience Trail in Sandy Spring, Maryland was held on October 5, 2018. The Underground R ailroad trail guides the visitor through woods and farmlands on their r oute to freedom. Even though slavery was not abolished in Maryland until 1864, Maryland Quakers outlawed owning of slaves by its members in 1777. The Quakers made Sandy Spring, Maryland a center of religious and community life and a sanctuary for escaped slaves. Free Blacks owned their homes , and established churches and schools and, with the Quakers, assisted escaping sla ves via the secret Underground R ailroad. The members of the Interfaith and Committee Service Committee presented a workshop on Colleg e Professional Development and Enrichment Day in October entitled \"Speed Dialogue: Pathways to Interfaith Exploration.\" Prince George's Community College students and employees continue d to volunteer at the SH ARE Food Network Warehouse three days each mon th. SHARE is a sustainable, social enterprise of Catholic Charities that helps anyone save mo ney on nutritious, healthy food and distributes high -quality, affordable and nutritious food as a way to build community and strengthen families throughout the Washington Metropolitan area. The facility produces 10,00 0 packages of food per month. The C ollege has been supporting SHARE monthly since January 2013. The Martin Lu ther King, Jr. Holiday was observed on Monda y, January 21, 2019 and is a national day of service. This year, The Interfaith and Community Service Committee encouraged the members of the college community to participate in service opportunities in their local communities and to share their 23515 experiences through the Employee Community Service sys tem located in myPGCC. Local service opportunities were also provided. A Seder Meal was presented to the college community on April 26, 2019. The presenter was Professor Alan Kahn. Participants were invited to come and learn about Passover, a significa nt and important holiday for Jews, Christians, and Muslims . REPORTING OF HATE -BASED CRIMES In addition to adhering to the requirement of submitting an annual summary of our institutional plan to improve cultural diversity, the college requires that hate crimes, as defined under title 10, subtitle 3, of the Criminal Law Article, be reported to th e Prince George's Community College Police. The incident shall be immediately investigated, and referred for appropriate criminal and/or administrative sanctions. All hate crimes investigated by the Prince George's Community College Police are reported t o the U. S. Department of Education as mandated by the federal law known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The vice president for Stu dent Affairs and the Title IX coordinator are notified of all hat e crimes so that intervention and counseling services can be activated to support the campus community. 236 Maryland Higher Education Commission Education Article 11 -406 - Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity FY 2018 -2019 Wor -Wic Community College 32000 Campus Drive Salisbury, MD 21804 2371 Overview Wor-Wic Community College is committed to a plan of cultural diversity that promotes inclusivity of diverse students and employees.

Institutional Plan to Improve Cultural Diversity All policies and practices at Wor -Wic Community College are guided by the college's seven core values (accessibility, community, diversity, integrity, innovation, learning, and excellence), Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR), and the goals of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education, which emphasize quality and effectiveness, access, affordability and completion, diversity, innova tion, economic growth and vitality, and data use and distribution. The college strives to uphold these values and goals in all of its academic and business operations, with the aim of creating a learning and working environment for all students and employe es that is inclusive and fair. In the conduct of its programs and activities involving the public and the constituencies it serves, Wor -Wic demonstrates adherence to ethical standards, and follow -through on its stated policies and support for academic and intellectual freedom. Wor-Wic defines \"diversity\" as \"embracing all people, ideas, and experiences by providing an inclusive and supportive environment\" (WWCC Catalog 2018 -2019, p. 6). Wor -Wic recognizes the importance of promoting awareness, understanding , and appreciation of diverse racial, ethnic and cultural groups, as evidenced by the college's mission to \"serve a diverse student body through its high quality, affordable offerings and comprehensive support services\" (p. 5) and one of its eight mission -based institutional goals to \"Attract and retain a diversity of students and employees\" (p. 6). The Wor -Wic cultural diversity plan promotes the inclusivity of diverse students and employees. As part of the plan, Wor -Wic instituted several initiatives to e nhance diversity. The college's cultural diversity committee, with representation from all areas of the college, ensures progress is made on the implementation of the cultural diversity plan and the coordination of multicultural events. The college holds a nnual Title IX training to ensure staff are knowledgeable of reporting crimes of sexual violence and provides the same information to new and returning part -time faculty at fall and spring professional development sessions. In 2015, the college's board of trustees approved the 2015 -2020 cultural diversity plan. Further, as the college continues to seek student enrollment growth, it also seeks a diverse staff and faculty. As a result, the college's human resources office annually reviews hiring guidelines to ensure the college is reaching a culturally diverse applicant pool. As for facilities and responding to the needs of unde rrepresented groups, Wor -Wic continues to improve handicap accessibility in all buildings. Facilities management determined that handicap accessible doors (operators) were reaching their end -of-life for various reasons (age, wear, function ality, etc.). Facilities management has an internal preventative maintenance plan where 2382 service technicians test the door operators. Repairs are u sually made internally and/or outsourced in an extreme circumstance in order to provide continuous service. The college has 46 automatic door operators; ten of the operators were r eplaced or repaired this year. Currently, four operators that were repaired in the first part of the fiscal year are out of service or under repair in one building (Fulton -Owen Hall). The department's goal is to address the remainder of the failing operators (11 per year over the next three years ). During FY 2019, Facilities manag ement installed a new accessible door next to counseling services (Maner Technology Center). Goal 1: The college's cultural diversity committee will ensure progress is being made on the implementation of the cultural diversity plan and continue coordinat ion of multicultural events. The cultural diversity committee, formed in 2009 as part of the college's initial cultural diversity initiative, meets a minimum of four times per year. The committee is comprised of students, staff, and faculty representative s. FY 2019 committee events included presentations on Irish - American Heritage, Maryland Teacher -of-the-Year, women's history, African -American history, dance, and poetry. The Passport around the World event initiated in FY 2018 in collaboration with the ho tel-motel restaurant's culinary component experienced a 35% increase in attendance over the previous year. Diners at this year's event sampled cuisine from Ireland, Italy, and India. In conjunction with the college's human services department, Dr. Richard Warren, the 2018 - 2019 Maryland Teacher -of-the-Year, presented during African -American History Month and was welcomed by a diverse group of 32 teacher -education majors (see Appendix A for cultural diversity committee events). Goal 2: Examine and list commu nity resources related to diverse populations to enhance cultural diversity linkages with the college. One of the primary roles of the admissions office is to promote the college and its programs of study to prospective students and residents of Worcester, Wicomico, and Somerset Counties. In this pursuit, the admissions office visits local high schools and various community events within the tri -county area. During FY 2019, the admissions office expanded efforts to offer college services to students that la cked transportation to the college by taking representatives from the admissions, registrar, and financial aid offices to selected high schools in the college's service area. This year all high schools in Somerset and Wicomico Counties were visited along w ith a majority of the high schools in Worcester County. This year a majority of scho ols in Wicomico County took advantage of this opportunity, in addition to several schools in Worcester and Somerset Counties. The following events were conducted by the admissions staff in FY 2019: \"Admissions Application Boot Camp\" - In cooperation with Wicomico County Board of Education, the WWCC admissions staff hosted a majority of Wicomico County's junior class for an overview and to promote higher education. Over 200 students attended. \"Inspire Fair\" - This cooperative project between WWCC and the Wicomico County Board of Education and the Wicomico County's Junior Achievement program hosted over 300 students to promote higher education and career s in STEM programs. 2393 \"College Focus\" - In partnership with the Shore Way to College group, the admissions office hosted a group of 30 \"at risk\" students from Somerset County to promote the college's programs of study and higher education opportunities. \"One Year to Empower Women's Group\" - In partnership with the Worcester County Health Department, the admissions office hosted a group of 20 minority females with the purpose of promoting the college's programs of study and other opportunities in higher educati on. \"Information Nights\" - The admissions office held several information nights at the college in order to promote certain college programs that featured specific advantages for students. One night dealt with dual enrollment, which offers students the opp ortunity to attend college at varied discount rates while still in high school. One hundred students and their parents attended the event. Another night dealt with the Maryland \"PROMISE\" scholarship, which offered the possibility of free college for Maryla nd high school students. Forty -five students and their parents attended the event. \"One-Stop Shop\" - Two English as Second Language (ESL) Specific Admissions/Financial Aid days were held at James M. Bennett High School in Wicomico County. This \"one -stop shop\" approach provided students a one application event both for financial aid and admissions. A follow -up application was also scheduled to determine if students needed further assistance. Twenty -five students attended. The director of career services has worked with 9 dislocated workers (7 Trade Adjustment Assistance Act funding and 2 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funding) from underrepresented populations through the Maryland One Stop Job Market and the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regul ation (DLLR) to assist clients with their education goals after being laid off from work. As the credit program liaison, the career services director also works with approved students to handle their funding, purchase their textbooks, maintains their class schedules each semester as per funding regulations, and processes invoices for third party billing. The director of career services has also provided career development presentations on career exploration and assessment, and choosing a major to local are a middle and high school students. The following high school programs participated in the presentations: Somerset County, Wicomico County Transitional Program, Wicomico Mentoring Project, Worcester County, and Wicomico County At -risk Program. In addition, the director of career services also participated in a Career Caf\u00e9 event as a guest speaker at Snow Hill Middle School and participated in the Junior Achievement Inspire event on March 12, 2019 at the Wicomico Youth and Civic Center to engage with middle a nd high school students about career options. The director of career services has also given career development presentations for the Joseph House, and the Homeless Community Outreach Project. The director of career services is also the project manager f or the Workforce Employability Skills Program (WESP) MHEC Grant which works with GEAR UP Program students who are rising juniors from James M. Bennett High School, Parkside High School, and Wicomico High School. Information sessions about career explorati on and assessment were held for these students and their parents. Career services also facilitated a free workshop on preparing an effective resume and job search tips on February 28, 2019. Of the 15 total that attended the workshop, 9 were community members. Lastly, a major career services initiative was to provide an annual spring job fair that was open to students and the community. The job fair, held March 28, 2019, hosted 52 2404 employers from all areas of industry. The free event was open to current students, alumni, and the community. Of the 294 job seekers, 137 (46 percent) were from the community members. Counseling Service s held the Mind, Body, and Soul Health Fair on March 12, 2019 from 9:00 - 2:00 p.m. in the college's cafeteria. The health fair featured alternative pain management such as acupuncture (Chinese me dicine), Reiki (Japanese medicine) and Jehovah's Witness (spiritual guidance). In addition, nine attendees were trained to administer Naloxone in the event of an opioid attack. In attendance were Wor -Wic staff and students, including dual enrollment and disabled students. The Office of Student Engagement recruited students to attend the Maryland Men of Color Summit at the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) in October 2018. The keynote speaker was noted journalist John Quinones. One of the Wor -Wic students and a n administrator was chosen to attend a luncheon held in honor of Quinones. Eight students of color attended the event. An in -house event to empower males, the Successful Male Achievement through Leadership and Empowerment (MALE) dinner, was held on April 18, 2019 and had twenty -five attendees. This event is in response to one of the college's initiatives to increase retention and completion rates among male students, increase cumulative GPA scores, ensure on -time completion, and connect male students to professional supports and resources (see Appendix B for office of student engagement i nitiatives - FY 2019). Efforts to Increase the Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups In addition to efforts to increase the diversity of its student population, Wor -Wic aims to increase diversity of its staff and faculty. Nineteen percent of full - and part -time employees at Wor -Wic are minorities. Although this percentage is lower than the state average for all Maryland community colleges (35 percent), it is higher than the average for all small Maryland community colleges (13 percent). According to the 2018 Performance Accountability Report Indicator #11, of the seven small Maryland commun ity colleges, Wor -Wic has the second highest percentage (10.1 percent) of full -time credit faculty who are minority. Wor -Wic has reached 84 percent of its benchmark of 12 percent for minority faculty. Wor -Wic ranks first among the seven small community col leges in the percent of full -time administrative/professional staff who are minority. Wor -Wic's percentage increased each year from the fall of 2014 (10.4 percent) to the fall of 2017 (18.3 percent). The college has exceeded its benchmark of 14 percent (20 18 Performance Accountability Report Indicator #12). These data demonstrate the college's continued commitment toward the promotion of diversity among faculty, staff and students. From Fall 2008 to Fall 2018, the number of full - and part -time employees at the college has increased by 34 people, or 8 percent. During the recent economic recession, the college experienced an enrollment surge, hitting its peak in FY 2011. To accommodate enrollment changes, the number of part -time faculty fluctuates accordingly (Employee Data System, Table 3.8). While the college has made efforts to increase the number of employees, staffing levels at Wor-Wic are somewhat low in relation to other small Maryland community colleges. The ratio of FTE students to FTE employees at Wor -Wic is 9.4 compared to 6.1 for other small Maryland community colleges (FY 2018). Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) is a federally funded Title IV (TRIO) program designed to motivate and assist veterans in the development of academic and other requisite skill s necessary for acceptance and success in a program of postsecondary education. The program provides 2415 Table 3.8 FTE Enrollment and Employees by Classification Fall FTE Enrollment* Total Employees Faculty FT (CR/CE) Faculty PT (CR/CE) Administrators FT and PT Support Staff FT and PT 2008 2738.00 413 70 181 64 98 2009 3018.58 413 71 181 64 97 2010 3228.11 441 70 208 65 98 2011 3417.20 440 70 206 65 99 2012 3218.44 425 70 192 67 96 2013 2997.57 420 72 181 67 100 2014 2749.13 431 73 187 69 102 2015 2816.74 449 71 204 68 106 2016 2760.29 426 73 178 71 104 2017 2620.12 436 71 175 78 112 2018 2583.05 447 67 176 87 117 assessment and enhancement of basic skills through counseling, mentoring, tutoring and academic instruction in the core subject areas. The primary goal of the program is to increase the rate at which participants enroll in and complete postsecondary educat ion programs. VUB serves 125 veterans and began in the F all 2017 semester. Two-thirds of the program participants are both first generation and low -income, and the remaining one -third are either first generation or low-income (as required by the grant). The following tables provide a breakdown by percentage of current program students by gender and race: Gender Female Male Total 18% 82% 100% Race Asian 2% 4% 37% 53% 100% Eligible veterans receive a variety of free educational support services to prepare them for academic success in obtaining a post -secondary education. During FY 2019, VUB services included the following activities or services: individual assessment of Engl ish and math and individual tutoring; cultural field trips, including a kayaking excursion and the Harriet Tubman 2426 Underground Railroad tour; career and financial aid counseling; as well as referrals to federal, state, and local veteran service providers. The director of the Veterans Upward Bound (VUB), a TRIO program , is the advisor to the Veterans -Military Association , a student club. During FY 2019 , the s tudent club sponsored an educational and cultural bus trip to Philadelphia on November 9, 2018 (33 s tudents and family participants). In addition, the club held its annual Vet erans Day ceremony at the college on November 8, 2018 (145 participants) and the Memor ial Day ceremony on May 27, 2018 (86 participants) . In addition, the club holds monthly pizza -social s for veterans to mingle an d share military camaraderie (26 participants, monthly average). Further, the club had five student veterans that represented the college at the Maryland Legislature's annual Student Advocacy Day on March 5, 2019. Las tly, the annual United States Marine Corps -Reserves Toys -for-Tots Christmas collection held November 15 to December 15, 2018 raised nine boxes of new toys. As a result of the collection, Wor -Wic was recognized as one of the largest donation sites in the tr i- county area of the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The continuing education workforce development division (CEWD) offered multiple co urses and initiatives in FY 2019 to further cultural diversity for incarcerated, developmentally disabled, and economically d isadvantaged populations. CEWD also has multiple initiatives in FY 2019 that include partnerships, grants, and training to foster employment, leadership, and communica tion for diverse audiences . For Allied Health Populations : Safe Talk Suicide Alertness - On February 12 and April 12, 2019, the directors of allied health and counseling services held free suicide alertness training at the college for forty - five student, staff, and community participants. Continuing education units (CEUs) were awarded to each participant. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) - The director of allied health, allied health coordinator, and administrative associate were certified in MHFA in 2018 to assist students with behavioral health challenges. The allied health instructor attende d a two - day Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) in 2018. Career Exploration - The allied heath staff provides career exploration, assessment and counseling to area middle and high school students. On February 7, 2019, the allied health dir ector, Lower Shore Workforce Alliance staff, and other continuing education workforce development (CEWD) staff presented to Wicomico County middle and high school guidance counselors, especially for students who were still undecided about what to do after high school graduation. Customized Workforce Trainings - In October 2018, the allied health and other CEWD staff worked with a local municipal jurisdiction to bring two sessions of respectful workplace training to its public works staff. Other trainings for local health departments on harm reduction strategies, stigma, and trauma as related to people with drug addiction were held on September 29, 2018 and April 26, 2019. Junior Achievement Inspire - The allied health and other CEWD staff participated in this event on March 27, 2019 that was aimed at career exploration for Wicomico County eighth graders. 2437 Sexual Orientation an d Gender Identify - During the S pring 2 019 semester, the allied health instructor added a module in the certified nurs ing assistant (CNA) curriculum on sexual orientation and gender identity (see Appendix C for CEWD Allied Health Sites) . Raising awareness of Student Cultural Diversity - The veterinary assistant training first comp leter student spotlight in the F all 2018 course schedule included a photo of a student representing the cultural diversity of allied health students speaking to the benefit of the training helping her achieve her car eer goal. In an effort to increase the employment of disadvanta ged students in the trades , the following initiatives are in progress: In partnership with Delmarva Power, Wor -Wic provides a $25 reading comprehension and math course to prepare eligible parti cipants for a career as linesmen. Students who pass the Delmarva Power CAST test and complete job applications are placed at the top of the interview/hire list. A free metal fabrication training program is offered for eligible participants for fourteen weeks. The training is funded by a Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation EARN Maryland grant in partnership with Crystal Steel, Arcon Welding, Quality Staffing Services and the Lower Shore Workforce Alliance. Students within the program learn metal fa brication skills, with the goal of securing entry -level metal fabrication jobs. A free welding training program will be offered for thirteen weeks for eligible participants. The training is funded by a Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation EARN Mar yland grant in partnership with Crystal Steel, Arcon Welding, Quality Staffing Services and the Lower Shore Workforce Alliance. Students within the program learn metal fabrication skills, with the goal of securing entry -level metal fabrication jobs. A free evening construction training program is offered to eligible participants. Two carpentry courses (approximately 98 hours) are funded by a Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation EARN Maryland grant in partnership with industry representatives, Quali ty Staffing Services, and the Lower Shore Workforce Alliance. Students within the program learn carpentry skills with the goal of securing entry -level construction jobs. For Economically Disadvantaged At -risk P opulations: The CDL program has six to eight students funded through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) per class, which is almost half the class. WIOA is a federally funded program that provides for training and education for workers whose jobs have been dislocated (WIOA). The comme rcial driver 's license (CDL) program accepts students with criminal backgrounds. The CDL program is reapplying for a Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training (CMVOST) grant which was successfully used in FY 2018 to provide training for vetera ns with GI Bill benefits. Veterans can obtain financial assistance for CDL training if veterans from any era. The CDL program averages 14 percent females in its CDL classes, which is double the female population (7 percent) of professional CDL drivers. 2448 The CDL program offers a scholarship for students unable to afford driver education training. The program opened a driver -training class in Crisfield, MD to address transportation needs in the region's lower most county. In Fall 2018, Wor -Wic hosted the sixt h annual College Career Pathways Night and invited Somerset, Wicomico, and Worcester County high school students. This event was for students from the Lower Shore and their families and provided the opportunity for students to meet with representatives fro m local employers, colleges, armed forces, fire and police departments, and non -profit agencies. Guidance staff from all three counties were available to answer questions about financial aid and college applications. The event included breakout sessions on dual enrollment, financial aid, Wicomico Economic Impact Scholarship (WEIS), developmental disabilities (DDA), and Naviance. The college plans to hold the event in F all 2019. CEWD operates a computer lab for 24.5 hours per week at the American Job Center and conducts computer skills training for clients of the center who are unemployed or lacking computer skills for employment. The lab was supported by a grant from the Lower Shore Workforce Alliance for FY 2019. For Miscellaneous Training: Employees from Cadista Pharmaceutical and Tr inity Sterile, minority owned companies, were trained in Microsoft Office Applications. Thirty -eight employees completed the training. For Developmentally Disabled Populations : A sixty -hour certificate for transitional youth e ntitled Culinary Arts Vocatio nal Life Skills was offered in S pring 2019 consisting of the following courses: Basic Culinary Arts Skills, Essential Culinary Art, and ServSafe Employee Food Safety and Sanitation. The course will be offered again in FY 2020. Two comput er courses for transitional youth from three Lower Shore counties entitled Introduction to Computer Applications and the Internet Part 1 and II as part of a Computer & Office Certificate was offer ed in Fall 2018 and W inter 2019. Seventeen studen ts completed the courses. Two computer courses for transitional youth entitle d Applied Computers and Technology Part I and II as part of a Computer & Office Ski lls Certificate was offered in Fall 2018 and W inter 2019. Seven students completed the courses. A 16 hour compu ter course is being offered in S pring 2019 for second -year students entitled PC Technician Basics. Twelve students are enrolled. The Tri -County Transitional Youth program received a national recognition from the National Council of Instructional Administrators (NCIA) as the Exemplary Initiative winner for 2019. The program was recognized at the Council for the Study of Community Colleges (CSCC) Conference in San Diego, CA in March 2019. A presentation was also given as well as a vide o, produced by the college, was shared to the conference participants. 2459 Initiatives to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness The items herein reflect events and initiatives held in FY 2019 to support the cultural diversity plan for Wor-Wic C ommunity College: Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs In response to a departmental goal to, \"Create and implement hiring guidelines that will help search committee members conduct effective interviews that comply with anti -discrimination laws,\" the human resources (HR) office uses a combination of recruiting tools to attract minority applicants, including mailings to local minority organizations and the use of affirmative action emails through HigherEd.com, which reaches more than 330,000 minorit y job applicants. For FY18, 33 percent of applicants who self -disclosed their race identified as minority. According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2017), 33 percent of Wicomico County is represented by minority groups and 17% of Worcester County is represente d by minority groups. The average for both counties is 25%, which suggests the college is working to ensure a diverse applicant pool. As of June 30, 2018, 18 percent of all standard and grant employees identified as minorities. Wor-Wic's minority statisti cs for all full -time and part -time employees is higher than all of the other small community colleges in Maryland (2018 Data Book 76) except in one category where Chesapeake College has 18 percent compared to Wor -Wic's 16 percent for full -time employees. Further, 20 percent of the college's full -time standard staff (administrators and support staff) employees identify themselves as minorities. The college continues to increase its percentage of minorities in full -time faculty positions. The figures change d from 6% in 2013 to 8% in 2014 to 12% in June 2015. During FY16, two minority faculty members resigned, lowering the percentage in June 2016 to 10%. This percentage held until June 2018, where the figure dropped to 9% as a result of position vacancies. Wh ile this number does not reach the college's goal, it is higher than three of the other six small community colleges in Maryland whose faculty statistics range from 2% to 15% minority (2018 Data Book 73). As of April 2019, the college is recruiting for num erous faculty openings for which we are recruiting which may cause an upward shift in these figures. In addition to attracting minority applicants, Wor -Wic's HR department helps search committee members conduct effective interviews that comply with anti -discrimination laws. An HR representative meets with each search committee prior to every search to discuss the recruitment process. Employees receive tools about acceptable and unacceptable questions, as well as training on various interviewing topics. HR reviews and modifies all interview questions to remove chances of discrimination in the hiring process. The college recently created a new strategic priority and assigned a priority team to \"ensure a high quality workforce by enhancing recruitment and hiri ng practices, addressing staffing needs and providing equity in compensation.\" Three major goals were established, including the goal to increase diversity in faculty and administrative positions. An ad -hoc committee was formed to (a) initiate branding efforts to facilitate recruitment efforts, (b) review hiring practices and make recommendations to improve the diversity of search committees, and (c) modify recruitment strategies to attract diverse candidates. The new HR pages of the college website were de signed based on the committee's input. In addition, a new procedure for selecting search teams was proposed, and 24610 related policy edits were submitted for review. Some of the branding and recruitment strategies were delayed due to lack of resources to prepar e professional videos for the website. To ensure employees encourage and respect diversity and understand the laws regarding discrimination and harassment, all new employees complete Title IX in Higher Education web training during their first few weeks of employment. The training provides information to new employees about Title IX, including the protection from discrimination it offers to students and employees. The training also covers sexual harassment, violence, and assault on and off campus, and makes it clear that discriminatory practices and retaliation will not be tolerated. Several key employees attend off -site Title IX trainings that are offered by the Association of Title IX Administrators, Maryland Title IX Consortium, Association of Title IX Ad ministrators (ATIXA), and the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MCASA), to name a few. HR also bring s trainers to campus to cover diverse topics. In April 2017, MCASA led two training sessions for employees on Campus Policy, Response and the LGBTQ + community and in September and October 2017, Dr. Julio Birman led cultural diversity training sessions. In May 2018, MCASA led two training sessions on campus covering Title IX and the #MeToo Movement. They will provide training on campus again in 2019 o n another current Title IX topic. Curricular Initiatives that Promote Cultural Diversity in the Classroom Arts and Humanities The Year of the Arts was designed as a lecture/speaker series in which writers/poets/artists of literary merit were invited to Wo r-Wic's campus to share their voices and ideas with an audience made up of students and community members. All writers were carefully selected to represent, because of their identities and their subject matter, certain demographic groups that are considere d \"marginalized.\" The writers were from groups whose voices have been dismissed or hidden historically, institutionally, socially and intentionally: LGBTQA+ communities, specifically transgender and non -binary identities; working -class women struggling wit h sexism, relationships and role expectations; American immigrants; families struggling with addiction; Veterans; and different racial, cultural and social groups. The experiences were designed to provoke thoughtful consideration of the diversity of our co mmunity (see Appendix D for arts and humanities the year of the arts events). SDV 102 Cultural Experience - This one -credit course exposes students to local events, such as music performances, visual arts, creative verbal performances, scholarly verbal performances and theater performances. Students explore local cultural events by attending, writing about, reading a bout and discussing such events (see Appendix E for SDV 102 cultural experience student r eflections). Criminal Justice CMJ 152 Law Enforcement and Community - The course includes a cultural awareness component where students examine police relationships with culturally diverse groups. The course objectives follow: differentiate between prejudice and discrimination; identify problems with policing a diverse so ciety; and identify strategies to improve relationships with culturally diverse groups. 24711 CMJ 155 Ethics in Criminal Justice - This course examines the difficult decisions that criminal justice professionals make in an environment of competing interests. T he decision making of criminal justice professionals can be impacted by ethical dilemmas. Emphasis is placed on addressing moral issues and concerns of our justice process in personal, social and criminal justice contexts . In addition to the department's credit courses, its Law Enforcement Academy also emphasizes cultural di versity in a number of courses (see Appendix F for law enforcement academy courses). Human Services SOC 101 Introduction to Sociology - Each semester, three sections of the course offe r students the opportunity to volunteer in cross -cultural settings where formal application of multiculturalism is experienced in service learning settings. Students must adopt a multicultural/sociological perspective, record their experiences in a journal , and conduct final presentations that include multicultural scenarios. During FY 2019, 36 students were involved in service -learning activities at unique sites in the area. During the same period, service learning was offered in five face -to-face sections . Thirty -six students served a total of 720 hours in a local community service (see Appendix G for SOC 101 service learning sites and locations). Mathematics -Science Students in MTH 152 Elementary Statistics were given a cultural diversity assignment asking them to use statistical principles to compare a racial, ethnic, or cultural group to the population as a whole. Students gather, organize, and analyze data which d eals with cultural diversity at the college. One part of the assignment involves a definition of the college's \"diversity value\" as to choosing a racial, ethnic, or cultural group and surveying five to ten Wor -Wic students belonging to that group, i.e., ve terans or Latinos. The data collection includes a student's name, age, and gender. The student researcher uses the collected data to calculate the mean age of the sample and the proportion of females in the same. A second part of that assignment incorporat es data from a Wor -Wic fact and figures document regarding the mean age of a student. Students determine if their chosen group is significantly different from the general population of the college. An integral part of the assignment is the reminder that W or-Wic recognizes the importance of promoting awareness, understanding, and appreciation of diverse racial, ethnic and cultural groups. In BIO 202 Anatomy and Physiology I, while studying the integumentary system, students can complete a bonus assignment that examines the biology of skin color. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute program includes films and interactives that examine the physiological trade - off between protection from UV and the need for absorption depending on the varying intensity of UV r adiation in different parts of the world, yet in spite of these variations in certain traits, all humans are closely related and share most traits. Combining genetics, chemistry, earth science, anthropology, and biology, this activity provides an importan t look at the genetics and physiology of human skin pigmentation and human diversity. A majority of students chose to complete this optional bonus activity and all earned full credit for th e quality of journal discussion (see Appendix H for mathematics -science cultural diversity initiatives). 24812 Nursing Wor-Wic Community College's nursing program is bound by the American Nurses Association's Code for Nurses and the state of Maryland's Nurse Practice Act . The standards require the professional nurse to provide compassionate care with respect for human dignity, worth, uniqueness and the rights of all individuals. Nurses are to be advocates for the delivery of dignified and humane care, and the self -worth o f an individual must not be negatively affected by health, illness, disease or disability. The information below explains the cultural diversity and sensitivity integration into the college's CPN & ADN nursing programs' curricula. Students are introduced t o cultural awareness, diversity and sensitivity in the beginning nursing course of the CPN program in the Self -Esteem/Self -Concept Unit in NUR 101: Nursing Fundamentals. Laying the foundation for understanding the importance of the provision of culturally competent care to ensure that all clients' individual psychosocial and physical needs are met, this particular unit encompasses ethnicity and culture, spirituality, growth and development throughout the life span and loss, grief and death. As the introduct ory course to the nursing profession, NUR 101 is taught to 48 students every fall semester and 32 every spring semester (see Appendix I for cultural diversity and sensitivity integration into the CPN & ADN nursing programs' curricula). Radiologic Technology The radiologic technology program (RDT) incorporates didactic instruction on cultural sensitivity and cultural competency within RDT 101 Introduction to Radiologic Technology, and RDT 109 Radiologic Nursing Procedures. Within these documented c ourses and the entire clinical practicum, students are required to follow the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) Standards of Ethics and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) Radiologic Technologist Code of Ethics. Stude nt radiographers and certified Radiologic Technologists are required to abide by these ethical principles. Cultural sensitivity is emphasized throughout the student clinical practicum experience. Students complete specific modules related to these topics during the student clinical orientation. Clinical sites have specific requirements that must be followed related to cultural sensitivity and interacting with diverse patient populations. These principles are emphasized within the clinical and radiologic n ursing procedures courses (see Appendix J for radiologic technology diversity and sensitivity initiatives). Reporting Campus -Based Hate Crimes In response to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, the colle ge's hate crime policy and procedures for reporting a crime is found in the safety and security section of the college's policy and procedures manual (PPM). In addition, hate crime statistics can be found in the college's annual security report which is pr epared, published, and distributed by the director of public safety. The annual security report is updated and posted by October 1, and a copy of the report can be acc essed on the college website at https://www.worwic.edu/WorWic/media/ServicesSupport/PublicSafety/AnnSecRpt.pdf , or a copy can be obtained by contacting the director of public safety at (410) 334 -2936. Further, the policy is define d in the 2018 -2019 college catalog (p. 27 ) and the safety and security section of the catalog's appendix includes the hate crime policy and procedures for reporting the cr ime (p. 231-235) (see Appendix K for crime reporting procedures). 24913 References 2018 Performance Accoun tabilit y Indicator Report Indicator #11: Percent Minorities of Full - time Faculty . 2018 Performance Accountability Indi cator Report Indicator #12: Percent Minorities of Full - time Administrative and Professional Staff . 2019 Maryland Association of C ommunity College Databook (March 2019 ).

(According to the college catalog, \"Diversity is the dynamic variety of people and ideas that prom ote greater skill and wisdom, and enhance institutional vitality...The college protects and welcomes a diversity of freely - exchanged and critically - considered perspectives and approaches in the learning and working process.\") A lot of people don't get the chance to understand and hear other people's opinions or get the chance to do something out of their comfort zone. Fortunately for me, from some of my experiences, I got the chance to do that and more. It helped me internalize the college's core value of d iversity. I learned how to be a better, more peaceful, and respectful person by listening to the wisdom shared by Diane Nash. She is a role model to many Americans and I'm honored to say I got to see her and consider her to be one of my heroes. The musical Hairspray that I attended was a chance to develop a critical perspective as an audience member reviewing a play. Even though I may have had a different opinion on the performances and production I acted respectful and learned from what was presented in fr ont of me. And finally, from the Ward museum I got the chance to view the visions and artwork from a painter who at first seemed like a regular local like me and turned out to have a diverse view on the environment we both grew up in. I know that from what I have learned I will be able to apply it to my classes and make me a more wholesome student. I am grateful to Wor -Wic Community College, for having a class like this. I think it should be a requirement for all students to experience. This class althou gh it was short; opened my eyes to a lot of things. The inclusiveness of the events whether they happened at Wor -Wic, SU or your hometown; was beneficial for all of us. Wor -Wic is a melting pot of all diverse cultures and backgrounds, I see it everyday on campus. The students and staff treat everyone like family, and that sets a positive atmosphere in encouraging learning. During this semester I attended events, I knew I would attend anyway, but this time I looked at these events with a purpose as I was re flecting on them...Another event although I didn't experience it was the reflective response from Diana Sabia about Ms. Diane Nash and her work with the Civil Rights Movement. Her principals of Agapic Energy (I classified as her movement); is what we need in this country today. We need everyone working together to make this country better today than it was yesterday...These experiences are being thankful for, it shows that we all don't live in a bubble, we want what's best for us, each other and the world. I am glad to be a part of such a diverse community at Wor -Wic Community College. 25519 Appendix F - Law Enforcement Academy Courses Cultural Diversity and Bias Incident Reporting - The course prepares the student to deal fairly and effectively with culturally diverse communities within society. The student must be acquainted with the basic sociology principal necessary to understand persons of different religions, race, and ethnic backgrounds so as to supplant ignorance and bigotry which brings out unjust and ineffective law enforcement and improper exercise of obligations to all segments of society. This in turn will build trust and partnerships with through respect, dialogue, cooperation, appropriate and effective consultation and communication; Crimes Against the Elderly - This course provides law enforcement personnel with information to improve their ability to understand and communicate with older people. To communicate effectively law enforcement personnel must understand citizen's expectati ons, vulnerabilities and fears. They must also understand the different needs that this group of citizens has and that persons over 65 years of age now constitute the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Dealing with the Mentally Ill - This course will acquaint the student -officer with the complex task of handling a disturbed person. It should assist the student -officer to recognize abnormal behavior that is potentially destructive and then intervene effectively. It should stress three objec tives at the same time: protect the public, safeguard officer's well -being and treat the mentally or emotionally disturbed person as humanly as possible. The main of this goal is give officer the tools to deescalate a person who is in crisis. Code of Eth ics - The course explores the relationship between law and the police, the role and function of the police in a free society, and the range of problems confronting the police. Emphasis is constantly being placed on the need to raise law enforcement to a co mpletely professional status. No professional status is possible until the representatives of law enforcement adopt and maintain a rigid code of professional ethics and conduct. Public respect, cooperation, sympathy and confidence are wholly dependent up on the practice of ethical conduct over and above that of most other segments of society. Dealing with Individuals with Disabilities - The course provides law enforcement personnel with information to improve their ability to understand and communicate wit h a persons with a disability. Developmental Disabilities . This subject provides the student -officer with information to improve their ability to understand and communicate with individuals with developmental disabilities. To communicate effectively law e nforcement personnel must understand the different needs and differences of individuals with developmental disabilities. Survival Spanish -This course will provide the student -officer with instruction in elementary Spanish. Emphasis will be placed on thos e phrases most utilized when police officers interact with a Spanish - speaking citizen. Integrated Communications Assessment and Tactics - This subject provides the student -officer with information concerning ICAT: Integrating Communications, Assessment, a nd Tactics. Integrated ICAT is a new way of thinking about use -of-force training for American police officers. ICAT takes the essential building blocks of critical thinking, crisis intervention, communications, and tactics, and puts them together in an int egrated approach to training. ICAT is anchored by a Critical Decision -Making Model that helps officers assess situations, make safe and effective decisions, and document and learn from their actions. 25620 The goal of ICAT is to enhance both officer safety and public safety. How? By providing police officers with more tools, skills, and options for handling different types of critical incidents, especially those that involve subjects who are acting erratically because of mental illness or behavioral crisis and who are unarmed or armed with a weapon. In addition to the department's credit courses and in the Law Enforcement Academy, its Correctional Academy also emphasizes cultural diversity in a number of courses: Ethics and Professionalism for the Correctional Professional - The student -officer will identify why correctional staff should exemplify the highest professional, ethical and moral standards. This course will examine the function of a professional correcti onal officer and the importance of discipline and ethical behavior both on and off duty. Cross Cultural Relations - The student -officer will become familiar with how multiple ethnicities of staff and inmates impact the correctional environment. Participan ts will review how inmates capitalize on prejudicial attitudes and how they may successfully work within this type of environment. Crisis De -escalation and Intervention - This module provides real world scenarios in a mock Correctional setting. Participants utilize skills learned during Crisis De -escalation and Intervention training to react to instructor lead scenario training exercises. Afterword, the instructor will review and critique the student's performance. Dealing with inmates with spec ial needs -.This lesson provides information about special needs inmates. The student -officer will explore the definition of a \"special needs\" individual in confinement situation and identify procedures for managing the special needs individual. Developmen tal Disabilities . This subject provides the student -officer with information to improve their ability to understand and communicate with individuals with developmental disabilities. To communicate effectively law enforcement personnel must understand the d ifferent needs and differences of individuals with developmental disabilities. Mental Health - Mental health disorders encountered in a correctional system will be reviewed and discussed. The student -officer will learn how to recognize and deal effectivel y with inmates who suffer with a mental health disorder . Continuing Education -Crisis Intervention Team Training - This course is to help alleviate the problem by providing law enforcement personnel with training in how to safely and compassionately handl e a person in a mental health crisis. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officers are trained to identify when someone may be experiencing a mental health crisis and adapt strategies for those individuals. This approach has been proven to dramatically decrea se the risk of injuries or death to both officers and people with mental illnesses, and it also reduces the number of repeat calls. 25721 Appendix G - Service Learning Sites and Locations SOC 101 Service Learning Sites and Locations Atlantic General Hospital Berlin, MD Berlin Humane Society Berlin, MD Berlin Nursing Home Berlin, MD Bloxom Volunteer Fire Department Bloxom, VA Buckingham Elementary School Berlin, MD Christian Shelter Salisbury, MD Delmar Elementary School Delmar, MD Delmar VFW Delmar, MD Emmanuel Wesleyan Church Salisbury, MD Lift Church Salisbury, MD Pittsville Elementary School Pittsville, MD Snow Hill, MD Snow Hill Christian Nursery School Stephen Decatur High School Berlin, MD Village of Hope Salisbury MD Wicomico Nursing Home Salisbury, MD Wicomico Police Department Salisbury, MD 25822 Appendix H - Mathematics -Science Cultural Diversity Initiatives The MTH 102 Quantitative Literacy course includes several activities with cultural diversity themes: 1. Students research biographies of mathematicians from various cultures, highlighting which events, circumstances or political climates influenced their work. Students bring their work to class, analyze and present their work by constructing Venn diagrams. 2. Students learn about the notation and operations of mathematics within five cultures - Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, Roman, and Mayan. 3. Students research and write a paper on another mathematical system, for example, Aborigine, Islamic, Hebrew, and Braille. 4. Students complete an exploration of Chinese numerals. 5. As part of the writing assignment, students are asked to view a movie that features mathematicians from other countries, for example Srinivasa Ramanujan from India, Steven Hawking and Alan Turing from England, and Paul Erdos from Hungary (see Appendix G for additional mathematics/science department course updates). In BIO 203 Anatomy and Physiology II, while studying the digestive system and genetics, st udents can complete a bonus assignment that examines the co -evolution of genes and different cultures. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute program includes films and interactives that explore the question of why when most adult humans lose the ability to digest lactose in milk, some cultures have maintained this ability. Combining genetics, chemistry, anthropology, and biology, this activity provides a compelling example of human diversity and gene -culture co -evolution, tracing the origin of a trait in pa storalist cultures that lived less than 10,000 years ago. A majority of students chose to complete this optional bonus activity and all earned full credit for the quality of journal discussion. In IDS 200H Scientific Thought and Data Analysis Honors, as p art of the course objective to explore and evaluate the ethics and societal impact of science across history, the students read and discuss chapters from Charles Darwin's The Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle and Marie Curie's biography of Pierre Curie, that contain s an appended autobiography, and her 1921 speech at Vassar College in the U.S. While reading Charles Darwin, students discuss his observations on the many diverse native cultures he encountered in South America and the abomination of slavery he witnesses, and how his experiences will lay the foundation for his development of his scientific theory of natural selection that refuted such concepts as scientific racism. We also discuss how his Origin of Species later became an important tool in the United States for the abolitionists, through Asa Gray. While reading Marie Curie, students discuss the struggles of females combatting sexism in science. All students participated in multiple class discussions and a majority incorporated new personal perspectives ga ined about one or both of these topics in their graded journals. In BIO 101, students complete a unit on the study of DNA. This spring, students were engaged in class discussion regarding Dr. James Watson, a pioneer in the field of DNA research. Watson, alongside Dr. James Crick, was awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering the double -helix structure of DNA. Now in his 90s, Watson has been stripped of his honorary titles for repeated racist comments implying that race is linked to intelligence, am bition, and sexual prowess. Students were read quotes from members of the scientific community, which were united in their rejection of the use of science to justify prejudicial attitudes. Students were asked to discuss whether the actions against Watson were appropriate and justified. All students participated in class discussions and were given an opportunity to formulate an educated opinion, substantiated with facts, on the misuse of science as bonus points during a lecture examination. 25923 Appendix I - Cultural Diversity and Sensitivity Integration into the CPN & ADN Nursing Programs' Curricula Two key course objectives for NUR 101 that encompass meeting the individualized goals of clients are: 1. Utilize the nursing process (assessm ent, diagnosing, planning, implementing and evaluating) to meet the client's basic self -care needs. 2. Use Maslow's hierarchy of needs to prioritize the self -care needs of the client. Some of the objectives of the unit include: 1. Describe the concept of cultu re with identified characteristics and universal attributes. 2. Discuss factors related to communication with culturally diverse clients and colleagues. 3. Discuss the factors that affect the interaction of the nurse and the client in terms of culturally differ ent healthcare values. 4. Describe ways to overcome cultural barriers to health care. 5. Describe the different health views of culturally diverse clients: magico -religious, biomedical, and holistic. 6. Discuss the use of specific cultural and ethnic factors i n providing holistic, individualized, culture -sensitive nursing care to clients. 7. Describe the influences of spirituality of everyday living, health, and illness. 8. Discuss factors that influence spirituality. 9. Describe nursing strategies including related scientific rationales to support client's spiritual beliefs and religious practices. 10. Discuss ethical/legal issues concerning end of life care. 11. Describe physiologic, psychologic, and spiritual care of a dying client and family. 12. Summarize major phys iologic, cognitive, psychosocial, moral, and spiritual development of early, middle, and older adulthood. 13. Describe common myths and stereotypes that perpetuate ageism. Inherent in all other core nursing courses of the CPN and ADN curriculum, emphasis is placed upon health disparities and health literacy among specific populations as to their prevalence, incidence and care of the populations of clients with illnesses, dis orders and disease processes. Health, wellness and education for health care consumers across various populations are also emphasized and the nurse's roles are taught. The third and final semester of the CPN program has included a group cultural project for students enrolled in NUR 121: Maternal/Child Nursing. This project includes researching the health beliefs and practices, common health disparities and the impact of economics on health, wellness and illness of certain cultural populations from birth t o death. Students present their findings via poster presentations. Directly progressing from the third semester of the CPN program into the first semester of the ADN program, student not only begin to learn how to care for clients with very complex healt h problems, they also learn the role of the professional nurse in the community and population health. Much emphasis in this module is placed on health disparities specific to the local region, including issues such concepts as social justice and linguisti cally competent health care, vulnerable and special needs populations, poverty, and barriers to access to health care. The first semester ADN course, NUR 222: Advanced Nursing I and Community Health also requires all students to complete an online cultural competency course, which consists of three modules, a pre -test and post -tests. Students are awarded a certificate of completion when they finish. The Cultural Competency can be found at https://ccn m.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/ . 26024 Appendix J - Radiologic Technology Diversity and Sensitivity Initiatives In an effort to continuously emphasize ethical practice standards and patient cultures, students discuss within the class ethical dilemmas experienced during clinical rotations. These discussions include cultural sensitivity issues and best practices to ensure the safety and comfort of patients from various cultures within their care as radiologic technologists. Clinical instructors and radio logic technology program faculty participate in the student ethical dilemma presentations. Ethical lessons are discussed following student presentations. Alternative methods for handling ethical dilemmas in the clinical setting are explained. Methods to pr ovide the best patient outcome while remaining sensitive to individual patient needs are discussed. The student radiographers' understanding of cultural diversity and sensitivity as each applies to the healthcare arena is assessed through a cultural divers ity research paper and oral presentation completed in RDT 205 Radiographic Positioning and Clinical Practicum II. The assignment for the cultural diversity paper requires students to describe how selected cultures cope with surgery, medical procedures and death; customs and practices associated with the selected culture and how each impacts healthcare administration; the religious beliefs related to the selected culture that influence healthcare decisions; identification of taboos or superstitions concernin g medicine or treatment specific to the identified culture; and describe who is responsible for making healthcare decisions in the particular culture. In addition to the completion of a cultural diversity paper, students construct a PowerPoint presentatio n on their specific culture and explain points of interest to the class. Professional development evaluations assess the student radiographer's adaptability to diverse clinical situations that include patient care interactions. Students must achieve clini cal competency on a plethora of imaging exams involving patients of differing age groups and in trauma situations. Students in RDT 205 Radiographic Position & Clinical Practicum II are required to complete a cultural diversity paper and presentation. Asse ssment results from FY18 are available for evaluation. FY19 cultural diversity paper and presentation assessments are planned for the conclusion of the spring 2019 semester. 26125 Appendix K - Crime Reporting Procedures Any member of the campus community who i s a victim of, or witness to, a crime should call 911 and the college public safety department at (410) 334 -2937 . Anyone who needs help reporting a crime to police can obtain assistance from the public safety department. Prompt reporting assures timely war ning notices and accurate disclosure of crime statistics. Victims or witnesses can report crimes, or suspicious behaviors or activities, on a voluntary, confidential basis by sending a text message to 50911 . The text message should begin with UTIPS , and th e date, time, location and description of the incident should be provided in the text. All reports of criminal activity are investigated and recorded in the daily crime log in the public safety department by the officer taking the report. The daily crime log is available for public inspection during normal business hours at the public safety department located in Room 102 of Henson Hall. In addition to the daily crime reporting log, the Jeanne Cleary Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statisti cs Act requires that certain crimes, which could require the assistance of local law enforcement officials, must be included in the annual security report. Primary crimes that must be reported include murder, negligent manslaughter, forcible and non -forcib le sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson. All primary crimes, as well as larceny/theft, simple assault, intimidation, and destruction, damage or vandalism of property, are also classified as hate crimes when the re is evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the victim's actual or perceived race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin or disability. Other crimes that must be reported are domestic vio lence, dating violence and stalking, as well as criminal charges or referrals to the college's student -faculty disciplinary committee for alcohol, drug or weapons violations. (Wor -Wic Catalog 2018 -2019, p. 231) 262 Four-Year Public Colleges and Universities 263 ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT : INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY 2018- 2019 Bowie State University (BSU) Coppin State University (CSU) Frostburg State University (FSU) Salisbury University (SU) Towson University (TU) University of Baltimore (UB) University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) University of Maryland University College (UMUC) Office of the Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs Presentation to Board of Regents Committee on Education Policy and Student Life University of Maryland System Office May 7, 2019 264 1 USM Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report, 2018-2019 In 2008, the Maryland General Assembly required higher education institutions to develop, implement, and submit a plan for a program of cultural diversity to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). Additionally, institutions must submit annual progress reports to MHEC summarizing institutional progress toward the implementation of its plan for cultural diversity. Within the progress reports, institutions must describe work being done to achieve the following goals: Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally-underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty; Goal 2: Create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus; and Goal 3: Provide a statement regarding the process for the reporting of campus-based hate crimes as consistent with federal requirements under the Clery Act. The following tables include select initiatives USM institutions have instituted to achieve the aforementioned goals. To experience the full scope of the work, please refer to institutions' complete submissions on the USM website. Finally, it should be noted that although the original intent of this report was to address racial diversity, our institutions' efforts address diversity more broadly by considering race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, ability, socioeconomic status, as well as programs and training that address diversity of thought and opinion. Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally-underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty. Table 1 offers examples of ways our institutions work to increase numerical diversity within their communities. Although institutions approach this goal differently, two themes emerged. Targeted Recruitment and P-20 Partnerships to Increase the Numerical Representation of Underrepresented Students Across the USM, dozens of strategies are in use to appeal to underrepresented student populations. USM institutions are: - engaged in partnerships with high schools in majority minority regions of the state; - have established MOUs with community colleges to focus on transfer students; - often offer scholarships to students who are brought to their university through one of these types of programs; - target marketing in areas that increase the probability of it being viewed by underrepresented minorities; - partner with HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions to recruit students into graduate and professional programs; and /or - participating in fairs and other outreach with community-based organizations, other colleges and universities. 265 2 Focus on the Recruitment, Hiring, Onboarding, Retention, and Advancement of Underrepresented Minority Faculty and Staff USM institutions are employing a variety of strategies that focus on increasing faculty and staff (to a lesser extent) diversity. Institutions are considering that work from many angles from the recruitment of faculty on through hiring, onboarding, retaining them, and being able to offer opportunities for advancement. Institutions are: - training search committees to use inclusive hiring practices; - monitoring the diversity of search committees; - facilitating pathways to academic careers for graduate and professional students; - targeting job advertisements to specific publications and networks; - providing training so departments better understand how implicit bias relates to hiring practices; - tracking the diversity of applicants and hires; - creating faculty networking groups and mentoring programs; and/or - using analytics to assess progress in the diversity profiles of the applicant pool and, ultimately, hires. Goal 2: Create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. Table 2 offers examples of institutional efforts to encourage positive and inclusive interactions and cultural awareness. Although institutions approach this differently, two themes emerged. Programs, Courses, and Training A wide variety of programs, courses, and trainings are designed to improve the campus culture. Campus professionals in student affairs as well as academic affairs are providing these opportunities, but this is also where students and student organizations get most involved in working to enhance inclusion and improve interactions among the campus community. Impressively, initiatives address \"diversity\" in the broadest sense, as courses, training, and programs address issues of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, ability differences, gender, gender identity, and socioeconomic status at least. This work encourages and facilitates collaborations, conversations, and engagement between student groups and other members of the university communities. Diversity and Inclusion Offices and Workgroups Several USM institutions have offices and chief diversity officers charged with overseeing this important work. Where there is no diversity office or chief diversity officer, many university officials have established or reinvigorating diversity and inclusion workgroups or councils. Goal 3: Provide a statement regarding the process for the reporting of campus-based hate crimes as consistent with federal requirements under the Clery Act. Each USM institution provided a statement detailing their process for reporting campus-based hate crimes, which is mandated by the Clery Act. Data were not required for this report, but annually, all institutions who receive Title IV (federal student aid) funding submit crime data to the Department of Education. Also, annually, institutions must publish and distribute an annual campus security report to all current students and employees. In most cases, these reports are on institutions' websites, so the information is also available to perspective students and their families. Out of increased concern about 266 3 hate crimes and hate-bias incidents, the 2018 Joint Chairmen's Report required the Maryland Higher Education Commission to collect information about institutions' programs about hate-bias incidents. The reports were due in October of 2018. All USM institutions responded to the request for information about (1) institution's policies on hate-bias incidents; (2) their plan or process for educating students about hate-bas incidents, including awareness, prevention, and deterrence; (3) and the number of hate-bias incidents that have occurred during the last three academic years. The reports revealed that although not every institution has a formal policy on hate-bias incidents, they do have policies that effectively prohibit hate-bias incidents, by prohibiting activities such as verbal harassment, intimidation, and hostile expressions against other members of the campus community. Institutions treat hate-bias incidents as violations of the institutions' student conduct policies and respond as they would to other such violations: by investigating the complaint and punishing perpetrators as necessary. Regarding education and awareness, many institutions reported already providing education about hate-bias incidents to students and other members of the campus community via the school's broader cultural diversity training. Others were actively implementing education and outreach regarding hate-bias incidents. Finally, MHEC found that it was impossible to draw any safe conclusions on the number of bate-bias incidents that occurred at colleges and universities, as institutions were not reporting based on a standardized, statewide definition, so incidents reported seemed to be inconsistent. Hate-bias incidents and hate crimes are not identical, yet it appears that these occurrences were often confused. For now, the most consistent measure of hate-motivated incidents is the count of hate crimes that is reported to the Department of Education for Clery. Conclusion These reports demonstrate the importance institutions place on increasing the representation of traditionally-underrepresented groups and creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Most of the work to be done around these issues must take place at the campus level and depends upon involvement from a wide variety of administrative units and academic schools, colleges, and departments. Work within and across divisions is important, occurring, and will hopefully become more systemic. Institutions also note inter-institutional work and important partnerships within their communities, which is promising. Although there was no formal diversity-related gathering since the last presentation to the Committee in September, diversity and inclusion issues are perennial issues on the agendas of the Council of University System Presidents, the provosts, the vice presidents for student affairs, and the shared governance groups. Additionally, the USM Inclusion and Diversity Council stands ready to help the System develop and implement ideas to move forward on these issues. Institutions are appropriately tackling inclusion and diversity from multiple perspectives. This work will continue, as there is no quick or singular fix. Our colleges and universities cite the need for additional resources to most effectively implement or sustain some of their initiatives. In the meantime, they find ways to make progress on this important work. All have identified a number of areas for continuous improvement and/or programs they are willing to continue supporting, as it often takes years for the outcomes of these activities and strategies to be realized. The USM staff will continue to work with the institutions on their compliance with the statute guiding this report, with determining the best ways to bring this information to the Board of Regents, and, most importantly, with conducting the work needed to make our institutions the representative, welcoming, and productive entities we want them to be. 2671 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report ~ 2018- 2019 \u00a711-406 of the Education Article states that each public institution of higher education in the State shall submit a progress report regarding the institution 's implementation of a plan for a program of cultural diversity .

Goal 4 of the Strategic Plan specifically focuses on enhancing the campus culture of diversity, inclusion and civic engagement. Strategic Plan Goal 4 objectives are listed below. Goal 4 - Enhancing our Campus Culture of Diversity, Inclusion and Civic Engagement Bowie State Univers ity will embrace, promote, and support a community of cultural inclusivity, diversity and accountability by ensuring that faculty, staff and students develop a mindset of accountability in teaching, learning, support programs, and extra -curricular campus experiences designed to enhance collaboration and engagement. Objectives 4.1 Community of inclusion - Sustain our commitment to fostering and supporting a safe, civil and welcoming environment for students, faculty, and staff by being intentional about how our community encourages involvement, respect, and connection among its members (State Plan: Success, Strategy 4). 4.2 Culturally responsive pedagogies - Expand the use of culturally responsive pedagogies through faculty development (State Plan: Success , Strategy 5, 6). 4.3 Multicultural programs and services - Establish an Office of Multicultural Programs and Services that promotes an appreciation of inclusion and diversity on campus and assists with the retention and graduation of international student s. 4.4 Culture of historical richness - Cultivate a culture of historical richness through campus displays and events that celebrate historical significant events and outcomes. 4.5 Civic responsibility - Continue to educate the next generation of global ci tizens to build stronger, more engaged communities through coordinated and deliberate activities aimed at improving the quality of life in our community and strengthening our democracy through political and nonpolitical engagement. In addition, the Strate gic Plan articulates the core values of the University: Excellence, Inclusivity , Integrity, Accountability , and Innovation. Our core value of Inclusivity is defined as \"intentional about creating a community that encourages involvement, respect, and connection among students, faculty, staff, and administrators regardless of differences of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, culture, sexual 282orien tation, religion, age, and disability.\" As an HBI, the Bowie State community believed it was important to adopt a definition that went beyond race and ethnicity to include the numerous other characteristics that bring richness to our campus communi ty. In the past, the Unive rsity took a decentralized approach to support cultural diversity. Annual objectives relating to cultural diversity flow through the offices of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Executive Vice President and General Counsel, the Vice President of Administration and Finance and the Vice President for Student Affairs. Building upon the previous work of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, President Breaux , in FY 2019, engaged in numerous discussions with campus constituencies related to the structure of diversity and inclusion activities on campus. A multi -phase proposal for a diversity and inclusion unit is in draft form with initial funding planned for FY 2020. In anticipation of the Diversity and Inclusion unit, t he Center for Academic Programs Assessment (CAPA) began to collect base -line student data on intercultural competency and diversity to inform the work of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee by participating in the Educational Testing Service (ETS) HEIghten pilot study. The ETS HEIghten study defined intercultural competency and diversity (ICD) as a \"person's capability to gather, interpret, and act upon radically different cues and function effectively in multicultural situations. Over 200 academic officers at com munity colleges and four -year institutions participated in the pilot study. Four pilot forms were designed for the ICD assessment. Each ICD form had 80 items and was designed to be less than 40- minutes long. Areas assess included: Analyze and Act : The ability to take in, evaluate and synthesize relevant information without the bias of preconceived judgments and to translate thoughts into actions. Approach : The overall positivity with which an individual views and responds to cross -cultural interactions . Positive Cultural Orientation : The evaluation of cross -cultural situations as favorable. Cultural Self -Efficacy : The belief that one can successfully engage in cross -cultural situations. Suspending Judgment/Perspective Taking : Active consideration of others' potential viewpoints and active refrainment of preconceived cultural schema interfering with informed processing. Social Monitoring : Awareness of physical, verbal and nonverbal behaviors and cues of others during a social interaction; attention to oth ers' responses to one's own actions and signals. Baseline data from HEIghten indicated that BSU students were very close to the proficient level in \"Analyze and Act\" in \"Approach\" . BSU students were within .5 points or less of their national comparison peers in Positive Cultural Orientation and Cultural Self -Efficacy . Suspending Judgment/ Perspective Taking and Social Monitoring were the areas where BSU students and the comparison group had the largest gaps with BSU students scoring lo wer than those students at comparison institutions. The Office of Equity and Compliance and the Facilities Management collaborated on an ADA and Accessibility Survey to improve the design and detail of campus grounds and facilities to meet the needs and expectations of our community members of all abilities. Several 283opp ortunities for improvement were identified related to parking and elevator availability and reliability. The finding supp orted a FY 2019 grant proposal for facilities improvements. The c ore value of Inclusi on is measured through the Ruffalo Noel Levitz Student Satisfaction Inventory survey administered every three years and being collected in spring 2019. The University is surveying faculty and staff using the Ruffalo Noel Levitz College Employee Satisfaction Survey in fall 2019 to gather updated information on campus climate to inform the cultural diversity plan. Findings from these and other sources will be used to inform the activity planning for the Diversity and Inclusion unit. 284Bowie State University Senate Bill 438 Institutional Cultural Diversity Plan February 22, 2009 Having been in the employee ranks of Bowie State University (BSU) for less than six months, I am one of the newest members of the leadership team. I am not the only new member, however; t he entire leadership team is new. As Dr. Mickey L. Burnim is in his third year as University President, a ll of his Cabinet members (five vice presidents, legal counsel , and the director o f public relations) and each of the a cademic deans (Arts & Sciences, Business, Education, and Professional Studies) were hired after his appointment as University President. An addition to the Cabinet, the Athletic Director was added; the person in that position was not a new hire. A series of searches are currently underway to fill critical administrative positions, some of which have been vacant for more than one year. Primary among these slots are the positions of Assistant Vice President for Institutional Effectiveness and Director of Institutional Effectiveness. As Bowie State University has a long -standing commitment to diversity, it values and celebrates diversity in all of its forms. The University community believes that its educational environment is enriched by the diversity of individuals, groups and cultures that come together in a spirit of learning. As the University aspires to even greater racial diversity, it fully embraces the global textbook definition of the term, diversity. It is one that acknowledges and recognizes difference and advances knowledge about race, ethnicity, national origin, age, gender, socio-economic status, religion, sexual orientation, veteran's status, disability, and intellectual perspective. Evidence of BSU's commitment is seen in all of the critical documents ema nating from the University and is immediately apparent to those who visit the campus . Efforts to move beyond rhetoric to additional initiatives as required by Senate Bill 438 has been somewhat slow, due, in large part to this period of administrative transition . President Burnim appointed a Strategic Plan Committee in 2006. The committee developed a Strategic Plan for 2007-2012. Details of the Plan can be found at the following address: http://www.bowiestate.edu/UploadedFiles/about/message/reports/strategic_plan/Strat egicPlan.81706.pdf . As th ere is evidence of p rogress on the BSU campus, please note the follo wing statistical data regarding initiatives as well as an additional listing of campus strategies and initiatives, all of which corroborate our success of our initiatives : a. Statistics outlining the ethnic/racial makeup of our campus community; b. Several critical documents where the University's commitment to diversity are delineated. Key phrases have been highlighted; c. A set of initiatives currently under consideration for implementation in the near future. 285 A.

Through the integration of internal business processes, technology, and the teamwork of administrators, faculty and staff, the University will be recognized statewide as a model of excellence in higher education for the effective and efficient use of human, fiscal, and physical resources. MISSION Bowie State University, through the effective and efficient management of its resources, provides high-quality and affordable educational opportunities at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels for a diverse student population of Maryland citizens an d the global community. The educational programs are designed to broaden the knowledge base and skill set of students across disciplines and to enable students to think critically, value diversity , become effective leaders, function competently in a highly technical world, and pursue advanced graduate study. The University is committed to increasing the number of students from underrepresented minorities who earn adv anced degrees in computer science, mathematics, information technology, and education. Constituent needs, market demands, and emerging challenges confronting socioeconomic cultures serve as important bases in the University's efforts to develop educational programs and improve student access to instruction. 288 With regard to the specifics of Senate Bill 438, the following is an update on progress made at Bowie State University : I. Develop and implement a plan for a program of cultural diversity. II. If an institution of higher education already has a program of cultural diversity, develop and implement a plan for improving the program. BSU Response: While the University sponsors numerous campus -wide initiatives and activities which support cultural diversity, no formal institution -wide plan has been approved to date. With the recent reorganization of the Academic Affairs area by the new Provost, several new positions have been created that will formalize and bring structure to the University's current efforts and aspirations in the area of cultural diversity. Among these positions are the following : Assistant Vice President for Undergraduate Studies Responsibilities : Among the primary foci of this new position are two retention - centered initiatives; (a) to provide greater academic oversight of several University student support services; and (b) to provide leadership for a new initiative at BSU, the creation of several Learning Communities. Support from the provost's office will have the cumulative effect of strengthening the University's efforts to support the special needs of our dive rse student population. Status of Search: Underway/Projected start date - July 1, 2009 Assistant to the Provost for Special Initiatives Responsibilities : This unique new position will have a rotating portfolio of responsibility\u2014one that will focus on a smorgasbord of initiatives that the University wishes to advance. One of the primary focus areas for the first year will be the University's Honors Program. The goal is one of making this program more select while increasing participation from majority and international students. Status of Search : Underway/Projected start date - July 1, 2009 Coordinator for International Programs Responsibilities : Embracing the full definition of diversity, BSU seeks to further increase its internationa l profile, particularly with students and faculty as well as to provide the necessary accommodations to insure the success of its international students and faculty. This new position will allow the University to focus more closely this critical area. Status of Search: Underway/Projected start date - July 1, 2009 289 Coordinator for Learning Communities and Interdisciplinary Studies Responsibilities: A retention initiative, this new position reports to the newly created position Assistant Vice President for Undergraduate Studies. Status of Search: Underway/Projected start date - July 1, 2009 With these positions in place by the beginning of the Fall, '09 semester, the Provost plans to appoint a special task -force charged to lead the University community in the creation of a BSU Cultural Diversity Plan. III. Include an implementation strategy and a timeline for meeting the goals within the plan. Include the following: A. Description of the way the institution addressed cultural diversity among its students, faculty, and staff populations; B. Description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity, if improvement is needed; C. Process for responding to reporting campus- based hate crimes and bias - motivated incidents that may occur on campus as defined under title 10, subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article and consistent with federal under 20 U.S. 1092 (F) known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act; and D. Summary of any resources, including state grants, needed by the institution to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body, faculty, and staff. BSU Response: Proposed timeline for meeting goals Institutional charge to Task- Force - September, 2009 Deadline for Report from Task -Force - November, 2009 Public Presentation of BSU Cultural Diversity Plan to University Community - December, 2009 1 st Phase of Implementation - January, 2010 (Preparation for this phase will be included in the budget for AY 09 -10) 2 nd Phase of Implementation - Each semester following (Depending on budget and proposed Jan., 2010 Approval of anticipated implementation date curricula changes 290 A&B. While the University is moving aggressively to raise the bar in the way it addresses the concerns of international students, faculty, and staff, it is currently depending on Mr. Robert Batten, Interim Dean of Student Affairs and International Student Advisor, who brings issues and concerns of international students to the University's attention . Evidence of BSU's commitment is seen in all of the critical documents emanating from the University and is immediately apparent to those who visit the campus. The r ole of the University Relations and Marketing (URM) team at Bowie State University (BSU) is to support internal constituents develop better long- term relationships with BSU students and external constituents. The URM team performs its role by using various marketing tools while incorporating the institutions mission and vision at the same time as adhering to the institutions core values: excellence, integrity, civility, diversity, and accountability. Examples of diversity in recent market collateral are seen in the following: Graduate View Book which provides testimonies from Male Professor of African descent Female Alumna of Asian descent Female international student, from Thailand Female African American student Semester promotions that highlight varying ethnic groups Inclusion of the Bowie State's five core values in brochures BSU also has a LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender) Resource Center. Its mission is as follows: (1) To provide programs and services that promote academic and personal growth for all of its students; (2) To assure unrestricted access to and full i nvolvement in all aspects of the institution; and (3) To serve as a catalyst for the creation of a campus environment free from prejudice, bigotry, harassment, violence and one that is hospitable for all students. The following are examples of activities that have been initiated or supported in support of cultural diversity by the Division of Student Affairs: Asian Bazaar African Bazaar Latin Bazaar International Cultural Fair We actively recruit all students for leadership roles Actively recrui t all student for RA positions Fraternities and Sororities are all multicultural 291 Diversity Training is at the core root of RA training. Staff Council started a Development Created a GLBTQA Advisory organization C. Hate Crimes are reported by the 8th day of each month on the Monthly Uniform Crime Reports and are submitted to the Maryland State Police. The Supplementary Hate Bias Incident Report Form is filled out which gives the date of the incident, report number, and the circumstances surrounding the incident. These statistics are generated by the Maryland State Police Central Records. Ms Clery requires accounting for those Hate Crimes where there is a reported homicide, rape, robbery, assault, B&E, larceny, or motor vehicle theft. D. Recent application for State Grants Agency: MHEC (Maryland Higher Education Commission) Title: Accelerated BSU Program with Retention and Success Initiatives Objective: Expand the State's nursing capacity through shared resources and increased focus on student retention and success. Focus Group: Transfers from community colleges, military in active duty, second - degree seekers. IV. Enhance cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff at the institution of higher education. BSU Response: Future Plans related to Cultural Diversity While BSU has brought speakers to campus, it has no distinguished speaker series nor does it have a concert series. Such a series will be started at BSU during the 09- 10 academic year. Such a speaker series can bring to campus well-known speakers with a variety of perspectives \u2014political and otherwise. Taking advantage of its strategic location and rich cultural offerings, BSU can easily find outstanding speakers and world-renowned concert artists in the Greater Baltimore -Washington area. Such a series w ould serve to bring faculty, students, and staff back to campus for the evening. V. On or before May 1 of each year, each institution shall submit the plan to the governing body of the institution for the governing body's review. BSU Response: We will comply. VI. On or before August of each year, the governing body of an institution shall submit a progress report regarding the institution's implementation of its plan to the Commission. BSU Response: We will comply. 292 COPPIN STATE UNIVERSITY 293Page 1 of 12 INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT AY 2018 - 2019 April 17, 2018 Office of Academic Affairs 294Page 2 of 12 INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT COPPIN STATE UNIVERSITY AY 2018 - 2019 BACKGROUND Education Article 11-406, of the Code of Maryland Regulations, states that each public institution must annually submit updates on plans of cultural diversity. At Coppin State University (CSU), diversity refers to programming related to the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are, or have been underrepresented in higher education. Additionally, the University's programs, strategies, and activities are inclusive of persons regardless of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, and military status. As required by the University System of Maryland (USM), CSU has developed and implemented a plan that enhances cultural diversity and inclusion awareness through programming, instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff. Using the template provided by the USM, details of the plan are provided below. SECTION I: Progress Report on Goals 1-3 Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty.

Statement 1 (do not include statistics): Reporting of Institutional Goal 3 - Hate Crimes INSTITUTION HAS A PROCESS FOR REPORTING HATE CRIMES Although hate crimes have been zero or minimal at the University, the campus has several outlets for reporting hate crimes and any other malicious acts by students, faculty, and staff. CSU is compliant with the processes outlined by the USM as well as the federal requirements under the Clery Act of 1990. The process is detailed on the University's website (Campus Police site) at https://www.coppin.edu/downloads/file/1302/complaint_procedure. The campus police will conduct an investigation of all complaints filed in a timely manner. The information is communicated to the public using the campus' annual Public Safety Campus Crime Report, which is posted to the university's home page. Also, as crimes are reported in and around the surrounding community, the Campus Police sends e-mail blasts describing the crimes and 298Page 6 of 12 requested the community to always exercise caution and to report these crimes. The public remains aware of any crimes primarily through this process. Students are able to report crimes through the Office of Community Standards and Conduct within the Division of Student Affairs. Reports may also be made to the Division of Academic Affairs. Students involved in such incidents have access to the campus' judicial process, the campus police, and if necessary, Baltimore City's Police Department. Faculty and Staff are able to report crimes through the Office of Human Resources or the Coppin State Police. This information is communicated to them through orientation processes as well as through professional development and training offered during the academic year. Compliance with New Requirements The Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) requires that institutions submit reports on Hate-Bias Plans and Hazing Policies. CSU developed a plan that includes incident response protocols and a process for tracking reported incidents. This was a require ment by the Joint Chairs last year. 299Page 7 of 12 APPENDIX SECTION II: INSTITUTIONAL PLAN NARRATIVE SECTION III: INSTITUTIONAL DATA 300Page 8 of 12 SECTION II: INSTITUTIONAL PLAN NARRATIVE - Report on Progress CSU's defines cultural diversity as strategic programming related to the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education. Also, the University is inclusive of persons regardless of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, and military status. Cultural diversity and inclusion is a central to the institution's mission. Institutional Mission Statement (revised 2018; approved 2019 ) Coppin State University, a historically black institution in a dynamic urban setting, serves a multi- generational student population, provides innovative education opportunities, and promotes lifelong learning. The University fosters leadership, social responsibility, civic and community engagement, cultural diversity and inclusion, and economic development. Cultural Diversity Among Students CSU is uniquely capable of addressing the preparation of multigenerational students from the State of Maryland, Baltimore City and County, and regions beyond. The University extends its preparations beyond the traditional classroom by providing experiential and authentic learning experiences to students who have been differently prepared. To address the cultural diversity goals of the USM, the university has aligned its plan to help the system meet its goals accomplish greater diversity and inclusion. Data below and explanations show progress towards greater diversity and inclusion. Since the 2008-2009 baseline year, the University has experienced a decline in enrollment within all student categories. However, the University has been able to maintain a diverse student population. During 2018-19, there was a slight increase in the percentage African American students from 77.8% to 79%. Hispanic and Latino students declined slightly from 2.8% to 2.6%. White students experienced a slight increase from 1.5% to 2%, while international students declined from 14.6% to 12.1%. Selected initiatives across the campus within the Student Affairs and Enrollment Management, Athletics, Administration and Finance, Information Technology, and Academic Affairs have supported the University's efforts to attract and retain a proportional mix of students that reflect the community. However, there is room for continued improvement. The following programs, strategies, and initiatives support enrollment, retention, and graduation, and continue to yield positive results. Selected support programs and interventions include: \u00a7 Summer Academic Success Academy (SASA) - The Summer Academic Success Academy is an intensive, six-week campus-based, residential program that prepares students for the transition from high school to college. At-risk students have the opportunity to develop confidence and earn college credit prior to the start of the fall semester. SASA 301Page 9 of 12 students receive information on financial literacy, career planning, personal growth, and other campus resources and support services. \u00a7 First Year Experience (FYE) - The First-Year Experience program serves as the advisement hub for first-year and sophomore students. Students receive intrusive advisement and guidance through the completion of the first 30 credits of their General Education curriculum. \u00a7 Academic Success Centers (ASC) - The Centers, housed within each of the four colleges, are staffed by full-time academic advisors and retention coordinators. Staff members monitor student progression, perform registration outreach, and direct students to support services needed for success. \u00a7 Our House Community Mentoring - Our House provides mentoring for incoming freshmen through a combined peer mentoring and staff mentoring program. Run as a pilot in AY2014, results show a higher freshmen to sophomore retention rate and academic achievement when compared to the University. \u00a7 Connecting Ladies across Campus (CLAC) - CLAC is designed to build self-esteem in female students with the ultimate goal of empowering them in womanhood, sustaining academic excellence, and building personal and professional relationships that may lead to successful careers. Paired with a mentor from the University's faculty or staff, CLAC supports CSU women of all backgrounds. \u00a7 Child Development Center - (Currently Closed for Renovations) Child care services offered through the James E. McDonald Child Development Center support students, employees of the University, and the community with the purpose of providing a safe, nurturing, and educational program that focuses on developmentally appropriate experiences for children. The Center addresses both the need of the campus community as well as provides quality service to the surrounding community. Students who major in Early Childhood Education complete experiential learning at the Center, contributing to their academic preparation. \u00a7 The Center for Counseling and Student Development (CCSD) - The Center provides quality counseling and mental health services to students experiencing personal, developmental, and psychological issues or distress. They assist students in crisis, intervene in potentially life threating situations, provide quality outreach programs and offer other important additional services. These services address the developmental concerns of students while emphasizing prevention and professional consultative services that increase the understanding of challenges faced by students and promotes psychological well-being. 302Page 10 of 12 \u00a7 Disability Support Services - Disability Support Services (DSSP) - Housed under the Division of Academic Affairs, DSSP has been charged to create an accessible university community to ensure students have equal access to University programs, activities, and services. Policies and procedures are developed to provide students with as much independence as possible and to promote self-advocacy. The services to faculty, staff, and students on disability issues address the needs of individuals to improve the quality and effectiveness of services; advocate for the upgrading and maintenance of the accessibility of all facilities; promote access to technology resources; and provide students with disabilities the same academic opportunities as non-disabled students in all areas of academic life. \u00a7 Center for Adult Learners (CAL) - The Center was formed with the adult learner in mind, given that the average age of the CSU student is 26 years of age. The goals of the CAL include the following: to increase educational opportunities for first-generation college students; to strengthen the level of engagement in the culture of academic rigor; to provide a campus climate in which adult learners demonstrate satisfaction with their program of study and go on to assume careers in their disciplines or continue matriculation into graduate or professional schools; to provide a model to be replicated on a larger-scale for the University; and to inform teaching and learning effectiveness through assessment. Administrative Staff The Office of Human Resources (HR) offers a variety of workshops that support cultural diversity and inclusion. These workshops are offered on a regular basis and are available to all members of the campus community at least two or more times per year. Workshops include such topics on sensitivity training, managing diverse staff members, customer service, and conflict resolution. These workshops are essential since the University has staff from all types of diverse backgrounds and remain central to the university's mission. The workshops are conducted in conjunction with the Information Technology Division, Academic Affairs, and Finance and Administration. The University experienced an increase in the number of staff members between AY 2017-18 and AY 2018-19. The total number of staff increased from 246 to 360. The number of African American staff increased from 192 (78%) to 304 (84.4%), while Asian staff decreased from 6.5% to 2.8%. White staff also decreased from 13.4% to 8.3%. Data show that efforts to increase representation among Native Americans and Foreign staff member could be further enhanced. 303Page 11 of 12 Diversity among Faculty Coppin's unique geographic location within the Baltimore City limits makes it an attractive environment for faculty to have careers and focus on instruction, research and service to the University. Overall, faculty members find the campus to be a welcoming environment. The University makes every effort to advertise in diverse publications to ensure that individuals in the country and worldwide would have access to job opportunities with the University. These publications include, but are not limited to the Washington Post, the Chronicle of Higher Education, Diverse Issues, Latinos in Higher Education, LinkedIn, HigherEdjobs.com, and other publications that are able to reach remote areas. The University maintains subscriptions to diverse publications in an effort to ensure that when searches are conducted for new faculty, candidates will derive from diverse locations. While the limitations of dollars for advertising continue, the University is able to post positions in print and online journals, many of which may be discipline-specific. Budget constraints have contributed to the University's inability to be even more aggressive in its recruitment and hiring of an appropriate number of faculty members across all of its disciplines. Also, internally, the institution is reviewing all of its academic programs, including faculty and all other resources necessary for successful programming. The following data show that overall, faculty recruitment has somewhat slowed. In AY 2018- 2019, the University had 250 members of personnel classified in a type of faculty position; down from 376 in the previous year (Note: the faculty count includes all faculty, Full-time, tenure/tenure track, full-time, non-tenure/tenure track, adjuncts, and library personnel classified as faculty). Out of the 250 faculty members, 56% are female and 44% are male. While there has been a decrease in the number of overall faculty, the population remains largely African American (75.2%). The Asian faculty member population increased from 3.7% to 5% and Caucasians increased from 9% to 12%. Data show that enhancements could be made to increase the number of underrepresented Native American faculty members. 304Page 12 of 12 SECTION III: DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ONLY STUDENTS Race / Ethnicity Base: 2008- 2009 2016- 2017 2017- 2018 2018- 2019 # % Male Female # % Male Female # % Male Female # % Male Female A.A./Black 1738 Am.

The report contains the following three sections: SECTION I: FROSTBURG STATE UNIVERSITY 'S PROGRESS REPORT ON USM GOALS ONE, TWO, AND THREE -Summary Statement .......................................................................................... 1 -Table 1: USM 3 -Table 2: USM Goal 2 (FSU Goals 4 and 5) ............................................................... 7 -USM Goal 3 (FSU Process for Reporting Campus-Based Hate Crimes and Bias-Motivated Incidents) ...... ... 12 SECTION II (A PPENDIX A) -Frostburg State University's Cultural Diversity Program ............................................... 13 SECTION III (APPENDIX B) -Institutional Demographic D ata ............................................................................ 23 Provides associated comparative demographic data for fall 2010, fall 2016, and fall 2017 with that of fall 2018. These data outline FSU's significant progress over the last ten years towards achieving its diversity goals. 307 1 SECTION I - SUMMARY STATEMENT Frostburg State University is a multicultural campus where diversity is highly valued. This is affirmed in the University's Core Values Statement : \"Frostburg State University is committed to developing cultural competence and cultivating understanding of and respect for a diversity of experiences and worldviews that encourage each person's ability to 'take the perspective of the other. '\" The University's Cultural Diversity Program 2008-2018 puts this value into action. The program is intended to help the institution more effectively recruit and retain individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education. It is also designed to promote cultural understanding and appreciation among all members of the University community. The Cultural Diversity Program 2008-2018 establishes five institutional goals together with strategies for their attainment (see Section II). The University has made significant advances toward achieving the five goals of the program over the 10 -year period 2008 -2018. 1. Recruit and Enroll a Growing Number of Undergraduate Minority and First-Generation Students Strategies under this goal include enhancing marketing and recruitment efforts that target members of underrepresented groups as well as expanding college-readiness and bridge programs offered by the University. The University has made notable progress in this area over the 10 -year period 2008-2018. The undergraduate minority student population at Frostburg has significantly increased in the past decade . In the fall of 2008, minority student s represented 26.1% of Frostburg's overall undergraduate population; and, i n the fall of 2018, minority students comprised 42.48% of the overall undergraduate population . The proportion of African American students rose from 21.9% in fall 2008 to 31.18% in fall 2018, and the percentage of Hispanic/Latino students increased from 2.1% to 5.0% over that same period . (Though this institutional goal specifically references undergraduate students, Frostburg's minority graduate student population has also appreciably grown over this 10-year period. In the fall of 2008, m inority students represented only 4.18% of Frostburg 's overall graduate population; by fall of 2018, minority students comprised 19.82% of the overall graduate population.) An increasing number of transfer students are from minority groups. New minority transfer students represented 13.5% of the new transfer population in fall 2008 compared to 28.7% in fall 2018. 2. Increase the Retention and Graduation Rates of Undergraduate Minority and First-Generation Students Strengthening and expanding student support, mentoring, and advising programs are identified strategies under this goal. Advances have been made in this area over the 10 -year period 2008 -2018, particularly with respect to undergraduate minority graduation rates. The second-year retention rate for all minority students has somewhat increased over the past decade , from 72% for all minority students in cohort fall 200 9 to 74% for all minority students in cohort fall 201 7. The second-year retention rate for African American students rose from 73% for cohort fall 2009 to 77% for cohort fall 2017. The s ix-year graduation rate for all minority students rose from 38.8% for cohort year 2002 to 49% for cohort year 2012. The six -year graduation rate for African American students rose from 42% for cohort year 2004 to 48% for cohort year 2012. In fall 2018, University President Ronald Nowacyzk appointed Ms. Arlene Cash the inaugural Vice President for Enrollment Management. This position consolidates important recruitment and support services for students who are considering Frostburg and throughout their college careers, with the aim of being more intentional and efficient in our recruitment and student support offerings. 3. Enhance the Cultural Diversity of Faculty and Staff Strategies include continuing the activities of the ADA/EEO Compliance Office's Minority Recruitment Plan, expanding efforts to attract and retain minority faculty, and providing additional support for college and departmental minority faculty recruitment and retention plans. The relative size of the minority tenure/tenure-track faculty population at Frostburg has remained fairly constant over the 10-year period 2008-2018. Minority faculty comprised 13.4% of the total tenure/tenure-track faculty population in fall 2008 and 14.7% of the total tenure/tenure- track faculty population in fa ll 2018. There has been a small increase in minority representation among executive-level staff . In fall 2008, 5.26% of executive- level staff were African American/Black and no executive-level staff were Asian or Hispanic/Latino. In fall 2018, the rates of representation rose to: American/Black (6.05%), Asian (1.61% ), and Hispanic/Latino (.4%) . The most notable gains have been at the level of professional s taff. The rates of minority representation at that level in 2008 were: African American/Black (4.05%), Asian (2.03%), Hispanic/Latino (.68%); and, African American/Black (6.74%), Asian (5.62%), Hispanic/Latino (1.12%) 308 2 4. Create a Campus Environment that Promotes the Valuing of Cultural Diversity Providing campus-wide cultural and gender diversity programming and activities through the President's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Frostburg's Center for Student Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and the Office of Gender Equity ; supporting campus student organizations that focus on diversity; and providing for the multicultural quality of the curriculum are important strategies designed to help the University attain this goal. Frostburg maintains a website (https://www.frostburg.edu/about-frostburg/cultural-diversity/index.php) showcasing its diversity initiatives, and providing easy access to diversity-related resources for students, faculty, and staff. In spring 2019, University President Ronald Nowacyzk, working with the University Advisory Council, formed a revamped University Council on Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (UCDEI). The new University Council will replace the President's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (PACDEI). The UCDEI is more inclusive in its membership, with more student and staff representatives, and is better aligned with national best practices. Like the PACDEI, it will meet regularly to set goals and launch initiatives to improve campus climate with respect to diversity. It will also oversee the University's Cultural Diversity Program, which will be reviewed and updated in AY 2019-20. The Center for Student Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (CSDEI) fosters a sense of community among students of all ages, economic classes, ethnicities, gender identities, races, religions, sexual orientation and national origins. Frostburg is a campus affiliate of the National Coalition Building Institute (NCBI) , and the CSDEI coordinates a variety of NCBI diversity-training programs, including an Introduct ion to Diversity Workshop that is required of all first-year, full -time students. FSU established the Office of Gender Equity in 2016 as the institutional body in charge of providing leadership to promote, sustain, and advance a campus climate free of gender-based harassment and violence. Minority students are robustly represented in the student leadership population at Frostburg: Resident Assistants (66.6%); Lane University Center (46.2%); Civic Engagement leaders, including the ECHO Stars program, (74.1%); Student Activities/Greek Life (36.8%); Cultural Events Series (57.1%); Social Marketing Team (50.0%); and Student Government Association (27.6%). There are currently 13 student organizations at Frostburg with overt diversity-related missions. Cultural and gender diversity issues are addressed throughout the University's curricula . The General Education Program requires all students to complete a course involving Identity and Difference. Currently, 31 courses across 16 academic disciplines satisfy this requirement. A variety of academic programs involve intensive study of cultura l and/or gender diversity, including African American Studies, Cultural Anthropology, Foreign Languages & Literature , International Studies, and Women's Studies. 5. Promote the Understanding of International Cultures Identified strategies under this goal are increasing the number of international students on campus, enhancing international programming at the University, increasing international opportunities for students and faculty, and promoting intercultural knowledge at all levels of the campus. The University has increased and diversified its international student population, enhanced international programming, and promoted intercultural understanding at all levels on campus. At the same time, the University is providing additional opportunities for FSU students and faculty to study and teach abroad. The number of international students enrolled at Frostburg has significantly increased over the past decade, from 34 in fall 2008 to 285 in spring 2019. Currently, international students on Frostburg's campus represent 14 nationalities, with the largest constituencies from China and Saudi Arabia. The University currently has 22 exchange partners and three cooperative-degree programs , with plans to add a fourth by summer 2019. As indicated under Goal 4 above, there are numerous curricular and co- curricular programs at Frostburg designed to promote intercultural knowledge. __________________ Frostburg State University's Cultural Diversity Program contains a number of new and ongoing initiatives that require additional resources if they are to be fully and successfully implemented. Any state financial support of these strategies that can be garnered by the University of System of Maryland would greatly assist Frostburg's efforts. An approach to providing Frostburg State University and other Maryland institutions of higher education additional resources to enhance diversity and cultural awareness programs is to make competitive state grants available for these purposes. In the past, the state has funded important initiatives that have helped to transform and improve higher education in Maryland. The University would welcome the opportunity to apply for diversity program funds provided through the Maryland Higher Education Commission and the University System of Maryland. 309 3 Section I - Table 1 USM Goal 1: Increase the Numerical Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups among Students, A dministrative Staff, and Faculty.

Data Source: PeopleSoft Queries F09; orig SSS file F1 8 During fall 2017 and spring 2018 (to recruit the Fall 2018 class): Either through individual high school visits, or visits to high schools as part of a college fair format program, FSU had a total of 30 visits at 24 high schools in Baltimore City. See results under FSU Diversity Goal 3. Continue to investigate other avenues of \"prospect\" and \"inquiry names\" to ensure that the makeup and size of the first-year class meets the university's goals. Seek out new communication strategies to increase knowledge of counselors in minority markets. FSU 1.2: Familiarize high school students, teachers, and administrators from selected areas with the University's programs and services. a) Continue bus trips to FSU from targeted areas and engage FSU minority students to serve as tour guides. The number of bus trips to FSU with minority attendees. The number of minority students in attendance at FSU admitted student receptions. The Office of Admissions hosted approximately 700 prospective high school students during 19 different bus trips to FSU from primarily minority high schools. Additionally, 60% of prospective fall 2018 students attending the \"admitted student receptions\" sponsored by the Admissions Office were minorities (69 of 117 students). 310 4 FSU 1.3: Enhance college- readiness programs and promote them to minority and first- generation students. a) Continue programs designed to prepare underrepresented students for postsecondary education at FSU. b) Provide additional academic support for underrepresented high school students from Allegany, Garrett, Washington, Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince Georges, and Frederick counties and Baltimore City. FSU programs designed to prepare underrepresented students for postsecondary education at FSU. FSU programs designed to provide academic support for underrepresented high school students from Allegany, Garrett, Washington, Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince Georges, and Frederick counties, and the city of Baltimore. Over the last five years, the grant-based TRiO Upward Bound Program has served 181 participants, and 18.8% of these self-identified as minorities. FSU's Upward Bound Regional Math/Science Center provided additional academic support for underrepresented high school students from Allegany, Garrett, Frederick and Washington counties and Baltimore City. An average of 68% of progr am participants curren tly in high school (52 of 77) self-identified as minorities. Of the 950 participants who graduated from high school during the past five years, 60 (63%) were minorities, and 53 of these 60 (88%) initially enrolled in college. Investigate additional methods to ensure the makeup and size of the transfer student class meets the university's goals. FSU 1.4: Increase the num ber of underrepresented students who transfer to FSU from community colleges. a) Continue to expand 2+2 and dual- degree programs with community colleges. b) Continue to establish dual-admission agreements with community colleges. c) Provide additional individualized support services to transfer students. The number of transfer students enrolled in FSU from minority groups. The number of dual- degree agreements with community colleges. The number of dual-admission agreements with community colleges. Services provided to transfer students. An increasing number of transfer students are from minority groups. New minority transfer students represented 16.3% of the new transfer population in fall 2009 compared to 29% in fall 2018. Data Source: Enrollment Information System file (EIS) In FY 2019, FSU had active articulations with 13 of 16 Maryland community colleges (Source: FSU's Office of Admissions). Dual-admission agreements are in place with Allegany College of Maryland and Hagerstown Community College. More dual admission agreements with regional and statewide community colleges are expected in the future. Students who transfer to FSU without a declared major or are non-degree seeking (students who transfer with a GPA less than a 2.0) are assigned to the Center for Academic Advising and Retention (CAAR) office. Staff in that office serve as the student's academic advisor and provide a welcoming connection to the campus, including training on the campus student information and learning management systems. Nineteen new transfer students were served through CAAR in the 2017 academic year; four of those students are African-American. CAAR offered Transfer Student Listening sessions in group and individual formats and 19 students took advantage of these in spring 2019. 311 5 FSU's Diversity Goal 2: Increase the Retention and Graduation Rates of Undergraduate Minority and First -Generation Students Timeline for meeting FSU Goal 2 is fall 2018; FSU's Diversity Program will be reviewed and updated in AY 2019-2020 Share campus-wide and program- specific efforts designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented stu dents, staff, and faculty.

Second-year and six-year graduation rates for underrepresented students at Frostburg State University. Second-year retention and six-year graduation data generated the following findings: For the fall 2017 cohort of first-time, full-time students, FSU's second-year retention rates for African American students (77%) and minorities ( 74%) are similar to the rate for the total student population (77 %). The retention rates improved from 71% (cohort fall 2016 ) to 7 7% (cohort fall 2017) for African Americans and from 69% (cohort fall 2016) to 74% (coho rt fall 2017) for all minorities. The retention rate for all first-time, full- time students improved from 74% (cohort fall 2016 ) to 7 7% (cohort fall 2017 ). The African American retention rate mirrored the overall retention rate for the most recent cohort of first-time, full -time students . While t he minority student retention rate was 3% points lower than the overall rate, the cohort showed a 5% point gain from the prior year. Six-year graduation rates increased over the reporting period for all student groups (cohort year 2010 to cohort year 2012): from 39% to 48% for African American students, from 40% to 49% for all minorities, and from 49% to 53% for all first- time, full -time students. FSU has been selected to participate in the first-ever national Excellence in Academic Advising (EAA) comprehensive strategic planning process, a program created by NACADA, a global association dedicated to enhancing the educational development of students in higher education, and the nonprofit Gardner Institute. EAA esta blishes aspirational standards for institutions to evaluate and improve academic advising and acknowledge the central role of advising in promoting student learning, success and completion. Explore possible reasons for the lower persistence rates, particularly for the minority student population, and devise initiatives to address retention from sophomore year forward. 312 6 FSU's Diversity Goal 3: Enhance the Cultural Diversity of Faculty and Staff Timeline for meeting FSU Goal 3 is 2018; FSU's Diversity Pro gram will be reviewed and updated in AY 2019- 2020 Share campus-wide and program- specific efforts designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented stu dents, staff, and faculty.

The number of minority faculty and staff at Frostburg State University. The University continues its eff orts to increase the number of minority faculty and staff at FSU. As of December 2018, the University 's workforce consisted of 1,033 full and part-time employees (387 faculty; 657 staff members; 75 graduate students). Females are employed at a rate of 51.1% (527) and are represented in 100% of all administrative offices and academic departments. Minorities are employed at a rate of 10% and are represented in 26.9% of the University's administrative offices and 75.0% of academic departments. The University's workforce is comprised of Black/African American 4.7% (49), Asian 4.0% (41), Hispanic/Latino 0.7% (8), Two or more races 0.4% (4) and American Indian/Alaska Native 0.1% (1). White employees represent 90.1 % of the university workforce. Frostburg's Office of Human Resources continues to sponsor the annual Employee Development and Leadership Series. The current cohort, consisting of 12 FSU faculty and staff members, meets monthly to receive management training, which will lead to increased employee advancement and retention. A fundamental goal of this program is to build the skills required to manage an increasingly diverse workforce and assist in fostering an inclusive workplace environment characterized by fairness, understanding, and mutual respect and civility. Recruit continuously, not only when there are openings. Maintain professional networks and make note of potential candidates from underrepresented groups. If possible, build and develop relationships with potential candidates, keeping them in mind for future openings and/or asking them to assist in recruiting from their own networks. 313 7 Section I - Table 2 USM Goal 2: Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness among Students, Faculty, and Staff on Campus FSU's Diversity Go al 4: Create a Campus Environment that Promotes the Valuing of Cultural Diversity Timeline for meeting FSU Goal 4 is fall 2018; FSU's Diversity Program will be reviewed and updated and revised in AY 20018-20019 Share efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff including: faculty and staff cultural training programs; curricular initiatives that promote cultural diversity in the classroom; and co-curricular programming for students Strategies are numbered followed by their Action Priorities.

FSU's Center for Student Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs and activities designed to reach out to racial identity groups and other marginalized student identity groups to provide guidance and support while providing education and training to the entire campus. During 2018-2019, the Center for Student Diversity, Equity and Inclusion worked collaboratively with faculty and staff to: Provide support and leadership development to marginalized student identity groups: African Student Alliance (ASA), NAACP, and the gospel choir (UVUGD). Provide assistance in leadership development and support for planning of activities, programs and meetings to University student orga nizations: Black Student Alliance (BSA), Latin American Student Organization (LASO), National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) and Spectrum (for students identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender). Coordinate and facilitate the NCBI's Introduction to Diversity Workshop\u2014required of all first-year, full-time students as part of the programs offered in the Introduction to Higher Education (ORIE 101). Participation in the workshop was a little under 90% coming in closer to 88% with a 95% satisfaction rate. Participating in the workshops resulted in an increase in first-year students applying to attend the diversity retreat. Explore strategies to increase the effectiveness of the workshops including follow-up activities to increase retention of the knowledge gained; increase in the awareness of the resources available on campus to increase cultural competence; increase attendance. 314 8 b) Continue the work of the President's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (PACDEI). c) Continue the work of the Office of Gender Equity to provide resources and services for promoting social justice; and to plan and implement efforts to educate students, faculty, and staff about the issue of gender- based violence and related programming, policies, and services. d) Plan and implement activities to prevent gender-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate-partner violence, and stalking based on research and best-practice information.

Programs planned and implemented to prevent gender-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate-partner violence, and stalking based on research and best-practice information. During 2018-2019, the Center for Student Diversity, Equity and Inclusion planned and implemented the following activities: FSU Social Jus tice Summit (formerly named Diversity Retreat): During the weekend a full day is dedicated to a Workshop on \"Building Community through Deeper Connections.\" In fall 2018, a total of 37 students, one staff member, two guest facilitators and two FSU alum par ticipated in this retreat. Funds for a second retreat were not secured. However, the impact of the retreat was demonstrated by nine of the retreat participants attending the NCBI Train-the-Trainer one month later. NCBI Train -the-Trainer was held in November 2018 with 25 trainees and 2 facilitators. Nine of the trainees attended the FSU Social Justice Summit; 16 were students; 3 faculty members, 3 staff members, and 2 Chartwells Dining Services staff. This will significantly increase the number of facilitato rs available to provide workshops for first year students. The President's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion was dissolved. In response to feedback provided during the University's recent strategic planning process, as well as in other f ocus groups and forums, the University President, the Vice-President of Student Affairs, and Director of the Center for Student Diversity, Equity worked to create a revised University Council on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. FSU established the Office of Gender Equity in 2016 as the institutional body in charge of providing leadership to promote, sustain, and advance a campus climate free of gender-based harassment and violence. The office has been actively engaged in implementing its mission by: Providing an equitable, safe, and inclusive environment for all students through the coordination of activities intended to oversee prevention, education, response, and assessment of sexual misconduct, gender-based harassment, intimate partner violence, and stalking. Assessing student perceptions and experiences of gender-based harassment and violence through the biennial Campus Climate Survey . Survey data from spring 2018 shows continued increases in positive responses about students' perceptions concerning their University experience, including increased engagement in the campus community and a higher sense of being valued as individuals. Providing recommendations in light of State and Federal expectations and best practices. In 2016, FSU restructured the previously existing President's Advisory Council Against Gender Based Violence (PACAGBV) into the current FSU's Gender- Based Harassment and Elimination Task Force (G-BHAVE). The purpose of restructuring the organization was to make it more inclusive with representation from students, faculty, and staff across campus as well as experts and stakeholders from the Frostburg community at large. Beginning in fall 2017, all first-time students were required to complete Think About It ; an online educational platform designed by EverFi's Campus Clarity. The one-hour curriculum serves as the mandatory population -level training required by the U.S. Seek funding to sustain activities led by the Center including a second retreat. Holding a second retreat allows more students to participate in the in-depth experience. The Council is expected to hold its first meeting before the end of spring 2019 semester. Council goals and work groups will be established at that time. Allocation of sufficient resources for sustainable prevention, response, outreach, and compliance. 315 9 e) Develop inter-institutional academic opportunities and institutional curricular programs for students, faculty, and staff designed to ensure equalparticipation in educational opportunities and encouragecollaboration in activities designed to highlight the stud y of social issues and theirrel ationship with underrepresented groupsglobally. f) Sustain the University's curricular programs designed to promote the understanding ofcultural diversity.Partnerships with other institutions in the University System of Maryland to increase the number of underrepresented minorities pursuing graduate school.

All first -year orientation courses were provided a presentation from the Title IX Coordinator, highlighting the services provided by the Office of Gender Equity and the protections and supports under Title IX. All faculty and staff were required to complete Harassment and Discrimination Prevention; an online platform designed by EverFi's Campus Clarity. The 90-minute program discusses the methods employees can identify harassment, discrimination, retaliation, related misconduct, and report such instances as mandated by federal and state law. Lastly, all Campus Security Authorities completed the required annual Clery Act training, via an online training module. FSU's partnership with the University of Maryland College Park, TRiO Academic Achievemen t Program's McNair Scholars has enrolled 81 students since its inception, in 1991. The six-year graduation rate for these students has been 100%. Over 35% of the participants have been males. The 2018-2019 cohort included two students, one African American female and one African American male. Identity and Difference courses in the General Education Program (GEP) : The Identity and Difference category in the GEP offers students multiple course options to gain insight into the ways cultural identities and experiences shape individual perspectives of the world and influence interactions with people from different backgrounds. The African American Studies Program and the Women's Studies Program, through courses in the GEP, provide students with opportunities to explore elements of the world and U.S. History which are often overlooked by developing an understanding of the rich and complex African and African American heritage, and the impact of women and gender in a diverse society, respectively. The two programs also collaborate with other institutional structures to offer events for students, faculty, and staff to highlight social issues and their relationship with these underrepresented groups globally. Identify funding to support FSU students' participatio n in ac tivities hosted at partner institutions.

The number of J1 and F1 students enrolled at Frostburg State University. The number of exchange partners to increase the diversity of international students. The number of cooperative-degree programs with overseas partner universities. The CIE works with all academic departments across campus to ensure a continued growth in international diversity. In recent years, the CIE changed its emphasis on recruitment of students who would enroll on an \"exchange\" basis for one or two semesters, and moved to promoting programs for \"degree-seeking\" international students. In spring 2019, FSU enrolled 285 international students (up from 183 in spring 2018), including 275 degree-seeking students (up from 162 in spring 2018) from 10 countries. The CIE became a member of the Maryland International Education Consortium, which actively recruits international students for Maryland universities. The CIE added one additional exchange partner this year\u2014NEOMA School of Business in Paris, France. The CIE is assisting the College of Business with recruiting students for study abroad opportunities at this new partner university. We expect students from the partner school to begin enrolling at FSU beginning the spring 2020 semester. Assess the effectiveness of cooperative-degree programs as a recruitment strategy for international students, and evaluate its impact on sustaining international education at FSU. 317 11 d) Establish strong connections for international students on campus The presence of programs designed to connect international students to the campus. FSU offers a six -week language camp (summer and winter) for incoming international students who need to improve their English language skills before beginning their first semester of classes on the FSU campus. Additionally, the CIE offers numerous cultural activities throughout the semester to introduce international students to American culture. FSU 5.2: Develop programs and organizations to promote students' intercultural understanding and diversity awareness through experiential exposure to global topics . a) Plan and implement student abroad programs conducted or sponsored by the university. b) Plan and implement recruitment activities for students to study abroad. c) Design and implement student abroad opportunities for students led by faculty members. d) Sustain the University President's Leadership Circle As an institutional program designed to provide students with opportunities to represent the university at key events, participate in intercultural experiences, and travel abroad to be part of cultural projects engaging exploited populations in different countries around the world. The presence of study abroad opportunities for students and the level of participation in those programs The presence of recruitment activities designed to encourage students to participate in study abroad. The presence of faculty led study abroad opportunities for students The presence of international experiences for student members of the President's Leadership Circle. During the academic year 2018 /19, 39 FSU students participated in study abroad programs conducted or sponsored by the university. These students were able to bring a wealth of experiences back to their classes and perhaps changed their outlook on the world. To encourage students to study abroad, the CIE engaged in the following recruitment activities in FY 2019: Conducted classroom visits Hosted bi-annual study abroad and international fairs Planned bi-weekly information sessions with prospective and former study abroad students to share experiences Held information tables in the Lane University Center Provided presentations to multiple Greek organizations Promoted study abroad at admissions open house events to encourage prospective students to get excited about FSU and plan for their future study abroad opportunities. In FY 2019, faculty members created and implemented study abroad experiences for students in Ireland, England, Wales, and the Dominican Republic. These short- term experiences abroad are intended to promote long-term study and provide study abroad trips for those students who cannot spend an entire semester abroad due to finances or rigorous course study plans. As a result of budgetary constraints, the students in the President's Leadership Circle did not participate in a service-learning trip to Uganda to educate villagers and schoolchildren about hygiene and how to purify their drinking water; however, the PLC hosted John Ochieng, our liaison with Africa Water Solutions in Uganda, for an on-campus visit for twelve days (March 28 - April 9, 2019). Mr. Ochieng visited several classes, made presentations on global leadership to student leaders, and worked with the executive chef for Chartwells to create an authentic Ugandan meal attended by students, faculty, and staff. CIE will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of Horizons , as a software system to track applications of students interested in studying abroad, and assess its impact on meeting the CIE goals. Promote a more consistent use of the University's Leadership Competency Model to assess the student learning outcomes of the experiential learning opportunities provided to the PLC members. Provide a direct sour ce of funding to continue the international, intercultural experience. 318 12 USM Goal 3: Provide a statement regarding the process for the reporting of campus-based crimes as consistent with federal requirements under Clery Frostburg State University's Process for Reporting Campus-Based Hate Crimes and Bias-Motivated Incidents Hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents are violations of the University Student Code of Conduct as well as violations of law. Any such crimes that are reported to the University are handled by several offices of the University. Initial reports are handled by University Police, who conduct an investigation to determine if the incident is a hate crime or bias-motivated incident. If there is a victim involved, the determination of whether a hate crime has occurred is determined by the victim. If there is no victim, University Police will make the determination. When a perpetrator can be identified, University Police can charge the individual(s) criminally as well as refer them through the University Judicial System. Student cases that are reported to the Judicial Board for violations of University policy are reviewed. If students are found responsible, sanctions can include disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the University. At the end of each month, University Police complete the hate crime report form and submit it as part of the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). At the end of each year, hate crimes and bias- motivated incidents are reported as required by the Clery Act and the Campus Crime Statistics Act (CCSA) . 319 13 SECTION II (Appendix A) Frostburg State University Cultural Diversity Program 2008 -2018 Prepared by: Office of the Provost 320 14 Executive Summary Frostburg State University's Cultural Diversity Program is designed to enhance diversity on campus and further the understanding of different cultures by all members of the University community.

To date, while SU has achieved a number of notable goals, certain challenges still persist. Since its founding, SU has traditionally attracted primarily White students, faculty and staff . Therefore , increas ing recruitment and retention of members pertaining to historically underrepresented groups will remain at the forefront of our efforts. Each school, department, and office has assumed an active role in the recruitment and retention of a diverse contingent and has devised specific approaches. There is a general consensus that specific emphasis should be placed on creating and advancing mentorship and professional growth opportunities for traditionally underrepresented faculty and staff. Enhancing the cultural compet ency of faculty and staff remains a firm commitment so that, in turn, they can cultivate and foster an inclusive learning environment for our students. In parallel, collective efforts are made to identify and strategically eliminate inequity -related barrie rs to academic and professional success. Beyond efforts directed at recruitment and retention, SU recognizes the importance of creating and supporting opportunities for meaningful interactions between campus community members, as a result of which a series of programs and initiatives was created over the years. While said initiatives have had varying degrees of success, SU has not been able to gauge their overall impact on the campus community, a rather arduous task in the absence of a Campus Climate Study. Consequently, the University has decided to com mission a general Campus Climate Study - both quantitative and qualitative - within the next twelve months, an invaluable tool in helping us outline the next Diversity Strategic Plan. Moreover, assessing the campus climate is indispensable in identifying areas of concern and/or focus pertaining to diversity, in order to develop innovative, relevant, and tailored programming and in turn, will inform the enhancements to our CDP . Concurrently, Salisbury is working on formulating the University's General Strategic Plan (20 20-2025) which will capture the new University President's vision 335for the institution, will incorporate feedback from the campus community through the Campus Climate Study and other means, as well as considerations and corresponding approaches to address current and future trends in higher education. In order to continue to capitalize on the progress that has already been made, SU will not only have to reaffirm its commitment to diversity and inclusion but also to continue to tailor the specifics to ensure the effectiveness of the strategic approach through a truly concerted effort, where every stakeholder becomes a co -creator of a new, diverse, and congruent institutional identity. The implementation strategy and the timeline for meeting the specified goals will align with and supplement the institution's Strategic Plan. As such, SU will uphold the institutional commitment to foster an inclusive campus by helping nurture a robust sense of identity and community so that all students, staff , and faculty experience a sense of belonging to the University. The new Center for Equity, Justice and Inclusion inaugurated in December 2 018 is a fitting illustration of this endeavor and a promising , meaningful step in that direction. The University will continue to outline and implement forward -looking action steps to dismantle systemic racism that exists within and beyond all campuses, as well as encourage and promote meaningful interactions across all -campus stakeholders to increase commitment to and support for diversity and inclusion initiatives. This particular long -term objective was catalyzed by the October 2018 workshop on the topic of systemic racism, which was attended by the 80 top SU administrators, including the new University President, as well as leaders from shared governance pertaining to all three campus community contingencies - faculty, staff, and students. This particular learning opportunity elicited courageous conversations and helped identify specific approaches that can be adopted, as well as the stakeholders that should be tasked with the implementation and monitoring. The short -term and intermediate goal is to continue to optimize institutional responses to diversity and inclusion - related matters. Harmonizing institutional efforts, in general, and abandoning the \"silo mentality\" is viewed an imperative in achieving the University's long -term goals. This requires the strategic re -alignment of goals for diversity and inclusion. To that end, maintaining an updated internal inventory of diversity and inclusion-related programs and initiatives is essential in the process of identifying potential areas of collaboration and serve a variety of purposes, such as creating learning opportunities in varied formats e.g., trainings, student orientations, targeted workshops, facilitations, etc., to improve cultural literacy, hence endowing the campu s community with a more profound understanding of diverse identities and perspectives. Any efforts to support cultural diversity and inclusion on campus should also translate into a concern and commitment to strengthen the relationship with the broader SU campus community. One of the ways in which Salisbury University has been contributing and should continue to d o so is by conducting culturally responsive research that supports community practice. This has concretized into various partnerships over the years. Attesting to that are the University's specific programs in education, arts and community health that impact and benefit the broader community in general, as well as historically minoritized groups in particular. Moreover, the University's cultural offerings typically reflect the diversity of the broader community, with many events being well received and well attended. Lastly, a welcoming and diverse community is undoubtedly a selling point, oftentimes even a decisive factor, for students, staff, and faculty alike when opting to come to SU for education or employment ; therefore it is strategic for the University to adhere strongl y to the strategic goal of \"Fostering Community.\" 336Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty. Share campus -wide and program -specific efforts designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students, staff, and faculty. Metrics to measure how the progress of each initiative/strategy is being evaluated Data to demonstrate where progress has been achieved / indicators of success Areas where continuous improvement is needed The President has made diversity and inclusion one of his top priorities. In speeches and engagements both internal and external, he has made this point and talked about the importance of having faculty and sta ff that are representative of the student body and a student body that is representative of the region and the State. N/A N/A N/A The Seidel School established the AACTE Holmes Scholar program to recruit underrepresented minorities into education career pathways and increase applicant pool for faculty positions to increase number of underrepresented minorities. Student enrollment. Increase in diversity of candidates in applicant pool for faculty positions resulting in more diverse hires. Application approved by AACTE. Holmes Coordinator identified. Solicitation of nominations for initial cohort from existing enrolled students. HR demographic data of applicants and faculty hires. Increase diversity of admitted studen ts across all program areas.

Salisbury Abroad: Global Experiences Internship program provides full -semester credit -bearing internships in nine cities around the world; 70% of participating students in spring 2019 were from underrepresented groups. Continue to create study abroad programs that attract students from underrepresented groups. SU opened the Center for Equity, Justice, and Inclusion (CEJI) - a new center for historically marginalized and underrepresented populations which will provide space for research, programming or just hanging out. Current occupants represent three diverse communities: LGBTQIA+, Women's Forum, and individuals with disabilities ; each group has access to its own office and shared access to a board and meeting room with an occupancy of up to 75. N/A N/A Three spaces in CEJI are unoccupied, allocation pending upon proposal approval. Programs such as Powerful Connections (August 19 -23, 2018), and the Multicultural Leadership Summit (March 1, 2019) are hosted by the Office of Multicultural Student Services to provide both leadership and mentorship opportunities for students. 75 new students completed the Powerful Connections Program. 75 students participated in a one - day leadership program. Participating students completed evaluation instruments which used the Likert scale as its basis for satisfaction. Multicultural Leadership Summit will be expanded to include four county school systems. Athletic Training staff attend recruiting events at HBCUs. Twelve students in the MSAT program are from traditionally underrepresented groups. N/A N/A SU posts all available positions on diversejobs.net to promote and recruit traditionally underrepresented faculty and staff.

N/A The Office of Admissions offers a Counselor Visitation 2 -day program every April. Invites high school and community college counselors to visit the campus over a 2 -day period to learn more about SU. Four counselors so far attending from CollegeBound Foundation, which serves underrepresented high school students in the Baltimore, MD, and DC areas. Will measure this through next year's admissions funnel to see if these counselors have sent any applicants. N/A The Office of Admissions offers on -the-spot admissions at high schools, particularly those with high populations of historically underrepresented identities . SU admissions staff makes admissions decisions on the spot upon review of an application, test scores, and transcript. For the reporting period, SU met with 21 schools. From these events, out of 406 students , so far 120 students have committed to SU - they have until May 1st to pay their deposit. Students interviewed increased by approximately 50 students. Students from these groups are tracked by tagging them in CRM and following them through the admissions funnel. Had a very successful on -campus event for this group this year and will continue that in future years. Continue to expand the program to new schools particu larly NJ. The Office of Admissions focuses on admissions visits/fairs within territories with a high percentage of historically underrepresented and marginalized students. Collaboration with SU's Office of Marketing and Public Relations to advertise in diverse high school and community college student newspapers , outdoors , and in college fair guides in the Washington and Baltimore metro regions. So far this season , 464 additional diverse students have been admitted and have 103 more deposits date to date (May 1st deadline to deposit.) The Office of Marketing and PR also tracks the reach of placements when possible. Final results available after May 1st. Improve tracking of individual recruiting events. The Office of Admissions offers a multicultural Alliance Reception during Admitted Students Day to welcome prospective students of multicultural backgrounds and their families to Salisbury University , and introduce them to the programs and services offered by the Office of Multicultural Student Services. SU had a large number of RSVPs with 19 students and 52 in total attending the reception. Will not be able to track until after May 1st. Improve communication to encourage students to attend this event or make it a special interest session instead, which is earlier in the day. The Office of Admissions hosts many diverse student groups for an information session and a tour of campus. For the reporting period, SU brought 62 diverse groups to campus, totaling approximately 2200 students. SU saw an increase of 21 more groups and 680 additional students.

The implementation strategy and the timeline for meeting the specified goals will align with and supplement the institution's new S trategic Plan (2020-2025) which will be presented to the campus community within nine months to a year . While certain adjustments are foreseeable given the fact that the new Strategic Plan is currently in the works , Salisbury University remains committed to the following diversity and Inclusion (D&I) intermediate and long- term goals and reserves the right to refine and adjust them, as needed. Ensure that all students, staff, and faculty feel a sense of belongingness to the U niversity by actualizing best practices around D&I . Provi de undergraduate and graduate students with the perspectives, skills, tools, a nd critical consciousness necessary to be successful in our modern-day society. Ensure that campus leaders exemplify best practices in D&I . Provide more opportunities for mentorship and growth for historically marginalized and underrepresented faculty and staff. Develop the cultural competency of faculty and staff so they're better equipped to provide the best possible and most inclusive learning environment for our students. Create innovative programs that endeavor to make the campus climate more inclusive and supportive of historically marginalized and underrepresented identities. Foster cutting edge research and scholarship on socially constructed identities like race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender identity, etc. Create opportunities and programs that facilitate meaningful interactions across all campus stakeholders and the broader community and work to concretize partnerships and connections. Continuously work on efforts to recruit and retain faculty, staff, and students representing historically marginalized and underrepresented identities. Develop cultural consciousness and improve racial literacy through onboarding trainings, student orientations, and campus and targeted workshops offered throughout the year. 347 II. A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its student, faculty, and staff populations Salisbury University reaffirms its commitment to promote and support cultural D&I among its various stakeholders through a multi -pronged approach. Endeavoring to enhance recruitment efforts for historically marginalized and underrepresented students, staff, and faculty members remains at the fore of our efforts , paralleled by a commitment to provide adequate onboarding training/student orientation vis -\u00e0-vis D&I issues for all campus community members. On campus, many offices, academic units, faculty, staff, students, and studen t organizations will continue to work within and across networks and campus communities to build cultural competency, raise cultural consciousness, improve equity, access, and opportunity, and increase feelings of belongingness on campus , as new areas of p otential collaborations are identified. These important objectives are accomplished through programs and initiatives, enhanced curricula and course content , which individually and collectively aim to reflect more accurately the entirety and the diversity of the human experience. Moreover, a visible focus persists on the creat ion and maintenance of networks, clubs, as well as affinity and resource groups that serve historically underrepresented identities, on facilitating workshops and discussions around D&I topics and issues, and securing support for the D&I Consortium Committee through the shared governance model. III. A description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity (if improvement is needed) We will continue to consolidate and inten sify previous efforts , while reserving the option to supplement the current plan with additional goals when appropriate . We will also create new initiatives and update existing ones, aimed at building cultural competency, enhancing equity, and increasing f eeling of belongingness on campus. In particular, we will further develop the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE)'s year -long diversity curriculum which guide s presentations and discussion around topics such as race, sexual orientation, gender identity, t riggers, etc. The OIE will engage in more concerted efforts to collaborate with other offices on campus , as well as faculty members so we can best incorporate the skills and expertise of multiple stakeholders, while addressing D&I issues in the most institutionally holistic way possible. A new series of OIE instructor- led trainings geared towards increasing the cultural competence of supervisors has elicited a positive response from participants and will be offered again in the upc oming year. W ith the newly inaugurated ( Fall 2018) Center for Equity, Justice and Inclusion currently featuring three identity -based centers serving historically underrepresented and marginalized identities , the focus shifts to allocating the other two remaining spaces so that the entirety of the Center can be utilized at maximum capacity . Throughout the year, we hope to further increase the 348exposure of the Center by developing resources , programs , and opportunities, while maintaining a close collaborati on with Graduate Assistantships for Women, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ folks , as well as other current staff and faculty into its everyday operations. SU's D&I strategy is based on the value of diversity in all persons and in all perspectives. This includes, but is not limited to, a clear institutional commitment to create an environment free of discrimination, supportive of all and in which all members of the SU community will have opportunities to thrive personally, academically, and professionally. This strateg y implicitly includes the recruitment and retention of exceptional and diverse faculty, staff, and undergraduate and graduate students from across Maryland, the United States, and around the world. In its D&I journey, SU has achieved many accomplishments; however, many challenges remain , both present and ahead. Since its founding, SU has traditionally attracted primarily white students, faculty, and staff. Recognizing a need to increase the recruitment and retention of traditionally underrepresented and ma rginalized groups, throughout the years, multiple cultural D&I initiatives have been launched with various degrees of success. Pursuant to the strategic goal as established by the U niversity System of Maryland , Salisbury University will further develop the strategic approach to recruiting and retaining a more diverse faculty. A search and selection process that successfully recruits highly qualified teacher - scholars from under -represented populations can not be the result of wishful thinking , but r ather the result of recognizing and adopting best practices as part of the standard operating procedures for recruitment at SU. Equally important, the onboarding process for faculty members from under - represented groups will be further refined , as it is deemed vital to SU's institutional success. SU's mission statement currently identifies six core values: \"excellence, student centeredness, learning, community, civic engagement, and diversity ,\" which could potentially be updated or enhanced as a result of formula ting the new Strategic Plan (20 20-2025 ) within the next months. Moreover, the new President (who was just inaugurated on April 10, 2019) has recently shared with the campus community four goals, namely: \"affordability, inclusion, stewardship, and community ,\" which will help guide institutional approaches and vision. SU's previous Strategic Plan (2014- 2018) defined growing diversity among students, faculty, and staff as a crucial aspect to SU's mission, a value the institution has fully embrace d. From all in dications , increasing the diversity of students, faculty, and staff is paramount to \"Foster ing Community,\" which will undoubtedly remain one of SU's goals . The two basic premises to guide the enhancement to our efforts recruiting and retaining tradition ally underrepresented and marginalized Faculty are: A. Develop pathways to recruit and retain a more diverse Faculty at SU. B. Identify and address institutional climate issues that will influence whether minority 349faculty stay at SU. The expected outcomes by area are as follows: Recruitment: The recruitment of a diverse faculty pool for an open position requires SU to publish and distribute vacancies as widely as possible. The expansion of recruiting efforts allows for the position to reach all possible potential candidates. Connections to minority professional associations are also critical to recruitment. Hiring managers and faculty chairs should maintain regular contact with graduate programs in their field and networks of underrepresented groups to encourage promising students to apply for fulltime or adjunct positions after graduation. Hiring Committees: SU still needs to conduct a comprehensive examination of its hiring practices and specifically its hiring committees. The institution has conducted a car eful review to determine what individuals are placed on committees and what strengths and perspectives those individuals bring. An important part of this process is to understand that there is value in looking for input outside of the discipline or from ne wer faculty. In essence, in order to cast a wider net, SU must diversify its vision of hiring. This vision is important not only in regard to ethnicity but also in a broader context including seniority, discipline, age, and background. Mentoring: There is a need to mentor prospective full -time applicants in SU's adjunct pools. An adjunct position could be the gateway to a fulltime job. Because of this natural pipeline, administrators involved in the Faculty hiring process have a responsibility to encourage and guide adjuncts into contributing roles on campus and in the discipline. Onboarding and Retention: SU needs to identify factors motivating faculty from under- represented groups, so that they stay with the institution for the maximum time and effectively contribute. Tangible efforts must be taken to ensure onboarding, growth, advancement, and learning. The OIE instructor -led supervisory training series can provide an additional tool for department chairs and deans, to help with retention effort s by increasing cultural competence. To that end, the OIE will continue to lead campus efforts to manage D&I, as well as all aspects of the Fair Practices and anti -discrimination law compliance. IV. A process for reporting campus -based hate crimes In addition to the long -established process for reporting hate -based crimes, we currently have a \"Report a Concern\" button hosted on the OIE webpage on the SU website . The information is currently recorded in our cloud-based platform intervention management system. All submissions will be reviewed by the appropriate SU administrators who will determine the adequate way to address each incident. We will also continue to use this data to strategize on ways to be more proactive on campus to mitigate identity-based bias. 350 V. A summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the institution to effectively recruit and retain a culturally -diverse student body. More financial support (e.g., scholarships, need- based aid) for recruitment and retention programs to support traditionally underrepresented and marginalized . Additional full-time, permanent positions to support targeted D&I effort.

Challenges The national challenge of identifying and hiring underrepresented individuals in select academic areas. Financial concerns for providing competitive salaries across the national landscape. 2. To ensure that every college or department has one meeting per semester dedicated to cultural competency. Each College has a Diversity Action Committee committed to developing and providing annual training and education fall and spring. The University has developed two positions focused on educational models and opportunities for cultural competency training. The University now has a position that focuses on providing education and training for the institution. An institutional focus to provide education and training began in fall of 2018 offering workshops for the university community on a variety of topic related to cultural competency, ally ship and implicit bias. Programming for all student organizations focusing on cultural competency began last year Revised New Student Orientation that focuses on inclusion, cultural competency and becoming an ally. Evaluation We are currently intentionally devising methods to collect information on trainings and educational opportunities across campus. Utilizing evaluation methods, on-line and in person to determine continued needs of the institution. Challenges Meeting the needs of a large constituency with varying needs and levels of understanding. 3. To continue to provide enforcement of university policies on non -discrimination and hate/bias The Office of Inclusion and Institutional Equity has worked collaboratively with partners across the campus to respond to and address complaints and reports related to hate/bias. Programs focused on ending bias are provided regularly to new employees SGA has continuous programming that began in 2016 using the campaign slogan #NotAtTU. Evaluation Number of complaints per year Request for workshops and along with written and oral feedback 355Challenges Helping student navigate the changing landscape, external politics and their understanding of free speech and the universities ability to address bias vs hate. 4. To develop a five -year diversity strategic plan for Towson University The vice president for Inclusion and Institutional Equity will lead the University in developing a five-year strategic plan to substantially increase diversity in all areas, to promote a campus climate that is fully inclusive, and to ensure that effective systems are in place to create a more equitable TU. The task force will focus on four key areas: What is the climate on campus related to diversity and inclusion and how is it experienced by individuals and members of the community? What is needed to recruit and retain a more diverse faculty, staff, senior administration and student body? What measures can be taken to productively provide education as well as prevent insensitivity and discrimination? How do we further promote a Model of Excellence for Campus Diversity and Inclusion? Evaluation The plan will develop actionable measurable goals for the University The committee will meet yearly to determine progress, need for updates or changes Challenges Ensuring sufficient participation in the campus-wide feedback process (focus groups, interviews, survey completion) Institutional Progress and Changes Towson University has begun to change and grow in the last decade. The challenges associated with new leadership, changing demographics, external changes in political ideologies that affect the nation as well as our campuses have created the express need to support all the constituents on our campus in a thoughtful and intentional manner. With the development of the Office of Inclusion and Institutional Equity and the support of Towson's newest President, the institution has begun to create a new inclusive and equitable climate on campus. This has required new programs, policies, structures, and processes that are not just revised but also implemented. This type of systemic change takes time, resources and methods of trust building. In the next few years with the development of positions, policies, programs and initiatives the University will begin to meet its challenge to become a more inclusive and equitable TU. 356 Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty.

DO NOT INCLUDE STATISTICS. Towson University (TU) utilizes an online incident report form as a uniform method to document the \"What, When & Where\" of certain reportable crimes and/or non-criminal hate-motivated incidents that have occurred and have been reported to Campus Security Authorities (CSA) other than the Towson University Police Department. TU has defined a Hate Crime as \"a criminal offense committed against any person or property which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias. Clery reportable hate motivated crimes include Murder, Manslaughter, Sex offenses, Robbery, Aggravated Assault, Simple Assault, Intimidation, Burglary, Motor Vehicle Theft, Destruction of Property, Theft and Arson.\" Although there are many possible categories of bias, under Clery, only the following categories are reported: Race, Gender, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Sexual Identity, Ethnicity/National Origin, and Disability. For the purpose of Clery, CSAs are required to document (and record the category of prejudice) certain reportable crimes and non-criminal hate motivated incidents that have been reported to them and occurred in the following locations: 1. On-campus property, On-campus residential life buildings, Non-campus property (property or building owned or controlled by the university that is frequently used by students and is not within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution, or any building/property that is owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the university.); and Public property located immediately adjacent to and accessible from campus (includes thoroughfares, sidewalks, streets, and lands). Confidential and anonymous reports are accepted. While second hand reports are inherently unreliable and are difficult to verify, such reports are also accepted. Certain individuals, specifically pastoral and professional counselors, are exempt from this requirement to report certain crimes. However, to be exempt from disclosing reported offenses, pastoral and professional counselors must be acting in the role of pastoral or professional counselors. 365APPENDIX Towson University: Diversity Initiatives Progress Report (attached) 3664/17/19, 10)08 PM Diversity Initiatives Progress Report | Towson University Page 1 of 12 https://www.towson.edu/inclusionequity/diversity/diversity-progress.htmlDiversity Initiatives Progress Report In November 2015, a group of students and administrators agreed that the university would work toward the following 12 goals, many of which were already aligned with the universitys strategic goals for diversity and inclusion. Here, you can track the universitys progress. 1. Increasing the tenured and tenure-track black faculty and retaining them by 10 percent by 2018. Status: ON TRACK HIRINGWe have implemented an outreach process that requires the development and approval of an Outreach Plan for all tenured or tenure track facultysearches. We continue to review and seek effective institutional outreachresources. Most recently, membership with The PhD Project was secured to provide access to pools of prospective faculty of color.

A web portal that highlights TUsfaculty diversity initiatives and resources is being developed as a marketing tool for prospective faculty. Faculty vacancy announcements will be posted on the prospective faculty web page. A brochure is under development that will serve as an outreach tool for use during conferences and meetings to attract potential faculty of color to TUs faculty employment opportunities. We have increased our support for academic department chairs and are emphasizing their vital leadership role as it relates to diversity and inclusion. 3674/17/19, 10)08 PM Diversity Initiatives Progress Report | Towson University Page 2 of 12 https://www.towson.edu/inclusionequity/diversity/diversity-progress.htmlemphasizing their vital leadership role as it relates to diversity and inclusion.

TUs academic Intergroup Dialogue Program (IGD) delivers for-credit opportunities for students to participate in multi-weekdialogues to come together across social identify differences. IGD faculty facilitators have established a supportive network that encourages faculty retention. Focus groups with faculty have been conducted for the purpose of discussing and gathering tools for faculty success at TU. Faculty members shared information regarding what resources and support systems that were most impactful in relation to securing their tenure and promotion. As a result of extremely positive feedback from faculty members, TUsmembership with the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity (NCFDD) is being renewed for next academic year. NCFDD provides resources and programming that support faculty success. A total of 226 individuals have registered and are taking advantage of the resources available through TUs NCFDD membership.We are in the final stages of developing TUs Faculty Exit Interview Process,designed to offer multiple reporting options for the purpose of increasingresponse rates. Faculty members may choose to respond in person, via telephone, and/or online. Data gathered from exit interviews will be shared in aggregate form and utilized to inform future programming. 2.

Preliminary recommendationsfrom the task force and tentative implementation plan and timeline wereshared at University Senate in February 2018. In fall 2018, a small sub-taskforce will be assembled comprised of one representative from each department with courses in the category to examine next steps. 378 UNIVERSITY OF BALTIMORE 379 2018-2019 INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT SUBMITTED TO DATE SUBMITTED : APRIL 17, 2019 POINT OF CONTACT : DARLENE BRANNIGAN SMITH, PH.D. EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND PROVOST 380Section I: Summary Statement Diversity encompasses many ideals at the University of Baltimore (UB) such as race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, foreign nationality, economic status, and non - traditional students. The University embraces the challenges of multi- culturalism and inclusion in its academic and co -curricular programming, enrollment processes, retention initiatives, and hiring decisions. The University of Baltimore values a multicultural and global campus community that encourages the development of intercultural skills and competencies which are all essential to living and working in today's world. The University of Baltimore's Institutional Plan for Cultural Diversity is aligned with the strategic plan, Re-imagining UB 2018 -23. Our diversity plan goals are centered on our values of respect, inclusion, equity, community, and excellence. The plan's strategies are designed to raise awareness, sensitivity , and create a sense of appreciation for UB's diverse community. UB's objective is to cultivate a diverse, equitable, and inclusive climate. The sixth goal of the strategic plan states: \"UB fosters a diverse community of students, f aculty, and staff. The experiences, perspectives, and contributions of all individuals are valued and deemed cr itical to intellectual growth. We will continue our commitment to supporting diverse ideas, experiences, and perspectives that strengthen profess ional, intellectual, and cultural agility.\" The plan emphasizes the following: increasing the diversity of faculty, maintaining and advancing the diversity of our staff, developing more culturally relevant programming, working with our alumni and communi ty partners to help ensure that our students are prepared to live and lead in a diverse, multicultural global environment, and developing the process for reporting hate crimes. To support this objective, five goals have been established: Intentionally fost er and sustain a welcoming campus environment based on the principles of equity and inclusion to create an environment that is respectful of differences and promotes the safety and security of all people. Recruit, employ, and retain a diverse faculty. Recruit and retain a diverse workforce and ensure that UB's staff profile reflects the diversity of Maryland's demographics. Prepare our students to lead and manage in a diverse and changing society by incorporating diversity and inclusion in significant ways in teaching, learning, and research. Build upon existing partnerships and create new partnerships that enhance the University's commitment to and work with diverse populations. Our implementation strategies for meeting these goals can be found in the In stitutional Plan for Cultural Diversity located in the Appendix. Below is a brief overview of our progress.

Based upon UBPD policy, these incidents/crimes are investigated by UBPD and re ported to the proper agencies. The UB student code of conduct does not specifically address hate crimes. Therefore, there are no student conduct cases that would be considered hate - related. To date, there have been no hate -crime incidents reported and one ( 1) bias -motivated incide nt reported for AY 2018 -2019. 392Section II: Appendix - Institutional Plan for Cultural Diversity UNIVERSITY OF BALTIMORE BUILDING ON A STRONG FOUNDATION: A STRATEGY FOR ENHANCING UB'S LEADERSHIP IN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION FY 2019 - FY 20 23 This diversity plan, seeks to develop a strategic framework to identify and address practices and policies that are barriers to diversity, equity , and inclusion, particularly in the integral areas of student success and a diver sified employee talent pool. In order to foster diversity and create inclusive excellence, the University embraces the following principles: 1. A shared understanding of a comprehensive, innovative, integrated approach to inclusivity in all aspects of unive rsity operations and a culture of shared responsibility , making all members of the university community integral to fostering the achievement of a diverse, equitable, supportive , and inclusive community. 2. A campus climate that acknowledges, welcomes, supp orts, and celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion among students, faculty and staff. 3. Recognizing that we are part of a global community, a commitment to strengthen and support programs and activities that promote cross -cultural understanding and globa l perspectives. 4. Diversifying the University's workforce through the development and implementation of a strategy for the recruitment, retention , and advancement of underrepresented and culturally competent faculty and staff . 5. The infusion of diversity -content in the academic curriculum and co -curricular programs. UNIVERSITY DIVERSITY GOALS AND STRATEGIES Implementation of the plan began 2018 -19 and will continue through AY 2022 -23. Senior leadership, in collaboration with the campus community, will establish annual priorities from this plan. Goal 1: Intentionally foster and sustain a welcoming campus environment based on the principles of equity and inclusion to create an environment that is respectful of differences and promotes the safety and security of all people. Strategy 1: Build and maintain an infrastructure that supports and promotes inclusion Assign the Director of the Diversity and Culture Center and the University Culture and Diversity Committee with the responsibility to sustain diversity and inclusion initiatives and support the implementation and monitoring of the diversity and inclusion plan. Analyze USM Data Journal and Maryland demographic data annually to assess achievement of goals to diversify faculty and staff, and develop metrics and trend data to mo nitor progress . Enhance the physical and technological infrastructure to provide accessibility for all members. 393 Upd ate existing, and create new, university procedures and policies to better meet the needs of students, faculty and staff in underrepresented groups that are not well -served by current systems. Develop a healthier, collegial working environment through better communication of and training in system, university and college -level policies; ensure mandatory training for all supervisors and academic leaders (e.g., deans, chairs, directors). Identify Ombudsperson(s) to serve as an impartial intermediary to mediate disputes and investigate and address complaints. Strategy 2: Develop quantitative and qualitative metrics to better understand the state of diversity and inclusion at UB. Assess UB with regard to the Multicultural Organization Development Model 1 and identify areas of deficiencies. Design and conduct periodic campus -wide climate surveys (faculty, staff and students) to frame and direct future action on diversity and inclusion. Strategy 3: Initiate cultural competence training for UB faculty, staff, and students. Cultural competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that enable one to function effecti vely across cultural difference while being respectful and responsive to the beliefs of diverse population groups. Include training in onboarding processes and /or orientation of new faculty, staff, and student employees. Offer training through Human Resource Training and Development Program or CELTT for existing faculty and staff on topics ranging from recognizing and reducing implicit bias in the application review process to best practices for inclusive interviewing and mentoring. Offer training via New Student Orientation of new students and via Student Affairs activities and programming for existing students. Train UB management and supervisory personnel in best practices that promote diversity and inclusiveness across all functions. Include training on the process for reporting hate crime and UB's response protocol in the onboarding of new faculty and staff, and the orientation for all new students. Incorporate informal and formal diversity, equity, and inclusion goals into Performance Management Process (PMP) and provide feedb ack regarding individual and unit -level diversity efforts and struggles. Strategy 4: Address gains, opportunities , and challenges of becoming a diverse campus by providing \"Our UB Students\" data and information. Information will provide a narrative beyond demographic data to enhance knowledge of UB students' unique backgrounds, histories and lived experiences. Include student data and information in recruitment p rofiles and interview documents. Provide student data and information during New Faculty and St aff Orientation. Offer student data and information through Human Resource Training and Development Program. Offer student data and information as a part of CELTT professional development series . 1 Jackson, B.W.

Please email your complete submission to zlee@usmd.edu by Wednesday, April 17, 2019. 41214 Appendix A Section II: Institutional Plan and Implementation Timeline The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) is currently in the third year of executing its strategic priorities outlined in the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan (the \"Plan\"). This Plan encompasses six themes, 28 strategic outcomes, and 303 goals and serves as the guidepost to direct our collective actions. Across the institution, senior leaders have aligned their unit plans with the Plan to ensure the integrity of a shared purpose, enhance d accountability, and continued improvement by adjusting our strategies with appropriate initiatives to accomplish our goals. In the context of advancing cultural awareness among faculty, staff, and students, UMB leadership is increasingly conscious of removing those institutional barriers that challenge attainment of our cultural diversity goals while also developing attainable tactics that support our objectives. President Perman leads our efforts to ensure that cultural diversity is a strategic priority. In this regard, the theme - Inclusive Excellence - in our strategic plan addresses this objective. This theme accounts for 14% (42) of all goals in the Plan, all of which are at varying stages of completion across the institution. These goals and their implementation status are discussed in Section 1 of this report. Additionally , the progress report for the execution phase of the Plan can be found on the UMB strategic plan website. Dr. Perman also continues to value the advice and counsel from the Diversity Advisory Council (DAC), a body comprised of at least one liaison from each of our seven schools, and a representative from the staff and faculty senate, human resource services, and the student body to inform initiatives and efforts. The school liaisons are responsible for communicating DAC efforts to faculty, staff, and students in the ir respective domains. In 2018-2019, the DAC created an affinity group initiative and institutional guidelines to provide an environment where faculty and staff can share prevailing ideology and purpose. The first affinity group established by members of the UMB community is Latinos Unidos. Latinos Unidos provides opportunities for Latino faculty, staff, and students to connect and share expertise to promote professional development and raise awareness of issues impacting the Latino/a community. We anticipate additional affinity groups will be created between now and the next diversity reporting cycle. Students Each of the Schools and central campus engage in a variety of efforts to improve cultural diversity. The campus continues to recruit diverse student, staff and faculty populations that embody the demographics of our nation. For example, spring 2019 enrollment data reveal that the diversity of our student population increased by 2% over the previous period. The following section will highlight examples of significant campus-wide initiatives during the 2018-2019 academic year focused on supporting underrepresented populations, advancing the intercultural competencies of all students, and student food security. In February 2018, UMB administered the Education Advisory Board (EAB) Campus Climate Survey to students to understand and measure students' experiences, perceptions, and behaviors with respect to diversity and inclusion on campus. In Fall 2018, the results were shared with University and School leaders. During Spring 2019, the findings were presented and preliminary meaning making and action planning oc curred with the following: Student Affairs Deans from the seven Schools, Division of Student Affairs/Campus Life Services staff, three open forums, and the University Student Government Association. Comprehensive action planning is occurring via a work group containing student, faculty, and staff representation from each School and central campus; with the Student Affairs Deans from each School during a retreat in May; and the Division of Student Affairs/Campus Life Services with the work concluding in July 2019. The campus published the presentation and infographic summarizing key findings on the UMB website. The infographic will be updated with key 413 15 initiatives and findings based on future administrations of the survey. UMB will administer the survey every two years, with the exception of the School of Social Work. Social Work will issue the survey every year because many students are enrolled in two-year programs. A campus-wide multicultural center taskforce met between September 2018 and February 2019 to expl ore the need and focus of a \"center\" at UMB. The co-chairs, the Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs and a student, met with approximately 289 students during 10 meetings held with one or more student governing bodies or leadership groups within each School and the University Student Government Association. The taskforce learned about current diversity efforts through presentations given by individuals representing seven departments/initiatives and the Schools to avoid duplication of programming and services and to find opportunities for collaboration and synergy. The taskforce collected data from students, faculty, and staff via an online survey. In addition, we reviewed the resources offered by peer institutions and professional guidelines established for multicultural centers. A student work group provided additional insights. The taskforce recommended the creation of a taskforce and submitted the report to University leaders in February 2019 for consideration. A campus food security committee administered a survey during the Fall 2018 semester to better understand and address food insecurity among our students. The student survey data and the food security committee generated a list of recommendations that we are implementing. Staff and Faculty The Human Resource Services (HRS) unit works closely with the Diversity Advisory Council and each of the Schools and administrative departments to further the goals of making UMB a more diverse and inclusive environment. In partnership with the DAC, HRS established a set of goals that included staffing and development action items. HRS also initiated the first ever campus-wide Climate and Engagement survey in 2016 and the follow-up survey in 2019. HRS is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment at the university. HRS operations span the university and through our people-related processes, we are able to collaborate to positively impact the experiences of both staff and faculty. We will continue to share data and best practices across the university and provide expert input in key areas, including staff and faculty training, organizational development, employee relations, and recruitment. In this regard, UMB has increased its efforts to recruit administrators with the expertise and lens to improve diversity outcomes throughout the institution. In addition, we demonstrate our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by seeking the most qualified candidates to fill positions regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or other under-represented designations. Consequently, senior leaders are diversifying their recruitment efforts to hire qualified individuals from underrepresented groups. For example, in spring 2018, UMB hired its first female chief of police and a femal e associate vice president for facilities and operations - males have always occupied these positions. Along with university leadership, HRS, institutional research, and the DAC are examining trends, evaluating survey results, and other metrics to inform our diversity efforts to positively impact our diversity and inclusion goals. 414 16 Process for Reporting Campus-Based Hate Crimes The University of Maryland, Baltimore Department of Public Safety adheres to interdepartmental policy and procedures outlined in Written Directive 14.4 entitled, \"Clery Reporting Policy\" Section II states: \"It shall be the policy of the Force to comply with federal laws impacting th e daily administration and operation of the UMBPF and to comply with obligations and requirements of the \"Clery Act.\" We publish and distribute an annual \"Clery Report\" to the US Department of Education. The report identifies campus -based hate crimes as consistent with federal and institutional requirements. The report is published and distributed no later than the 1 st of October of each year by the agency's Technical Services and Records Lieutenant or designee, consistent with the mandates of the Jeanne \"Clery Act\" disclosure of campus policy and campus crime statistics. An annual notice of the availability of the campus crime report is generated and made available to all current students and employees by the Technical Service and Records Lieutenant or desi gnee no later than ten days from the date of publication of the report by the U.S. Department of Education. As a public safety organization, the UMB Department of Public Safety provides policy disclosure, collect, classify and count crime reports, crime statistics and issue emergency notifications, and timely warnings in addition to retaining certain records for the dissemination of information. The submission of all statistical data is initiated annually by the 1 st of August using an electronic online submission to the U.S. Department of Education's website. The submission of all \"Clery Act\" reportable statistical data including (hate -crimes) is completed annually to comply with the \"2008 Amendments to the \"Clery Act\" which mandates that \"Hate Crimes\" be reported in the published annual \"Clery Act\" report. In addition, in support of the mandated requirements for compliance by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Department of Public Safety, regarding the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act; Title 20, USC, SS 1092 (f), the records section request submission of required reporting from the Baltimore Police Department's Central and Western Districts which surround the University. The agency makes crime logs available to all students, employees, prospective students and prospective employees and members of the public at the Police Communications Center. Also, the University of Maryland, Baltimore Department of Public Safety, works with the Executive Director of Diversity and Inclusion/Title IX Coordinator. The Executive Director of Diversity and Inclusion/Title IX Coordinator works closely with our agency's Clery and Victim Assistance Coordinators as needed. The Executive Director of Diversity and Inclusion/Title IX Coordinator also manages policies and procedures that permit administrative review and response apart from law enforcement when there is a hate crime including sexual violence. Where the alleged perpetrator is a member of the campus community, Office of Diver sity and Inclusion/Title IX can establish a review process that includes assuring accountability for actions substantiated as having occurred. Also, when the impacted party is a member of the campus community, they can provide support and assistance to assure ongoing access to work, school, and other services. 415 17 Summary of Any Resources, Including State Grants, Needed by the Institution to Effectively Recruit and Retain a Culturally-Diverse Student Body UMB professional schools are able to recruit and retain some of the best underrepresented minorities, but often times, students are selecting other institutions where they receive a scholars hip offer that covers tuition. Our awards across the schools range from $2,000 to $35,000. Additional funding would allow us to increase awards to make a meaningful impact in the funding provided to this cohort of students whose presence in the classroom provides a richness to human services and health care educational experience. Minority students represented 2,935 (44%) of the 6,678 enrollment total during Spring 2019. UMB awarded $2,653,078 in state funds to 436 students to recruit and retain diverse students in the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, Carey School of Law, School of Pharmacy, the School of Social Work, the School of Nursing, BSN, The School of Medicine, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and the Department of Medical & Research Technology. Fourteen percent of the minority students enrolled in Spring 2019 received diversity state funding.

We have pre -registration que stions to assess expectations, and post -event evaluations to measure the impact of the content that was delivered. Questions are designed to see if we are meeting needs of URM undergraduates, with respect to increasing their preparation for graduate scho ol. Underrepresented Minority Students = 68% (not including those who identified within the broad category of \"Asian -American/Pacific Islander\") 45% of the participants had not had information on preparing for graduate school prior to attending the Summer Horizons program. 64% did not know that there were funding opportunities available through NASA. We want to be sure that we are reaching all underrepresented undergraduate students. Most participants (63%) learned about the program through their summer research/internship programs, faculty, or university staff members PROMISE Engineering Institute (PEI): As part of faculty diversity recruitment efforts, UMBC (COEIT) leads a new grant with MSU, UMCP, and JHU, to expedite the career preparation of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows so that they can be considered for tenure -track faculty positi ons. This is a NEW * discipline -specific* effort. PEI is in early stages, and the Co -PIs are planning the activities for 2018 -2019. WESTAT, an independent evaluation firm will be conducting the summative evaluation. Formative evaluation will be handled internally. Some of the international excursions, an d discussions on connecting humanitarian engineering content to student programming, are contributing to the research on retaining underrepresented students. An official launch was held on August 18, 2018 as part of the PROMISE AGEP's Summer Success Inst itute (SSI). A primary task is to be sure that all URM graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty of all types are reached. Human Resources - PageUp applicant tracking system implemented in 2017 for nonexempt and exempt staff positions. Utilize system for data collection and reporting.

Two days of programming in August, including activities connected to Dissertation House and the Bridging conference co -hosted with the USM LSAMP group. We ask questions during registration process and have evaluations for select sessions during event. The 201 8 SSI workshops focused on science communication, preparation for leadership, and academic success. In 2018, the # of participants who completed the survey was 86. 92% stated that the program provides them with a stronger sense of identity as a scholar. SSI invests in bringing \"Mentors -in- Residence\" to the event - these are faculty and leaders of color who are already role models in their respective fields. Providing professional development programming that isn't covered by labs or other university entities is a top priority for organizers of SSI. SSI works to improve visibility of faculty of color in STEM professoriate, hopefully convincing more scholars of color to consider faculty careers.

Founded in 1966, UMBC is a selective, historically-diverse, public research university with a total student enrollment of 13,767 for Fall 2018. Diversity is defined at UMBC in its fullest scope, embracing not only racial and ethnic groups and individuals who are or have been underrepresented in higher education, but also including religious affiliation, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability, foreign nationality, non-traditional student status, and other important characteristics. UMBC's first Diversity Plan was written in 2009, in response to a state mandate. The original plan articulated four overarching diversity goals for UMBC. Over the intervening years, UMBC's wealth of diversity initiatives has deepened and grown, while the four overarching institutional goals have remained constant. The 2019 Diversity Plan for UMBC retains the four overarching UMBC diversity goals and integrates them with the two guiding diversity goals from USM, as required in the Diversity Report UMBC is mandated to submit annually. In development of the 2019 plan, UMBC has integrated the broad diversity scaffolding with the specific, diversity-related goals from UMBC's recent strategic plan to form part one as the core of the plan. It is anticipated that part one of the 2019 Diversity Plan will warrant review for possible updating in 2024. Part two of the 2019 Diversity Plan is the annual update portion. This portion of the plan integrates the specific, diversity-related strategies (identified for 2018-2020 and continuing from 2016-17 and 2017-18) from UMBC's 2018 strategic planning implementation document. It is anticipated that part two of the Diversity Plan will be updated annually--as needed and based on continued implementation of UMBC's strategic plan--at the time UMBC develops its annual Diversity Report. Finally, it is important to note that UMBC frequently implements its plans for diversity through programs executed in the normal course of daily operations of the University, without designating them as diversity programs. For example, a large proportion of UMBC's transfer students are persons of color. Because UMBC is strongly committed to ensuring the success of its transfer students, UMBC actively supports the racial and cultural diversity in its student population through programs that support transfer students. Because UMBC has thus woven many of its diversity programs into the fabric of how it supports all students, faculty, and the campus community, some of the initiatives included in part two of this plan may not include descriptors such as \"diversity\" but are nevertheless an important part of UMBC's ongoing plan for supporting and enhancing cultural and racial diversity at UMBC. 430 14 Overarching Diversity Goals of USM and UMBC USM Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, staff, and faculty. UMBC Goals: 1. To ensure access to educational and employment opportunities for a diverse, student, faculty, and staff community 2. To encourage and support individual development and advancement 3. To provide conditions for personal success USM Goal 2: Create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. UMBC Goal: 4. To provide a culture of safety, inclusion and respect PART I Core Diversity Plan, 2019 -24 Excerpts from Our UMBC, A Strategic Plan for Advancing Excellence that support and advance USM's and UMBC's overarching diversity goals Strategic Plan Preface With this plan, our UMBC community focuses on strategic steps toward the next level of inclusive excellence. The plan honors our founding commitment to serve the citizens of Maryland and welcome people of all backgrounds into the life of the university. It builds on our achievements as a selective, public research university strongly connected with the economic and civic life of the Baltimore region and the State of Maryland. University Mission UMBC is dedicated to cultural and ethnic diversity, social responsibility, and lifelong lear ning. University Vision Our UMBC community redefines excellence in higher education through an inclusive culture that connects innovative teaching and learning, research across disciplines, and civic engagement. We will advance knowledge, economic prosperity, and social justice by welcoming and inspiring inquisitive minds from all backgrounds. 4312019 Diversity Plan-UMBC 15 Final 4.3.2019 FOUR FOCUS AREAS OF STRATEGIC PLAN Focus Area One: The Student Experience Strategic Goals Leverage the strength of UMBC's compositional diversity by increasing the cultural and global competencies of all students.

Progress on the following institutional goals should be reported: Goal 1: Inc rease the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty . Goal 2: Create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. Goal 3: Provide a statement regarding the process for the reporting of campus -based hate crimes as consistent with federal requirements under Clery. Summary Statement of your institution's plan to improve cultural diversity. ( 2-3 pages max ) 2018 -2019 marked another year of transitions at The University of Maryland, College Park due to external scrutiny and internal pro cess improvement. As the University swiftly implemented the recommendations of external athletic review boards, President Loh faced another challenge with turnover in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Moving quickly, President Loh appointed Cynthia Edmunds interim CDO in August upon the resignation of Roger Worthington and his return to the faculty. The President's charge to Interim CDO Edmunds was to identify actionable steps following from recommendations of the Joint Task Force on Inclusion and Respect, the External Review, and the Campus Climate Survey. Additionally, she as the leader of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion ( ODI) w as to develop a comprehensive communications program to fully capture and promote the full breadth of diversity, equity and inclusion activities within UMD; finally, President Loh tasked Interim CDO with preparing ODI for the inaugural Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion (VPDI). Interim CDO Edmunds asked ODI to review all of the documents produced in recent years related to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) at UMD. The synthesis of 500+ pages of information and recommendatio ns yielded a clear consensus as to where UMD should/could focus on enhanc ing EDI. These were: Collaboration & Coordination of diversity and inclusion efforts across campus , Resource Allocation , Leadership & Accountability , Communication , Training & Develo pment (visual included in the Appendix) . 441 During all of the transitions, including personnel changeover and status shifts ( ODI, MICA, ADVANCE, UHR, and others), resource availability, and other changes that occur during the regular course of academic life, offices, units, departments, and colleges continued to provide direct services to students, faculty, staff and the community to improve cultural diversity, enhance personal experiences, and foste r a sense of belonging. The Self -Study Report in the Appendix provides a comprehensive overview of equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts at UMD. Also in the Appendix is the External Review that provides an analysis of UMD by expert observers who used multiple investigatory research techniques to gather a de eper view of what is currently being done at UMD and what opportunities remain to be explored. The University has already acted on one recommendation, namely to elevate the role of CDO to VP and expediently conducting a thorough search leading to the sel ection of VP DI Dodd. The major goals outlined in the Strategic Plan (included in the Appendix) of the University remain unchanged and units continue to work towards them; the short- term goal of selecting a new VPDI has been met with the selection of Dr. Georgina Dodd. VPDI Dodd will take up her position in June 2019. Her initial plan of action includes a listening program wherein she will meet with a broad range of campus consti tuents to learn what matters to them, what they see as issues - and strengths - and what they offer to UMD. She will also have re sponsibility for collaborating with colleges on localized DI efforts; the short -term goal remains to fully understand the breadth of EDI activities on campus, to vigorously promote them, and to analyze their impacts. She will be supported in her efforts b y the work done by ODI and the campus in the past few years. Areas of emphasis for UMD remain unchanged from previous years and are reflective of Goals 1 and 2 of this report. UMD aims to: Improve recruitment and retention of under -represented faculty ; Improve recruitment and retention of under -represented minorities, with specific attention to African -American students. Recent data provided by enrollment services and IRPA reveal a multi -year, downward trend in application, acceptance, and matriculation rates ; Provide support and outreach to campus community members to increase opportunities for academic and social success, improve well-being , and foster a sense of belonging as a Terp. The tables below highlight some of the efforts UMD makes towards achieving these goals. Unfortunately, it is not complete, and UMD does not currently have a systematic process to capture all of its EDI initiatives and efforts . Th is challenge has been identified by President Loh and assigned to ODI to solve with the assistance and support of Strategic Communications and other units as necessary. While this report catalogs broadly many successful and visible efforts, there are many other similar efforts within individual colleges or departments tha t (as of this year) do not automatically get credited in this report because UMD does not have an official, centralized data collection point or process. Creating that mechanism and process will be crucial short -term goals for UMD to achieve within the ne xt few years under the leadership of VPDI Dodd. Areas of Success: 442 Successful VPDI search Implementation of Hate Bias Program Response Protocol Creation of Enrollment Action Committee , a cross campus partnership to study and improve African American student numbers Second Thriving Survey underway (April 2019) following 2 years of positively shifting work -life perceptions on campus Campus Climate Survey report (April 2019) provided additional reinforcement of findings of Joint Task Force Report and External Review. Successful Director of OCRSM search Reorganization of the Counseling Center to provide additional mental health services to students During this year of tremendous challenge, UMD continues to improv e equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI ) efforts. Established efforts continue such as the President's Commissions on Disability, Ethnic Minority, LGBT, and Women's Issues, and new initiatives continue to be envisioned and actualized. UMD continues to move towards its strategic diversity goals and meeting challenges with pragmatic optimism. Goal 1 : Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and facul ty. Timeline for meeting goal within the diversity plan : 2018 (see pages 19 -20 of Transforming Maryland in the appendix) Format: Bulleted, succinct descriptions of major initiatives and strategies are ideal; additional narrative is not necessary. Share campus -wide and program -specific efforts designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students, staff, and faculty. Metrics to measure how progress of each initiative /strategy is being evaluated Data to demonstrate wher e progress has been achieved / indicators of s uccess Areas w here continuous improvement is needed The Office of Undergraduate Admissions has created a multi-tiered strategy designed to impact students from prior to the point of application through enrollment and includes: Education about the college application process Recruitment A holistic application review process Special program and merit scholarship review and selection and, Yield efforts The primary metrics to evaluate progress are: The number of interactions with traditionally underrepresented students and those who support them The number of students who chose to apply for admission The numbers of these students who complete the application process The number of these students that apply, enroll, and graduate from Maryland From Fall 2017 to Fall 2018 , the percentage of incoming first -year students who are underrepresented minorities decreased . We will continue to learn from what the environment presents and adjust our strategies during periods where numbers are not increasing. We have exp erienced great success in attracting talented and diverse students to the university over time. We anticipate periods when the numbers may not increase, and at times may even dip 443because of unforeseen factors. As we are currently experiencing one of those periods, we are redoubling our recruitment efforts while we continue to learn and adjust our strategies. Graduate School initiatives include the following: Annual Networking Reception for Diverse Students and Faculty PROMISE AGEP programming and activities including PhD Completion Workshops Fall Harvest Dinner and Networking Reception Writing retreats Annual Research Symposium and Professional Development Conference Invited guest speakers of STEM initiatives Bi- monthly listening sessions with URM graduate students Spring Speaker Series Conversations on Graduate Diversity Series Continued outreach for URM undergraduate research programs nationally and HBCU institutions The primary metrics to evaluate progress are: Tracking for the last five years of URM students from initial application to admissions to enrollment From 2017 to 2018, we have seen an increase in overall graduate student enrollment with a slight increase in URM enrollment.

Like other institutions of higher learning at the time , it was created to benefit the sons of landowners. As Maryland was a slave state, many of those landowners also owned slaves. Indeed, of the twenty -four original trustees, s ixteen were slave owners (Steven, 2011). The student body began to become a bit more diverse in the 1870s with the admission of male international students primarily from Latin and South America. One of the most notable early international stu dents was Pyon Su, class of 1891. He was the first Korean to receive a degree from any American college or university. Non-black w omen were firs t admitted in 1916 concurrent with the institution's renaming as Maryland State College. In 1920, the college became part of the existing University of Maryland. The first black students were admitted in 1951 despite the \"separate but equal\" stance of then President Harry Clifton \"Curl ey\" Byrd (president, 1936 -1954) .1 The first African American member of faculty, M. Lucia James, began in 1955 and continued working with classes until her death in 1977 (umdarchives, 2015). Desegregation did not begin in earnest until 1977 when a federal appeals court o rdered Maryland colleges to speed up the process (Barnes, 1977). Though more slowly than we would wish, the University continues to become a more diverse and inclusive institution. We have sought to transform the campus into a national leader on issues of EDI. Evidence of our national stature was manifested in 1998 with the publication of the Diversity Blueprint: A Planning Manual for Colleges and Universities, published by the University of Maryland with the Association for Colleges and Universities (Office of Human Relations Programs, University of Maryland, College Park, 1998) . More recently, UMD received the 2015 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine , and f or over five years running, we have been recognized by Campus Pride as among the \"best of the best\" LGBTQ- friendly campuses (Seabolt, 2015). Leadership Many dedicated members of the c ampus community have guided the progress of EDI. The most notable have been four exceptional leaders beginning with Dr. John Slaughter (chan cellor , 1982 -88). Slaughter was one of the first African American chancellors of a major state university. He challenged the campus to become a \"model multiracial, multicultural, and multi generational academic community \" (Holter, 1983). Under his leadership, the university moved from being an institution focused on compliance to an acad emic community that pro- actively addressed diversity . 1 The football stadium at College Park was named for Byrd when it was built in 1950. His name was stripped from the stadium in 2015 to remove one of the most prominent symbols of a painful aspect of campus history. President Loh explained that the effort was not intended to \"purge history,\" but to find a \"principled compromise.\" Byrd's name is now memorialized in one of the campus libraries (Wenger, 2015) . 454 3 Among his many accomplishments, Dr. William E. Kirwan (president, 1988- 98) led the institution 's defense to a legal challenge of the university's Banneker scholarship, a program designed to enroll academically talented African American students. While the court eventually ruled against the race -exclusive nature of the scholarship, the university's defense was a first step in developing the now wide -spread use of the diversity rationale to advance affirm ative action goals in higher education (Synnott, 2005). Dr. C. D. Mote, Jr. (president, 1998- 2010) built on earlier accomplishments and expanded on the focus of our commitment to diversity. He sponsored programs that reach into Maryland communities with large numb ers of disadvantaged students and created pipelines for these students to obtain an affordable college education. Graduation rates of students from all racial/ethnic backgrounds grew with substantial progress in closing the achievement gap. He championed the rights of LGBT people with aggressive support for domestic partner benefits, and established family -friendly policies and programs to help faculty, staff, and students balance academic, work, and family responsibilities (\"Dr. C.D. 'Dan' Mote, Jr.,\" 2016). Dr. Wallace D. Loh (president 2010- present) continues in the tradition established by his three immediate predecessors. During his tenure, the first strategic plan for diversity was adopted, the position of chief diversity o fficer (CDO) was created, and d iversity officers were established in each of the colleges and divisions. On July 6, 2017, Loh announced that the position of CDO would become a vice president. \"A VP for Diversity and Inclusion indicates a major institutional commitment of effort and resources...\" (Loh, 2017b) . In an interview with the Baltimore Sun, Loh spoke of $3.8 million for new diversity measures (Campbell, 2018). Offices that Promote EDI A variety of units promoting EDI have been established over the years. The first unit with a broad, campus -wide, multidimensional mission for EDI was the Office of Human Relations Programs (1971) . It has evolved over time and is now the Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI). Today, ODI is considered a department with three sub -departments. They include the Nyumburu Cultural Center (1971) , the LGBT Equity Center (1998), and Diversity Training and Education ( 2017). D iversity Training and Education (DTE) evolved from an interim version of what was the Office of Human Relations Programs and the current ODI. Other important units focused on diversity with campus -wide responsibilities have include d the Office of Multi -Ethnic Student Education ( 1971), Accessibility & Disability Service (1977 ), the Maryland Incentive Awards Program (2000), and the Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy Office ( 2006 ). As the dates s uggest, each of these units was established in response to concerns raised at the time of their founding , but there was no overarching vision or plan into which they fit. They were also scattered into different administrative structures within the university. Today, the Office of Multi -Ethnic Student Education (OMSE) and the Marylan d Incentive Awards Program (IAP) are located in the Office of Undergraduate Studies . Accessibility & Disability Service (ADS) is part of the Counseling Center. The Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy Office (MICA) is within the Stamp Student U nion. While collaboration 455 4 between units is encouraged, accountability and reporting flows to the heads of the units where these various offices are located in the institution. These units are all mentioned in the 2010 diversity strategic plan (Diversity Plan Steering Committee, 2010). In addition to these units, others may not have a specific focus on diversity, yet they serve a high proportion of students of color, economically disadvantaged students, and others with identities protected by law and university policy. This would include units such as Academic Achievement Programs in the Office of Undergraduate Studies . Many of the se are cited in the Report on Diversity Assets at UMD . Most recently, students have called for an indigenous cultural center, a Latinx cultural center, and an increase in the number of designated prayer spaces on campus for Muslim students (Hughes, 2016). An increase in resources for additional identity groups is not new. This is particularly true for a Latinx center, community resources for people with d isabilities that go beyond compliance, and a Women's center. 2 Given the highly decentralized nature of existing resources, it is difficult to know where any new resources should be placed or even who should be responsibl e for attending to these needs or overseeing accountability assessments to measure impact and progress to broader institutional goals and objectives. Within the colleges and divisions, t here is a multitude of additional units and other ongoing efforts in support of EDI. Many of these are de tailed in the Report on Divers ity & Inclusion Assets at UMD . Like the campus -wide efforts, these were typically created in response to local specific needs with accountability and reporting within their respective colleges and divisions. Collaborations vary widely and may include the involvement of campus -wide units, but collaborations across major organizational boundaries is less frequent. Diversity in the Curriculum Interdisciplinary programs have been part of the university since at least 1945 when the American Studies program began. Other academic programs focused on social identities have been established over time. They include African American Studies (1969) , Wom en's Studies (1977), Jewish Studies (1980) , Latin American Studies (1989) , Asian American Studies (2000) , Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies (2002) , Persian Studies (2004) , and U.S. Latino Studies (2007) . These programs and the courses they of fer are indispensable for any comprehensive academic institution and UMD's offerings are highly regarded. These areas of scholarship are interdisciplinary by thei r nature and frequently involve a small cadre of core faculty within a specific department al ong with many more affiliate faculty from other departments. Courses taught by affiliate faculty tend to be cross -listed with the program 2 Luke Jensen has been aware of these efforts over the last twenty years . In particular, requests for support of Latinx students and students with disabilities were submitted to the Moving Maryland Forward Grant Program while he was chair. Some of the proposals were not funded primarily because there was no logical \"home\" for the resources. 456 5 and the academic home of the faculty member. Affiliat e faculty may also play a role in any conferences, symposia, lecture series, etc. These collaborations are concentrated in the colleges of Arts and Humanities, and Behavioral and Social Sciences. There are few structural organizational incentives or supports specifically designed to foster collaborations that extend beyond their academic home, and in some ways the decentralized framework of the institution may be prohibitive of such collaborative partnerships. Undergraduate student s have had a General Education diversity requirement since 1990. Today, the req uirement consists of six credit hours . Students must complete two Understanding Plural Societies courses (3 -6 credits), or one Understanding Plural Societies course (3 credits) and one Cultural Competence course (1 -3 credits ). In cultural competence courses, students are required to think about their own culture and how it compares with others, and they must negotiate across cultural difference. Plural societies courses are more about systems and structures. It could all be very theoretical or completely historical. For example, Classics course, CLAS311 Inventing Ancient Greek Culture, is an understanding plural societies course. Current Context Diversity plan The University published its first strategic plan for diversity in 2010 (Diversity Plan Steering Committee, 2010) . The core of the plan included a set of recommendations in six categories. They were a) leadership, b) climate, c) recruitment and retention, d) education, e) research and scholarship, and f) community engagement (see Appendices for a copy of the 2010 Diversity Plan ). The Diversity Plan triggered the creation of the position of CDO , but the first hire was made as an assoc iate vice president reporting directly to the provos t rather than the recommendation of the 2010 Di versity Plan for the CDO to be a vice president reporting directly to the president (p. 14). President Loh has recently announced the elevat ion of the CDO to the level of vice p resident along with new resources to support the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Kumea Shorter- Gooden was appointed as the first CDO in 2012 and served until January 2017. Dr. Shorter -Gooden was instrumental in the creation of diversity officers in each of the colleges and divisions as called for in the plan (p. 15). This important achievement began the process of building a more robust infrastructure to address issues of divers ity and inclusion . Responsibilities for implemen tation as outlined in the plan were pushed from the CDO, provost, and president , to the separate colleges and divisions. Diversity officers regularly provided goals and plans for implementation of the plan wi thin their separate units, but there was no annual progress report posted on the university website, and the individual reports from the colleges and divisions were not shared publicly (pp. 27 -28). Shorter -Gooden resigned in January 2017. Cynthia Edmunds became the interim CDO in January until Roger L. Worthington was appointed beginning on July 6, 2017. 457 6 Troubling campus incidents In recent years, a number of troubling campus incidents have occurred with a negative impact on campus climate . They include a 2015 racist, sexist email by a member of a fraternity on campus . The email became public . The administration expressed indig nation and anger over the language while stressing free speech rights. Many students felt frustrated. They believed that condemning speech without also punishing those who expressed it did not go far enough (New, 2015) . In May 2016, there was an incident involving the University of Maryland Police that played out against the national discussion on police violence against African Americans . On May 21 , campus police received a call about a party at an apartment complex on campus. The 911 callers reported a potential fight and underage drinking. It was later determined that the call was retaliation by non -UMD students who had been denied entry into the party. At the scene, the two officers initially spoke with people in the parking lot who pointed them to the party claiming there were weapons insi de. When they arrived at the party, the hosts assured the officers that there was no fight and there were no weapons. The situation escalated to the point that the police used pepper spray. The Prince George's County Fire and EMS Department arrived on the scene and they attempted to treat partygoers who came into contact with the spray. The police felt that c rowd control around those being treated was becoming difficult . Once again , they used pepper spray to disburse the crowd . Chief David Mitchell later stated that the use of pepper spray did not adhere to department standards and added, \"We should have handled the situation with more diplomacy\" (Thomas, 2016). The number and intensity of incidents grew rapidly after the 2016 presidential election. Posters promoting a white supremacist group appeared on campus in December (Moyer, 2016). Alarmed at this development and the outcome of the election, a coalition of 25 student groups came together as ProtectUMD. They presented a list of 64 deman ds to the university (Hughes, 2016) . While President Loh responded by praising the students' engagement and passion, he noted that work was already underway to advance progre ss on some of the demands whereas other demands were dismissed as misguided and inappropriate for campus action. Some students found his reaction inadequate (Loh, 2017a) . On April 27, 2017 , a noose was found in one of t he fraternity houses on campus (Wells, 2017). Reports mention that it was found by a black chef in the kitchen of the house. The news sparked a student march and sit -in protest (Limon, 2017). Frustration among students on campus were raised because the perpetrator(s) was/were never charged with a criminal act or violation of the conduct policy, and the fraternity was never sanctioned either. About 3:00 a.m. on May 20, 2017, 2 nd Lieutenant Ric hard Collins III was murdered on our campus. Lt. Collins was about to graduate from Bowie State University, an Historically Black College or University (HBCU ) about 12 miles from College Park. He was visiting friends at UMD and was waiting for an Uber when he was attacked. Sean Urbanski, a student at UMD , was charged with the murder, which was elevated to a hate -crime charge three months later . News 458 7 of the murder shocked and traumatized the campus and made national headlines (\"Opinion | A Murder at College Park, \" 2017) . Many saw the murder as indicative of the campus climate. For example, s tudents , especially students of color, took a slogan that had been associated with UMD Athletics, \"Fear the Turtle, \" and voiced their experiences on Twitter. \"I had straight As in HS but more than once YT [white] classmates have told me I am only here bc of affirmative action #FearTheTurtle.\" \"Turned away from a frat party because I'm Black #FearTheTurtle.\" \"When your story of sexual assault is not taken seriously #FearTheTurtle.\" And so on (Higginbotham, Byrne, & Donlan, 2018) . Against this backdrop, during the first week of classes in the fall of 2017, an email exchange became public between a professor teaching a mock trial class and one of his coaches . The coach sent an email to the instructor (who also happened to be her father) to inquire about whether to admit one or more Latino students into the mock trial class following auditions, stating, \"There were three (obviously) Latino students who came; 1 was mediocre, two were pretty bad...but we have almost no Latino students on the team. If I were to rank purely on performance, I would probably only take one of them. Should I take 2? All three? None have mock trial experience\" (Silverman, 2017). The email was accidentally sent to all students in the class, and one of the students (who had been identified as \"mediocre\") posted the email to Twitter, resulting in an uproar on campus, in part because it occurred during the first week of classes of the semester that followed the murder of 2 nd Lt. Collins (which occurred the previous May). The instructor and the coach were both asked to step down from teaching the course. However, there was extensive media coverage of the incident, some of which included OP -ED articles defending (or criticizing) the actions and reputations of the coach and instructor as \"affirmative action.\" Also , during the Fall 2017 semester, the Diamondback student newspaper published an article quoting the Title IX Coordinator and the UMPD as providing two different numbers for reports of hate -bias incidents on campus (27 from the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct but only 15 from UMPD). Strategic Communications attempted to explain the discrepancy in a statement issued to the Diamondback and the campus, stating that the two offices had different criteria for taking reports. The issue came quickly fol lowing the release of a new hate - bias protocol and the announcement of a search for a new program manager for hate -bias response by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Actions following the murder of 2nd Lieutenant Richard Collins III When Lt. Collins was murdered, an active search for a new permanent CDO was well underway. Given the now more urgent need , President Loh and Provost Rankin made a special plea for Roger Worthington to accept the job, promising to elevate the position to the rank of Vice President (Loh, 2017b) . Professor Worthington was chair of the Department of Counseling, Higher Education and Special Education in the College of Education. A nationally recognized scholar on diversity in higher education and a former CDO at the University of Missouri, he had deep expertise and experience as both a scholar and a practitioner. He had been co -chair of the 459 8 search committee and issued several conditions before considering the request . Ultimately , he accepted and became Interim Associate Provost and CDO on July 6, 2017. On September 7, 2017, he spoke of the urgency of the work , citing the murder of Lt. Collins and a white supremacist rally at the University of Virginia . He outlined ten concrete early steps needed to strategically and methodically assess and improve EDI at UMD (Worthington, 2017). Substantial progress has been made with Worthington's outline. The list and the April 2016 state of each follow. Joint Task Force on Inclusi on an d Respect - the final report became public on April 17, 2018 (included in the materials for the site visit team) and recommendations to be presented to the University Senate on April 24, 2018. Rapid -response campus team to assist victims of hate and bias on campus - the membership of the team has been established; the leader of this team, Program Manager for Hate/Bias Response, a newly created position, to be gin on April 20, 2018. New UMD Student Leadership Council for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - first meeting was held November 16, 2017 ; subsequent meetings have been delayed . Reinvigoration of the President's Commission on Disability, Ethnic Minority, LGBT, and Women's Issues - conveni ng of the respective chairs occurred in the Fall 2017, and meetings with two Commission s (Racial -Ethnic and Disability) also occurred in the fall . Dialogue and discourse on diversity and inclusion - a consultant was contracted to meet with campus leaders of di alogue programs at UMD and has submitted a draft proposal for the a new Campus -wide Difficult Dialogues I nitiative; resources have been set aside in ODI to provide funding for the new initiative once it has been announced . New Center for Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education (CDIHE) - established in the summer of 2017 under the leadership of Roger Worthington as the executive director and Candace Moore as the director; two post -docs have been hired along with staffing support from CHSE and two part -time graduate assistants; the CDIHE ha s convened a national thought leaders conference in January and begun planning to co -host a conference in October with the Difficult Dialogues National Resource Center. Campus -wide external benchmarking and review of diversity and inclusion programs, activ ities, and resources - site visit April 25-27, 2018, with final report expected in May. Campus Climate Study - data collection in February of 2018 with a preliminary report of findings now available (included in the external review materials) and a final report expected in June. Revision of Diversity Str ategic Plan - to be informed by the Joint Task Force, the external review, the campus climate study, along with additional campus voices ; scheduled for 2018 -19 academic calendar year . Black History and the University of Maryland: A Campus Landmark Walking Tour - self- guided version went live online in February at http://umd.edu/blackhistorytour ; in- person, guided tours availab le beginning on April 28, 2018. Develope d in collaboration with Dr. Kim Nickerson. 460 9 It is important to underscore that these steps are not an end product. Rather, they are intended to provide data and recommendations for moving forward. ODI was and is seen as a central organizing unit for issues of EDI for the entire campus. As the data and recommendations come in from a variety of sources (e.g., C limate Study, Joint Task Force Report, HR Strategist Report, External Review Report) , ODI will need to expand dramatically to undertake the many new responsibilities coming on top of existing ones. At its height, there were at least eight full -time positio ns plus graduate assistants and occasional contractual employees. Yet in August 2017, the unit had only two full -time staff, the CDO and an Executive Administrative Assistant, and a small cadre of graduate assistants, a couple contractual employees, and ad ditional staff on overloads or administrative adjustments. We began our work by backfilling existing positions , a task that remains incomplete. President Loh recognized almost immediately that additional resources would be needed if UMD wa s to adequately address the many issues of EDI that were raised in the wake of the murder . Initially, he committed $100,000 to ODI to begin working toward a campus -wide response. In January , he spoke of $3.8 million set aside for new diversity measures in an interview with the Baltimore Sun (Campbell, 2018). Overview of Self -study Process The need for campus -wide external benchmarking and review of diversity and inclusion programs was publicly stated in an email by Worthington to the entire campus on September 7, 2017 (Worthington, 2017). In order to complete a self -study in a timely manner, we decided to begin with the map of Diversity, Inclusion, Equity an d Social Justice Assets created by Kevin Allison the previous spring. Allison was an American Council on Education (ACE) Fellow working with President Loh. The map came at the request of Cynthia Edmunds, Interim CDO from January through July 5, 2017. It was the first attempt, at least in recent years, to provide an overview of these assets across campus. We understood Allison's map as an excellent effort. It may not have captured everything, but it did include the major elements. The map is organized thematically rather t han where the various assets are physically located within the university. Identifying organizational location was the first task. We next determined which units should suppl y additional information. These included academic programs, research units, student support and services, community engagement, and a few others. We did not include some of the of the safety and governance units such as the Department of Public Safety and the ombuds officers. Having identified the units and programs, we then determined the information that would be useful and should be readily available or easily obtained. On February 2, the requests for information were sent to nearly sixty (60) different campus units, with a deadline of February 23 to submit the data. Given the type of information, we felt a short turnaround was reasonable. It would also encourage brevity. 461 10 Most reports arrived on time, several required an extra effort to obtain, and a few never responded. The reports vary considerably in the amount of data and the level o f detail. Assisted by three graduate students, we summarized the reports. We attempted to impose some degree of uniformity, but the variety from one report to the next caused variations in the summaries. Allision's map, the organizational structure showing the institutional home for each asset, the assets arranged thematically, and the summaries of the reports are found in the appendix, Report on Diversity Assets at UMD. The report of the Joint President/Senate Task Force on Inclusion and Respect is compl ete and will be presented to the University Senate on April 24. Given the visibility of their work and the importance to EDI associated with their recommendations, their report is also included in the appendix . The third item in the appendix is a prelimin ary analysis of the data collected in a climate survey deployed earlier in the 2018 spring semester. It is followed by a report from our human resources consultant with information on backfilling position s and projecting needed new positions. Finally, ODI' s budget request for fiscal year 2019 (beginning on July 1, 2018) is included. In sum, the materials for the external rev iew team includes the following: 1. Overview and brief analysis 2. Report on Diversity Assets at UMD 3. Report of the Joint President/Senate Task Force on Inclusion and Respect 4. Preliminary Report on the climate survey conducted during the spring 2018 semester 5. Report from human resources strategist Brief Analysis The Report on Diversity Assets at UMD was produced by Kevin Allison from Virginia Commonwealth University during his ACE Fellowship with Presiden t Loh during the 2016 -17. It was the first and most comprehensive attempt to map our campus diversity assets in the history of the institution. This self- study report, building on the work of Dr. Allison, takes the work to another stage in the process of our campus -level review of EDI efforts at UMD. The report submitted by the external review team will then advance the work to yet another level by offering conclusions and recommendations based on a comprehensive review of EDI assets never befo re attempted in this institution. In collecting data from the various EDI assets , we were struck by the variety of assets and the ir wide distribution within the institution. The quality of many diversity assets is made evident in the individual reports, while others are already highly respected and known to be valuable to the university by their reputation. Even so, the perspective gained from this exercise is only the beginning of any comprehensive understanding of EDI work at UMD. Simply gaining an overview of these efforts is a formidable task. When individuals who are actually engaged in EDI 462 11 work at UMD struggle to gain a comprehensive understanding of what we have and what we do, it is no wonder that others are unaware and do not know where to turn to learn more. Other reports underscore the general issue of \"not knowing. \" The missions of EDI units run the gamut. Those with the broadest responsibilities tend to be located in the Office of the Provost, in the Office of Undergraduate Studies, and in the Division of Student Affairs. Those in the colleges tend to be general ly aligned with fields of study included within their particular college. There are extremely few articulations of how EDI units relate to one another, or an overarching mission or vision of the university . This theme was also articulated in the recently released Joint President/Senate Task Force Report: Diversity programming is not comprehensive and does not have a broad overarching vision. There is a lack of coordination b etween campus units and no central source of information, making it difficult to find information on current diversity and inclusion programming and resources. One is struck by missing data regarding programming. Both traditional academic programs and so-called nonacademic EDI units and initiative s were asked to provide the name and a brief description of each of their program s. W e also asked for the goals or objectives of each and the number of participants . For the nonacademic EDI unit s, we also asked for key indicators of success. Sometimes, a goal or objective could be gleaned from the description. Numbers were reported sporadically. Relatively few provided key indicators of success. There are many possible reasons why a unit failed to report the se data. One could fairly conclude that such data were either not easily assembled, or they simply didn't exist. The sheer number of reports coupled with our aggressive timeline precluded returning to the various units for clarification. One cannot fairly ascertain from the report summaries precisely which units did not supply all the requested data. For example, t he Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct , and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Equity Center both provided very long and detailed responses. These data were omitted in the process of summarizing due to the exceptional length of their reports. While essential in evaluating the individual units, omitting that data in these cases seemed reasonable for this report due to the overall paucity of these data and the consequent inability to provide any global analysis. The reports provide an impressive list of key collaborations with o ff campus entities . UMD is connected to a wide variety of community and scholarly organizations with both our academic and nonacademic EDI units. Collaborations within the university are fairly predictable. Academic units i ncluded in this study appear to be dependent on traditional units for affiliate faculty and cross listing of courses. They are concentrated in two of the colleges. Collaborations across major organizational boundaries are less frequent. Nonacademic units a lso collaborate in fairly predictable ways. Research centers collaborate with related academic units. There is at 463 12 least one exceptional example of wide ranging collaboration in this category , the Consortium on Race, Gender and Ethnicity (CRGE). While CRGE is exceptional in the breadth of collaborations, it could be predicted given the interdisciplinary mission of CRGE. Overall, research units appear to be a bit less siloed than academic units, yet still relatively insular. Collaborations of other types of nonacademic units are also somewhat predictable . There are many examples of EDI units collaborating primarily with other EDI units. One notable exception is the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Equity Center which has established liaisons with units as diverse as the University Career Center and The President's Promise, and the Department of Resident Life. These established relationships may explain why Campus Pride highly rates UMD for being among the most LGBTQ+ friendly institutions of higher lear ning in the United States (Seab olt, 2015) . Surprisingl y, there are instances where a lack of collaboration is indicated. For example, there are three (3) different initiatives in support of black male students. They are in the Nyumburu Cultural Center (NYUM) reporting to ODI , the Offic e of Multi -Ethnic Student Education (OMSE) reporting to Undergraduate Studies (but which formerly reported to ODI until 2017) , and the Student Success Initiative within the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. NYUM did not cite OMSE or the Student Success Initiative under collaborations. OMSE did not provide any information on collaborations . We are left to wonder if the different programs work in concert or in competition with one another. Similarly, there are a handful of dialogue programs on campus, including Common Ground (Resident Life) , Words of Engagement Intergroup Dialogue Program (WEIDP; Office of Diversity and Inclusion), in addition to a dialogue program run by the Clarice Performing Arts Center, and others. These programs were developed in different units across campus, for different purposes, to serve different constituents, and operate from differing conceptual frameworks, but pursue similar goals , but in the absence of collaborative partnerships and wit hout recognizable communication between the organizers. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion has begun working toward the establishment of a campus -wide dialogue initiative that could bring together these disparate programs under the framework of a Campus -wide Difficult Dialogues Initiative. Under this conceptual framework there will be an effort to build collaborative partnerships that have the capacity to broaden the scope of work on dialogues across campus and increase the impact \u2014building an initiative that will be greater than the sum of its parts. The need for this in itiative has also been highlighted by one of the findings and one of the recommendations of the Joint President/Senate Task Force Report: Faculty and staff do not have the tools necessary to facilitate dialogue on issues of hatred and bias in the classroom and in the workplace. Develop a comprehensive prevention and education initiative on diversity, inclusion, and respect for all members of the campus community that includes content areas such as implicit bias, cultural competency, bystander intervention, and civic engagement. The initiative should draw upon expertise from campus scholars and should be administered by the Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI). (p. 2 4) 464 13 During the 2017 -2018 academic year, courses fulfilling the Cultural Competence requirement were offe red by twenty -four different programs with unique prefixes (e.g., ENGL for English, AASP for African American Studies , etc.). Understanding Plural Societies were offered by thirty - eight programs. These are programs rather than departments as one department may have more than one program (e.g., Women's Studies, [WMST] and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies [LGBT] are both programs in the Department of Women's Studies). As mentioned above , many of these courses are cross -listed. For example, cour ses in African American, Asian American, and LGBT literatures appear as both English courses and courses within the programs focused on those particular groups. Typically, the home for the course is in the more tradition al academic unit, in this case Engli sh. Data from Testudo, UMD's online schedule of classes, collected in February 2017, show the following number of seats available, the number assigned, and fill rate for all general education courses offered during the 2017 -2018 academic year (minus summer courses). For cross -listed courses, each seat is counted only once. All Diversity General Education Courses , 2017 -2018 Fall 2017 offered issued fill rate Cultural Competency Courses 921 773 83.93% Understanding Plural Societies Courses 7,767 6,524 84.00% Winter 2018 offered issued fill rate Cultural Competency Courses 175 110 62.86% Understanding Plural Societies Courses 1,104 664 60.14% Spring 2018 offered issued fill rate Cultural Competency Courses 875 747 85.37% Understanding Plural Societies Courses 6,780 6,298 92.89% While the fill rate may indicate sufficient seats for the diversity requirement, a deeper analysis would likely show that the summary numbers alone do not tell the whole story. Also, the impact of this requirem ent on a broader diversity agenda would also require a deeper analysis. They undoubtedly support a sense of belonging for students with the relevant social identity, but they may have limited impact on students without those identities. For example, an LGBTQ+ student may find a home and develop academic interests in LGBT Studies and never venture into any of the other academic programs focused on diversity. Some have called for the general education requirement to \"teach tolerance\" (de Silva, 2017). In other words, with an increased level of scrutiny regarding the frequency of hate -bias incidents and dissatisfaction with the campus response to them, there have been a number of proposals to directly tailor the diversity requirements in the undergraduate general education curriculum to foster greater 465 14 competencies (awa reness, knowledge and skills) to interact with others without bias and discrimination (intentional or unintentional). While the Office of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for the General Education Program, responsibility for the development of specifi c courses is diffuse d throughout departments, programs, and individual faculty members . In 2014 and 2016 , the Office of Undergraduate Studies and ODI worked together to provide incentives for two cohorts of faculty to develop new courses to fulfill the cul tural competencies requirement in an effort to expand the number of courses offered to satisfy this requirement. They jointly offered seminars on the development of the courses with economic incentives to complete th e process \u2014from successfully developing a course to receiving approval to fulfill the c ultural competence requirement to offering the course and completing an evaluation once the course was completed. The program was short -lived, in part because the senior administrator who initiated the program left her position, and in part due to challenges related to the administration, funding and resources to support the program. For nonacademic units, we requested data on two key resources, space allocation and budget totals for fiscal year 2018 . For space allocation, the majority did not report on square footage. Exceptions include those who occupy a whole building, such as NYUM and the Center for Young Children (CYC). Other exceptions are more difficult to explain. When reported, s pace allocation does not appear to be generous and is frequently tight. Two examples of especially small allocations given the nature of the units are ODI and Academic Achievement Programs (AAP). Reports on budgets reveal that some units have significant resources derived primarily from outside the university . The most dramatic examples include the Center for International Development & Conflict Management (CIDCM) with about 97% of their budget from outside sources, the Maryland Population Research Center (MPRC) with about 93.5% from outside sources, and the Center for Minorities in Engineering (CMSE) with either 87.5% or 82% from outside depending on how one calculates additiona l support from their dean. These centers all received research funding and are located within colleges. Reports from nonacademic units, especially those with a broad EDI mission, have little or no funding from outside the university. Their budgets are typically sm all in relation to their functions. ODI has proposed an organizational plan to hire a development officer within our office to pursue external funding from donors, foundations, and other sources. The Nyumburu Cultural Center (part of ODI) has also proposed to hire a staff member with primary responsibilities for alumni relations and donor development, but at this time the search has not been approved. Conclusions UMD has many outstanding units focused on EDI, yet it is difficult to know who is doing what. The old adage seems applicable : \"The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. \" The formidable task of gathering data on EDI units speaks to the need for better information sharing. This issue is also evident in the other studies provided. We do not have a particularly 466 15 coherent approach nor are we very good about sharing information. From the Joint President/Senate Task Force Report: There is substanti al concern with the way the administration communicates with audiences and the tone it sets when hate/bias incidents occur on campus. Despite numerous administration efforts in recent years to address diversity and inclusion on campus, there is a lack of transparency in how the campus handles hate/bias incidents that gives the impression nothing has been done. Students, in particular, are frustrated that they hear about hate/bias incidents from outside sources before they receive information from the University. The University does not fully appreciate the import ance of social media when communicating information about incidents. There is a lack of coordination b etween campus units and no central source of information, making it difficult to find information on current diversity and inclusion programming and resources. The scattered locat ions of EDI units and the lack of any articulation of how units relate to the university's overarching EDI mission or goals indicate problems associated with decentralization, fragmentation, and silos. One can point to outstanding EDI units, but we are left wondering how or if they add up to any cohesive university vision. Their scattered nature indicates no consiste nt reporting or accountability. Until recently, ODI has provided mostly symbolic leadership for EDI efforts on campus, with limited funding and diminished capacity due to be short -staffed \u2014nevertheless, the commitment from President Loh to infuse new resources may help to elevate the level of the office beyond symbolism to a fully functional campus -wide division with the capacity to increase the scope and impact of EDI services , form collaborative partnerships through a net work of EDI units on campus, and provide a centralized location for the communication of EDI activi ties, event s, programs, and initiatives at UMD. With so little reporting on goals or objectives of programs, key indicators of success, and number of participants, it is impossible to begin assessing with any precision the collective value of these programs or units. We simply do not know the outcomes f or individuals who participate in most of these programs, or their collective impact in advancing EDI at UMD as a whole. EDI assets associated with specific research tend to be amply funded from outside sources. Assets with a broad EDI mission tend to have little to no outside sources of income and, given their mission, they are under resourced by the university. This breeds a competitive culture and can easily lead to a zero -sum game for adequate funding. 467 16 Works Cited Barnes, B. (1977, August 11). Speedup Ordered In Md. College Desegregation.

Loh University of Maryland 7901 Regents Dr. College Park, MD 20742 -6105 Dear President Loh, On behalf of the Diversity and Inclusion External Review Team, please find the final copy of the University of Maryland External Review of Diversity and Inclusion Report attached. It is based on our analysis of documents and interviews with key University stakeholders between April 25- 27, 2018. Our hope is that the report will be helpful to you and your leadership team as you forge new directions for diversity, equity and inclusion at the University. As requested, this document is being shared only with you and Senior Vice President and Provost Rankin for your decision regarding how it might be shared and used. As we concluded in the report, Provost Rankin, Assistant President and Chief of Staff Eastman, Interim Associate Provost Worthington, and members of their respective staffs were extremely helpful in preparing us in advance of the visit, and hosting us while on campus. Frankly, everyone we met provided personal and professional insights regarding the strengths and challenges of the campus that were valuable to our review. We came away from t he campus with a common belief that the community cares deeply about the University and that they welcome the opportunity to make it stronger in every way. We were especially pleased with our meeting with you. You provided additional context and informati on needed for us to consider the full scope of issues as we conducted our analysis. We also left with a strong sense of your commitment to this work and your analysis about how you thought the institution should proceed. Finally, each of us would like to thank you for the invitation to be part of the External Review Team. We collectively learned a great deal about the good diversity and inclusion work at the University of Maryland. The visit also provided organizational models for us to consider as we pursue our individual work. We wish you and the rest of the University of Maryland community all the best as you move forward.

The institutional members of these associations range fro m elite research universities to a wide range of two- and four -year colleges and universities that focus on the quality of the curriculum and student learning outcomes. This reveals the expansive reach of UMD. The University 's website offers the following self-description: The University of Maryland, College Park is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent public research universities. A global leader in research, entrepreneurship and innovation, the university is home to more than 40,000 students, 10,000 faculty and staff, and 352,000 alumni all dedicated to the pursuit of Fearless Ideas. Located just outside Washington, D.C., we discover and share new knowledge every day through our renowned research enterprise and programs in academics, the arts and athletics. And we are committed to social entrepreneurship as the nation's first \"Do Good\" campus. As one of the nation's premier higher education institutions and an academic innovator, UMD has a rich tradition of advancing diversity both in the academy and the larger society. This was affirmed in the 2010 strategic plan, Transforming Maryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity Inclusion. The document states: Our vision for the next decade is to become a model diverse community of learning, exploration, and self -examination whose impact is felt across the state and the region and throughout the nation and world. (pg. 6) Eight years later President Loh reaffirmed this goal in light of challenges being raised nationally about equity, diversity, and inclusion issues. These issues range from outreach and retention of the historically underserved and underrepresented; to growing incidents motivated by hate and bias ; to an unfortunate murder on campus. All of these factors contributed to President Loh creating the Joint President/Senate Inclusion and Respect Task Force (hereafter the Joint Task Force), which was charged with reviewing equity, diversity and inclusion concerns. It was specifically asked to: I. INTRODUCTION AND CAMPUS CONTEXT 475... consider our existing practices, and develop a comprehensive plan for initiatives on prevention and education, improving campus climate, responding to incidents motivated by hate and upholding the pillars of academic mission with legal guidelines. (pg. 1) In this statement President Loh underscores the importance of insuring consistent, ongoing and effective leadership for equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) efforts at the highest level. He announced in 2016 that he would be creating a cabinet level posi tion of Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion. The position is to provide collaborative leadership across campus units to develop, initiate, and coordinate EDI efforts related to the UMD's mission, and to advise the University. On July 6, 2017 Dr. Loh appointed Dr. Roger Worthington as Interim Associate Provost to lead this work and develop a plan for the proposed VP position and office structure. Among the plan elements were: a) a climate study (which was recently completed); b) enhancements in professional development; coordination of EDI efforts; enlistment of a team of national diversity thought leaders to explore research projects for the newly created diversity institute (October 2017); and c) invitation to an external review team to identify the strengths and challenges EDI efforts at UMD. Three nationally recognized individuals were identified by Dr. Worthington to serve as the External Review Team (ERT), Dr. Nancy \"Rusty\" Barcelo, Dr. William B. Harvey and Dr. Alma Clayton -Pedersen. The team members collectively have amassed more than one hundred years of experience in higher education, including holding positions as Chief Diversity Officers at four flagship research universities, vice -presidencies at two national higher education associations, and the presidency of a publicly funded college. At this point, UMD is responding to the rise of campus violence and hate speech nationally, which has prompted an expressed sense of vulnerability to attack on the campus. By undertaking this review, UMD is recommitting to its previously articulated goals of equity, diversity and inclusion as hallmarks of success and excellence. With the appointment of a Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion (VPDI) and the many efforts underway, UMD will be at a comparable level with its peer institutions. Efforts that are now in progress will contribute to reimagining EDI efforts at UMD and will serve as an important step toward healing from the recent acts of intolerance and violence. It was clear to the ERT that there remains much residue following the murder on campus of Lt. Collins last year. Although the 476interviews revealed a profound sense of optimism, there is also skepticism about whether proposed changes to restore a sense of safety will actually occur. As such, we are grateful to the scores of individuals who met with us to share information and perspectives to advance this very important work. We have reviewed all of the materials provided and had many conversations across the campus community. These observations provided a unique opportunity to conduct an in-depth analysis of the current and aspirational equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) work across the University. Consequently, we unanimously agree that UMD can address the challenges of inequity, prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion that have prevailed at UMD in new and innovative ways. As indicated in the various reports, the commitment and desire from the administration, faculty, staff and students that signal the possibility of UMD being uniquely poised to reclaim and advance beyond its previous position as a national higher education leader in EDI. Described below are the remaining four sections of the Report. The Review Process comprises Section II. It details: the steps undertaken to conduct the review, the questions intended to guide the review, the analysis of individual and group meetings, and the review of documents. Sections III and IV \u2014Observations and Recommendations respectively \u2014seek to describe our observations in six (6) areas and then link those to a set of overarching considerations for action in the Recommendations section. Our observations are all based on the readings and onsite interviews. The recommendations flow from those observations and our collective knowledge of effective and promising practices in EDI work. We provide in Section V Conclusions a brief summary and remarks. Our hope is that the review will complement the findings of the President/Senate Joint Inclusion and Respect Task Force Report (hereafter the Joint Task Force Report). We also hope that the report assists UMD in achieving its aspiration of being a n ational model of excellence in equity, diversity and inclusion as it strives to create a campus -wide environment that is rich in diversity, inclusive, and supportive of all of its members. We are impressed with the policies, programs, and the human and fiscal resources that are dedicated to achieving UMD's EDI goals. Yet, we also understand that complete realization can only be assessed accurately, despite good intentions, when the University moves forward to fully implement its strategies. We made reference to UMD's membership in a number of national higher education associations because we are convinced that UMD could recapture and advance its previous leadership role in equity, diversity and inclusion 477strategy and success by leveraging i ts membership in them. We are convinced that by using internal and external collaborative approaches to the institutional -level EDI work, UMD can accomplish its goal of national acclaim. By acting collaboratively within the campus and with outside others, UMD can address the national cynicism towards the nation's long history of attending ineffectively to differences among the people that have led to the current state of affairs. The racial/ethnic, immigrant, LGBTQ, and other historically underrepresented communities in higher education are increasingly being marginalized and attacked simply for being who they are. These realities underscore the urgency of the University's efforts to rethink and intensify its EDI efforts. The long history of cooperation and collaboration within the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) of the Big Ten Academic Alliance makes it especially relevant and poised to serve as a conduit for recommending collaborating with this entity. There is high potential to gain both stre ngth in numbers and the resources to advance the work in collaborating with this and other associations. And, that filling the cabinet - level position internally will create the synergy needed to make UMD a distinctive leader in EDI strategy and effectiveness. We elaborate on the leadership role that UMD can play to move the country in a more positive direction with strategic actions and supports in our recommendations. II. THE REVIEW PROCESS The external review was conducted from April 25 - 27, 2018. President Wallace Loh and Senior Vice President and Provost Mary Ann Rankin elaborated in their letter outlining the charge to the ERT. They requested that we assess the impact, effectiveness, coo rdination, structure, and organization of, and the resources for equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts across the University. The ERT focused its review on the broader integration and coordination of EDI work across multiple units and programs to determ ine their impact on the campus as a whole. We also reviewed the impact of other units' efforts on behalf of diversity, equity and inclusion. The ERT conducted interviews with a broad range of individual and group campus constituents. The agenda for the review is included as Appendix 1. Preparation for the task included reviewing the following reports: Inclusion and Respect at the University of Maryland; Preliminary Report of the Comprehensive Campus Climate Assessment for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion at the University of Maryland; 478 Equity , Diversity, & Inclusion at the University of Maryland Self Study Report; Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report 2016- 2017; Fulfilling Com mitments: A Structured Approach to the University of Maryland's Transition to a Division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion; and Transforming Maryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion. Additional materials, including budgets, policies and program level reports, were provided on -site. All of these materials were reviewed and considered by the ERT in writing this report. These materials assisted the team in formulating three basic questions to address the charge as outlined by the President and Provost that we believed would encompass the questions President Loh and Provost Rankin provided. The agenda established for the review team arranged for meetings - together and separately - with a broad range of individuals and groups that represented students, faculty, staff, deans, and senior administrators. The process generally adheres to the guidelines established by Senate document 00-01-134Z entitled Policy on the Review of Academic Units . The ERT was very impressed with the candor and honesty of all the individuals and groups with which we met. They expressed a belief that the external review was important in order to move forward while also building on the past. Outlined below is a brief description of the team's charge, a set of common questions asked during interviews, the materials reviewed prior to the visit and a brief description of their content. Additional materials received by the ERT while on campus are not listed. However, all documents received were reviewed and considered in the development and details of the observations, recommendations and conclusions offered in this report. External Review Charge and ERT Questions Provost Rankin presented the team with a total of eleven questions for consideration as part of charge for our review (see Appendix 2 for the full list of questions). From among these questions, there were three that were identified as priorities to address specifically. They included: 1. How can we optimize the equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts at UMD to have the greatest impact and effectiveness? 2. How does UMD compare to its peer institutions with respect to campus initiatives and programs to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion? 4793. What would it take to become a national model for [equity] diversity and inclusion? The ERT sought to provide a common set of questions for the individual and group meetings. Thus, whether we met separately or as a group with campus constituents, three (3) guiding questions were posed to the interviewees and listed below. 1. What are strengths and challenges with regard to equity, diversity and inclusion at UMD? 2. What do you see as the vision for Office of Diversity and Equity (ODI) 3. What would you like to change? Together the six (6) questions guided the interviews and the document review processes. While responses to the questions regarding strengths, challenges and vision varied from session to session, they provided an impor tant overarching framing for the team and the review. The ERT's questions also provided a general means to address many of the remaining eight (8) questions posed by the Provost. The insights gleaned from the materials and the respondents are interwoven throughout the Observations section of the report. Materials Reviewed The depth and breadth of the University's commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) is evidenced by the sheer number of initiatives, organizational structures and resources \u2014human, physical and fiscal\u2014 dedicated to the work of making excellence inclusive. These efforts are documented in the material provided for review. Especially important in this regard is the Transforming Maryland : Expectations for Excellence diversity plan . It offers guidance that is more thorough and detailed than seen in other institutions ' plans. Since 2010 it is has provided critical guidance to the campus in its quest to serve equitably the citizens of Maryland and beyond. Similarly, the Preliminary Report of the Comprehensive Campus Climate Study for Equity Diversity and Inclusion at UMD reveals that there is still work to be done to achieve the ideals articulated in Transforming Maryland. Although preliminary, this climate assessment alr eady pinpoints areas where there are wide disparities between groups in their campus experience. It offers insight into what needs to be better understood. The work ahead is to develop consensus about the means by which these disparities in constituents' campus experience are addressed and assessing if the actions taken make a difference over time. 480The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) at the University of Maryland : Self-Study Report offers: a historical analysis of the environment for EDI work at UMD; a comprehensive list and description of the work of the various Offices that are engaged in the EDI work; a review of diversity in the curriculum; a review of the implementation of Transforming Maryland plan mentioned above; and an ove rview of its self -study process. This document offers an up- close and realistic assessment of the accomplishments of EDI programs and the needs for the future. The Report on Diversity Assets at the University of Maryland (2017) not only offers description s of the programs and initiatives underway, but also key collaborators, and space allocations. Also, budget allocations for many entities were provided. This is among the most comprehensive reviews compiled into a single document of EDI assets of a major University that the team has seen. Its overview, entitled Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Social Justice Assets Map offers a visual representation of all the EDI work that makes it easy for the comm unity to recognize the enormity of UMD's commitment, but also the complexity of managing, assessing and communicating all of the work being done to the campus and larger communities. The 2 -page overview of the assets is included as Appendix 3. The team's list of pre -reading also included the Inclusion and Respect at the University of Maryland report authored by the Joint Task Force. It offers recommendations for a comprehensive diversity and inclusion initiative in nine areas and calls for the resources to enact their recommendations. Their recommendations are drawn from the Joint Task Force 's review of diversity -related initiatives, current practice, scholarly research, issues and concerns expressed by the community and their findings. The challenge of the existing structure of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) is outlined in Fulfilling Commitments : A Structured Approach to the University of Mary l an d's Transition to a Division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion . It offers five (5) recommendations including reorganizing the office into a division over a three -year period to achieve economies of scale and resources, and greater synergy across the many initiatives currently underway at the University. In addition to these documents, the ERT received several other pieces of information from leaders of various offices to further inform the Review process. The ERT appreciates the thoughtfulness of the various individuals and groups that participated in generating and gathering the information to help us 481obtain a truly comprehensive understanding of the equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) work at UMD. III. OBSER VATIONS UMD has long history of being viewed as a national model for diversity. The University has evolved significantly since its construction by slaves and adherence to racial segregation into the 20th century. With the coming of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the University, like others throughout the country, initiated efforts to diversify the institution. UMD soon became a national leader due to the strong leadership of the Presidents, three of whom have been people of color. To our knowledge, only one other predominately white, major research university in the nation can match this appointment record. A strong desire was expressed by many, starting with the President, to regain the University's national status as an EDI advocate as it works to enhance its efforts. We were pleased to learn that there is representation of individuals from broadly diverse backgrounds who have been at UMD during most of their careers, if not entirely, because of this rich history and commitment to diversity. While they expressed concerns, they believed the potential to do more compel them to remain at UMD and engage in the effort to do more. The team's Observations are framed within six (6) major topics that emerged consistently from our review of reports and interv iews. Specifically, the topics and themes include the following: 1. Communication and Transparency 2. Professional Development and Education 3. Collaboration and Coordination 4. Resources/Development \u2014Fiscal/Human/Physical 5. Accountability 6. Leadership It is important to note that several of these topics are consistent with the findings in the Joint Task Force Report. Consequently, we believe it is imperative to address them for purposes of building institutional capacity and sustainability, and to address the questions posed by the president and provost. 482 Communication and Transparency More effective communication and administrative transparency were consistent responses to our three guiding questions concerning strengths, challenges and vision. Comments focused primarily on what appears to be a lack of transparency regarding the status of unresolved issues. These issues included: a) the status of the search for the Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion (VPDI); b) efforts following the Lt. Collins murder; and c) decision - making strategies regarding the allocation and/or reduction of resources to address EDI issues. Interviewees shared concern that beyond the work of ODI, UMD's diversity efforts, in general, seem modest. Some unit employees expressed concern over the limited understandings of how their efforts might be influenced or incorporated with the appointment of a VPDI. Both academic and non- academic units tended to agree that they often are unaware of what other units are doing. As a consequence scheduling conflicts are created that negatively affect participation. There is a general consensus that restructuring EDI efforts would be a positive step toward enhancing communication. Following the murder of Lt. Collins, an atmosphere of uncertainty descended on the campus that seems to be evolving into suspicion regarding the administration's commitment to diversity. Part of this attitude reflects confusion regarding certain measures that have been suggested to memorialize Lt. Collins, measures that we understand take into account the wishes of the family. Frustration was also expressed that the previously announced selection of Dr. Worthington to the Vice President's position has not officially occurred. One student leader, when asked what the administration should know regarding the perspective of her peers on this matter, said that the delay was hampering efforts to move the University forward by not having a point person at the senior administrative level, and that if the President didn't follow through, \"How can we trust him?\" The issue was raised on several occasions regarding the need to clarify what is meant by the term \"diversity,\" or dismay that there is no standard for what we mean by diversity. For example, Asian Americans are not underrepresented in the sense of racial composition, yet they are still viewed in a racialized context that sometimes leads to micro aggressions. There was some sense that a point person and/or cultural center would help to address their needs. It was not clear from our conversations how the GLBTQ, women and disabilities communities are part of the current diversity mandate. All these groups recognized and appreciated the support of ODI, but that it needed to have more robust financial and staff resources. 483 Such uncertainties attributed to communication and/or transparency issues can further erode trust. Once lost, trust is difficult to regain especially when messages are inconsistent or not forthcoming in the face of stressful events. This is particularly relevant for communities that continue to suffer disparities from mistreatment, disrespect and outright hostility in the larger community and on campus. If left unresolved, this matter will likely affect the recruitment, retention and success not only of students, but of faculty and staff as well. There was near universal agreement among those interviewed about the need to enhance communication strategies designed to improve coordination and collaboration of EDI efforts. Such resources are critical to create the institutional capacity to sustain and evolve the work over time. The interviews also indicated, especially among the academic representatives, that it would be helpful in their planning processes to know who is doing EDI work. They also remarked that it would help maximize their resources if there was more collaboration with those most familiar with the work. They all shared the perspective that the decentralized model of UMD makes it imperative for communication to be a priority. These observations suggest that clear articulation of the EDI goals and the human resources assigned to achieve them must be clearly communicated to the community, both on and off -campus. Effective communication is critical to gaining broad engagement in articulating and achieving the goals that EDI efforts seek to accomplish. These human, fiscal, physical and knowledge resources support t he means to accomplish UMD's EDI goals. There also was recognition of the progress the institution has made on regarding diversity. Interviewees cited such examples as every search committee having diversity representation, new education and professional development efforts by Human Resources, and ADA services. Professional Development and Education There was wide- spread support for new professional development and education efforts for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Also expressed was a need for efforts to educate and prepare students for a diverse world, and to raise awareness among staff and faculty of the needs of diverse students and increase their knowledge of how they might be served. There was general agreement that there are good efforts in place for professional development and education. However, there also was concern that such efforts were not always consistent or sustainable, and that it was difficult to 484discern if there was a comprehensive and effective pr ofessional development plan to address issues from sexual misconduct to acts of racial intolerance. Collaboration and Coordination There was consensus among the individuals and groups that met with the team that the University operates in a highly decentralized manner. Yet, the Joint Task Force Report noted that: The University should work to achieve a balance between centralization and decentralization of equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts on our campus. Efforts to achieve equity, diversity, and inclusion are the responsibility of the entire campus. (pg. 26) Adoption of such a view by the entire campus requires both intentional collaboration and effective coordination. Establishing deep knowledge and operational collaborations across the various elements of the campus EDI work will likely have many positive community outcomes and very few negative ones. Some evidence of this is shown through the coordination efforts that already exist in the Diversity Officers' Network. However, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) Self -study report found a lack of articulation of how units relate to the University's overarching EDI mission and goals, and identifies a need for a coherent university vision. The ODI serves as a coordinating, catalytic unit for planning, action, and policy development across the campus, and also executes some specific responsibilities within the office. Clearly, one of the most notable aspects of the review was the sup port, and even gratitude, that was expressed for the leadership that has been shown by Dr. Roger Worthington during his short time as the Interim Associate Provost for Diversity and Inclusion. The university has devoted significant resources to the EDI wo rk. Yet, it has fallen short in the more difficult task of establishing coordination, collaboration and coherence across its efforts to achieve economies of scale. A well- considered development plan to establish innovative initiatives that focus on the element of coherence around this work will promote changes that enhance UMD's EDI efforts and increase revenues. A limited effort will continue to be what has referred to as \" islands of innovation with few bridges between them\" (Carol Schneider, President Emeritus AAC&U) . Resources Resource allocation and distribution can be complicated, and sometimes divisive, in any complex organization. This is particularly so when a new unit 485is being created or an existing unit is assigned additional responsibilities. The elevation of the Associate Provost for Diversity and Inclusion to a cabinet level position with the title of Vice President obliges a review of the human, financial and physical resources currently assigned to the unit to ensure that it can successfully carry out the additional duties that it will be executing. In the case of the new Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion (VPDI), the position should operate in a manner that the administrative engagement crosses the standard vertical sectors that other institutional Vice Presidents are most likely to operate. For example, the Vice President for Finance can focus his attention on fiscal matters and concerns; the Vice President for Student Affairs is able to focus her efforts and those of her staff on issues that affect student life and learning. The VPDI, on the other hand, will need to engage in horizontal administration, working across the existing administrative units and with the other Vice Presidents as they c arry out their assigned duties. At any given time, the VPDI might be working with the Provost on curricular expansion and reform; with the Vice President for Advancement on effective fund -raising strategies to support EDI initiatives; and with the Vice President for Student Affairs on creating diverse student - led discussion groups to improve the campus climate and address stereotypes that students may have brought with them from their respective communities. With these considerations in mind, the various funding proposals that have been generated for discussion and possible implementation can serve as starting points to reach an understanding of what is an appropriate and acceptable allocation of human, financial and physical resources for the VPDI as this person initiates the recently expanded position in the Fall of 2018. A plan for staffing and funding the ODI must also be approved that will reflect the further growth and refinement of responsibilities that will be incorporated in future years. Some examples might include: a) active participation in the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty and graduate students; b) creation of effective outreach programming to the Prince George's communities for recruiting and public relations purposes; and c) connections with prominent alumni from historically marginalized groups to assist with both national undergraduate recruitment, and potential expansion of the pool of financial contributors to the University. In the meeting with the review team, President Loh referred to the significant amounts of money that the University currently expends for a broad range of EDI activities, events, and services. These investments are 486commendabl e and reflect the serious commitment of the institution to achieving a more diverse and inclusive environment. However, because the responsibilities of the VPDI are vital to reaching and maintaining the level of excellence to which UMD aspires, appropriate and necessary resources must be provided and sustained whether they are new, reallocated, or raised from external grants. While there is always a limit to the availability of institutional resources, effectivel y and appropriately funding the ODI will likely facilitate a set of collaborative engagements across the campus. This will result in various other units actually needing fewer of their existing resource allocations to develop and promote diversity and equi ty initiatives within their areas of responsibility. Thus, the VPDI and the Office staff will be able to function better as catalytic agents. They could then use their expertise to encourage, facilitate, and support important initiatives that would benefit parts of the campus community in some cases and the entire campus in others. Thus, the opportunity for the ODI to maximize its impact and enhance the campus atmosphere has a direct relationship to the level that it is appropriately resourced. Additionally, seeking external grants to fund research on institutional- wide EDI efforts does not seem to be pursued similarly as other types of research. Yet, if the EDI work is considered similarly, success may generate the resources needed to build a more coherent and collaborative structure of support for the work. It will be prudent for the University to pursue such grants in ways consistent with other resource pursuits. This may be particularly appealing to funders at this particular point in time in the U.S. Throughout many of the discussions there was concern about limited resources to achieve goals. For example, there was concern that current program like DACA, African American Cultural Center, the GLBT Center and other areas were under staffed and funded to accomplish goals. In fact, several individuals mentioned that academic lines in ethnic study related programs were often lost. This seems to have negatively affected morale and contributed to distrust of the \"administration.\" Given that many institutions are struggling with these issues, there has been a move to partner with their alumni associations and Foundation offices to enhance development effort for increased scholarship opportunities, programmatic support, endowed profe ssorships, and diversity efforts to name a few. An outstanding example of this would be the University of Washington that has had a well -established development effort underway since 2005. 487Accountability In a highly decentralized institution such as UMCP, clear measures of accountability are likely to result in more efficient procedures and practices. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion is expected to shoulder the responsibility of providing leadership, vision, and direction to the University in all matters that relate to equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI). It must also exercise creativity and thoughtful consideration to help identify ways in which appropriate measures of accountability can be implemented across the institution. The discussions held by the review team with the Vice Presidents and Deans provided a high level of confidence that they are not simply prepared for, but are actually l ooking forward to collaborative interactions with the Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion that will result in effective actions within their own respective areas to enhance diversity and inclusion in measurable ways. A notable example can be seen i n the A. James Clark School of Engineering (SOE), where Dean Pines has been able to increase the diversity of both faculty and students through the use of timely and effective personalized outreach by him and other SOE representatives. This situation contrasts markedly with schools and colleges of engineering across the nation, where race and gender remain stubborn and serious constraints to increasing the diversity among both faculty and students. Dean Pines and his team have utilized a proactive recruitme nt approach that is complemented by feeder programs that use early identification of talent programs. These efforts identify and engage individuals who they believe can bring added value to the academic programs and the social environment within the School. The success of this approach bears repeating in other units as well. The VPDI will be positioned to assist other Deans in developing approaches that resonate within the particular nuances of their own student and faculty populations. The reality of academic environments is that some parts of the institution are more change -averse than others. Where circumstances exist within the institution that indicate covert opposition to EDI efforts, they are stumbling blocks to making progress and they must be addressed. It may prove necessary to incentivize a reversal of these efforts, and support from the highest levels of the administration of the VPDI efforts to interface with each unit to create p lans and actions that can move the University forward and succeed in achieving stated institutional goals. Different tactics may be necessary to recognize and honor the broad range of options for success across academic and administrative areas within the university. Pragmatism notwithstanding, each unit must ultimately be held to an established, predetermined measure of success in reaching goals that correlate with the 488larger vision of institutional success. This ultimate reality cannot be compromised when it comes to EDI matters, any more than it would be in matters related to academic quality or fiscal growth and integrity. Institutional accountability is usually considered to be vested in the administrative and faculty ranks. UMD, like its peers, also expect students to develop cultural competence, as it is articulated by the University, and to actually demonstrate it in their campus and subsequent work interactions. The University could convey to its students that it is also their indivi dual and collective, moral and ethical actions that will determine its actual commitment to reaching the goal of equity for all members of the community. Led by the VPDI, and joined by all other relevant administrative and faculty leaders, the university could challenge students to be intentional and proactive in considering ways that UMD could become more inclusive and respectful in its treatment of all members of the community. The university could also distinguish its elf among the colleges and universities nationally by encouraging the students to hold faculty and administrators to the same high standard of behavior and interaction. One could conceive of a role that would be played by the VPDI in creating a 21st centu ry conception of individual and institutional accountability at UMD. A conception that combines a sense of shared responsibility with mutual insistence on effective outcomes. A national model of intentional, concerted action is desperately needed in the higher education arena; a model that would bring an end to student demonstrations that are fueled by their frustration over differential treatment. In turn, these are often met by half- hearted institutional acquiescence on the least significant measures, resulting in a period of relative calm before the students begin the next round of demonstrations. UMD has an opportunity to be that national model, and the tragic situation of Lt. Collins' death is one factor that might have unexpectedly propelled it into that position. Accountability is demonstrated through structures that lay out how the EDI work is done and provides motivation to engage in the work effectively. These are needed to avoid the fits and starts that often occur. When individuals or units ar e separately held accountable, no one is held accountable for the overall institutional impact of the work. Like student recruitment and admissions, if the enrollment target is not met it has ramifications for the whole institution. In EDI work, when goals are not met the campus climate for all suffers\u2014either directly or indirectly. Clear and consistent direction and accountability is needed to address the rising polarization of the nation's citizenry, and to address the legacies of past discrimination and other injustices. 489Leadership It became clear to the ERT following a review of the documents, and interviews with individuals and groups, that the need for broader leadership on behalf of EDI was essential. There was a general sense that there needed to be strong leadership from the \"top .\" There were specific references to the President in terms of there being a clear vision of the goals and how EDI can best be achieved. It was not clear that there is a general understanding and/or appreciation that President Loh and Provost Rankin have taken multiple steps to address growing acts of intolerance, a campus tragedy, and more during the past year. Specifically, President Loh has made it clear that he is committed to creating a senior level cabinet position Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion to provide leadership and oversight of EDI efforts at UMD. This led to the appointment of Roger Worthi ngton as the Interim Associate Provost for Diversity and Inclusion to assist in the development of the position, enhance the services of ODI, address campus climate, and more. In addition, President Loh with the Joint Task Force with the specific purpose, to: ... review these concerns, consider our existing practices, and develop a comprehensive plan for initiatives on prevention and education, improving campus climate, responding to incidents motivated by hate, and upholding the pillars of our academic mission within legal guidelines. (Transmittal Issues Summary) The report was recently approved by the Senate and accepted by the president. It could well become the launching pad for a comprehensive approach to EDI that would engage the entire University. While many believed this to be a positive step there was still concern as to whether or not these efforts would actually come into fruition. The second level of leadership focused on the overall nee d to have a VPDI. In fact, there was general appreciation that the president was creating such a position with some reservation given that the initial search was postponed. Most individuals agreed that such a leadership positon would serve to enhance collaboration and coordination within a decentralized model. While there was agreement for the position there was also concern that the position/office would centralize diversity efforts. There were also some who questioned why Roger Worthington was not immedia tely appointed to the position as interim to move forward in a more timely way. Many acknowledged that EDI under Dr. Worthington' s leadership had accomplished much during a very short time span from the climate study, to professional development and education efforts, to brining groups together. 490 Our observations are consistent with many of those found in the Joint Task Force Report summary section entitled \"What we heard from the campus community \" (pgs. 3 - 4) and listed below. That Report's clarity of needs, and subsequent means of addressing them, offers corroboration that underscores the areas of observations that the ERT has presented above. Their Report indicates: Despite numerous administration efforts in recent years to address diversity and inclusion on campus, there is a lack of transparency in how the campus handles hate/bias incidents that gives the impression nothing is being done. [ Communication and Transparency] Diversity programming is not comprehensive and does not have a broad overarching vision.[Accountability ] There is a lack of coordination between campus units and no central source of information, making it difficult to find information on current diversity and inclusion programming and resources. [ Collaboration and Coordination ] Substantial concern with the way the administration communicates with audiences and the tone it sets when hate/bias incidents occur on campus. [ Communication and Transparency] IV. RECOMMENDATIONS The Observations section above sought to highlight the University's challenges and compare them with the larger high education context related to equity, diversity and inclusion. We use the themes reported in our observations as a template for the structure of the Recommendations offered below. These recommendations provide specific actions that can be taken to address the observations given above. These are addressed in the following order. 1. Communication and Transparency 2. Professional Development and Education 3. Collaboration and Coordination 4. Resources/Development \u2014Fiscal/Human/Physical 5. Accountability 6. Leadership 491Although these categorizations have some overlap, we present them discreetly so that the UMD community can link the ERT's observations with the recommendations offered. As with our observations, our recommendations support those of the Joint Task Force Report. Listed below are some of the specific recommendations in that report that align with areas covered in our recommendations. By linking these two reports the campus will be better able to envision ways to address the observations and recommendations offered in these Reports and others. Use the ODI website as a centr al resource for information about diversity -related programming, events, policies, data, climate reports, and reporting processes, as well as resources related to free speech, expression and demonstrations on campus. [Communication and Transparency ] Develop a strategy for communicating information related to equity, diversity, and inclusion that is transparent, timely, and responsive to the concerns raised by the campus community. [ Communication and Transparency] The University should develop a comprehensive prevention and education initiative on diversity, inclusion, and respect that involves all members of the campus community (faculty, staff, and students). The initiative should include a broad vision for diversity programs for the University and sh ould be overseen by ODI. [Professional Development and Education; Accountability; Leadership ] ODI should: consider developing a diversity -related suite of training options for faculty and staff in partnership with UHR, OFA, and TLTC using existing trainings as a way to develop a more robust program; [ Professional Development and Education] continue to develop and deliver programming as part of the University's comprehensive prevention and education initiative; [Professional Developmen t and Education] work collaboratively with representatives from existing University diversity programs in the development and delivery of the comprehensive prevention and education initiative. [Coordination and Collaboration; Professional Development and Education ] President/Senate Joint Task Force Report (pg. 25-26) 492Communication and Transparency Suspicion of ill will diminishes when the institution effectively communicates what it is doing regarding EDI issues both on and off campus. The R eport on Diversity Assets at UMD identifies more than 100 large and small, ongoing efforts supported by the University. The extent to which the communities served by the University are informed of these efforts directly affects their perception that EDI efforts are insufficient. The team recommends that that a communication plan be developed to address the prevailing notion that individuals and groups feel uniformed about the status, direction and issues pertaining to EDI efforts and incidents. It is important that such a plan align with the EDI vision and goals of the institution. There is also a need to identify internal and external stakeholders who will serve as liaisons to the various constituents to keep them regularly informed about EDI efforts. This will keep the community informed, and also serve to galvanize their support for efforts such as fund raising for diversity initiatives and research on the practices. Such a plan would be an important step towards: enhancing coordination and collaboration on future diversity initiatives; minimizing rumors and innuendos that are often the seeds of mistrust; and negating comments that institution is not being transparent. The plan should be inclusive of the many forms of communication from traditional media methods to websites, social media, symposia and regular campus discussions on EDI issues, to name just a few. Effective marketing strategies are also important tools to position new directions and goals for diversity, equity and inclusion work. Examples include supporting and promoting the work of scholars who are doing important research that may aid in developing national policy, and programs like Latino, Asian and African American and Women's Studies. Most importantly, a communications plan could provide consistency of messages and provide a balance between acts of intolerance and successes. At the core of the plan should also be ongoing face-to-face discussions with students, faculty and staff with appropr iate campus offices and staff engaged and robustly assessing program impact. Transparency was closely tied to communication that often focused on not knowing or understanding the processes and procedures related to decision - making. The mechanisms by whic h mission and goals for diversity are established and implemented were also viewed as ambiguous. Increasing the campus community 's knowledge and clarity about earnest efforts to address EDI challenges will likely reduce skepticism and mistrust. 493 Professional Development and Education The interest in professional development and education is an explicit recognition of the need to uncover additional effective methods for educating the community, to address acts of intolerance, and to address effectively issues related to EDI. The ERT recommends that a Professional Development and Education Plan be developed by ODI in collaboration with academic diversity liaisons and Student Affair s representatives. This would provide a comprehensive and sustainable approach for identifying priorities and initiating efforts where there are gaps as well as encouraging collaboration and coordination between the various units. The ODI Self -Study spoke to the importance of professional development efforts as did their colleagues throughout the campus. There was universal agreement that there needed to go beyond Implicit Bias to focusing such as issues from freedom of speech to inclusive teaching practice s. On the academic side, the University should consider developing university - wide, as well as college -focused, academic programming that examines important racial and cultural concerns, with a goal of generating innovative approaches, rather than simply reiterating the problem. For example, \"Contemplating Racia l and Ethnic Perspectives regarding the 2020 Presidential Election\" might be a University sponsored symposium, while the College of Business might develop a program that examines the wealth differential among different racial groups, or the College of Education could analyze the causes of the achievement gap. For students, the campus might initiate a \"common readings\" program for freshman students in both the Fall and Spring semesters in which they discuss pertinent materials that address significant racial, ethnic, and cultural issues. These sessions should be structured so as many as possible take place in the residence halls and led by student development professiona ls as well as faculty from various disciplines depending on the reading topic. Such a program would provide a smaller, yet similar experience to UMD 's successful Living -Learning Program and would broaden student access and expose all new students to living -learning experiences. For the local community, the University might take full advantage of being located in the most affluent African American county in the United States, which presents countless oppor tunities for joint student- faculty research projects on a wide variety of topics. 494Collaboration and Coordination The ERT recommends that A President 's Diversity Council be appointed, and chaired by the VPDI, to provide oversight of and feedback about EDI efforts. The Council should be representative of functional and academic areas of the University. The Council migh t use the many reports generated to guide their work, but especially the Report on Diversity Assets at UMD Report and its Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Social Justice Assets Map (given here as Appendix 3). These provide critical pieces of information to identify means of collaborations and coordination across the units. The Council should advise the appointed VPDI by making recommendations about ways to: a) create synergies across these the asse ts, b) maximize the resources, and c) provide input about means of assessing the effectiveness and outcomes of the many EDI efforts. This Council 's work could include the development of a clear institutional vision of EDI work with goals, objectives, prio rities, resources, and assessment mechanisms. Council members should be expected to provide regular updates to their respective areas to enhance communication and transparency. Council members should also consider bringing their unit EDI issues to the Council for discussion. In this way EDI challenges are shared and leaders can obtain broader perspectives on their specific challenges and explore potential means of addressing them. Resources The University has devoted significant resources to the EDI work, but there is a need to develop a plan with funding goals and objections that would contribute to collaborative efforts and coherence. A well-defined development plan can initiate changes tha t will enhance UMD's EDI efforts while simultaneously enhancing revenues. It will be prudent for the University to consider this work in ways consistent with other resource pursuits, particularly at this point in time in the United States. In addition, re source development strategies could complement state and grant revenue streams. Currently, seeking and acquiring grants for EDI work does not seem to be on par with other types of development activities. Yet, if considered similarly such endeavors could generate some of the resources needed to build a more coherent and collaborative structure of support for the work. It will be reasonable for the University to consider this work in ways consistent with other re source pursuits, particularly at this point in time in the U.S. when many well -resourced Foundations and business entities are concerned about how the nation addresses the challenges of its broadly diverse citizenry. 495 The institution is reimagining the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) from its goals, resources and scope to the responsibilities of the newly created Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion The team recommends that the office be provided human resources either explici tly assigned from the Development office, or located specifically in ODI, to focus on EDI work. The person(s) would focus is on alumni development, planning and raising funds from private and public sources (foundations, organizations, individuals as well as State and Federal agencies) specifically for EDI work institution -wide. It would be especially important for the development officer(s) to work closely with the University Alumni Offices to collaborate on strategies if it is not located in ODI. To be successful, this effort should be viewed as a complement, rather than a replacement, to institutional advancement efforts. All units that undertake EDI work could be supported in efforts to advance EDI innovations not funded by the University under suc h an institutional- level umbrella. For example, the GLBT Center, Schools and Colleges, and administrative units could work together with ODI to develop strong proposals that if pursued alone may not be funded; but a comprehensive approach is more likely to be reviewed favorably. This would also place the VP position on par with other leaders of institutional level work. More importantly, the new VP and the ODI work would attain a level of legitimacy as integral elements of the University's overall success. The responsibility for external development work should be incorporated into the VPDI position description along with appropriate resources to be successful. The appointed development officer(s) should be able to focus on and be successful in identifying and supporting the acquisition of funding for broad range of EDI efforts. Those efforts might range from endowed chairs to scholarships, from faculty professional development to EDI course development, from difficult dialogues to internships focused on diversity in non-profit or for profit entities. Accountability It is recommended that a University -wide Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Council is established, chaired by VPDI to advise, monitor progress and provide recommendations about campus equity diversity and inclusion efforts. As such, this Council should be representative of the university and include individuals with the authority to take recommended actions to implementation, evaluation and revision when needed. Appoint subcommittee of the Council to explore and develop accountability measures. Also, the institution should consider budget allocation as an 496accountability measure as well as explore other factors such as climate studies. The Transforming Maryland Diversity Plan could be used as to guide the Council regarding the development of the 2020 - 2030 Diversity Plan. The Council's efficiency and effectiveness is not a given. However, effective leadership provided by the VPDI and a powerful plan will give UMD a much needed collaboration and coordination guide to managing and monitoring the large number of existing and future EDI efforts. For example, the Council might engage Dean Pines of the School of Engineering to understand how best to establish, support, and assess an institutional process that actively recruits nationally recognized scholars from diverse backgrounds in each of the colleges. This would then move towards the formulation of a critical mass of tenure d academicians who could: provide support to one another and mentoring for junior faculty from underserved communities; support for student research in nontraditional areas; and outreach to local communities that are heavily populated by underrepresented groups. When successful, such practices might become an institution -wide effort by providing an effective standard operating procedure by which all hiring officials may be held accountable for implementing. This does not suggest that such actions would restrict who will be hired. Rather it would provide a set of guidelines that would ensure that hiring officials are held accountable for having done their best to ensure that all hiring processes are truly open . The goal is to address implicit biases that are common across search processes, and to broadly diversify candidate pools when hiring and promoting the staff, faculty and administrative workforce. Leadership There were very positive comments among those we spoke with about the importance of ODI and all that it has accomplished with limited resources in less than a year under the leadership of Roger Worthington. This was an area that many felt the President had made the appropriate decision to appoint Roger as the Interim Associate Provost with the understanding he would be the VPDI. None knew how the office could support their efforts and needs with what they perceived as a lack of staff and monetary support. The University leaders should consider and determine the leadership needed for the EDI work in ways similar to decisions about other cabinet level leaders. Senior leaders have a coherent set of goals and responsibilities, as well as specific expected outco mes, including robust assessments to ensure 497the goals are achieved. These are adjusted based on previous experience on campus and in previous work. The rationale for a similar role for the University's EDI work is similar in that the leader must comprehensively review of all the work, set expectations for various components elements of the work, and support the work of others to achieve identified goals. The leader must have an adequate set of clearly articulated goals, and appropriate resources, authority, and accountability to achieve the goals. As a nationally recognized scholar on diversity in higher education and a former CDO at the University of Missouri, Dr. Worthington has deep expertise as both a scholar and practitioner in this arena. It was clear that he has put his knowledge and experience to good use at UMD in working to bring greater coherence across all of the EDI work, and to achieve synergies and efficiencies through col laboration in requesting an external review. This is also evidenced by working across units outside of the official sphere of his responsibilities, arranging for the systematic compilation of Diversity Assets at UMD Report, and developing plans for interse ctional work with any unit that is doing EDI work. This is the kind of work that seems to be needed to address many of the issues uncovered in the various reports we reviewed. The equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts at the University can be optimized to have the greatest impact and effectiveness by the appointment of Dr. Roger Worthington to VPDI prior to the beginning of the Fall 2018 semester. This appointment should come with the appropriate allocation of resources that will allow the unit to provide leadership, coordination, and collaboration to the many existing programs and activities, and to create new initiatives. There are several reasons why we reached this conclusion. These actions would accomplish a number of UMD objectives including to achieve the following. a) Reaffirm the commitment of President Loh to place the University at the forefront of American universities addressing equity, diversity, inclusion substantively, and equity issues as fundamental academ ic and social concerns. Through this action, the President also would buttress his personal national leadership and reputation in these areas. b) Reestablish trust between student leaders and the administration, which at this time appears to be very fragile. c) Communicate to the President's cabinet a sense of continuity and acknowledgement that outstanding administrative performance is valued. d) Communicate to the academic and administrative leaders that they will continue to have support and partnership as they innovate, initiate and implement EDI initiatives within their units. 498e) Communicate to the faculty that the VPDI position is one in which a high level of scholarly achievement is expected in addition to substantial experience in and familiarity with academic concerns. f) Communicate to alumni that a page has been turned and that the tragedy of Lt. Collins death does not pervade the institutional atmosphere. g) Demonstrate President Loh's intent to implement the recommendations made by the Joint Task Force. h) Demonstrate President Loh's awareness of and responsiveness to the wishes and concerns of a variety of groups and individuals with whom we interacted ranging from the University police, to the college and division diversity officers. i) Provide continuity. We also provide the following general recommendations for consideration. Each is related to one or more of the themes that frame this Report. General Recommendations Develop a robust feeder program in conjunction with the school systems in Prince Georges, Baltimore and Montgomery counties to identify, encourage and support students from underrepresented groups as they are moving through the K- 12 systems. This would be an important future enrollments and staffing pipeline for UMD. Establish, support, and assess an institutional process to actively recruit nationally recognized scholars from diverse backgrounds at the senior level who could provide support to other faculty and mentoring for junior faculty from underserved communities, support for student research in nontraditional areas, and outreach to local communities that are heavily populated by underrepresented groups. A group of new scholars could infuse innovative thinking and programs like a \"common readings\" program for freshman students in both the Fall and Spring semesters in which they discuss pertinent materials that address significant racial, ethnic, and cultural issues that would engage the entire campus community. The University should engage the most affluent African American county in the United States, to explore joint student -faculty research projects on a wide variety of topics. Also, explore a feeder program with the school systems in Prince Georges, Baltimore and Montgomery counties to identify, encourage and support students from underrepresented groups as they are moving through the K-12 systems. 499V. CONCLUDING REMARKS The ERT members were particularly impressed by our conversation with President Loh when he shared his vision of diversity and inclusion at the University. We appreciated his commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as a measure of excellence, and his understanding of their relationship to the academic mission of UMD. His experiences as a person of color have afforded him personal insights about the presence of racism in the American academy. Projecting a sense of engagement in this area that was both humanistic and pragmatic, made it clear that President Loh has the capacity and desire to take UMD to new heights \u2014to be an institution that demonstrates how diversity functions as a key element in achieving excellence that could serve as a national model. The External Review Team is truly grateful to the scores of people who took the time to meet with us and provide their insights. We believe they are committed and interested in working on behalf of equity, diversity and inclusion at UMD. It was clear that they care about establishing a campus climate that provides a place where all can thrive and succeed as students, faculty and staff. We also want to thank Provost Rankin for inviting, hosting and enabling us to undertake this important work, and her staff for supporting us while on campus. We also thank Dr. Worthington and his staff for recommending us to be part of this important endeavor. A special thank you to the staff of ODI who worked with us to make sure we were properly prepared from travel plans to insuring we had the documents necessary for the review. We leave with hope and confidence that the University of Maryland is moving forward in new and innovative ways. 500001 External Review April 25-27, 2018 MASTER Sche.dule 5:30 PM DINNER External Review Team (Bill Harvey, Alma Clayton- Pedersen, Rusty Barce lo), Mary Ann Ranki n,Miche le Eastman and Roger Worth ington Breakout Meetings 8:15- 9 a.m. Bill Harvey, Rusty Barcelo, UMPD Meeting Police Chief Mitchell and Chief of Staff David Lloyd, Old Maryland Grill 8:45- 9:15 a.m. Alma Clayton - Pedersen ,OCRSM Meeti ng Catherine Carroll, Director and Title IX Officer, Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, 1402 MMH 9:15 - 10 a.m. Bill Harvey, Student Leaders, Stamp Union, Calvert 2100 The following list of students have been invited, but not all have confirmed attendance: Chris Henderson Naila M Al Hasan lshaan a.m. Alma Clayton- Pedersen ,Advance Meeting Kerry Ann O'Meara, Professor, Higher Education and Associate Dean, EDUC 1402 MMH 501 9:30- 10:15 a.m. 10:15 -11a.m. 10:30- 11:15 a.m. Rusty Barcelo, ,Acting Director, 2218 MMH Alma Clayton- Pedersen, OMSE Site Visit Christopher Lester, Director Shaunna Payne Gold, Associate Director 1101 Hornbake Library Bill Harvey, BFSA & Nyumburu Site Visit Solomon Comi ssiong,Assistant Director of Student Involvement and Public Relat ions, Nyumburu Cultural Center Brandon Dula, Vice President of the Black Faculty Staff Association Ronald Zeigler, Director, Nyumburu Cultural Center Anne Reese Carswell, Associate Director, Nyumburu Cultural Center Nyumburu Cultural Center, 4108 Campus Drive Rusty Barcelo, Resident Life Meeting Denni s Passarella -George, Associ ate Director South Campus Steve Petkas, Associate Director, Student and Staff Development 2411MMH 11:15 a.m. -12:15 p.m. Alma Clayton- Pedersen ,MICA Site Visi t James McShay, Associate Director for the Adele H.

We recognize a div erse educational community as one of our greatest strengths . I am proud to be continuing in the tradition of recent University of Maryland presidents who led us to outstanding accomplishments in this area, including Robert Gluckstern, John Slaughter, William Kirwan and C . D . Mote, Jr . Under their leadership, the university embraced a vigorous commitment to becoming a multiethnic, multiracial, and multicultural institution . The diversity plan presented here, Transfor ming Maryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion, is aligned with the university's strategic plan, which represents the aspirations of our community and calls for the University of Maryland to renew its efforts in diversity . The strategic plan articulates three principles for which we must strive as a pr eeminent research university: impact, leadership, and excellence . The diversity of our faculty, staff, and students is a fundamental component of each of those principles . Our 10-year diversity plan is visionary, inspirational, and inclusiv e, and calls on our university to serve as a leader for the next generation of scholars . It clearly sets forth our aspiration and our determination to become a model diverse community of learning, exploration, and self-examination whose impact will be felt acr oss the state of Maryland and the nation . I embrace the vision outlined in this document and ask that you read, review , and commit to implementing its strategies and goals . Wallace D . Loh President 5133 prefacefrom the Chair, Diversity Plan Steering Committee The strategic plan for diversity at the University of Maryland, Transforming Maryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion, is a document that represents the remarkable journey of the University of Maryland, College Park . The first 100 years in the history of the university r eflect the challenges of our state and the nation . Many were ex cluded from obtaining an education and working here, and the curriculum made invisible the contributions of many in our society . Howev er, the past 50 years at Maryland have been extraordinary, first as we integrated all populations into the student body, faculty, and staff, and then as we eagerly embraced the idea of diversity, transforming the institution into a national leader in this area . Today we ar e well on the path toward realizing our vision of being a \"model multiracial, multicultural, and multigenerational academic community .\" I am tremendously grateful to the members of the Diversity Plan S teering Committee for their hard work, diligence, and dedication to developing this plan over an 18-month period . I would also like to thank the hundreds of University of M aryland community members who attended town hall meetings and listening sessions and submitted comments on the plan . The suggestions offered improv ed the document and expanded ownership of the notion of diversity beyond any single community . I would also like to thank the University Senate and univ ersity leadership for endorsing and embracing the document . Those of us who worked together to develop the plan believe that Mar yland is poised to become the university model for diversity and inclusive excellence in the nation . We have dev eloped a 10-year document that lays a comprehensive roadmap for meeting this goal and calls on the University of Maryland to serve in a preeminent leadership role for the next generation of scholars . Robert Waters Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs and Assistant to the President Chair, Diversity Plan Steering Committee 5144 the university of maryland i. The University of Maryland's Commitment t o Diversity \u00bb 5155 commitment to diversityThe University of Maryland, the flagship of the University System of Maryland and one of the nation's top research universities, has long embraced diversity as a core value and counts a diverse educational community among its great strengths . Our commitment to diversity rests on thr ee tenets: 1 . We believe that living and working in a community that accepts and celebrates diversity is a jo y and a privilege that contributes to the vitality and excellence of the educational experience . 2 . We believe that as a state university, w e have a responsibility to assure all citizens access to the transformative experience of an outstanding higher education and the opportunity for success in this experience . 3 . We believe it is essential that our students have exposure to differ ent perspectives, that they interact with people from different backgrounds, and that they explore ideas with those from different cultures in order to succeed in an increasingly diverse workplace and global community . 5166 the university of maryland In short, creating an educational and work environment that is rich in diversity, inclusive, and supportive of all students, faculty, and staff is morally right and educationally sound . We commit ourselves fully to implementing the strategies set for th in this plan to achieve an optimal environment for all members of the university community . The university strategic plan of 2008, Tr ansforming Maryland: Higher Expectations, clearly states the results we strive for as a preeminent university: impact, leadership, and excellence . We know without doubt that the div ersity of our university faculty, staff, and students is a cornerstone of that excellence . This diversity plan is aligned with the goals of the university strategic plan . It calls for the university to energetically rene w its efforts in diversity . The results will be transformative . The strategic plan states the mission of the university with eloquence: \"As the flagship, its task is to look o ver the horizon, attract the most brilliant minds, advance the frontiers of knowledge, stimulate innovation and creativity, and educate those who will be leaders in business, public service, education, the arts, and many other fields .\" To succeed in this task we must have a community that ackno wledges and celebrates diversity in all its dimensions . Through the goals and strategies outlined in this plan, we intend to secure and maintain a wor king and learning environment in which all members of our community are welcomed and can flourish regardless of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, personal appearance, age, national origin, political affiliation, or hidden or visible disabilities . We are confident that we can meet the goals outlined in this document because the univ ersity has special strengths on which it can build: 1) a history of national leadership in diversity initiatives during the past three decades; 2) a substantial record of scholarship on diversity issues across the disciplines; 3) a location that offers opportunities to engage with a wealth of diverse communities, including large African American, Hispanic American/Latino/a, and Asian American populations, and thanks to the proximity of the federal government agencies and offices, a substantial international population; and 4) a conviction that a university community energized by diverse perspectives and experiences provides an enriching educational experience and strong competitive edge for our students, our faculty, and our state . We are uniquely positioned to influence the world outside the university based on the contributions and r esearch of our faculty, students, and staff . Our vision for the next decade is to become a model diverse community of learning, exploration, and self-examination whose impact is felt across the state and the r egion and throughout the nation and world . 5177 section name : section sub-head overview and background ii. The University's Transformation into a Leade r in Diversity \u00bb 5188 the university of maryland University of Maryland Leaders Embrace Diversity The university undertakes this new diversity plan after three decades of successful initiatives that focus on diversity issues . We are confident in the university 's ability to meet new challenges in creating the community of the future . After an early history in which the university engaged in deplorable practices of discrimination and held destructiv e prejudices against women, we now have a keen appreciation of the moral imperative of equity and diversity . We know that at the time of its founding in 1856, 16 of the first 24 tr ustees of the Maryland Agricultural College were slave owners and that slaves labored, if not on campus, certainly throughout Prince George's County, in which it was built . White women were first admitted in 1916, and African Americans in 1951 . Though slower than we would wish in including all citiz ens and creating an appropriate climate for their success, in the past decades the university eagerly adopted the ideal of diversity and has worked diligently to transform the campus to become a national leader in this area . The University of Mar yland's strategies were among those highlighted in the Diversity Blueprint: A Planning Manual for Colleges and Universities, published with the American Association for Colleges and Universities (aac&u) in 1995 . Today we are on the path to ward realizing our vision of being a \"model multiracial, multicultural, and multigenerational academic community .\" We have been guided by many dedicated members of the campus community in this transformation, especially thr ee exceptional leaders: Dr . John Slaughter, chancellor Dr Jr ., president, 1998-2010 . Under their leadership, the university embraced a commitment to diversity with unwavering vigor . The journey toward a div erse and inclusive institution began with race and gender, but the imperative to address other identities became apparent as we undertook various initiatives . Indeed our terminology that today favors the wor d \"diversity\" evolved from a growing understanding of the complexity of this work . During his tenure as chancellor of the University of M aryland, Dr . Slaughter, one of the first African American chancellors of a major state university , challenged the campus to become a \"model multiracial, multicultural, and multigenerational academic community .\" Under Dr . Slaughter's leadership , the university moved from being an institution focused merely on compliance with equity mandates, to an academic community that addressed diversity pro actively . Under the leadership of his successor, Pr esident Kirwan, the university made giant strides in its commitment to equity and inclusion for minorities . His administration supported major initiatives designed to inv olve every campus unit and department in activities that supported minority faculty, staff, and students . University leaders raised expectations for recr uitment of faculty, undergraduates, and graduate students from under represented groups; developed major initiatives to support and mentor minority members on our campus; and provided significant financial support for activities likely to increase the success of minority members of the university community . From 1990 through 1995, P resident Kirwan led the university's defense of a legal challenge to the university's Banneker scholarship, a program designed to enroll academically talented African American students . While the court eventually r uled against the race-exclusive nature of the scholarship, the university's defense of the case was a first step in developing the now-widespread use of the diversity rationale to advance affirmative action goals in higher education . President Mote built on these effor ts, deepened our understanding of the complexities of diverse backgrounds and identities, and expanded the focus of our commitment . He sponsored innov ative and successful programs that reached into Maryland communities with large numbers of disadvantaged students, and created pipelines for students who had overcome adverse circumstances to obtain an affordable college education . In the past decade, the university significantly increased the graduation rates of undergraduates fr om all racial/ethnic backgrounds, and made substantial progress in closing the achievement gap . In recognition of the university 's growing global impact, President Mote also vigorously supported programs that offer students life-changing international experiences . Led by the former president, the administration pushed aggressiv ely to promote the rights of gays, lesbians, and women and fought to obtain benefits for domestic partners of university employees . The state began providing same-sex domestic partner health benefits to M aryland state employees and retirees in July 2009 . Under President M ote's leadership, the university also introduced new family-friendly policies and programs to help faculty, staff, and students balance their academic, work, and family responsibilities . 5199 Diversity and inclusiveness have, over time, become integral and ongoing components of the university's institutional identity . A quantitative sketch of our successes indicates how far the Univ ersity of Maryland has progressed in recent decades . The diversit y of our students: Students of color comprise 34% of the undergraduate student body . African American students constitute 12% of our undergraduates . Asian American students comprise 15% of Maryland' s undergraduates . The Hispanic American/Latino/a student population increased 29% at the undergraduate level and 58% at the graduate level from 2001 to 2009 . The percentage of new minority graduate students increased from 16% in 2001 to 21% in 2009. The succes s of our students: The University of Maryland is one of the top degree- granting institutions for African American and other minority students in the United States . In 2009, our campus was rated No . 1 among aau institutions for the number of African American Ph .D .s . In a 2010 study by the Education Trust, the university had the fourth-highest ranking for 2007 graduation rates of minorities among public research universities . In the same study, the university was ranked 14th in improved graduation rates for minority students (2002-07) . Six-year graduation rates for African American students have increased from 46.3% to 70.4% in the past 10 years (Classes of Fall 1993 and Fall 2003) . Graduation rates for Hispanic American/Latino/a students rose from 49.3% to 72.0% in the same time period . The university has achieved parity between male and female bachelor's and master's degr ee recipients since 2001 . In fact, between 2001 and 2008 more women than men w ere awarded Bachelor's degrees . The gap between male and female doctorates is also narrowing, with women earning 48% of all doctoral degrees in 2009 . The diversit y of our faculty and staff: Between 2000 and 2009, the percentage of women in the tenured/tenure track faculty increased from 26% to 31% and the percentage of faculty of color in this group increased from 16% to 20%. In 2009, one-third of new tenured/tenure track faculty hires were women and 43% were members of ethnic minority groups . The number of women department chairs grew from six in 2004 to 15 in 2009, a 150% increase. The university's diverse staff is 16% African American, 7% Asian American, 5% Hispanic American/Latino/a, 17% from other nations, and 52% women. a leader in diversityWhere We Are Tod Ay: diversi Ty Accomplishmen Ts university of maryland aking Diversit y Initiatives at Maryland \u00bb 52111 diversity initiativesUniversity Offices that Promote Equity and Diversity Several campus programs have been established that address diversity issues, and the dates of their inception reflect the growing understanding of the complexity of diversity and the variety of groups that need to be served . The Office of Human Relations Programs (1971), now known as the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (odi), is responsible for compliance with the Human Relations Code that contains our official nondiscrimination policy (1976; amended in 1992 to include sexual orientation) . The office also provides a variety of multicultural and div ersity education programs, including intergroup dialogues . Many other offices, centers, and programs address specific issues . These include the: Nyumburu Cultural Center (1971) Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Education (1971) Disability Support Services (1977) Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (lgbt ) E quity (1998) Maryland Incentive Awards Program (2000) Office of Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy (2006), formerly Student Inv olvement and Minority Programs (1987) Special presidential commissions focus on eliminating inequity and fostering community for specific groups on campus . The four President's Commissions focus on: Women's Issues (1973), Ethnic Minority Issues (1973), Disability Issues (1986), and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and T ransgender Issues (1997) . The Provost 's Conversations on Diversity, Democracy, and Higher Education, established in 2003, promote university- wide awareness and dialogue about nationally important diversity issues . Diversity in the Curriculum The univ ersity has been a leader in interdisciplinary programs, with its American Studies program (1945) one of the earliest in the nation . This history was a stepping-stone for academic programs and concentrations that focus on educational issues surrounding specific ar eas of diversity . First introduced in the 1960s, these programs hav e helped to broaden our understanding of diversity, cultivate community, and build support for various social identity groups . Many programs that began as concentrations in traditional depar tments led to the establishment of formal academic programs: African American Studies (1968) Women's Studies (1977) Jewish Studies (1980) Latin American Studies (1989) Asian American Studies (2000) Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies (2002) Persian Studies (2004) u.s. Latino Studies (2007) The univ ersity has also been a national leader in fostering diversity as a serious topic for research and academic exploration . One of the most important and successful initiatives has been the Consor tium on Race, Gender, and Ethnicity (1998) . Faculty members working through the Consor tium have published groundbreaking studies on the complexity of issues surrounding self-identity and diversity . In 2008, the u.s. Department of Education granted the university status as a minority-serving institution for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a gateway to targeted support for the growth of academic programs and support for student scholarships . The David C . Driskell Center for the Study of the V isual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora, established at umd in 2001, preserves the heritage of African American visual arts and culture . Existing and new courses within established disciplines have been infused with elements and principles of diversity with the assistance of the C urriculum T ransformation Project (1989) . Since 1990, undergraduate students have had a c ore diversity requirement, and they currently have co-curricular opportunities that address diversity such as Words of Engagement: Intergroup Dialogue Program (2000) and the Common Ground Multicultural Dialogue Program (2000) . There are far more activities, campus-wide, and locally, than w e can include in this overview, but the programs listed above represent the breadth of our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive campus community . 52212 the university of maryland 52313 section name : section sub-head recommendationsThe University of Maryland has laid a strong and broad foundation for diversity and equity over the past three decades . The recommendations in the diversity strategic plan aim to ensure that the univ ersity will build on this foundation and continue as one of the nation's higher education leaders in diversity, equity, and inclusion . Clearly, the university has made great pr ogress . Howev er, building a community in which support for diversity permeates all levels is an ongoing process . The university still has much to do to create the optimal and inclusive learning and wor k environment to which it aspires . Vigorous effor ts should be made to further diversify the senior leadership, faculty, and student body; to create a more vibrant and inclusive campus community; to support diversity-related research; and to implement a curriculum that prepares our students to succeed in a multicultural, globally interconnected world . This plan sets forth strategies to take us to the next level . Our plan seeks to accomplish three goals: 1 . To ensure policies and structures ar e in place at all levels of the university to support transformational leadership, recruitment, and inclusion efforts, and to institutionalize campus diversity goals; 2 . To foster a positive climate that promotes student success and encourages faculty and staff members to flourish; and 3 . To promote a vision across the university that fully appr eciates diversity as a core value and educational benefit to be studied, cultivated, and embraced as a vital component of personal development and growth . The plan includes many exciting, bold initiatives to help the university meet its goal of excellence in div ersity . Highlights include: the appointment of a chief diversity officer and creation of an Office of U niversity Diversity; the establishment of a representative Diversity Advisory Council that will give a central voice to the needs and visions of diverse groups at all levels of the campus community; the introduction of new initiatives to assist with recruitment and retention, such as cluster faculty hires and work-family initiatives; the creation of a \"building community\" fund to support innovative approaches for enhancing the campus climate; and the emphasis on challenging new general education diversity requirements that will engage students in learning about plural societies and prepare them to be culturally competent leaders . Following are the major goals and strategies of the div ersity strategic plan, organized in six core areas: Leadership, Climate, Recruitment and Retention, Education, Research and Scholarship, and Community Engagement . A. leAdership Leadership is essential to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable institution . This plan proposes to strengthen the diversity leadership thr oughout the campus . The goals and strategies listed below recognize that leadership in div ersity must come from senior leaders as well as from the ranks of students, faculty, and staff . First, the plan calls for leadership from the top . When the university 's senior administrators endorse diversity programs and initiatives, they affirm that diversity is a core value and set the tone for action throughout the university . The appointment of a chief diversity officer and establishment of a campus-wide D iversity Advisory Council to replace the current Equity Council will be a visible signal of this commitment . With wide repr esentation from campus groups, the new council will focus on major diversity initiatives that can help move the campus forward . IV . Recommendations \u00bb \u00bb 52414 Second, leadership in diversity requires a commitment to increasing the presence of individuals from diverse populations among those in charge at all levels . This plan proposes an energetic effort to increase their numbers thr ough robust recruitment strategies . In addition, the university should expand and strengthen pr ograms of professional development that prepare individuals from underrepresented groups already on campus to move into positions of leadership . Students, faculty, and staff all benefit from a community in which those in charge r eflect diversity among their ranks . Finally, the university should suppor t a vigorous effort to inculcate the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all faculty, staff, and students so that leadership in diversity is something every member of the university community understands and for which each one feels responsible . GOAL A.1 The univ ersity will provide strong leadership for diversity and inclusion at all campus levels. Strategies A . The president will appoint a chief diversity officer (preferably a vice president with faculty rank) who r eports directly to the president and is a member of the President's Cabinet . B . The university will create an Office of University D iversity led by the chief diversity officer . The officer and his or her staff will advocate for diversity and equity issues; pro vide active oversight, coordination, and evaluation of work in these areas; track university progress in meeting the goals of the diversity strategic plan; and encourage and support the efforts of units to achieve their diversity goals . 52515 recommendations The office will serve as a resource providing regular and accurate information on existing university equity and diversity programs, centers, academic units, and identity- based organizations . The office will develop a comprehensive communication plan and strong campus Web presence to: pr ovide diversity and equity information; disseminate examples of best practices for promoting diversity and inclusion; and highlight the university's leadership in diversity research, academic, and co-curricular programming, minority graduation rates, and other accomplishments . The office will establish a resource center to share diversity materials (e .g ., curricula/syllabi, co-curricular programs, fellowships, funding opportunities) and pr ovide a site for consultation and collaboration on diversity, equity, and climate issues . C . The university will create a campus-wide diversity advisory council with r epresentatives from all divisions, schools/ colleges, graduate and undergraduate student bodies, and other appropriate units, to play a key role in advising the chief diversity officer regarding diversity decision-making, planning, and training . Units represented on the diversity advisory council will appoint diversity officers who will be responsible for providing div ersity education and training, overseeing climate assessments, and supporting diversity-related recruitment/retention, programming, and evaluation efforts within the unit . Diversity officers will also collaborate on campus-wide diversity initiativ es . Responsibilities, expectations, and accountability for diversity officers will be clearly defined and consistent across units . Although the diversity advisory council will replace the Equity Council as the major diversity leadership body, units may continue to appoint equity administrators to ov ersee all aspects of search and selection procedures, including data collection . D . The president, vice presidents, and deans will take steps to increase the diversity of leadership ranks acr oss all divisions, colleges/schools, and departments/units to support a diverse and inclusive institution . E . The university leadership will help each unit establish measurable goals for diversity and inclusion at the division, college or school, and depar tment/unit levels and help units meet their goals . Accountability mechanisms will be used to assess outcomes . Support for diversity and inclusion will be a uniform qualification for all leadership positions and a performance criterion in the annual reviews of all campus leaders . GOAL A.2: The universit y will increase opportunities for leadership training, mentoring, professional growth, and advancement of diverse faculty and staff in all divisions. Strategies A . The Provost 's Office will: Provide an annual leadership orientation for all new vice presidents, deans, and department chairs that includes a significant focus on fostering diversity and inclusion . This orientation should address such topics as supporting diversity r esearch/scholarship and teaching, creating an inclusive climate, dealing with sexual harassment, and recruiting and retaining diverse faculty, staff, and students . Offer leadership training and mentoring programs, such as 52616 the university of maryland the university's Leadership Education and Administrative Development (lead) program, which prepare tenured faculty to assume campus and professional leadership positions . Women, minorities, and faculty from div erse backgrounds will be actively encouraged to apply for these programs . B . The university will establish leadership education and mentoring programs for talented staff from diverse gr oups that provide avenues for professional growth, network development, and career advancement . C . The chief diversity officer will offer periodic training that prepares faculty and staff from all gr oups to be influential leaders, advocates, and spokespeople for diversity initiatives across the campus . B. climATe All individuals in a community need to feel that their individual worth is recognized, their work is respected, and they work in an environment in which they can flourish . If students feel marginalized because they are differ ent from those in the mainstream, if faculty or staff members feel that their contributions are not valued, or if any individual feels isolated and excluded by a climate that is unfriendly or uninterested, the university community is diminished . A welcoming, supportive climate is essential in our academic community . The university has in place clearly defined policies and legal guidelines to deal with egregious problems such as sexual harassment, hate speech, or thr eats . The initiatives addressed in this plan aim to ensure that w e go beyond a neutral climate to one that is completely supportive and inclusive . This diversity plan focuses on ways to enhance day-to-day learning and working conditions . The creation of a climate that nurtures and suppor ts all of its members requires proactive acts of self-examination . Many useful tools are available for self-assessment of the wor kplace and classroom climate . Exit surveys, for example, ar e accepted and valuable ways to measure experiences . The plan proposes surveys and other formal assessments as initial steps, but units will also find it helpful to gauge climate issues thr ough informal group discussions, spontaneous interviews with individuals in the unit, and other activities . GOAL B.1: The univ ersity will ensure a welcoming and inclusive learning community, workplace, and campus environment. Strategies A . Units will actively support and demonstrate adherence to the university's policies on equity, non-discrimination, compliance, and equal employment opportunity/affirmative action . 52717 recommendationsB . The chief diversity officer, in collaboration with the Diversity A dvisory Council, will: Create an online climate assessment survey that will be administered by all units to establish a baseline so they can assess their needs in creating a climate conducive to success . The results will be submitted to appropriate unit heads (e .g ., deans, vice presidents) for review and feedback . The climate assessment survey will be repeated periodically , maybe even annually, as dictated by the results . Create the framework for a climate enhancement plan and help units use the plan to identify strategies for responding to climate concerns and to create an inclusive, welcoming envir onment . Climate enhancement plans will be submitted to and discussed with appropriate unit heads and unit diversity officers . Develop a schedule for unit heads and the Diversity Advisory Council to reach out, work with units, and offer them suppor t and advice as indicated by the results of their climate assessment surveys and the outcomes of their climate enhancement plan activities . C . The university will survey graduating students on an annual basis concerning the impact of their diversity-r elated educational and co-curricular experiences, as well as their perceptions of the campus climate . GOAL B.2: The univer sity will develop and implement innovative, cross-cutting programs to improve and enhance the campus climate for diverse students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Strategies A . The chief diversity officer, in consultation with the Diversity A dvisory Council, will identify common themes that arise from climate assessments and develop campus-wide programs to foster an inclusive, civil environment and to remedy climate-related problems . B . The university will create a \"building community\" fund administered b y the chief diversity officer to support innovative initiatives for enhancing the climate within and/or across units, and between social identity groups on campus . C . Across the university, in campus-wide social activities and campus offices designed to addr ess issues of different cultural and identity groups, the university will celebrate and promote a community based on inclusiveness and respect for 52818 the university of maryland differences, encouraging close interaction among individuals on campus with varying backgrounds, experiences, interests, and perspectives . D . The President's Office will continue to suppor t the Commissions on Women's Issues, Ethnic and Minority Issues; Disability Issues; and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and T ransgender Issues in their work to identify campus diversity concerns, educate university constituencies, advocate for programmatic and policy improvements, and celebrate the achievements of diverse members of the campus community . With ov ersight from the chief diversity officer, the commissions may hold annual (or periodic) town meetings of their constituencies to identify issues that require university attention, evaluate progress in achieving equity and diversity goals, and make recommendations to the President . c. recrui TmenT And reTenTion Excellence at the university depends on the recruitment and retention of outstanding faculty and staff . Talented individuals with great potential ar e found among every group . To build an academic community that is preeminent, the univ ersity will actively seek and aggressively recruit these outstanding and diverse individuals to our faculty, staff, administrative ranks, and student body . The university has taken action in recent years to r emove impediments to effective recruiting and retention of faculty . For example, new policies recogniz e the needs of faculty involved in child-rearing, a concern that has disproportionately affected the careers of academic women . A newly established Family Care R esource and Referral Service will provide a variety of child and elder care services to facilitate greater work-life balance for faculty, staff, and students . In 2009-10, the university also instituted a policy for part-time status of tenur ed/tenure-track faculty due to childrearing responsibilities, enabling faculty with young children to work part-time . Research and experience have sho wn that achieving a critical mass of colleagues is especially important in recruiting individuals from groups who are not in the mainstream . If many individuals from a particular gr oup find support and success in a department or unit, others from that group will be more eager to join them . It will be our goal, at every lev el, to build the critical mass that signals the University of Maryland is a welcoming home for every individual who aspires to reach his or her highest potential . The promotion of cluster hires and a rene wed emphasis on mentoring of junior faculty will help ensure success in building the corps of minority and women faculty across the university . Likewise, the university will support effor ts to recruit, retain, and promote diverse staff members, and to overcome unfair barriers to their advancement . The univ ersity's recruitment strategies over the past two decades at the undergraduate level have reaped rewards and successes . We are pr oud of the steady enrollment of African Americans and Asian Americans, of the increasing numbers of Hispanic American/Latino/a students attending the university, and of the numbers of women in our programs . Innovativ e recruitment efforts at the undergraduate level will continue . The university's strategic plan set for th goals for supporting graduate students, casting a wide net in their recruitment that should greatly help to attract minority students and women, and offer them the highest level of mentoring and guidance . We expect steady increases in the enr ollment and success of diverse graduate students as a result of these new measures . GOAL C.1: The univ ersity will continue to recruit, promote, and work to retain a diverse faculty and staff. Strategies A . The Office of the Provost and college/schools will implement faculty r ecruitment strategies, such as cluster hiring, faculty exchanges with minority-serving institutions, and programs that build the pipeline of future faculty, to increase faculty diversity and create an inclusive community that facilitates retention . A faculty recruitment fund will pro vide support to enhance the diversity of the university's faculty . 52919 recommendations B . The university will join the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (her c) to increase its competitive advantage in recruiting talented and diverse faculty and staff, and to identify potential positions for their family members . C . The chief diversity officer will work with deans and department chairs to determine the availability of women and minorities in targeted fields, and to ensur e that departments are making efforts to hire diverse faculty and staff in proportion to their availability in relevant job pools . D . The Office of the Provost, deans, and chairs will dev elop mentoring, professional growth, and other retention initiatives, such as collaboration caf\u00e9s, to reduce disparities in the retention rates of tenure-track and tenured faculty from diverse groups . Administrators should replicate best practice models from depar tments that have been successful in retaining and promoting faculty of color, and should provide mentorship training to faculty who choose to become mentors . E . The chief diversity officer will monitor faculty retention and promotion/tenure rates, identify impediments to r etention and advancement, and make recommendations for remedying identified disparities . F . Deans and department chairs will carefully evaluate campus ser vice assignments and mentoring activities of junior faculty, with a particular focus on women and minority faculty, and will ensure that they have time to successfully complete their teaching and research responsibilities required for promotion and tenure . G . The chief diversity officer will monitor staff retention, promotion, and turnov er rates, identify barriers to career advancement, and make recommendations for remedying identified obstacles . H . The university will implement family-friendly policies and provide services to facilitate wor k-life balance as retention incentives . GOAL C.2: The universit y will recruit, retain, and graduate a diverse student body. Strategies/Undergraduate Students A . The Division of Academic Affairs will adopt innovativ e, high-contact recruitment models, including those that employ alumni of color and international alumni, to attract a diverse student body from all areas of the state, the nation, and the world . The university will set appropriate goals for increasing enr ollments . The university will increase the percentage of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups (African American, Asian American, H ispanic American/Latino/a, Native American, and multiracial) to a target of at least 38% of the total enrollment by 2018 . 53020 the university of maryland The university will increase the percentage of international undergraduate students to a target of at least 8% of the total enrollment by 2018 . B . The university will continue to create scholarship and financial aid programs to ensure that higher education is accessible to div erse undergraduates, particularly low- income, first-generation students . C . The Division of Academic Affairs will support initiatives that enhance the academic pr eparation of low-income, first- generation students during their pre-college years, and that encourage their college attendance . D . The university will regularly review its 27 admission factors, including academic achiev ement, standardized test scores, and other criteria, to ensure that admissions procedures do not negatively impact women, minority, and low- income students . Members of the university community should make ever y effort to share information about the individualized, holistic evaluation of student applicants to the university . E . The university will work to close the academic achievement gap by bringing the graduation rates of African American, H ispanic American/Latino/a, and Native American students in line with those of the general student body . Specifically, the university will r educe the discrepancy between the six- year graduation rate of students from the above groups and that of all students to 5% or lower by 2018.F . The university will continue to support offices and programs that facilitate undergraduate student success, progr ess to degree, and timely graduation, including those that provide smooth transitions to campus life, mentoring advising, and positive academic and co-curricular experiences . Strategies/Graduat e Students A . The Graduate School and deans will develop innovativ e programs to recruit, enroll, and retain diverse graduate students, and increase their degree completion rate . The Graduate School and colleges and schools will educate graduate directors and other interested faculty on best practices for recruiting, r etaining, and graduating diverse students . Colleges and schools will periodically review and provide feedback on department plans for recruiting a diverse student body . B . The provost and Graduate School will consider the success of its pr ograms in recruiting and graduating a diverse population of graduate students when allocating institutional financial support to programs, departments, and colleges and schools . 53121 section name : section sub-headrecommendations d. educATion Consistent with the goals of the strategic plan, the university strives to provide every student with an education that incorporates the values of diversity and inclusion and prepares its graduates for an increasingly diverse United States and evolving global society . Curricula should ensure that graduates have had significant engagement with differ ent cultures and global issues . The new general education plan spells out clearly the courses and curricula that will be required to br oaden the vision of all undergraduates . Innovativ e new diversity courses will increase students' understanding of cultural pluralism, develop their cultural competencies, and provide exceptional opportunities to study abroad . In addition, the university has many outstanding scholars whose work has focused on div ersity issues within their disciplines . To name just a few , our School of Public Health has a major research focus on the reduction of health disparities in Maryland's minority populations, our history faculty and students have traced historic connections between African American slavery and the Maryland Agricultural College (which grew into the University of Maryland), and our education scholars regularly conduct studies with urban schools in Prince George's County and Baltimore that have large minority populations . University faculty from many disciplines hav e made important contributions to the scholarship on diversity and self-identity . These and many other programs can be given campus-wide publicity and tapped to pro vide educational experiences for undergraduates . Through a collaborative process, the univ ersity will consider how best to incorporate the study of diversity and different cultural perspectives in its academic programs, courses, and co-curricular programs . Students will gain knowledge of intellectual approaches and dimensions of div ersity, develop an understanding of diverse people and perspectives, and recognize the benefits of working and problem-solving in diverse teams . Programs and activities that promote cr oss-cultural understanding will help to prepare students for careers in a global economic environment and life in a multicultural society . GOAL D. 1: The university will ensure that undergraduate students acquire the knowledge, experience, and cultural competencies necessary to succeed in a multicultural, globally interconnected world.Strategies A . The university will implement the new general education plan with Diversity r equirements that increase undergraduates' knowledge of diversity issues, understanding of pluralistic societies, engagement with peers from diverse backgrounds, and multicultural competencies .

Working with the Division of Resear ch and Graduate School, departments will ensure that graduate students are educated in the responsible conduct of research, including research involving vulnerable populations . GOAL D.3: T he university will increase faculty capacity to educate students about diversity issues and to develop inclusive learning environments. Strategies A . The Division of Academic Affairs will work with department and pr ogram chairs to establish curriculum transformation programs that prepare faculty to teach students from diverse backgrounds, employ pedagogies that recognize multiple ways of learning, and integrate diversity issues in their courses and laboratory/research environments, including the new general education courses . 53323 recommendationsB . Faculty will work with colleagues from Student Affairs to develop innovativ e co-curricular experiences, such as service- learning, common ground dialogue programs, internships, and international experiences that equip students to work and live in diverse communities . e. reseArch And schol Arship The university's record is filled with instances of ground- breaking scholarship that illuminate the experiences of women, minorities, and other diverse groups in America . In departments such as W omen's Studies, African American Studies, Government and Politics, and Family Science, as well as Journalism, Theatre, and Music (which recently commissioned Shadowboxer, an opera on the life of Joe Louis), research has investigated issues of ethnicity, culture, sexuality, religion, gender, age, disability, and a wide range of other identities . Other research focuses on application of theor y to practical situations . In the College of Education and College of Computer, M athematical and Natural Sciences, as well as the A . James Clark School of Engineering, r esearchers are identifying the tools for mentoring and teaching specialists in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (stem ) fields, including methods for use in urban communities with large minority and first-generation college populations . Robert H . Smith School of Business scholars study how div ersity in management teams contributes to innovation . Such research is making a differ ence on campus and in the larger society . Communicating the outcomes of our diversity scholarship in lectures, programs, and ev ents has the potential to energize the campus discussion of diversity issues and inspire research by other faculty and students . This plan calls for multiple strategies that will strengthen, augment, and enhance opportunities for research and scholarship in div ersity fields . In addition, every academic and co-curricular unit will be encouraged to incorporate div ersity- related topics, themes, and concerns into their curricula . Such efforts will greatly enrich the educational experience of faculty and students, as w ell as other members of the university community . GOAL E.1: The univ ersity will commit itself to developing and supporting the production of nationally recognized research and scholarship on race, ethnicity, class, gender, and other dimensions of diversity.Strategies A . The chief diversity officer will engage the faculty in opportunities to participate in diversity-themed, inter disciplinary research centers and programs on the campus . B . The university will support the recruitment of distinguished senior faculty who can establish world-class, externally funded r esearch/scholarship programs that address race/ ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and other dimensions of diversity . C .

D . The provost will sponsor conferences, symposia, and seminars that addr ess diversity research and scholarship, including ways to apply research findings in instructional, co-curricular, and institutional improvement activities . 53424 the university of maryland E . The Office of the Provost will wor k to ensure that diversity research and scholarship is appropriately valued and evaluated in promotion and tenure decisions . F . Colleges and schools will increase opportunities for graduate students to participate in professional dev elopment and career preparation activities that support scholarship on diversity issues, such as national/international conference presentations and fellowships for international study . Women, minorities, and other students from diverse backgr ounds will be actively encouraged to apply for these opportunities . G . The university will create a President 's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, available in all academic fields, for scholars whose research and presence will contribute to the diversity of the academic community . GOAL E.2: The univer sity will provide a clearinghouse of opportunities for funded research, scholarship, and creative activities addressing diversity issues. Strategies A . The Division of Research will maintain and disseminate information about funded opportunities for r egional, national, and international research, scholarship, and creative activities that focus on diversity and equity issues . B . The Graduate School will maintain and publicize an up-to- date list of fellowships and outside sources of suppor t from funding agencies and foundations that are specifically for minority and female graduate students . 53525 section name : section sub-headrecommendationsF. communi Ty engAgemen T Community engagement has been an underlying theme in several of the goals listed above . The vision that animates this plan is of a university characterized by intellectual vitality and ex citement, where individuals from different backgrounds, ethnic groups, national cultures, socioeconomic groups, and life experiences can share ideas and concerns . This would be a university in which students actively engage with other students, faculty, and staff in both formal and informal settings . The Diversity Advisor y Council will promote community engagement by sharing examples of other successful campus models . For example, students on the university' s Sustainability Council and its student subcommittee share environmental concerns and tackle sustainability issues with faculty and staff from the divisions of Academic Affairs, Administrative Affairs, Student Affairs, Research, and University Relations, and the Office of Information Technology . Such engagement enriches the educational experience and leads to personal growth . It builds trust among participants, suppor ts creativity, enlivens intellectual life, and creates an ambiance that is characteristic of the great universities . The university's reach and inv olvement extend beyond the physical boundaries of the campus . The neighboring communities and regions provide v aluable resources for learning and personal growth . For example, the Department of P ublic and Community Health has maintained a 10-year partnership with the City of Seat Pleasant, with faculty, staff, and students providing health education services to residents and residents offering feedback on the department's health education curriculum . College Park Scholars partners with the City of College P ark to provide weekly tutoring for children through the Lakeland Stars program serving Paint Branch Elementary School . Other community-based activities are described in the plan, but much, much more interaction takes place betw een the university and communities throughout the state . Learning experiences include departmental internships, alternative break pr ograms, service-learning, and field experiences for credit or for learning, such as Engineers Without Borders, which takes our students to other countries . Engagement in educational, research, and ser vice activities in communities beyond the campus is an important vehicle that broadens perspectives and increases understanding of the value of diversity . This plan supports university efforts to pr omote such engagement . GOAL F.1: T he university will promote academic and co- curricular activities that facilitate positive interactions among students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Strategies A . The university will create and support opportunities that facilitate dialogue and engagement among div erse students, faculty, staff, and alumni, and that contribute to the professional, social, economic, and spiritual development of all participants . B . The university will create initiatives that support and expand collaboration on div ersity issues between departments/ units in Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, Research, Administrative Affairs, University Relations, and the Office of Information Technology . Initiatives will reflect the univ ersity's values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and citizenship with the goal of developing the \"whole student .\" The university will showcase inno vative and effective initiatives as models for replication . GOAL F.2: The univ ersity will increase the number of part- nerships and the quality of engagement with the diverse external community. Strategies A . The colleges and schools, Institute for Internal Programs, and D ivision of Student Affairs will provide increased opportunities for students to participate in community- based internships, service learning, international exchange programs, and related activities that enhance their knowledge of diverse populations and their cultural competency . B . The university will create new community-based resear ch, continuing education, and extension partnerships, as well as leverage existing partnerships, that benefit diverse populations in the state and surrounding areas . 53626 the university of maryland 53727 implementationV . Implementation \u00bb This diversity plan proposes a leap forward at the University of Maryland over the next 10 years . Like the university's 2008 strategic plan, it sets high expectations and offers a frame work and guide for the university as it fulfills aspirations for future excellence in becoming a model of diversity and inclusion . Its vision and initiatives repr esent a bold and ambitious agenda for the university . The goals and strategies recommended in this plan must be thoughtfully and carefully implemented . The role of the chief diversity officer and the Div ersity Advisory Council will be crucial to the success of the implementation . They will need to prioritize the proposed goals and strategies, develop a r ealistic timetable, and assign the plan's specific tasks to offices or individuals responsible for executing them . Their success will depend, in part, on their ability to seek the advice and counsel of expert and engaged faculty, staff, and students fr om across campus as they pursue these goals; their willingness to support bold initiatives; and their acceptance of patience and flexibility in finding ways to achieve their goals . Future, not yet anticipated oppor tunities or challenges may create a need to modify individual goals and strategies, or create new ones . Yet the vision of a university community that thriv es on diversity, that uses diversity as an educational instrument for personal growth and enrichment, and that cultivates future leaders who embrace diversity will not change . It remains our fixed star . GOAL 1: There will be guiding principles developed f or the implementation component of the diversity strategic plan. These principles will be developed by the chief diversity officer in consultation with the Diversity Advisory Council. A . The president, provost, vice pr esidents, deans, department chairs, directors, and the chief diversity officer should use the diversity strategic plan for planning and decision making related to campus diversity issues . B . The chief diversity officer should work with the university' s senior leadership to develop incentives for implementing strategies presented in the plan . C . The chief diversity officer, in consultation with the Diversity A dvisory Council, should develop measures to monitor and evaluate the success of plan goals and strategies . GOAL 2: The university will prioritiz e and set a time line for the goals and objectives of the diversity strategic plan. The chief diversity officer, president, and provost will: A . Annually identify high-priority strategic plan goals and strategies for implementation . B . Identify the individuals/units responsible for implementing and evaluating the progr ess of prioritized goals and strategies . C . Establish realistic time lines and outcome measures for implementing high-priority goals and strategies . D . Work with the vice president for Univ ersity Relations and appropriate development officers to seek financial sources to fund the goals and strategies of the plan . 53828 the university of maryland GOAL 3: The chief diversity officer will monitor imple- mentation of the diversity s trategic plan and will report annually on plan progress. A . The chief diversity officer will annually report on the progr ess of the diversity strategic plan to the president and the president's Cabinet . B . After presentations to the president and Cabinet, the annual progress r eport of the diversity strategic plan will be posted on the university website and released to the university community, including the Student Government Association, the Graduate Student Government, the University Senate, and The Diamondback . GOAL 4: The univer sity will develop processes for modify- ing the diversity strategic plan and updating it at least once every 10 years. A . Members of the university community will have an opportunity to petition for major and/or minor amendments to the div ersity strategic plan . Major amendments will requir e revisiting the goals and strategies of the plan or the basic assumptions that have provided direction for the plan . A major amendment would have an impact on many areas of the plan . Minor amendments might include a change in the wording of a goal or strategy, or changes in r esponsible leadership . B . The president will appoint a diversity strategic plan steering committee to complete a major review and update of the div ersity strategic plan no less than once every 10 years . C . The chief diversity officer will chair the diversity strategic plan steering committee . D . The diversity strategic plan steering committee will include representation from the faculty , staff, senior leadership, and undergraduate and graduate students . 53929 implementation of the general education planDiversity Plan Steering Committee \u00bb Robert Waters, Chair, Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs and Special Assistant to the President Cordell Black, Associate Provost for Academic Affairs; Associate Professor, School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures Gloria Aparicio Blackwell, Assistant to the Vice President, Division of Administrative Affairs Gloria Bouis, Executive Director, Office of Diversity and Inclusion Kamilia Butler-Peres, Undergraduate Student Linda Clement, Vice President for Student Affairs Pat Cleveland, Associate Dean, Robert H .

Knowledge discovery accelerates and the societal relevance of scientific research improves when supported by a diverse workforce. Bu ilding this culture requires new commitments. We will enhance diversity of interns, graduate students, faculty, and staff. We will cultivate inclusivity through professional development and innovative mentoring. We will incentivize change via individual and institutional performance metrics. \" Through collaborations with other USM institutions, including the Maryland Sea Grant College that it administers, UMCES continues to lead, coordinate , and catalyze environmental research and education within the USM. The 2019 Strategic Initiatives Plan emphasizes our commitment to engage students from groups underrepresented in the environmental sciences as well as training and inspiring the nation's next generation of environmental scientists. UMCES Areas of Empha sis to Enhance Cultural Diversity Our approach to tackling this important plan focuses on recruitment and campus climate . In larger institutions, such work is typically associated with a diversity and inclusion office, staffed by professionals trained in the skills and knowledge of this field. Given UMCES' size, it is unlikely that an entire office can be devoted to this work. However, the appointment of a diversity officer who has the professional background and experience in this type of institutional change could be transformational. We are considering how best to fill this role as funding and added budgeted position requests continue to be a challenge. Recruitment and Retention: Recruitment to UMCES happens through both sear ch committees as well as student admissions to graduate programs. There are a number of practices to be considered that can increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty. F or example, search committees for faculty and staff should receive training specific to the hiring process, while also recognizing that recruitment may extend outside of formal committees. Coupled with these efforts, procedures are needed to document and assess efforts to expand the pool of diverse applicants. For staff and faculty hires we envision a new set of procedures and tracking efforts that target outreach/recruitment, training of search committees (especially on unconscious bias), and evaluation of a set of metrics that can be used to describe progress. 543 For our student population, we must consider a host of practices, from exposure to the institution through internships to our influence on the graduate admissions process and financial support . Increasing diversity and enabling successful careers requires reinforcement of positive experiences at multiple touch points, from K -12 experiences to mid -career promotions. UMCES can contribute by coordinating and integrating efforts across the career trajectory of internships for high school and undergraduate students, graduate student recruitment and training, post -doctoral experiences, and faculty recruitment and retention as a means of advancing diversity and inclusion at each key step in a scientist 's career. Having diversity at each career stage within the institution will also afford synergisms that further reinforce the broad range of diversity objectives across career stages. UMCES faculty currently supervise a handful of programs targeting un derrepresented groups, such as Centro TORTUGA and the Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center. While these programs have had some success, m uch could be done to build and expand these efforts. We also envision partnering with minority serving i nstitutions and their faculty to inform and improve recruitment/retention and our campus climate. Once recruited, conscious effort should be focused on improving retention of employees from underrepresented groups at UMCES. For example, UMCES should pursue opportunities for additional mentoring that is available and accessed, and that overall improvements in campus climate provide a productive and constructive workplace. In order to accomplish this goal, we will need additional resource infrastructure and funding to insure these programs are developed and policies are created that lead to improvements. In a ddition to a diversity officer role we are looking to form and engage an UMCES Diversity and Incl usion Task Force across our campus locations . Campus Climate: Tackling the \"inclusion\" aspect of this strategic plan goal necessitates consideration of our campus culture and climate. A baseline Campus Climate Survey will provide a means to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses, as well as to pro vide a way to communicate to the community our understanding of relevant issues and concerns . We also emphasize the need for training on diversity and inclusion, with a special focus on unconscious bias and fostering a learning environment on these topics that is appropriate for all members of our community. In addition to appointing a diversity officer, we see these approaches as cornerstones to creating the opportunity for growth and improvement at UMCES in this regard. Areas of Progress and Improvement Goal 1: Efforts to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty Hiring and Search Procedures UMCES implemented the PeopleAdmin hiring and recruiting system in March 2018 which includes an applicant diversity tracking and reporting module. In FY 2019 UMCES completed 14 hiring searches with 4 minority candidate hires. We continue to work on enhancing our faculty and staff search procedures and provide training for search committees to focus on attracting a diverse applicant pool. A workgroup to develop and recommend enhancements to our current search procedures and training has been formed and updated procedures are expected to be finalized by December 2019. Partner with other USM institutions to increase enrollment and diversity in the MEES program. UMCES partnered with UMD and submitted a joint $1M enhancement funding request to the USM in May 2018 for fellowship funding to attract and retain students in the program with a focus on increasing underrepresented minority student enrollments. Unfortunately, due to other competing priorities this request was not funded in 2018. UMCES and UMD intend to re -submit the proposal in 2019. 544 Engage students from underrepresented groups in UMCES environmental sciences programs. For the past several years, UMCES continues participation in the Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center, a minority training partnership supported by the National Oceanic an d Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2019 $457,000 is currently funding student research, stipends, and tuition. This is a $157,000 or 52% increase over last year's funding. Goal 2: Efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultural aware ness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. Engage campus in Institutional Assessment process to include a Campus Climate survey UMCES began planning for a Campus Institutional Assessment project to include a campus climate and diversity and inclusion discussion in July 2018. We expected to complete the surveys and interviews by end of calendar year 2018, but did not receive MSCHE guidance and approval on the process details until early 2019. Interviews and feedback session ar e in progress. Results and data analysis are expected to be completed by December 2019. Engage Student Organizations in Diversity and Inclusion Planning The UMCES Graduate Student Council shared their Diversity and Inclusion Plan with UMCES Executive Council leadership in May 2017. The UMCES Plan was shared with the Student Council in October 2018 and a Student representative has been appointed to the UMCES Administrative Council for ongoing discussions, plans and feedback. Designated gifts & grants that support cultural diversity UMCES faculty and staff continue to pursue targeted funding to attract and retain minority students. L'Or\u00e9al has provided funding in support of research mentoring activities for underrepresented students in STEM at the community college level. UMCES -IMET also received $80K in private donor funds to support undergraduate student summer internships in STEM research related experiences and mentoring. Conclusion Clearly, there are great opportunities and a commitment for UMCES to expand our work to meet a shared vision of a diverse and inclusive institution. Our biggest challenge continues to be funding and organizational resources in support of these goals. We look forward to the development of an UMCES wide working group approach in the next year to help develop and implement these programs and changes. 5451 2018- 2019 INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT TEMPLATE Institution: _____________UMCES_____________________________________ Date Submitted: 4/17/19 Ross lross@umces.edu _______________________________________________________________ Overall Guidelines: For the 2018-2019 Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report, complete the two sections (and subsections) in this template.

Its statutory mandate is to \"conduct a comprehensive program to develop and apply a predictive ecol ogy for Maryland to the improvement and preservation of the physical environment through a program of research, public service, and education.\" This revised mission included a path for accreditation to award joint degrees with other USM partners and to assume an expanded role in graduate and professional education. UMCES completed its accreditation review by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and was awarded accreditation in March 2016. Through collaborations with other USM institutions, including the Maryland Sea Grant College that it administers, UMCES leads, coordinates, and catalyzes environmental research and education within the USM. The UMCES Strategic Plan, Focus on the Future, defines UMCES' commitment to cultural diversity and future goals and plans through 2018. The Strategic Plan emphasizes our commitment to engage students from groups underrepresented in the environmental sciences as well as training and inspiring the nation's next generation of environmental scientists. The core values pf UMCES as stated on page 4 of the Strategic Plan are: Commitment to environmental discovery, integration, application, and education that epitomizes our institutional responsibility to serve society. Adherence to the highest standards of academic independence in the pursuit of discovery and knowledge.

Allen reallen@umes.edu________________________ Summary Statement The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) implemented its Cultural Diversity Plan in 2009. The plan is composed primar ily of three major goals with sub- goals and key strategies that align to each goal. The goals, data on the numerical representati on of faculty, staff and students , and the variety of strategies implemented are reviewed and reported annually. In the 2009 plan, UMES established a 1- year target date for implementation of the major goals and identified strategy leaders for high accountability and to reinforce its commitment to cultural diversity. UMES will be restarting its strategic planning process next academic year and goals, objectiv es, and strategies relate d to cultural diversit y and inclusion will continue to be apart of our future strategic plan. Over the past few years, the demograp hics of the campus community have changed. Given these changes, the university intends to revisit it s original goals to better align them w ith current demographic data. In additi on, UMES intends to revise its existing Cultural Diversity Plan. The subsequent tables depict a small selection of goals/strategies that UMES has implemented in order to ensure cultural diversity on our campus.

Section II: Appendix -- Institutional Plan for Cultural Diversity The University of Maryland Eastern Shore has included its current Diversity Plan, developed and implemented in 2009. During academic year 2019-2020, the university has plans to implement a new institutional plan for cultural diversity. A draft of the new plan has also been included. INTRODUCTION The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) has developed this \"Diversity Plan\" in accordance with Senate Bill 438 and House Bill 905, identical bills entitled \"Institutions of Higher Education - Plans for Program of Cultural Diversity.\" According to a letter from Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, dated May 15 th, 2008, to the Honorable Martin J. O'Malley, Governor of Maryland: \"The bills also require public institutions to develop and implement a wide range of elements to be included in the plans, including processes for reporting campus-based hate crimes, programming to enhance cultural diversity sensitivity through training of students faculty and staff, and a summary of resources needed to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body.\" 56712 Therefore, the remainder of this plan will include those three aforementioned elements. However, the plan will also inc lude several sections: Institutional Background, Institutional Core Values, Commitment to Diversity, Goals and Key Strategies, and the Policies and Procedures for Reporting Campus Based Hate crimes and Bias -Motivated Incidents. INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND Founded September 13, 1886, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore has a Mission which continues to evolve and which has necessarily become more comprehensive in scope as the University's affiliations, organizational structure, and purpose have been redefined by relevant governing bodies to address state, national, and global needs. UMES, however, maintains its legacy as a comprehensive, 1890 Land-Grant, Historically Black institution and continues its progress to become a Carnegie Doctoral/Research-Inten sive institution. The profile of the University has been changing over recent years due to a period of unprecedented growth. With a fall 2008 enrollment of over 4,300, the University stands as one of the University System of Maryland's fastest growing in stitutions, with entering students coming from all 23 counties in the State of Maryland, representing more than 37 states in the United States, and originating from over 42 foreign countries. The program mix has expanded to 29 Bachelors degree, 10 master' s degree and 7 doctoral degree programs. Overall, growth extends beyond enrollment to programs that define UMES as a modern, comprehensive University that honors its unique 1890 Land-Grant Mission and that respects the urgent need for workforce development on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the nation, and throughout the global community. INSTITUTIONAL MISSION University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the State's Historically Black 1890 Land -Grant institution, emphasizes baccalaureate and graduate programs in the liberal arts, health professions, sciences, and teacher education. In keeping with its land-grant mandate, the University's purpose and uniqueness are grounded in distinctive learning, discovery, and engagement opportunities in agriculture, marine and environmental sciences, technology, engineering and aviation sciences, health professions, and hospitality management. Degrees are offered at the bachelors, masters, and doctoral levels. UMES is committed to providing access to high quality values-based educational experiences, especially to individuals who are first-generation college students of all races, while emphasizing multicultural diversity and international perspectives. The University serves the educational and research needs of business es, industries, government, and non-government 56813 organizations. The University is committed to meeting the economic development needs of the Eastern Shore; workforce development needs of the State; international development priorities of the nation; and com mercialization and entrepreneurial ventures of the University through engagement activities and partnerships. UMES is a teaching/research institution that nurtures and launches globally competent citizens. It will continue to embrace its interdisciplinary curriculum, sponsored research initiatives, rural and economic development priorities, and community engagement. UMES will continue to expand its partnerships and collaborative arrangements with the University System of Maryland institutions, other universities, community colleges, public schools, government, and other external agencies and constituencies. INSTITUTIONAL CORE VALUES Providing high quality undergraduate and graduate programs that will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary for the challenges of America and other global societies. Affirming its role as the State's 1890 Land-Grant institution by providing to citizens opportunities and access that will enhance their lives and enable them to develop intellectually, economically , socially, and culturally. Demonstrating shared-governance through recognition of the viewpoints that all members of the university community contribute to the institution. Appreciating diversity in its student body, faculty, staff and administration through commitment to tolerance, freedom of expression, and celebration of other cultures. Adhering to the highest standards of honesty, fairness, trust and integrity in both personal and professional behavior. Promoting student-centeredness as the heart of the enterprise. COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY As a public institution of higher education, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore has a special responsibility to create and maintain a climate that affirms diversity of persons as well as diversity of views. Diversity is an indispensable component of academic excellence. A commitment to diversity means a commitment to the inclusion of faculty, staff, and students from all ethnic groups. Among these characteristics are race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, socioeconomic background, religion, sexual orientation, and disability. According to Senate Bill 438 and House Bill 905, \"Cultural Diversity\" means th e inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups, and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education. 56914 By virtue of our commitment to diversity, UMES has an established core value that is provided below: \"Appreciating diversity in its student body, faculty, staff and administration through commitment to tolerance, freedom of expression, and celebration of cultures.\" GOALS AND KEY STRATEGIES This section, on Goals and Key Strategies, presents diversity goals grouped under three broad areas: Climate for Living, Learning, and Working; Student Access and Opportunity; and Diverse Faculty and Staff. Each goal is followed by a set of \"key strategies\" - those strategies believed to have the highest potential for success in reaching the goal. Specific timelines are provided with each key strategy, setting a target date for completing or reporting progress on specific actions. The area of Climate for Living, Learning, and Working includes the culture, decisions, practices, policies, and behaviors tha t constitute the environment at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Also included in this area are strategies to enhance cultural diversity sensitivities through training. All members (students, faculty, and staff) of the community will believe that they support an environment conducive to Living, Learning, and Working. The environment at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore is everyone's responsibility and it must include a climate of civility and respect for all. The climate sets the tone for success in the areas of recruitment and retention of students, faculty, staff, and administrators. In the area of Student Access and Opportunity, particular emphasis is placed on the successful graduation of all students, in recognition of the campus' most basic educational mission. However, for this plan t he matriculation of non-African American students is emphasized. The plan also includes enrollment, graduation rate and retention goals that contribute to the over - arching aim of increasing the number of degrees earned by non-African-American students. In the area of Diverse Faculty and Staff, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore believes that a strong faculty is a diversifi ed faculty. Diversity brings a whole world of knowledge by looking at and viewing learning from different perspectives. In Senate Bill 438 and House Bill 905, the definition for \"Cultural Diversity\" means the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education.

The terms African-American and non-African-American will be the terminology used for the establishment of goals. The term non-African-American will include: Native-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-Americans, White, Foreign and others. 57015 GOAL 1: Climate for Living, Learning and Working The University of Maryland Eastern Shore is committed to fostering a campus environment of inclusion, knowledge and understanding in which faculty, staff and students learn to value diversity and to respect the individual differences that enrich the University community.

The University has a sworn police force with the power to enforce the laws of the State of Maryland. As such, the University Department of Public Safety enforces all applicable laws including those specifically covering hate crimes. The Univer sity also has a Fair Practices Officer/Equity Officer that is trained by State Office of Equal Employment Opportunity which enforces all workplace discrimination laws including those regarding hate crimes. The Fair Practices/Equal Opportunity Officer is tr ained to investigate all types of discrimination that occur in the workplace and is trained to take appropriate action to safeguard th e welfare of all employees. Because we are a small campus, the Fair Practices Officer/Equity Officer handles all cases of discrimination involving students, faculty, and staff. Since we have relatively few such complaints, the officer is able to accommodate all campus constituents. Additionally, our Fair Practices Officer/Equity Officer is an attorney licensed in the State o f Maryland and knowledgeable of the various laws that pertain to hate crimes and other forms of discrimination. We also have pamphlets from the State of Maryland that are displayed prominently in the Human Resources Office that specifically address hate cr imes, various resources, and complaint procedures. Complaints of Hate or Bias incidents may be reported to the Director of Public Safety if a crime has been committed and/or to the Office of Human Resources Fair Practices/Equity Officer if the incident is not of a criminal nature. The Hate or Bias Incident form may be accessed at our Diversity Website linked to the Human Resources Webpage. Your complaint form may be delivered by mail or in person to the Fair Practices/Equity Officer located in the Office of Human Resources, UMES, J.T. Williams Building; Princess Anne, MD 21853.

The University is located in a residential area of northeast Baltimore, a city with a population estimated at 602,495. Demog raphics for Baltimore City include the following: 62.8% the residents are African American; 31.8% are White; 5.5% are Hispanic, 2.8% are Asian, 2.1% are two or more races, 0.5% are Native American and 0.1% are Native Hawaiian. For over 150 years, Morg an State University has been an important part of the higher education system in Baltimore City, the State of Maryland, and the nation. Throughout its history, Morgan has served the community with distinction while meeting the educational needs of an incr easingly diverse society. I. Institutional Plan to Improve Cultural Diversity Morgan's motto, \"Growing the Future, Leading the World,\" underlies the development of the University's 2011 -2021 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan focuses on a core set of goals that will build a transformative educational environment enriched by diverse perspectives. Such an environment will ensure a supportive atmosphere that promotes stud ent success, enhances Morgan's status as a doctoral research university, and facilitates the University's contribution to community development. Morgan State University serves as an intellectual and creative resource to the community, state, nation, and world, by supporting, empowering and preparing high quality, diverse graduates to lead the world. A broad diversity of people and ideas are welcomed and supported at Morgan as essential to quality education in a global interdependent society. Morgan St ate University embraces cultural diversity in its broadest sense. Morgan's diversity efforts focus attention to underrepresented racial and ethnic groups who have been marginalized. Additionally, diversity at Morgan also encompasses a commitment to enhanc ing the equity and inclusion of women, those who are economically disadvantaged, and those of different sexual orientations, religions, and abilities. In summary, Morgan's mission is to serve a multi -ethnic and multi -racial student body and to help ensure that a broad segment of the population enjoys the benefits of higher education. Morgan's Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan State University (Diversity Plan) was developed by the University community and approved by the Board of Regents at its May 3, 2011 meeting. As Maryland's public urban university, Morgan is one of the nation's premiere historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). As such, achieving and maintaining a diverse student body, faculty, and staff, is a c ompelling interest and important goal for Morgan. To that end, the Diversity Plan sets forth 33 goals in six core areas: 1) Students (undergraduate, graduate, and non -traditional); 2) Faculty and Staff; 3) Curricular; 4) Socio -economic; 5) Disability; and 6) Community Engagement. (See Table 1). An assessment plan with goals, objectives, anticipated outcomes, measurements/benchmarks, assessment methods, and responsibility was developed for each core area and goal. Successful implementation of the goals in the Diversity Plan requires the coordinated and sustained efforts of all 618 2 members of the University community and the systematic assessment of progress toward the goals. All members of the Morgan community are expected to contribute to the enhancement o f cultural diversity on campus, and some members are responsible for monitoring the University's initiatives and outcomes related to the diversity goals. (See Table 1). The Office of Diversity & Equal Employment Opportunity, the Office of Assessment in A cademic Affairs, and the Office of Institutional Research will use the timelines in the assessment plan to collect, analyze, and report data on the goals and six core areas of the Diversity Plan. Table 1: Summary of Strategic Plan to Enhance Cultural D iversity Major Areas Goals Measure/Benchmark Responsibility Students Undergraduate (UG): Goals 3 -5 Number of UG, GD Institutional Research Graduate (GD): Goals 14 -17 & NT students (ALL) Admissions, Registrar' s Non -Traditional (NT): Goals 18 -21 Office, Deans, Office of Student Disability Support Services Dept & Program offices Graduate School Faculty/Staff Tenure -Track: Goals 1 -2 Number of Faculty Institutional Research Faculty & Staff: Goals 30 -33 Number of Staff Human Resources Climate Survey Dept. & Program offices Academic Affairs, Faculty Affairs and Development Office of Diversity & EEO Curricular General Education Program Curricular Initiatives Academic Affairs (GEP): Goal 29 Assessment of GEP College of Liberal Arts Exchange Program (EP): Goal 28 Study Abroad data Office of Assessment Study Abroad: Goals 26 -27 Int'l Student/Faculty Services Socioeconomic Economic Disadvantaged: Goal 6 Number of UGs Institutional research with family income Financial Aid Office above national mean Disability Students with Disabilities: Professional development Student Disability Support Goals 9 -13 initiative, workshops, Office of Assessment seminars, Academic Facilities Management Support Lab, Feedback Surveys Community Engagement Climate: Goals 22 -25 Community Initiatives Center for Global Studies & Feedback Surveys Int'l Student/ Faculty Services, President, Academic Outreach The total number of undergraduate international students increased by 172% from 219 in AY 2010 to 595 in AY 2019 (Table A -1). 619 3 The total number of graduate international students increased by 43% from 100 in AY 2010 to 143 in AY 2019 ( Table A -2). The total number of Hispanic students enrolled at the undergraduate level increased more than 269% from 59 in AY 2010 to 218 in AY 2019 (Table A -1). The total number of Hispanic students enrolled at the graduate level increased 411% from 9 in AY 2010 to 46 in AY 2019 (Table A -2). The total number of White or Caucasian students enrolled at the graduate level increased 3% from 99 in AY 2010 to 102 in AY 2019 (Table A -2). In an effort to reach new markets, the Office of Undergraduate Admi ssion and Recruitment (OUAR) has expanded its recruitment efforts in out -of-state territories and modified it's in state recruitment philosophy to position the University to continue its enrollment growth. Among the chief strategies employed by Morgan to e nhance diversity is offering a comprehensive program of studies, including programs in the STEM fields, leading to the awarding of degrees at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. The university awarded 88 STEM bachelor's degrees to women at t he undergraduate level in AY 2018 - 2019, which is a 33% increase from 66 in AY 2010 -2011. The university awarded 191 STEM bachelor's degrees to underrepresented minority students in AY 2019, which is a 72% increase from 111 in AY 2011. The total STEM bach elor's degrees awarded at the university increased by 95% in AY 2019 (327) from 168 in AY 2011. At the state level for AY 2017, the most recent data available, Morgan is 1st in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans in civil, elec trical and industrial engineering, architecture, multimedia production and strategic communication, family and consumer science, philosophy and religious studies, social work and sociology; 1st among all campuses in the number of master's degrees awarded t o African -Americans in architecture; 1st among all campuses in the number of doctorates awarded to African Americans in Community College Leadership, Engineering, Higher Education, History, Psychometrics, Public Health, and Social Work; and 3rd among camp uses in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans (IPEDS Completions Data 2016 -2017 Preliminary). At the national level, Morgan is ranked 1st in civil and electrical engineering; 2nd in actuarial science and family and consumer scie nce; 3rd in multimedia production and engineering physics; 4th in architecture and nutritional science; and 5th in industrial engineering in bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans. Morgan is ranked 1st (tied) in landscape architecture; 3rd (tied) in architecture; and 5th in urban transportation in masters degrees awarded to African Americans. At the doctoral level Morgan is ranked 1st in Community College Leadership and Psychometrics; 2nd in Public Health; 2nd (tied) in Engineering and History; and 4th (tied) in Social work in total number of doctoral degrees awarded to African Americans (IPEDS Completions Data 2016 -2017 Preliminary). Morgan State University remains committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse student body and workforce. However, resources (e.g. human and fiscal) continue to be challenges to diversity. There is concern that the University lacks the required resource s as compared to other campuses in Maryland with the same Carnegie designation as an R2 Doctoral Research University. Morgan will continue to seek grants and funding sources at the state and national level to support and fulfill the mission and goals of i ts Diversity Plan. 620 4 II. Efforts to Increase the Numerical Representation and Retention of Traditionally Underrepresented Students, Administrative Staff, and Faculty On an annual and ongoing basis, Morgan State University employs a variety of strat egies and initiatives to foster an inclusive community and to recruit diverse and underrepresented students, faculty, and administrative staff. ADULT AND NON - TRADITIONAL STUDENTS Consistent with its strategic plan goals to diversify its student body, the University has invested heavily in new online degree programs to attract non - traditional students. Currently, Morgan awards ten (10) online degree programs. The degree programs are as follows: 1) Applied Liberal Studies (BS); 2+2 Electrical Engineering (BSEE); 3) Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Nursing to Master of Public Health (RN to BSN to MPH); 4) Business Administration (MBA); 5) Community College Administration, Instruction an d Student Development (M.Ed.); 6) Social Work (MSW); 7) Public Health (MPH); 8) Project Management (MSPM); 9) Electrical Engineering (MSEE); and 10) Community College Leadership (Ed.D.). Morgan also offers five (5) post -baccalaureate online certificate (PB C) programs in the following areas: Advanced Study in Project Management; Advanced National Security; Urban Sustainable Communities; Urban Journalism, and Psychometrics. Quality Matters (QM) and Maryland Online (MOL) In 2016, Morgan executed an annual au tomatically renewing Quality Matters Higher Education Program Subscription Agreement that provides for services, software, tools, publications, and training materials to faculty for developing and offering online courses. Specifically, faculty who want to create online or hybrid course and teach online courses must take two courses: Quality Matters Designing Your Online/Hybrid Course or Applying the QM Rubric; and MSU Teach Online (which is linked to Morgan's Canvas' Learning Management System, Canvas templ ates, and other Morgan Online Tools). Faculty course developers receive 5 weeks of training including 2 weeks of QM course development and 3 weeks of MSU Teach Online. Since 2010, a total of 222 faculty have been trained through the QM rubric and quality s tandard. The increase in the number of faculty trained to develop online courses and to teach online is largely responsible for the dramatic increase in student enrollment in online and hybrid courses over the past decade. Although faculty were being trained to develop and offer online courses even prior to the academic year 2008 - 2009, Morgan Online was not officially constituted as an office within the Division of Academic Outreach and Engagement until January of 2014. The impact of Morgan Online, Maryland Online, and Quality Matters is reflected in the surge in student enrollment in online courses since the 2013 -2014 academic year where enrollment increased from 176 students in hybrid courses and 1,807 students in online courses during the 2013 -2014 academic year to 694 students in hybrid courses and 6253 students in online courses during the 2018 -2019 academic year. The Center for Continuing and Professional Studies (CCPS) is designed to serve the lifelong educational needs of traditional and n on-traditional students pursuing undergraduate, graduate, professional and personal growth aspirations. The CCPS coordinates a broad variety of educational activities and community services for learners from culturally diverse populations from Baltimore C ity, Maryland, nationally, and internationally. Some of the CCPS' programs include the following: The Bernard Osher Scholarship Program provides scholarships to promising students, ages 25 -50, who have experienced an educational gap of five years or mo re and are returning to complete a bachelor's 621 5 degree on a full -time or part -time basis. Since the initial award in 2008 to the Center for Continuing and Professional Studies, the Bernard Osher Foundation has funded 244 scholarships totaling over $1,000,000 dollars. Ninety -four (94) students have graduated as Bernard Osher Scholars. The success of the Osher Scholarship Program has resulted in the funding of a new award, the Crankstart Reentry Scholarship Program, begun in November 2016. This scholarship fu nds an additional 20 adult students, ages 25 -50 who have experienced a break in their education of five years or more and are returning to complete undergraduate degrees. Current Crankstart majors include Social Work, Psychology, Engineering, Computer Scie nce, Education, and Sociology. In March 2018, the Crankstart Foundation has provided a 2 -year agreement of $200,000 to fund the Crankstart Reentry Scholarship Program through 2020. The Improved Opportunities for Parents (IOP) Program provides funding to help adult individuals, especially student -parents, obtain a bachelor's degree. Twenty (20) student -parents, 13 females and 7 males, received IOP funds during the 2017 - 2018 academic year with five graduating from Morgan State Universi ty. TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS Goals 3 -5, 14 -17, and 18 -21 of the Diversity Plan are designed to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented students at Morgan State University. Goals 3 -5 and 14 -16 are designed to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian undergraduate and graduate students. Goal 17 is designed to increase the percentage of international students enrolled at Morgan. Goals 18 -21 are designed to recrui t, admit, and retain a greater number of non -traditional students (over the age of 25). Examples of strategies utilized by the University include: 1) hiring a diversity admissions officer; 2) open house in the fall and spring semesters to engage parents, diverse students, and schools in the recruitment process; 3) campus tours to invite diverse students from different geographic areas to experience campus life; 4) overnight programs that target underrepresented and international students; and 5) enhance mo nitoring and review of applications from underrepresented students. Examples of targeted programs that address underrepresented student recruitment, retention, and graduation are outlined below. Summer Bridge Programs Morgan offers several summer bridg e programs designed to increase student academic success and retention. For example, Morgan State University's Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) sponsors CASA Academy, an alternative admissions program for students who do not meet the SAT /ACT requirements for regular admission. CASA accepts up to 300 students each year, and all participants who successfully complete the summer bridge program are guaranteed admission to the University for the fall semester. The six -week program offers a wi de range of activities including developmental courses, study skills, mandatory tutoring, peer mentoring, academic advising, career exploration, orientation to the campus and its offices and resources, opportunities for personal/social development, and an avenue for parent involvement. In addition, since 2010, CASA has required students to engage in a common reading experience related to a social issue. Division of International Affairs . The mission of the Division of International Affairs is consistent with the mission, and strategic goals of the University, that of preparing diverse and competitive graduates for success in a global, interdependent society. Morgan State University has established over 40 international relationships with institutions of higher learning in countries that include: Brazil, Botswana, Cameroon, China, Cuba, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and Zambia. Our international student population during Academic Year 2018 -2019 622 6 accounted for approximately 738 students from over 60 countries, of which 80% hail from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. As such, the Division of International Affairs is actively seeking to grow our relationships with East and Sub -Saharan Africa, China a nd Southeast Asian nations throughout 2018 - 2024. Among the programs in the Division of International Affairs that support international diversity at Morgan are: The Center for Global Studies and International Education The Office of Study Abroad & Scho lar Exchange HBCU -Brazil (Alliance) Program The Office of International Student and Faculty Services The Fulbright Program The Center for Global Studies and International Education (CGSIE) is the institution's arm for facilitating the university -wide efforts to internationalize the curriculum across disciplines, in a fashion that is consistent with the President's vision of \"Growing the Future and Leading the World!\" To achieve this goal, C GSIE serves as a gateway to the globalization of the local and regional communities and their minority populations. As well, the Center works collaboratively with academic departments to enhance student and faculty development through workshops, study abro ad, internships, exchanges and other relevant international education programs. This thought process incorporates into the Morgan rubric a basic tenet of the Center's efforts in assisting the College/Schools with the provision of an international focus to programs that nurture globally perceptive and competent graduates. Our Commitment to Internationalization. Globalization requires that institutions of higher education graduate globally - competent citizens and professionals. Morgan State is committed to doing this by broadening the scope of student, faculty, and staff awareness of the world in which they live, through travel, experiential and service learning, and collaborative international research at home and abroad. In a post 9/11 world, and for nati onal security reasons, this undertaking becomes even more urgent. As an integral part of the university's goal of providing a holistic education to its students, the Office of Study Abroad & Scholar Exchange is charged with creating an enabling environ ment on campus for students to successfully engage in international experiential learning. In doing so, students have the opportunity to broaden the scope of their knowledge of other languages in particular and cultures in general. To date, over 560 studen ts have participated in either a study/intern/volunteer and/or teach abroad program through one of our third -party affiliates or a faculty -led program. Additionally, the Office supports the exchange of visiting scholars who participate in work -and study - based exchange visitor programs. This exchange of visitors promotes interchange, mutual enrichment, and linkages between research and educational institutions in U.S. and foreign countries. Particularly at Morgan, it helps to diversify our research intere sts and increase mutual understanding between populations of the United States and those of other countries through educational and cultural exchanges. The Office of International Student & Faculty Services is charged with meeting the administrative, advising, and programming needs for nonimmigrant students, staff, and faculty at Morgan State University. Services provided by the Office of International Student & Faculty Services include: Immigration inform ation workshops 623 7 Orientation programs for new international students Employment workshops to provide information on the various types of employment available to F-1 students; campus employment, CPT, OPT and economic hardship applications Assistance with preparing and/or filing initial petitions to include H -1B petitions, program extension, SEVIS school transfer in/out, preparation of depended forms, reinstatement, and other regulatory compliance processes Advising services to the International Student A ssociations and the Morgan State community at large on all immigration -related matters SEVIS reporting to safeguard student status by providing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security with timely and accurate updates of enrollment activities. Collaborat ion with other university international stakeholders to facilitate the infusion of global themes throughout the formal and informal curriculum Facilitation of intercultural programs and activities with the primary aim of exposing the Morgan community to t he importance and advantage of being aware and sensitive to the diversity of cultures in our campus and the wider community. The Fulbright Program. Morgan State University has long been the Fulbright leader among historically Black colleges and universi ties. A total of 143 awards for Fulbright -related grants for study, research, and/or teaching in 44 different countries have been offered to 133 Morgan State University students/ graduates. As well, 75 awards to 41 countries have been offered to 51 Morgan State professors (47) or administrators (4). These awards are made through the Institute of International Education, the U.S Department of Education, and the Council for International Exchange. Fulbright Scholars from Morgan have often stressed not only th e academic advantages of studying in a foreign milieu, but the personal and cultural rewards as well, the enlightenment gained from close contact with new languages and ways of life. The Director of the Fulbright Program is fully committed to ensuring that Morgan students are successful in their international academic pursuits. English as a Second Language (ESL) Program . The ESL Program is committed to providing intensive language instruction and rich local and regional cultural experiences which will em power our students that are learning English as a second language to become successful students in the mainstream classroom and productive members of our community at home and beyond. The Division of International Affairs administers the ESL Program, which consists of three interrelated components: language instruction, cultural immersion, and educational field experiences. Intervention and Support Services for Students . Morgan's 2011 -2021 Strategic Plan includes indicators designed to focus considerable attention on the \"educational attainment gap between the races.\" Consistent with the Strategic Plan, Morgan State University's Office of Student Success and Retention (OSSR) works in collaboration with the various schools, colleges, and academic support programs of the University to provide continuous, quality support for undergraduate students from matriculation to graduation with a focus on academic success and achievement. Through OSRR, the University continues to implement an effective student succes s model, one that includes a comprehensive early alert system, intrusive advising, ongoing tracking and monitoring of student cohorts, transparent and consistent note - taking and specific programs and initiatives designed and delivered to increase student r etention rates and promote degree completion. The work of the OSSR has helped to increase retention and graduation rates, from a 63% (2006 cohort) to a 72% (2017 cohort) retention rate in 2018 and from a 28% (2005 cohort) to a 43% (2013 cohort) graduation rate in 2019. The Office of Student Success and Retention also manages new student and parent orientation, placement testing, Starfish Retention Solutions' Early 624 8 Alert and Connect systems, first -year advisement, financial literacy, alumni mentoring, and a cademic recovery among other programs and services. The Office of Residence Life & Housing (ORL&H) sponsors the Academic Enrichment Program (AEP). This program offers tutorial/study sessions through workshops, seminars, individualized tutoring, and computer tutorial for students residing in a residence hall. The AEP tracks the grades of resident students and provides support as needed. New and returning students who have a G.P.A. below 2.0 are mandated to receive tutoring services. Additionally, a component of the AEP is the International Student ConneXion, which provides academic and campus engagement support services for Morgan's international student population. TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF Morgan remains committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce. (See Tables A -3 and A -4). Morgan's faculty is wellcredentialed faculty and racially and ethnically diverse. This represents a continuation of a long tradition at the University. D iversity is particularly valued by today's collegeage population and Morgan's degree of diversity among members of its faculty differentiates it from most other Maryland campuses. For example, among 705 total faculty (full -time and part -time) at Morgan, 53% (376) are males and 47% (329) are females. African -Americans comprise 48% (337) of the faculty at Morgan. White faculty (100) and International faculty (102) each comprise approximately 14% of the faculty at Morgan. The Office of Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) continues to provide sensitivity/cultural competency training and diversity activities. These activities are designed to: 1) address cultural diversity among students, faculty, and staff; 2) educate the university commun ity about laws governing equal opportunity; 3) reduce discrimination complaints; and 4) create an environment that promotes the recruitment and retention of underrepresented faculty, staff and students. In addition, the EEO office is available to meet with faculty and staff search committees as needed to provide tips on how to recognize and avoid bias and prejudice in the selection process. The Office of Faculty Development , a unit under the auspices of the Division of Academic Affairs, provides opportuni ties for faculty to explore issues around diversity and cultural competency/sensitivity through faculty institutes, conferences, workshops, seminars, and trainings. These experiences foster dialogue and collaboration among faculty of diverse backgrounds, orientations, and perspectives and serve to promote retention of underrepresented faculty. Additionally, orientation sessions for new faculty integrate attention to diversity issues. The Office of Faculty Development also provides faculty with mini -grant opportunities to: 1) support curricular development in all disciplines, with particular attention given to issues of diversity and cultural competency; 2) develop interdisciplinary and cultural diversity initiatives; and 3) promote faculty development. Additionally, promotion and tenure training is provided to support and retain underrepresented faculty. Through the Office of Public Relations and Communications , the University has expanded its advertisement efforts in order to reach a more diverse appl icant pool. Advertisements are regularly placed in various publications such as the Professional Woman's Magazine, Hispanic Network, U.S. Veterans Magazine, Diverseability, and the Black EOE Journal. III. Efforts to Create Positive Interactions and C ultural Awareness 625 9 Morgan State University utilizes ongoing cultural training programs, curricular initiatives, and community partnerships to create positive interactions and cultural competence and awareness within the University community. Examples of the initiatives related to the aforementioned processes are the focus of this section. CURRICULAR INITIATIVES Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) at Morgan State University opened in May 2017. It is a unit under the auspices of t he Division of Academic Affairs. The overall goal of the Center is to enhance the quality of teaching through the delivery of innovative and socially inclusive, active learning environments that promote greater student retention and success. CETL assists f aculty, staff, and graduate teaching assistants (TAs) in creating innovative and active learning environments in their classrooms. Its mission is to promote best practices in teaching that celebrate diversity, equity, and inclusiveness and lead to student success. CETL's work is guided by the scholarship on teaching and learning that is in turn grounded in the research in the field of faculty educational development. During AY2018 -19, 43 different workshops/presentations/webinars or classroom observations were conducted that covered 26 topics and included 22 speakers. The 293 Morgan participants in these events were full - time and part -time faculty and staff, as well as doctoral students --three times as many that attended the previous year. Innovative even ts included a Friday morning 'Podcast and Bagels' discussion session, a virtual online panel discussion featuring eight journal editors from across the country, and Department Chair training. The General Education Program establishes a number of signifi cant goals and high expectations for Morgan students. Students who complete the program are expected to exhibit the following outcomes as it relates to cultural competence and awareness: Demonstrate integrated knowledge of the heritage, culture, social s tructures, and accomplishments of autochthonous African cultures and African -American Civilization; Demonstrate a global perspective and integrated knowledge of the heritage, culture, social structures and accomplishments of one Non -Western Civilization; and Demonstrate integrated knowledge of the political, social, and economic development of American society in relation to the world, of the history and geography of America and the world, of civic affairs and responsibilities, of personal, interpersonal, intergroup and intra -group relations, and of learning, work habits, and career choices. The College of Liberal Arts offers a minor in the area of Women's and Gender Studies . These courses provide students with the opportunity to explore gender and sex uality, while paying particular attention to how those constructs are affected by race, religion, class, and nationality. The program in Women's and Gender Studies works collaboratively with the University at large, as well as with local and national orga nizations by engaging in varied academic and advocacy initiatives. The Division of Academic Affairs collaborates with deans, chairs, faculty, and student organizations to ensure curriculum diversity at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Examples of data collected include, but are not limited to, the following: Study abroad initiatives Diversity or multicultural initiatives Diversity of educational experiences available to faculty and students General Education Program and curriculum diversity initiatives: 626 10 o Undergraduates' knowledge of diversity issues, understanding of pluralistic societies, engagement with peers from diverse backgrounds, and the development of competencies for success in a multicultural world; o Interpersonal communication and acquiring the abilities to relate to and work effectively with diverse groups of people; and o Social re sponsibility and tolerance and respect for diverse groups of people and a disposition towards responsible citizenship and building a connection to the community. First year experiences related to diversity Service and community -based learning experiences Internship opportunities in diverse settings Capstone experiences and projects As an accredited academic institution, MSU's Center for Continuing and Professional Studies (CCPS) offers Continuing Education Units, Professional Development Hours (PDHs), and non-credit courses in order to meet the workforce development and training needs of a variety of individuals and organizations from around the country. Through partnerships with organizations such as, American Contract Compliance Association, Blacks in Government, Ministerial Interfaith Group, Women of Color in STEM, Black Engineer of the Year Award (BEYA) STEM Global Competitiveness, and Grandparents and Caregiver training opportunities are provided for individuals seeking professional develop ment. Several options are offered for course delivery, including face to face, blended, and through specialized intensive institutes. Through a partnership with ed2go, anyone may enroll in online non -credit classes focused on workforce readiness, professi onal development and personal enrichment activities. These training programs prepare individuals, including adults with disabilities, to launch or advance a career by developing new skills and knowledge for today's competitive job market. Morgan State University is the premier source for individuals seeking academic and personal enrichment courses. A variety of summer programs operated on campus this year, offering classes and workshops in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (ST EM) fields, history, transportation, wrestling, football, volleyball and art. Many of the programs focus on recruiting students from diverse linguistic, cultural, and economic backgrounds with the goal of encouraging talented individuals from historically underrepresented groups to attend Morgan State. UNIVERSITY -BASED OUTREACH INITIATIVES The Office of Diversity & Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO Office) is charged with the day -to-day implementation of the non -discrimination policies of Morgan State U niversity. One of the major responsibilities of the EEO Office is to educate the University community about affirmative action and equal employment opportunity laws, and to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements in this regard. The E EO Office also collaborates with all units at the university (e.g. colleges, schools and divisions) to ensure successful implementation of the Diversity Plan, and in turn, create a more diverse community. The Office of Diversity & Equal Employment Opportu nity (EEO) will continue to expand educational efforts relative to diversity and incorporate online training program(s) to ensure ongoing educational opportunities are available to the University community. The Office of Student Disability Support Servi ces (SDSS) a unit under the auspices of Academic Affairs is dedicated to assisting all students with disabilities to accomplish their scholastic and career goals by supporting their academic and advocacy skills. The Office is committed to providing all ser vices and 627 11 operating programs in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. Students with a disability register with SDSS for reasonable accommodations. The goal of SDSS to su pport the academic success of students with disabilities by continuously working to eliminate the physical, technical, and attitudinal barriers that can impede progression to graduation. Reasonable accommodations at the university include, but are not limi ted to; housing, dining, mobility, classroom and learning support services (i.e. note -takers, interpreters, technology, etc.), testing services for course examinations and quizzes and sign language and transcription services. To ensure access and implemen tation of reasonable accommodations, SDSS collaborates closely with various departments on campus such as Residence Life and Housing, Design and Construction, Records and Registration and more. Morgan has a large population of international students regis tered with SDSS, which serves to create collaboration between SDSS and the Office of International Students and Faculty Services. SDSS also provides outreach to local high schools and participates in orientation events on -campus to share information on re asonable accommodations for students with disabilities. In addition, SDSS focuses on faculty and staff training both within individual departments and with The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. Collaboration efforts are made with all depart ments on campus as well as with faculty to ensure students with disabilities are supported. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Ally (LGBTQA) Advisory Council. The LGBTQA Advisory Council was established by the University President, Dr. David Wi lson, in 2013 to assess and make recommendations for improving the campus climate and resources for LGBTQA students, faculty and staff. In addition, its charge was to promote personal, physical, and emotional safety while identifying ways to create educat ional and social opportunities and inclusion of issues of sexuality and gender identity and expression in recruitment, accommodations, academic, and social programming at Morgan State University. The LGBTQA Advisory Council continues to work on its Sustain ed Inclusivity Action Plan focused on facilitating LGBTQA inclusion within nine (9) areas at the University: Institutional Infrastructure and Policy; Academic Affairs; Student Affairs; Recruitment, Retention and Alumni Efforts; Housing and Residence Life; Campus Safety; Counseling and Health; Academic and Community Outreach; and Faculty and Staff Support. Through these efforts, the LGBTQA Advisory Council continues to make strides to ensure that sexual orientation and gender identity and expression issue s are included in the framework of diversity at Morgan State University. The University is fully committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment by providing trans -inclusive programs and services and assessing University policies and procedures to ensure specific attention to the development of policies that are sensitive to individuals within the LGBTQA community. Further, Morgan State University will be re -introducing its \"Safe Space \" program , which will offer strategies for preparing students, faculty, and staff to be effective allies to the LGBTQ community. COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS . Morgan continues to serve as a catalyst for positive change in the community. The University works with local, regional, national, and international governmental and private entities to fulfill its Diversity Plan. Examples of community initiatives include, but are not limited to, the following: The Morgan Community Mile Initiative is a university -community partnership that involves residents, busine sses, public agencies, and other stakeholders in making the community a better 628 12 place. The five priority areas for the initiative are: 1) health and safety; 2) youth and education; 3) environment; 4) live -work -spend in the community; and 5) strengthening University/community relations. Morgan's Upward Bound Program provides first -generation, low -income high school students with access to postsecondary education as full participants. The Upward Bound is designed to enhance the academic and personal skills of qualifying Baltimore City Public School Students (BCPS) whi le preparing them while in high school for college admission, retention and graduation. During the third week of November every year, Morgan celebrates International Education Week (IEW). This campus wide celebration is an opportunity to celebrate the b enefits of international education and exchange worldwide. Morgan State students, faculty, staff and neighboring communities are encouraged to attend and participate in the week of events. The theme for 2018 was \"Building Our Legacy Together: Expanding Glo bal Engagement at HBCUs\" . The International Student Organization led by the Office of International Student and Faculty Services hosts the FEVER Program . FEVER is an annual inter -cultural showcase and celebration of the various cultural groups within the Morgan State Community. Expression is done through the art forms of song, dance, and drama. In a broad sense, participants are drawn from America, Afr ica, Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. While FEVER is primarily a student driven event, every effort is made to partner with faculty, staff and community groups. The Saudi Student Association and the Office of International Student and Fac ulty Services hosted the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission's Graduation for 12 schools in the Maryland, DC and Virginia area. Approximately 1,700 Saudi guests visited the campus for this event. The University's Office of Community Service was created to de velop and implement dynamic community service programs that boldly address the educational, social, cultural and recreational needs of the under -represented, educationally \"at -risk\" and the homeless residents in the Baltimore metropolitan area. By organizi ng multidimensional, holistic programs, which involve university students, faculty, staff, community organizations, government agencies, businesses, school children, and parents, the Office of Community Service positively influences the educational, social , cultural and recreational problems of Baltimore's inner city population. While each of the community service programs vary in size, structure, and focus, they share the same goal of improving the educational challenges of Baltimore's urban population. IV. Other Central Diversity Initiatives. In January 2018, the University administered its first Diversity Climate Survey designed to understand student and staff members' experiences with diverse individuals and viewpoints. Initial analysis of the surv ey results have occurred. The results will be used to enhance and improve campus diversity efforts. In recognition of the growing religious diversity among the faculty, staff and students within the University community, the University chapel offers ch aplain services for various Baptist; Roman Catholic; Intervarsity; and Apostolic. V. Hate Crime Reporting. Campus -based hate crime incidents are reported to and investigated by the Universit y's Police and Public Safety Department. In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, the University publishes an annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report. The report includes data on al l campus -based hate crime incidents. Copies of the report are made available in hard copy and are posted on the University's website. 629 13 APPENDIX Table A -2010 AY-2016 AY-2017 AY-2018 # % Male Femal e # % Male Female # % Male Female # e e African American/Black Alaska Native 12 0.2 4 8 16 0.3% 6 10 10 0.2% 4 6 8 Asian 46 0.7 25 21 40 0.6% 27 13 58 0.9% 41 17 56 Hispanic/Latino 59 1 20 39 226 3.6% 91 135 220 3.5% 89 131 215 White 102 1.6 49 53 114 1.8% 54 60 120 1.9% 70 50 123 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 0 0 0 0 5 0.1% 3 2 5 0.1% 4 1 4 Two or more races 0 0 0 0 215 3.4% 93 122 190 3.0% 81 109 203 International 219 3.5 122 97 416 6.6% 338 78 724 11.4% 622 102 780 Did not self -identify 0 0 0 0 51 0.8% 28 23 144 2.3% 69 75 96 Total Comparison Baseline: AY -2010 AY-2016 AY-2017 # % Male Female # % Male Female # % Male African American/Black 792 77.1 294 498 887 63.1% 318 569 847 63.8% 307 American Indian or Alaska Native 2 0.2 1 1 1 12.5% 0 1 0 0.0% 0 Asian 24 2.3 14 10 25 1.8% 12 13 27 2.0% 11 Hispanic/Latino 9 0.9 7 2 53 3.8% 22 31 46 3.5% 14 White 99 9.6 45 54 132 9.4% 61 71 129 9.7% 58 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 0 0 0 0 0 0.0% 0 0 0 0.0% 0 Two or more races 0 0 0 0 40 2.8% 13 27 40 3.0% 13 International 100 9.7 51 49 260 18.5% 141 119 228 17.2% 116 Did not self -identify 1 0.1 0 0 8 0.6% 3 5 10 0.8% 3 Total 1406 100.0% 1327 Faculty Baseline: AY -2010 AY-2016 AY-2017 # % Male Femal e # % Male Femal e # % Male e e e African American/Black 324 59.3 175 149 301 46.5% 154 147 339 48.6% 173 American Indian or Alaska Native 11 2 8 3 2 0.3% 1 1 3 0.4% 2 Asian 28 5.1 22 6 34 5.2% 26 8 35 5.0% 27 Hispanic/Latino 5 0.9 4 1 9 1.4% 6 3 10 1.4% 7 White 113 20.7 73 40 97 15.0% 56 41 102 14.6% 63 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 1 0.2 1 0 1 0.2% 1 0 1 0.1% 1 Two or more races 7 1.3 3 4 14 2.2% 7 7 12 1.7% 6 International 57 10.4 33 24 77 11.9% 44 33 92 13.2% 57 Did not self -identify 0 0 0 0 113 17.4% 59 54 104 14.9% 52 Total 546 100% 319 227 648 100% 354 294 698 100% 388 632 16 -4: Staff Comparison Baseline: AY -2010 AY-2016 AY-2017 # % Male Femal e # % Male Femal e # % Male Femal e e e African American/Black 962 87.8 463 499 950 69.8% 416 534 1051 70.5% 469 582 American Indian or Alaska Native 3 0.3 1 2 6 0.4% 2 4 4 0.3% 2 2 Asian 16 1.5 6 10 24 1.8% 8 16 24 1.6% 10 14 Hispanic/Latino 10 0.9 4 6 40 2.9% 16 24 43 2.9% 18 25 White 64 5.8 40 24 54 4.0% 30 24 72 4.8% 43 29 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 2 0.2 0 2 1 0.1% 0 1 1 0.1% 0 1 Two or more races 12 1.1 5 7 24 1.8% 7 17 31 2.1% 12 19 International 25 2.3 13 12 124 9.1% 62 62 133 8.9% 65 68 Did not self -identify 2 0.2 1 1 138 10.1% 70 68 131 8.8% 62 69 633 St. Mary's College of Maryland Cultural Diversity Report 2019 634 1 Introduction Diversity and inclusion at St. Mary's College of Maryland (SMCM) are a foundational tenet of the overall institutional mission . Our work is marked by our intention to \"foster... a community dedicated to honesty, civility, and integrity \" as stated in the SMCM mission statement . The Office for Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (IDE) is committed to engaging the entire campus with a robust slate of activities aimed at progr am design, curriculum reform, alumni engagement, policy creation and general campus climate reform . Additionally, promoting and embracing cultural diversity and cultural competence among SMCM constituents is essential to the success of the institution as the nation's public honors college; hence, inclusion, diversity and equity are prominent theme s that recur throughout the 2016 -19 Strategic Plan . During 2018 -19, t he IDE Office was led on an interim basis by Dr. Ken Coopwood, Sr., a nationally recognized, four -time chief diversity office r (CDO) in higher education. During his tenure, Dr. Coopwood focused on ensuring continuity of current campus -wide training initiatives as well as beginning to apply formal structure to the SMCM diversity administration functionality. The incom ing Vice President for Inclusive Diversity and Equity /CDO, Dr. Tayo Clyburn, will continue and expand on these initiatives throughout the 2019 -20 academic year and beyond. Through out 2018 -19, through t he collaborative efforts of the AVPDI/CDO, members of the IDE workgroups , and various other campus members, SMCM continued to demonstrate its commitment to recruiting and retaining a diverse student and employee p opulation, as evidenced by various policy reviews and additions, recruitment strategies, curricular offerings, co -curricular and professional development opportunities, and assessment efforts. While t he 201 9-20 academic year will be a year of transition as we welcome a new CDO, we also expect to expand and deepen cultural diversity efforts involving faculty and staff collaboration, student integration, and administration engagement. Highlights of the 2018 -2019 efforts are summarized in this report; links are provided for more detail. I. St. Mary's College of Maryland's Cultural Diversity Plan SMCM's 2016 -19 Strategic Plan highlights its focus on serving a diverse student and em ployee population through infusing inclusion, diversity, and equity (IDE) into various aspects of SMCM . An abbreviated summary of IDE -related objectives in the plan follows: Goal 1: Attract intellectually ambitious students who thrive in and respect a diverse, collaborative learning community. This will be partially accomplished through increasing diversity among the student body (Objective 1); diversifying course offerings related to wellness, diversity, leadership, and financial literacy (Objective 2); and enhancing the academic and social integration of students in the campus environment (Objective 3). Goal 2: Engage students in a rigorous, experiential, flexible, and innovative academic environment that capitalizes on our unique geographical location. This will be partially accomplished by promoting a community and academic environment that embodies the princip les of diversity and inclusion on which we were founded (Objective 4). In so doing, the campus will inventory its learning opportunities (via course offerings and workshop/training opportunities) for diversity -related 635 2 content and pedagogical strategies as well as create a system for developing additional opportunities/offerings and a long -term plan for institution -wide IDE efforts. Goal 3: Attract and retain a diverse staff and faculty who achieve excellence across the liberal arts in the teaching, schol arship, creative works, and practice of their disciplines. Toward this end, SMCM will increase its efforts to recruit/hire a diverse employee population (Objective 1) along with expanding efforts to create an inclusive environment that values and optimizes the strengths of a diverse workplace while supporting employees' professional excellence, personal well -being, and ability to thrive on campus (Objective 2). Goal 4: Graduate prepared, responsible, and thoughtful global citizens. To accomplish this, SMCM will promote inclusion, diversity, and equity (via increased IDE initiatives and professional development opportunities) to engage students in (and assist employees in working with each other and students while) challenging and abating injustice consisten t with the St. Mary's Way (Objective s 3 and 4). Increase the four -year graduation rate for underrepre sented (racial/ethnic minority and first - generation college) students. Note: Although this objective is not explicitly listed in the Strategic Plan, SMCM is committed to supporting efforts aimed at enhancing retention and graduation rates of th ese student population s. II. Recruitment and Retention of a Diverse Student Body, Faculty, and Staff As documented in SMCM 's annual Managing For Results (MFR) repor t to the Maryland Department of Budget and Management and the annual Performance Accountability Report (PAR) to the Maryland Higher Education Commission, SMCM has established a strong record of high retention and graduation rates for historically underrepr esented students among Maryland's pu blic colleges and universities . Guiding these successes are SMCM 's current strategic goals for recruitment of underrepresented minorities (25% of the entering class ), out -of-state students (10%), first -generation students (20%), and students who receive Pell Grants (20%). Recent performance on these goals and related recruitment strategies can be found in SMCM 's MFR and PAR documents and are briefly summarized below. As important as it is to attend to the diversity of our student body, SMCM is equally committed to having a diverse employee population (faculty and staff) . Hence, SMCM has set a goal, published in the MFR and PAR, to strive for diversity in the faculty and staff so that the composition reflects the aspired diversity of the student body. After having met and exceeded the previous faculty g oal of 15% of full - time faculty belonging to minority groups, this goal was revised in 2016 to be even more aspirational and closer to the student target. The current goals are for 20% of total full-time faculty and 28% of total full-time staff to be from minority group s, and for 30% of all new hires to be from minority groups . Strategies and pr ogress toward accomplishing these goals can be found in SMCM 's MFR and PAR documents and are briefly summarized below. A. Recruitment and retention of a diverse student body St. Mary's College's mission to promote access to underrepresented students includes recruiting and retaining students from all racial and ethnic groups as well as being sensitive to the needs of first - 636 3 generation college students and those from diverse socio -economic circumstances. Toward that end, in 2018 -19, several campus offices engaged in multiple efforts in the areas of outreach, financial aid, marketing, and external partner ships. Outreach efforts in the Office of Admissions included a continued presence at secondary schools with significant populations of underrepresented students; attending a wide variety of college fairs an d workshops , including several organized by or for underrepresented or first -generation students; and providing transportation to underrepresented students to visit campus . The Office collaborated with the SMCM DeSousa -Brent Scholars Program , a program for underrepresented students who are a good fit for the College , to increase new student capacity in the program by 50%, from 40 to 60 incoming students . The Office of Alumni Relations hosted gatherings with alumni and President Jordan to address ways alumni can assist in recruitment and mentoring of prospective and current underrepresented students. The Black Alumni Chapter in particular hosted mentoring events and panel discussions. Launching in Fall 2019 , the Office of Alumni Relations will engage alumni in the recruitment process through a prospective student referral program. The Landers Scholar s program, a new full -ride scholarshi p for underrepresented students, was launched with four recipients in Fall 2018 and fundraising is underway to ensure this program is endowed in perpetuity. Application and enrollment fee waivers were continued for low income and first-generation applicants . In Fall 2017, President Jordan established the First -Generation Student Initiative , a program enabling students who are the first in their families to attend college (like President Jordan) to be part of an on - campus s upport network including other first -generation students and faculty . This year, the web services team continued to improve the SMCM website to ensure accessibility by disabled individuals, and to showcase online image ry that reflects the diverse nature of the campus. Those effort s were also carried over into the launch of the new brand initiative, naming SMCM as The National Public Honors College and describing its distinctive new LEAD (Learning through Experiential and Applied Learning) undergraduate core curriculum. The web pages of the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity were redesigned to reflect a new theme, StRIDE (St. Mary's Resource for Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity). In addition, the Office of Marketing widely publicized many events, programs , and faculty, staff and student accomplishments highlighting diversity of experiences and backgrounds, including the design selection process for the \"A Commemorative to Enslaved Peoples of Southern Mar yland\" project; the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Prayer Breakfast; the annual Math Girls day for middle school girls; and the inaugural Mulberry Music Festival. SMCM also worked to maintain e xternal partnerships , and seek new ones, to aid in supporting students from all backgrounds. In February 2019, SMCM became a member of the Coalition for College Access , a national initiative of institutions committed t o making college a reality for all high school students. SMCM also continued its relationship with Human Capital Research Corporation to develop and implement financial aid modeling, and continued partnerships with the College Boun d Foundation , Strive for College , and the American Talent Initiativ e to support the recruitment of students from Baltimore City, first-generation students, and high achieving low -income students, respectively. 637 4 In 2018 -19, SMCM continued to offer several academic programs supporting and enriching the education of underrep resented students, including the DeSousa -Brent Scholars Program , STEM Emerging Scholars Programs , and the STEM Navigators Scholarship Program . Faculty and staff, in collaboration with the Office of Student Support Services , also continue to utilize the B eacon Student Success program to coordinate communication among all faculty and staff who are involved in each student's academic and co -curricular pursuits. Last year, SMCM recruited a first -year class for Fall 2018 that met or exceeded the target for t he percentage of minority students for the sixth year in a row (see Table 1 below) . The Fall 2018 entering class also included 21 % first -generation college students, exceeding the target. Pell recipients comprised 17% of entering first -year students, falli ng short of this goal for the first time in four years. Progress on metrics of retention and graduation, for all students and for underrepresented students, is detailed and discussed in SMCM 's MFR and PAR documents . Table 1. Characteristics of entering students, Fall 2012 t Fall 2018 FA12 FA13 FA14 FA15 FA16 and retention of a diverse faculty and staff Several strategies continued to be implemented in 2018-19 to work toward attracting and retaining a diverse faculty and staff, which is also a prominent aspect of the Strategic Plan . SMCM expanded its external recruitment venues (web sites, trade publications, consortiums, etc.) to improve efforts to attract applications from women and underrepresented professionals. The Office of Human Resources updated the Affirmative Action Plan and con tinued to utilize the plan to guide recruitment and hiring practices, and to inform external partners of the institution's intent to diversify. The hiring processes continued to include search committee training, auditing of committee compliance with the C ollege's hiring processes and the utilization of the talent management platform, Interfolio. Updates and progress on all efforts were shared with the President and the Executive Committee. The Office of Human Resources hosted the State of Maryland 2019 EEO Retreat, commemorating ten (10) years of educating, empowering and leading. All new faculty and staff participate in orientation and other essential onboarding processes, which are tailored to the particular needs of the faculty and staff involved. The Office of Human Resources developed the College's staff mentoring program, and continues to work with the Staff Senate to develop a method to pair mentees with mentors. Final implementation will promote diversity, improve retention, and increase loyalty, performance and productivity. New faculty seminars and f aculty mentoring programs begin at the start of the academic year and extend throughout the first and second 638 5 years. In response to faculty requests, additional professional development conversations h ave been added for pre -tenure faculty past the first year of hire, addressing issues such as work/life balance and building a supportive network within and beyond campus. All faculty mentors receive introductory welcome notes specifying the specific benefits of the cohort model for supporting and retaining underrepresented groups within the faculty, and prompting them to be mindful of the addit ional stressors placed on women and underrepresented groups as new faculty navigate their first year in the position. These strategies have been successful in moving the institution toward a more diverse faculty and staff. For example, the proportion of full-time (non -faculty) staff who are members of a minority group (individuals identifying as Hispanic/Latinx, Black/African -American, Asian, Native American/Alaskan, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) rose five percentage points in two years, from 24% in 2016 -17 to 29% in 2018 -19 (see Table 2 below) . Meeting these goals for faculty has been more challenging. Although in Fall 2017, an impressive 43% (6 of 14) of newly hired tenure -track faculty members were members of minority groups, none of the six in coming t enure -track faculty in Fall 2018 had minority status. On a positive side, r etention of underrepresented faculty members has been strong in recent years; since 2009, 90% (9/10) of minority faculty members were retained through the third -year review milestone, compared to 79% (30/38) of all faculty; and 70% (7/10 ) of minority faculty members earned tenure after the sixth year , compared to 67% (22/33) of all faculty . Table 2 . Percent Minority Full -time Faculty and St aff, Fall 2012 through Fall 2018 FA12 FA13 FA14 FA15 FA16 FA17 FA18 Promote Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness St. Mary's College is committed to providing learning opportunities (in and outside the classroom) that enhance each member's ability to positively interact with diverse individuals while creating a strong sense of community in which all members thrive and are successful. This commitment is evident in diversity -focused professional development of employees , campus -wide diversity trainings, curricular offerings, and social support for underrepresented groups, all of which enable campus members to meaningfully contribute to an educational and work environment that embraces IDE. The 2018 -19 academic year saw the continuation of the two-stage, campus -wide DiversitySMCM program, a diversity training program for faculty, staff, and students. The program incl uded an online training module offered by DiversityEDU, paired with highly interactive in -person group sessions to discuss ways to apply the module' s contents. The combined program captures three key aspects of social justice/chan ge: awareness raising, knowledge acquisition, and skill development/application. High numbers of faculty, staff, and students participated in the widely publicized training in 2018 -19; for example, 80% of all employees (393 of 493) and 92 % of new students 443 of 483 ) completed the 639 6 training . Assessment tools were developed to identify the degree to which participants associate d specific behaviors to program concepts. Results from surveys of faculty, staff, and students suggested that participants comprehended a majority of assessed concepts across the content areas, including Understanding Diversity and Inclusion, Understanding Diversity Science, and Care for the Person. These assessment s will be used to refine the overall training experience and target areas for growth in general campus response to bias, hate, and anti -diversity activity. Several ne w initiatives were implemented in 2018 -19. An All-Campus Community Conversation event was held in January 2019, where faculty, staff, and students gathered to discuss topics suggested by campus community members regarding aspects of inclusion across campus . Faculty, staff and students were also invited to join more informal monthly gatherings called \" DiversiTeas \" to discuss targeted topics of interest, including identity and cultural appropriation. All campus members were invited to contribute inspiring quotations for a campus -warming activity called Diversity Landmarks , in which a series of signs were \"planted\" along highly trafficked campus sidewalks and entryways to promote individual and group diversity awareness and heighten a sense of community. Finally, student fellows in the Office of Inclusion, Dive rsity and Equity assisted with multiple events and efforts throughout the year, including hosting events, working with the Student Government Association, liaising with the Executive Council, and mentoring first -year students. Looking forward, training an d professional opportunities will continue for faculty and staff, as well as new approaches to cultural training for students, addressing areas such as intersectionality, intergroup relations, and connections between behaviors and the college mission. Thes e efforts will be collaborations between the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity; the Division of Student Affairs; and the Office of Human Resources. A. Cultural Training Programs for Faculty and Staff In addition to the two -stage campus -wide diversity training program described above , multiple internal and external training opportunities were available for faculty and staff. These trainings included opportunities for campus members to increase their knowledge and skills in working with multicu ltural, underrepresented and underserved students (e.g., students of color, LGBTQIA, neurodiverse, varying physical and psychological functioning, etc.) as well as ways to address sexual assault issues , including prevention and response . These efforts were spearheaded by staff in the Wellness Center , the Office of Student Support Services , and the Title IX Coordinator. In addition, the Office of Human Resources collaborated with the Title IX Coordinator to develop and begin to implement a comprehensive sexual harassment prevention training program in complian ce with Maryland law HB 1423. B. Curricular Initiatives Promoting Diversi ty in the Classroom SMCM 's Core Curriculum includes two requirements that are key to enhancing cultural diversity as a component of the educational experience. One of these is a course in International Languages and Cultures \u2014 a subject explicitly taught at St. Mary's College in such a way as to embed language study in a study of cultu re. The second requirement is called \"Cultural Perspectives,\" and includes classes designed to help students better recognize the ways their own culture shapes their thinking and the ways in which culture more generally shapes an individual's world view. C ourses might examine theories 640 7 of race and ethnicity, explore the experiences of people and societies in various cultures, or investigate diverse issues related to both globalization and the variability of experiences within particular cultures. During the 2018 -19 year, the College continued its efforts to improve both curricular and pedagogical supports for diverse students. SMCM hired the inaugural director of its new Center for Inclusive Teaching and Learning . The CITL will focus on providing professional development opportunities for faculty and staff to employ high impact practices with a diverse student population ( e.g., neurodiverse/neurodivergent students, students from underrepresented groups). The CITL has already begun providing such services; these include a restructuring of our Teaching Excellence Workshops into an Inclusive and Innovative Instruction Conference , with a focus on critical issues pertaining to the implementation and assessment of inclusive classroom practices. In addition, last year SMCM faculty endorsed the framework for a new Core Curriculum, which includes a revision of our Cultural Perspectives requirement. This revision builds on the work of the Social Justice Workgroup , which developed learning outcomes and proposed strategies needed to support a social justice requ irement in the curriculum . Finally, two departments have continued their work with the Council for Undergraduate Research's Transformat ions Project . This four -year grant supports the implementation of scaffolded major curricula that fosters the development of skills students need to pursue undergraduate research. One of the main aims of the grant is to show how such curricular transforma tions will increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups in undergraduate research. C. Co-curricular Programming for Students In addition to the two -stage campus -wide diversity training program described above, multiple offices and departments offered trainings, workshops, programming, events, and services designed to support students from diverse populations, and to enhance camp us members' capacity to integrate and collaborate with diverse individuals. Diversity -related programming was offered by campus offices including the Wellness Center and the Office of Student Support Services , and by numerous student groups and organizations including the Student Government Association, the Black Student Union, LGBTQ IA Student Services , Multi cultural Advocacy and Partnership for Progress (MAPP), the Cultural Dance Club, the Jewish Student Union, and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. IV. Campus Statement of the Process for Reporting Hate -Based Crimes Hate crimes and bias -motivated incidents may be violations of SMCM 's Student Code of Conduct or Employee Handbook as well as violations of law. SMCM encourages anyone who is the victim or who witnesses a hate crime or a bias -motivated incident to report it to the Office of Public Safety, the Office of Human Resources or the Title IX C oordinator (for crimes or bias -motivated incidents based on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation). Any crimes that are reported to SMCM that meet the definition of a hate crime under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1092, et.seq. (1990) (\"Clery Act\"), Title IX Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, et. seq. (1972) (\"Title IX\"), and the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of 2013 (\"VAWA\"), are reporte d monthly to the Maryland State Police via the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) system, and reported in the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report in accordance with the Clery Act. 641 8 The St. Mary's Cou nty Sheriff's Office (\"Sheriff's Office\") may take the lead on investigating hate crimes. In accordance with Title IX and the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") between SMCM and the Sheriff's Office, if the victim of sexual violence elects not to pursue criminal action or chooses to remain anonymous, the Sheriff's Office will not conduct an in vestigation until such time the victim requests a criminal investigation be initiated. Depending on the circumstances, SMCM may also conduct its own investigation (e.g., allegations of violations of SMCM 's Policy Against Sexual Misconduct or allegations of violations of the Code of Conduct or Employee Handbook). Where appropriate, SMCM will defer investigation until the Sheriff's Office has conducted its investigation in accordance with the MOU. Criminal charges may only be instit uted by the State's Attorney. SMCM may also pursue a disciplinary action against a student or an employee of SMCM , including sanctions up to and includin g probation, suspension, expulsion, or termination of employment. In addition, SMCM has implemented a Bias Response Team to assist individuals or targeted groups with options to address bias -motivated incidents and to develop community responses. See the Bias Incident Response web site for more information regarding SMCM 's Bias Response Team. V. Conclusion St. Mary's College of Maryland remains committed to the pursuit of an inclusively diverse and equitable campus community, which aligns with the foundational concepts of tolerance that were set forth by the original Maryland colonists. Our mission is to ensure that underrepresented stud ents have full access to the SMCM liberal arts experience , which includes supporting students with need -based financial aid, and SMCM is dedicated to exploring means to bridge the gaps in access. SMCM recognizes that promoting cultural diversity is essen tial to the mission of the institution and to its long -term sustainability , as detailed in the 2016 -19 Strategic Plan . President Jordan is firmly committed to improving SMCM 's ability to recruit, retain and enhance the success of a diverse student and empl oyee population. Toward that end, SMCM has implemented new approaches and programs to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, faculty, and staff, resulting in increased diversification in all three populations in recent years. SMCM will cont inue to explore ways to ensure inclusion and diversity are infused throughout all aspects of the academic, co -curricular, and occupational experiences for all campus members. 642Independent Colleges and Universities 6431Cultural Diversity Report 2019Maryland Independent College and University Association MICUA Capitol Technology University Goucher College Hood College Johns Hopkins University Loyola University Maryland Maryland Institute College of Art McDaniel College Mount St. Mary's University Notre Dame of Maryland University St. John's College Stevenson University Washington Adventist University Washington College 6442About MICUA THE MARYLAND INDEPENDENT COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ASSOCIATION is a member-driven organization devoted to serving the interests of independent higher education and supporting the work of campus leaders throughout the State. Established in 1971, the Association provides services to meet the needs of independent higher education and fosters cooperative efforts among its member institutions and all segments of higher education. As the voice of independent higher education in Maryland, MICUA seeks to inform the broader public about its member institutions and the vital importance of independent colleges and universities to the future of our State and nation. The State of Maryland has maintained a partnership with its independent colleges and universities for over 230 years, beginning with the charters granted to Washington College in 1782 and St. John's College in 1784. The first State operating grant for higher education was awarded to Washington College in 1782. For more than two centuries, the State has providedline-item appropriations for land, campus buildings, operating expenses, and equipment. Today, the primary State support for independent higher education is through the Joseph A. Sellinger Aid Program, which was established in 1973. A diverse and distinctive group of 13 State-aided institutions constitutes MICUA's membership. These public-purpose institutions offer students a broad spectrum of educational opportunities. Some common features stand out. From the smallest to the largest, Maryland's independent colleges and universities offer an education characterized by small classes and by close interaction between skilled faculty and motivated students. Every MICUA institution offers quality undergraduate education to a diverse student body, and increasingly institutions are expanding programs of graduate and continuing study to meet ongoing needs for lifelong learning. Tina Bjarekull PresidentMatthew PowerVice President of Government Affairs Jennifer FrankVice President of Academic Affairs Cover photo: Goucher College 6453THE MARYLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY passed legislation in 2008 that requires each independent institution that receives State Sellinger funds to report annually to MICUA on programs and practices that promote and enhance cultural diversity. As defined in statute, \"cultural diversity\" means the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups that traditionally have been underrepresented in higher education. In consultation with its member institutions, MICUA developed a survey instrument for independent colleges and universities to report annually on its cultural diversity programs and practices. MICUA is charged with compiling the information received from its member institutions and submitting a report to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). For the past 11 years, MICUA has surveyed Maryland's independent colleges and universities to identify new and ongoing programs and activities that promote cultural understanding,build on impactful policies, and create a blueprint for success in creating inclusive campus communities. With information collected from these surveys, MICUA publishes its annual Cultural Diversity Report. MICUA's 2019 Cultural Diversity Report is a compilation of the results of its most recent survey. The Report does not list every initiative or effort on each campus, but provides a general overview of common activities, unique programs, and best practices to enhance the campus climate and support cultural competency. Many of the examples provided in the Report are ongoing, multi-year practices and programs that have proven effective. Other examples reflect new initiatives and emerging trends. The Report also highlights meetings, lectures, discussions, ad hoc events, and other activities held to promote learning about and continued discussions of race, gender, and equity.MICUA's Commitment to Diversity St. John's College 6464MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS SERVE 64,000 students every year. The student population is economically diverse, racially diverse, and demographically diverse in other ways, including adult learners and non-traditional students, students who speak English as a second language, students who are first to go to college in their families, and transfer students from community colleges. While the overall tuition, or \"sticker price,\" of an independent college or university is often higher than that of a state college or university, private colleges work hard to meet the financial needs of their admitted students, often resulting in lower \"out of pocket\" expenses for many families. Almost 90% of full-time Enrolling Diverse Students undergraduate students at MICUA colleges and universities receive one or more types of financial aid to make their enrollments possible. Combining State and federal scholarship programs, low-interest loans, private scholarships, and on- campus employment gives most students with financial need the resources they need to enroll at their top choice institution. The MICUA member institutions target financial aid to students with the greatest need. MICUA schools provide five times more need-based grant aid to their students than the State and federal governments combined. Attending a Maryland independent college or university is possible for students from all economic circumstances. Sources of Need-Based Grant Aid MICUA institutions provide five times as much need-based aid as the State and federal governments combined.

The figures for students are disaggregated by race and ethnicity. Based on IPEDS enrollment data, 37 percent of undergraduate students enrolled at MICUA member institutions are students of color. The fastest growing population at MICUA institutions is Hispanic students. Between 2008 and 2017, Hispanic undergraduate student enrollment increased by 145 percent, while African American undergraduate student enrollment grew by 35 percent. In comparison, total undergraduate student enrollment grew by 2 percent at MICUA institutions. Based on IPEDS graduation rates, half of the MICUA State-aided colleges and universities have eliminated the graduation gap between students of color and the general student population. Institutions also report race and ethnicity of full-time faculty. Based on the most recent IPEDS data available, 25 percent of full-time faculty members at MICUA institutions are minority.

The belief that diversity is essential to a quality education is affirmed in each mission statement. The mission of Capitol Technology University is to educate individuals for professional opportunities in engineering, computer and information sciences, and business through relevant learning experiences in the evolving global community. Capitol prides itself on being \"An organization with faculty and leadership who stimulate and implement new curricula for the professions we serve, and that benefits a diverse community of learners.\" Capitol's strategic plan also includes two diversity goals: Explore international partnerships and opportunities; and Implement strategies to recruit and retain non-traditional students, to include working adults and active duty military. Goucher College's Mission Statement, Diversity Statement, and Community Principles all affirm that diversity and racial equity are central to a liberal arts education and to the institution's core values. Goucher's Mission Statement describes the College as \"... dedicated to a liberal arts education that prepares students within a broad, humane perspective for a life of inquiry, creativity, and critical and analytical thinking.\" The College has also added this Vision Statement to its Mission: \"Become the model for accessible transformational education that integrates curricular and co- curricular learning to deliver graduates who can solve complex problems together with people who are not like themselves.\"St. John's College's Diversity Statement describes its educational aim as providing \"... an education for all, regardless of a person's race, ethnicity, sex, religious beliefs, country of origin, economic background, age, disability or sexual orientation. By reading great books and struggling together with the fundamental questions that they raise, students and their teachers learn from their differences and discover more deeply their shared humanity. In this and other ways, a diversity of background and experience enriches our community of learning. Because it offers an education for all, St. John's College has sought and continues to seek to make its program of study known and available to people of diverse backgrounds.\" The Mission Statement of Stevenson University describes the University as \"... an innovative, coeducational, independent institution offering undergraduate and graduate students a career-focused education marked by individualized attention, civility, and respect for difference. The University blends the liberal arts with career exploration and planning, complementing a traditional education with applied learning beyond the classroom. The University meets students where they are and supports and challenges them to become reflective and accomplished individuals committed to a lifetime of learning and contribution. Students graduate with the competence and confidence needed to address creatively the opportunities and problems facing their communities, the nation, and the world.\" Hood College 6497Strategic Plans & Goals MICUA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES RECOGNIZE diversity in their long-range strategic plans by establishing goals to create inclusive and welcoming environments, increase engagement, sponsor cultural activities, and foster inclusive communities. Johns Hopkins University's Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion articulates the University's belief that a community of diverse people, thought, and experiences is essential to its core mission and long-term success. The second annual progress report, published in April 2019, highlighted the successes and challenges the University faced over the past year, and provided a transparent account of new or progressing initiatives. It also noted future initiatives and focused on additional issues and challenges of importance to the University community, including those voiced in campus protests on issues such as campus safety, federal immigration policies, disability services, and handling of sexual misconduct cases. Loyola University Maryland's current strategic plan, T he Ignatian Compass, Strategic Plan 2017-2022, pays explicit attention to diversity by establising the Ignatian Citizenship Commons: \"Loyola will embrace an action-oriented commitment to greater diversity, equity, and inclusion, seeking to make an impact in our own campus community and at local, regional, national, and global levels. The Commons will advocate for the public and communal application of the Ignatian tradition of reflection, discernment, and action as invaluable social virtues.\" In the Mount St. Mary's University Strategic Plan: 2018-2023, diversity and inclusion are prominently featured under Goal 6: Culture of Teamwork, which states, \"The Mount fosters a culture where all members of our community are treated with dignity and respect and where they feel they are a valued and trusted member of our team.\" Specific strategies include establishing a welcoming climate and more inclusive learning community, continuing to diversify its student body, and defining and advancing diversity and inclusion. Washington College includes a number of diversity-related goals in its long-range plans, including increasing the racial, ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, national origin, and socio- economic diversity of the student body, faculty, and staff; and confronting and challenging attempts to dehumanize others through prejudiced attitudes, behaviors, and practices that exclude, demean, or marginalize any individual or group. The College has also made commitments to \"support and recruit excellent teacher-scholars and staff committed to the distinctive character of a Washington College education.\" Mount St. Mary's University 6508OFFICES OF DIVERSITY and multicultural affairs demonstrate MICUA members' commitment to enhancing cultural diversity. Many institutions have created councils, committees, and workgroups to complement this work. They have also developed collaborative initiatives to foster inclusivity and hired staff to coordinate and oversee the range of programs and issues related to diversity. At Hood College , the Office of Diversity and Inclusion offers programming, initiatives, and accessible resources for students from underrepresented populations. Throughout the year, students are provided with a services to foster an inclusive community, including diversity training, orientation and programming for underrepresented and international students, and professional staff who support and advocate for issues of awareness, equality, and inclusivity. Efforts over the past year include webinars/trainings on mentoring students of color (October 2018), creating a culturally relevant bystander intervention curriculum (November 2018), overcoming unconscious bias and racial tensions (April 2019), and bridging the gap between Islam, Islamophobia, and contemplative pedagogy (May 2019). Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) created the Office of Multi-ethnic Student Services almost 30 years ago to address issues with the retention of African American students at the institution. The Office's scope of service was examined and expanded in 2008, and again more recently as a result of the President's Task Force on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Globalization. The Office, now named the Center for Identity and Inclusion, was restructured to expand its efforts to include all students regardless of race and ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations and expressions, ability, religious, political, socio- economic backgrounds, and all other areas of diversity central to the mission of creating a truly multi-cultural environment promoting cross-cultural sharing and learning. The Office has been relocated to one of the main buildings on campus with high traffic and high visibility, with increased staffing, and with increased cross-institutional support and advocacy. McDaniel College's Office of Diversity and Inclusion provides visible leadership and direction for the College's diversity and inclusion initiatives by developing programs to promote diversity awareness and understanding; supporting and coordinating student groups that serve diverse student populations; and serving as a resource to underrepresented students, faculty, and staff. The Office collaborates with campus organizations and offers programs and training opportunities throughout the year. Recent workshop topics include: Multicultural Competency; Privilege, Power, and Oppression; Safe Zone: LGBTQ +, Gender, and Sexuality; and Difficult Conversations: Challenging the Idea Not the Person. Washington Adventist University's Diversity Committee is dedicated to promoting cultural sensitivity among students, staff, and faculty and to creating a conducive environment where everyone feels safe and respected. The Committee, chaired by the Vice President for Ministry, collaborates with the Vice President for Student Life and the Student Association on programs, events, and diversity initiatives. The Diversity Committee directly reports to the President's Cabinet through the Committee Chair. Intentional planning, programming, and assessments are addressed every month and presented every week in the Office of Ministry between Campus Ministry Chaplain and Vice President for Ministry.Leadership to Foster Diversity Loyola University Maryland 6519CROSS-CULTURAL COMPONENTS are included in MICUA members' general education requirements, which students satisfy by taking courses in areas such as ethnic studies, non-western civilizations, foreign languages, diversity, and inclusion. Described below are a few examples of courses and programs that promote diversity. At Loyola University Maryland , Diversity is one of nine Undergraduate Learning Aims with a focus on students' \"recognition of the inherent value and dignity of each person, and ... respect for the differences of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, culture, sexual orientation, religion, age, and disabilities.\" The core aim also imparts the importance of awareness of \"structural sources, consequences, and responsibilities of privilege\" and other cultural competencies. Undergraduates must also complete a Diversity Course Requirement for graduation, satisfied by global diversity, domestic diversity, or social justice courses. Notre Dame of Maryland University included \"Development of a Global Perspective\" as one of the General Education Learning Outcomes for students. As a part of the University's General Education requirements, students are required to complete courses on gender studies and cross-cultural studies and engage in service in their local communities. Cultural literacy is ingrained in the curriculum beginning with the University's freshmen orientation course which has an individual and group service requirement. The University also chooses an annual \"Common Read\" to unite the campus with a work that demonstrates understanding and responsiveness to social problems, promotes dialogue, and raises issues related to gender and global perspectives. Stevenson University's General Education requirements include \"Intercultural Knowledge Competency .\" The Di versity Curriculum Task Force , c reated by the University's Academic Affairs Committee in the fall 2018 semester , suggested this requirement be incorporated into the First Year Seminar course, English 152, and at least once in each academic program. First Year Seminar faculty participated in targeted diversity professional learning in May 2019, and professional development opportunities will be offered to additional Stevenson faculty. Students in the First Year Seminar will complete surveys to assess the course learning activities, which will include questions devoted to diversity learning outcomes. Many courses at Stevenson also embed weekly service- learning in to the curriculum to engage students in authentic, real- world experiences and help them better understand course content and reflect upon possibilities for personal and social change.Inclusion of Cultural Diversity in the Curriculum Washington College 65210Activities & Organizations MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS TAKE ACTIVE measures to create a welcoming environment for students both inside and outside of the classroom. Student organizations, activities, lectures, and campus events are an important part of these efforts to make students from all backgrounds feel welcome while exposing students to different perspectives. At Capitol Technology University , several student clubs and organizations support culturally diverse students, including the University's chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, whose mission is to encourage minorities to pursue engineering and technical-related degrees; and the Society of Women Engineers, the largest nonprofit educational and service organization representing students and professional women in engineering and technical fields. Capitol Tech also houses oSTEM, a student group whose mission is to unite LGBT students who are studying science, technology, and engineering and serve as a professional and social organization that recognizes the needs of LGBT students and their allies. Hood College's Director of Diversity and Inclusion, along with a committee of students, faculty, and staff, designs and implements an annual diversity program that is a part of fall orientation. This program, \"Welcome to the NeighborHood,\" provides students with information about campus resources and teaches the norms of the campus community, including language usage and anti-bullying guidelines. The Director also collaborates with other campus offices and student organizations such as the Black Student Union, Queer Student Union, Feminist Student Union, La Comunidad, African Student Union, Hillel/Jewish Student Union, Muslim Student Association, and Global Citizens Club to sponsor heritage/history months with documentaries; games; educational, social, and cultural programs; fashion and talent shows; musical performances; and special trips. Goucher College 65311Maryland Institute College of Art's (MICA) Center for Identity and Inclusion presented over 45 diversity related programs during the 2018-2019 academic year. These trainings, events, and exhibitions promoted the goals of accepting, respecting, and valuing differences such as age, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender expression, sexual identity, ability, language, family circumstances, and cultural backgrounds. For instance, faculty and staff from MICA and Morgan State University, along with Michael Cobb, United States Congress Legislative Assistant, interacted, challenged, taught, and prepped students for professional networking opportunities during \"Art 2 Art,\" a networking event that created fruitful connections and generated new opportunities for students of color. Another initiative, \"The Collective,\" was created to foster and strengthen the MICA community through civic and conscious dialogue with faculty, staff, and student leaders around issues of race, gender, culture, and identity. The Men of Color, Women of Color, and Queer, Trans People of Color Collectives were designed as mentorship programs for students to learn how to navigate a white, male, cis, hetero-normative world. Each year, the contributions of Stevenson University's students, faculty and staff, along with some of the region's best- known artists, entertainers, and speakers enhance campus life and enrich knowledge around the areas of diversity, inclusion, multiculturalism, cultural competency, and equity. Stevenson's women's leadership group, R.I.S.E., hosts events for numerous students on campus. The African Student Union hosts dance performances, food tastings, and exhibits such as \"Experience Africa.\" The Black Student Union holds an annual fashion show that allows students to showcase their talents, as well as clothing from various locations. During this past Black History Month, a Black Lives Matter Showcase displayed many talented students as they gave reverence to African Americans who have made significant contributions to society. Other events were hosted in collaboration with student groups, faculty, and staff members to recognize and celebrate National Women's History Month and National Hispanic Heritage Month. Maryland Institute College of Art 65412Publications & Promotional Materials MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS utilize publications and electronic materials to reach students, prospective students, faculty and staff, and the community. To create a welcoming environment and encourage respect for diversity, MICUA schools ensure that all publications, promotional materials, and websites reflect diverse populations that span ethnicity, race, national origin, age, and gender groups. The Office of Communications strives to represent Goucher College's diverse student body in all print and electronic publications and on its website. In the College's series of student, faculty, and alumni profiles online and in print, Goucher ensures there is reflection of the rich diversity in the community in terms of academic and extracurricular interests, ethnicity, gender, and geography. The \"Experience Goucher\" section of the website provides a page titled \"Equity and Identity at Goucher\" that emphasizes the College's commitment to diversity while also providing information and resources to prospective students. The website includes links to resources such as the Maryland Scholars Program; International Student Support; President's Council for Race Equity; Cultural Programming; and the Center for Race, Equity, and Identity. Goucher also hosts and promotes speakers, artists, and lecturers on campus who represent a wide range of views and backgrounds. In 2018-2019, the College hosted civil rights activist and author DeRay Mckesson, as well as clarinetist Anthony McGill, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra's first African-American principal player. It is important to Washington Adventist University that any print and electronic materials represent the diversity on campus. The University is culturally and racially diverse and endeavors to reflect the campus's richness to the community and surrounding world. There are multiple communication streams that are disseminated to various internal groups and external stakeholders and other parties, including students, faculty, staff, alumni, neighbors and friends of the University, board members, and the press. Stories about diverse students and faculty are frequentlyhighlighted. In the past academic year alone, two of the more significant student success stories featured Latina students. These stories range from stories of freshmen just beginning their college journey, to seniors graduating with accolades. These stories are told via emails, videos, social media, and a student engagement mobile app. Stevenson University 65513 Washington College continues to be excited about the changing demographics of classes recruited, as well as the diverse intersecting social and cultural identities that make up the campus community of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and supporters. College Relations and Marketing designs promotional materials to highlight and accurately portray the diversity in the student population and to showcase unique strengths, achievements, and outcomes. Additionally, the institution works to have gender identity and expression, international/domestic, St. John's College racial, and other diverse identities in featured stories in the campus newspaper, Washington College Magazine, and other media. A campaign is underway to showcase a more diverse representation of faculty, staff, and students via visual images, such as banners and portraits, across campus. The College's Global Education Office also works closely with College Relations and Marketing to create specific promotional materials to distribute to international partner schools to help attract visiting exchange students to campus. 65614Recruitment, College Preparation, Intervention, & Community Outreach MICUA MEMBERS TAKE ACTION during each aspect of the application and admissions process to provide students from all backgrounds the opportunity to attend and succeed at an inclusive institution of higher education. Goucher College has several important components to its cultural diversity recruitment initiatives, including programming (on-campus and off-campus visits and college fairs) specifically targeted to underrepresented populations and schools that serve mostly underrepresented populations (e.g., Seed School of Baltimore, Bard High School Early College in Baltimore). Goucher also hosted group visits for community- based organizations and schools that provide access to higher education for underrepresented high school students, such as the Baltimore Urban League Seminar. The College hosted the Diversity Overnight Experience for admitted students who identify as a person of color. The event was held in conjunction with Gopher Day, an all-day campus event for admitted students. Goucher also continued to feature the Goucher Video Application (GVA) as an option in the admissions process. Goucher was the first college in the nation to create an application option requesting student-submitted videos as the decisive factor for admission. The GVA represents an innovative step to demystify the admissions process and create a more transparent application for students of all backgrounds .McDaniel College 65715Over the past year, Johns Hopkins University expanded its undergraduate recruitment and outreach efforts to include working with several large school districts that serve substantial numbers of low-income or underrepresented students. The University brought more underrepresented and first generation students to campus for prospective- and admitted-student programs and, for the first time, gave every admitted first generation student the opportunity to be flown to campus with a guardian. Over the past year, the University also significantly expanded support for first-generation college students with financial struggles by creating networks designed to connect these students with each other and with faculty, staff, or alumni from first-generation or low-income backgrounds. The University also held an opportunities fair to expose students to high-impact experiences such as studying abroad and internships and started a pilot summer stipend program to provide competitive funding for unpaid or under-paid summer research or internship experiences . St. John's College has a fly-in program and special tours that support its efforts to recruit a diverse student body. It emphasizes diversity in its Summer Academy, an on-campus summer college experience for high school students. St. John's also has a fully funded summer program coordinated with UNCF and AEI to host African American students in a leadership and critical thinking program. The College has a need-based financial aid program that enables students from all income levels to attend St. John's; 10% of currently enrolled students have family incomes below the poverty line, and 30% are Pell Grant eligible. The College has also announced that it has lowered undergraduate tuition for the 2019-2020 academic year from $52,000 to $35,000, which makes St. John's one of the most affordable liberal arts colleges in the United States.

(National Student Clearinghouse, 2018)STUDENT SUCCESS IS PARAMOUNT TO MICUA members. In testament to this cause, each college and university has put programs and offices in place to assist students in the transition to college life through graduation. The First Year Program at McDaniel College provides many levels of support for new first year students and transfer students. Every new student has a student Peer Mentor to help with the transition to McDaniel and to enhance the first year experience of all new students. The College has several Peer Mentor roles: First Year Seminar Peer Mentor, Honors Peer Mentor, Transfer Peer Mentor, and International Peer Mentor. The College's Director of Student Diversity and Inclusion trains the Peer Mentors annually to make them aware of the unique needs of diverse populations. At Mount St. Mary's University , the Mount Cares Committee is a team of representatives from every professional segment of the community (Academic Affairs, Residence Life, Public Safety, Campus Ministry, Center for Student Diversity, Center for Student Engagement and Success, and Learning Services). This group meets on a bi-weekly schedule to review and discuss students who have been identified as at-risk by professors or other staff members. Every student is assigned a contact person from the Committee, who offers resources and help where needed, including peer tutoring services. All new students convene multiple times a week with assigned advisors and mentors who also serve as the students' First Year Symposium professors. In 2018, Symposium faculty participated in a mandatory Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning workshop sponsored by the Mount's Inclusive Excellence Committee. Notre Dame of Maryland University's Trailblazers Program supports first generation college students via personalized meetings, workshops, collaborations with other on-campus departments/services, and guest speakers. The Program provides ongoing, essential support to help first generation students in Notre Dame's Women's College reap the benefits of college life, earn their degrees, and make their way into the world as college graduates. The Trailblazers Program has a new initiative called Primeras for first generation Latina students and their families as they navigate the college journey. Notre Dame's First Year Experience Task Force made suggestions to redesign the University's first year seminar course curriculum, which has been revised and launched. This course emphasizes the transition to Notre Dame, including the richness of its culturally diverse student body; support systems that enable student success; and the University's mission and values. Service-learning, peers as mentors and guest presenters, and assessment are built into the seminar, which is co-taught by faculty and Student -Full Time Deg ree -Seeking Students Note: Totals inc lu de co mp letio n at transfer in stitutio n . (Nation al Stu den t Clearing ho use, 2018) 65917IN 2016 LEADERS OF THE 13 MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS announced the launch of the Guaranteed Access Partnership Program (GAPP). This first-of-its-kind program was created to reduce college costs and moderate student debt for Maryland high school students who lack the financial resources to afford higher education. Students who receive a State Guaranteed Access grant and a GAPP grant may receive up to $38,200 each year for four years. MICUA member institutions also offer individual need- and merit-based grants and scholarships to promote diversity. Capitol Technology University offers full-tuition scholarships for high ability students who demonstrate financial need. Other high need students may qualify for institutional grant funds from $2,000-$12,000. In addition, based on donor specifications, Capitol awards specific funds for Baltimore City students, Prince George's County students, and women in cyber security. Capitol also offers a free summer program for its most at-risk incoming students, Capitol Institute for Student Success (CISS), which provides developmental coursework in math and English during the summer months. Goucher College offers the Maryland Scholars Program for first- generation, socio-economically disadvantaged students from Maryland, with a four-year financial award exclusive of loans. The College also offers several endowed scholarships for multicultural students, including Bell (preference given to Asian students or American students of Asian descent); Brady (international students); and Hearst (awarded to economically disadvantaged students from urban schools in Baltimore) , among many others. In May 2019, Mount St. Mary's University received another $1 million commitment from generous donors to suppo rt the Third Century Scholars program, which was originally established in 2007. This donation will provide eight more underrepresented, low-income students from urban communities (Washington D.C. and Baltimore) with full scholarships, a success coach, and operating funds. The Mount also actively pursues grant opportunities to support underrepresented groups. For example, the University was awarded an S-STEM grant from the National Science Foundation that provides scholarships for high-achieving, high-need students. The Washington Scholars Program at Washington College recruits high achieving and high financial need students from various metropolitan areas across the U.S. The Program includes an interview process, first-year student requirements, academic preparation for the student's career trajectory, cultural experiences, and personal and identity development with an emphasis on engaging in student development opportunities such as clubs, organizations, community immersion opportunities, and experiential learning activities. The College also offers several endowed scholarships to students who contribute to the diversity of the College including Hearst Foundation, Hodson Gilliam, Timothy Maloney Theatre, and Dr. Charles H. Trout. Targeted Financial Aid Programs Guaranteed Access Partnership Program $38,200 4EACH YEAR FOR YEARS bridging GAPP is the gap to college access and affordability 66018Student Leadership INVOLVING STUDENTS IN LEADERSHIP positions is an important goal for MICUA members, all of which offer many opportunities for students to influence decision making. Hood College's Diversity Coalition is comprised of at least two representatives from each of the College's diversity organizations, including the Black Student Union, Queer Student Union, Feminist Student Union, and La Comunidad (Latinx Student Union). These groups have established a tier-based executive structure so that each year, one or more first-year students are elected to their boards, providing new students the opportunity to experience leadership growth. Two years ago, the Student Government Association (SGA) amended its constitution to include a Diversity Chair on its Executive Board, who is selected from the Diversity Coalition. In spring 2019, the SGA adopted a campus-wide Inclusivity Resolution and Community Values Pledge. Students, faculty, and staff were invited to sign the pledge online. At Loyola University Maryland , students of color are heavily involved in campus leadership, including both campus-wide leadership offices and leadership offices specific to diversity efforts, such as the Director of Diversity in the Student Government Association and leadership positions in African, Latino, Asian, and Native American (ALANA) related clubs and organizations. Other leadership opportunities during the 2018-2019 academic year included MOSAIC, an initiative that provides resources, support, and encouragement for Loyola's women of color. MOSAIC focuses on developing an inclusive environment that fosters sisterhood while involving, informing, and inspiring women. The University also offered a Leadership Summit, a day-long program focused on the intersections of social identity and leadership. At McDaniel College, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) works with students to develop leadership skills and meets regularly with the leaders of the organizations that fall under its umbrella. The Black Student Union, Africa's Legacy, Hispanic Latinx Alliance, and Asian Community Coalition are among the most active student groups on campus. The Director of ODI also recruits students to introduce keynote speakers, lead workshops and discussions, and serve on panels to share their experiences. Students have led efforts to grow the Edge Experience Programfor students from Baltimore and to bring together multicultural student organizations in order to develop new ways to build communication among the groups. Students have also been instrumental to the Global Bridge Program, which runs with the support of a team of student mentors, most of whom were in the U.S. for less than five years before arriving at McDaniel. Washington College's Office of Intercultural Affairs provides leadership for the Intercultural Ambassador Council, comprised of eight student leaders that represent the following intersecting social and cultural identities: Race/Ethnicity, International, Socioeconomic Status, Sex, Sexuality and Gender Identity/ Expression (LGBTQ+), Ability, Religion and Faith, Women, and First-Generation College Students. The charge for each Ambassador is to engage the campus community via outreach and programming efforts across identities and difference. Additionally, there is an expectation that Ambassadors engage with broader communities, such as Greek Life, Athletics, Residence Life, and the Student Government Association. As a result, increased social justice and equity conversations have taken place across campus, with intentional cross-cultural relationship building. Students have benefited from greater accessibility to trained and passionate peers on issues of diversity, identity, and inclusion. Capitol Technology University 66119Diverse Faculty & Administrators\u2014Recruitment, Professional Development, & Retention A CRITICAL OBJECTIVE FOR MICUA members is to increase diversity among faculty and administrators. Johns Hopkins University's Faculty Diversity Initiative (FDI), launched in 2015, has demonstrated important successes not only in supporting the recruitment of diverse faculty, but in launching and adjusting systems and practices needed to advance these aims. This year, the University completed the rollout of the faculty information system Interfolio to better track all parts of the faculty search process. Interfolio pairs with the recently adopted FacultyForce information system for tracking faculty activities, promotions, and retention. Together, these tools have helped systematize the University's commitment to diversity in recruitment and hiring. Ongoing University initiatives to increase faculty diversity include the Target of Opportunity Program, Visiting Professors/Scholars Program, and Provost's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. For the third year, the Provost's Office has recognized faculty members with the Prize for Faculty Excellence in Diversity and Prize for Excellence in Faculty Mentoring. Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) has been working to diversify the faculty and faculty leadership on three fronts: 1) the recruitment process; 2) professional development programs; and 3) artists/designers/scholars-in-residence and public programming. Implicit bias and anti-discrimination training is provided for search committee members for all faculty and academic leadership positions. During the 2018-2019 academic year, trainings were extended to staff and included over 120 MICA personnel. MICA has also worked to develop and institutionalize faculty professional development around issues of anti- discriminatory and inclusive teaching, multiculturalism, and other areas of contemporary practice. In 2019, MICA also expanded support for two endowed artist/designer/scholar-in-residence programs that bring regional and national artists of color to work in residence at MICA. At Notre Dame of Maryland University , the University's non- discrimination and recruitment policies and guidelines require the development of applicant pools that include underrepresented groups in order to promote the University's goal of learning and working in an inclusive campus community. The University has taken part in the NCAA Presidential Pledge, geared towards achieving ethnic and racial diversity, gender equity, and inclusion, with a focus on hiring practices in intercollegiate athletics to reflect the diversity of the student athlete population. All of Notre Dame's faculty and staff position announcements include a diversity statement that welcomes diverse applicants, as well as those applicants who value diversity, to apply. This practice reinforces the University's mission, values, and commitment to creating a campus environment that appreciates the talents, skills, and perspectives of every member. As Washington Adventist University continues to increase the diversity of its hiring pool, it is expanding its recruitment efforts and strategies to include professional organizations such as the National Association of Hispanic Nurses, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, and the American Association of Blacks in Higher Education. Human Resources encourage s bilingual candidates to apply. Structures are already in place for minority faculty and staff exchange programs, via agreements with several Central and South American universities. International volunteers have been and will continue to be brought in to serve in special capacities on campus on a selected basis. Over the past year, four volunteers from Brazil and the Caribbean have served at the University, and two have ultimately become employees. Notre Dame of Maryland University 66220MICUA INSTITUTIONS CONTINUALLY EVALUATE cultural diversity programs and practices using a range of internal campus assessments and outside sources. In 2018, Johns Hopkins University asked faculty to participate in the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) Faculty Satisfaction Survey, students to participate in a climate survey on sexual misconduct, and staff to participate in the Gallup-administered employee engagement survey. Data from these surveys, which included questions specific to diversity, were disaggregated by gender and race, and the analysis of the data will steer future programs and initiatives. Also in 2018, the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) released its first report providing background and specific data on the University's response to reports of sexual misconduct and other forms of discrimination and harassment. The report provides increased transparency around the work and approach of OIE and a baseline against which to measure progress in coming years. McDaniel College has partnered with the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) to assess student learning related to diversity. HERI's Diverse Learning Environments (DLE) Survey is based on research that states optimizing diversity in the learning environment can facilitate achievement of key outcomes, including improving students' habits of mind for lifelong learning, competencies and skills for living in a diverse society, and student retention and success. The DLE captures student perceptions regarding the institutional climate; campus practices as experienced with faculty, staff, and peers; and student learning outcomes. The data are being used to assess areas of strength and improvement regarding the College's efforts at promoting cultural diversity.Evaluation in Promoting Diversity Washington Adventist University 66321At Maryland Institute College of Art , the President's Task Force for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Globalization (DEIG) was established to create a campus-wide plan. The Task Force began in 2015 and sunset in 2018. An Accountability Monitoring Group (AMG), with broad representation of leaders from various College constituency groups, has been appointed to monitor the DEIG plan and work in parallel with the President's Council. The AMG will assess and review data and information such as relevant benchmarks used in various annual reports, curricular evolution, assessments, climate surveys, and faculty and staff diversity hiring data, among other measures. Mount St. Mary's University administered a campus climate survey to all students in spring 2015 and again in fall 2018. The results from the most recent survey were shared in individual meetings with the President's Cabinet, faculty, in an open meeting, and with the Mount Inclusive Excellence (MIE) Committee. The MIE Committee also adopted an assessment plan to help identify gaps and challenges, guide recommendations for resource allocations, and track progress over time towards the goals and objectives in the University's Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan. Capitol Technology University Johns Hopkins University 66422Best Practices IN THE INTEREST OF building on successful policies and creating a blueprint for success, MICUA has identified the following best practices related to the campus environment, students, faculty and administrators, and assessment and evaluation: Improving the Campus Environment (1) Inclusion of cultural diversity in the institution's mission statement and strategic plan serves as a constant reminder of the commitment of the institution to create an inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Institutions seek to eliminate discrimination, foster positive relations between members of different racial and ethnic groups, and promote the ideals of social justice and equity. Phrases such as \"build inclusive communities\" and \"promote social responsibility\" are common in institutional mission statements. Strategic goals related to diversity positively impact enrollment, hiring practices, curriculum, and the community of learners. Cultural diversity must be a component of the general education rubric. (2) An office of diversity or a senior administrator responsible for diversity issues ensures that the institution's commitment to cultural diversity is implemented and a central consideration in a broad range of campus activities. (3) Campus publications and classroom presentations reflect diversity in photos and articles. In addition, displays of artwork in various locations on campus include works by diverse artists. Campuses can support this effort by creating a database of resources available to faculty, staff, and administrators. (4) Librarians ensure that the library holdings include diverse materials, and faculty ensure that instructional materials cover diverse populations and perspectives. (5) Colleges and universities sponsor cultural events throughout the year to recognize diverse populations. The cultural events may include film and book discussions; guest speakersfrom a broad range of backgrounds; visual art displays; music, theater, and dance productions; and food-tasting experiences that reflect various cultures. Effective events are planned in a collaborative manner by students, faculty, and staff. Best Practices Related to Students (6) Effective strategies to recruit diverse students include: hosting college fairs in geographic areas with diverse student populations, engaging high school guidance counselors to identify and recruit diverse students, and employing admissions counselors who are responsible for multicultural recruitment. (7) Partnerships with elementary and secondary schools with high minority enrollment are an excellent way to reach out to prospective students who may not be considering college. Institutional representatives invite prospective students to visit the campus and introduce them to students of color who are successful at the institution. Washington Adventist University 66523(8) Colleges and universities that embrace need-blind admissions policies and provide substantial need-based financial aid are more likely to attract diverse students . Endowed scholarship funds\u2014though not exclusively for minority students\u2014may be targeted toward high-ability students of color. Such scholarships reduce the dependence on loans and make an independent college or university affordable to low-income students. As a result of these efforts, the number of student applications increases and diversity improves. (9) Remove barriers that preclude low-income and first- generation students from considering college. Waive the application fee for underrepresented students, especially those who have participated in summer internships during high school. Provide scholarships or tuition waivers for academically talented and at-risk high school students who take college courses. Eliminate the requirement for SAT/ACT scores as part of the application process. By waiving fees, providing scholarships, and making standardized tests optional, institutions improve access and foster a welcoming environment. (10) A year-long first-year experience program helps students transition from high school to college. Guest speakers, book discussions, films, and other activities that focus on issues of race, oppression, power, and privilege, provide an opportunity for dialogue about these issues. In small group settings, students share, explore, and learn about each other's cultural, religious, or ethnic similarities and differences. This is vital in fostering unity throughout the college experience. (11) Students who participate in orientation programs as freshmen often become mentors to future classes. This gives students an opportunity to give back to the institution and to assist new students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to make a successful transition to college life. Institutions recruit a diverse group of experienced students to serve as orientation leaders. These student leaders are able to have discussionsaround issues of cultural diversity, its relationship to the mission of the institution, and implications for working with students of diverse cultures. (12) Summer bridge programs help students who have the ability to attain a college degree, but require additional skills to succeed. These programs are also critical for students who are the first in their family to attend college. Students enhance their skills during the summer and eliminate the need for remedial or developmental courses once they matriculate into college. (13) Institutions offer tutoring, mentoring, and support programs for beginning students, particularly those whose high school academic program did not adequately prepare them for college-level work. These services are particularly important in the areas of study skills, time management, and stress reduction. Diversity is an important consideration in assigning tutors and mentors. (14) Grouping students together in a \"family\" (i.e., cohort) of individuals who mentor and support one another throughout their college experience is an effective practice. If one individual in the \"family\" falls behind in a course or program, the remaining members can assist to bring the student back on track. (15) Effective curriculum is infused with courses that address cultural diversity. Course content and delivery are sensitive to and promote diverse points of view and experiences among students. Institutions ensure that textbooks include the global and cultural diversity issues appropriate to the topic of study. Institutions offer courses and majors in ethnic studies and encourage students to enroll in courses about non-western civilizations to learn the history, language, and customs of other cultures. Educational programs such as teaching and nursing embed community-based projects into the curriculum. These field experiences may be in schools or other settings that include disadvantaged children and/ or adults. 66624(16) Culturally competent colleges and universities include service learning as part of the curriculum. Community service projects offer students, faculty, and staff an opportunity to reach out to areas of the State that are underserved by providing services, such as after-school enrichment activities, tutoring, mentoring, English-language training, health care screening, and home repairs. Effective service-learning programs allow students to work alongside professionals to rebuild communities. Community outreach efforts are designed to promote cross-cultural exchange and provide support for underrepresented ethnic groups. Participation in such activities helps broaden understanding of economic, social, and cultural issues. Students reflect on their experiences, which often have a profound impact on their lives and social consciousness. (17) Institutions make a commitment to human rights for all citizens by making social responsibility an integral part of the educational experience. This goes beyond students and faculty on campus to the surrounding community and the world. Higher education has a responsibility to teach best practices\u2014whether in providing health care for disadvantaged citizens or creating a sustainable environment\u2014that students take with them throughout their lives. (18) Study abroad programs that provide immersion in other cultures, customs, and languages are important for participating students and the campus at large. When students return to campus, the insights they gained help to enrich classroom discussions as they reflect upon their experiences in other countries. Study-abroad opportunities influence future leaders in a global learning community that promotes justice, health, sustainability, and peace. (19) Leadership development is an important aspect of campus life. Effective institutions make certain that student leaders on campus represent a diverse population, and that students of color are nominated for leadership positions, including student government, club leaders, campus-wide committees, resident assistants, and new student orientation leaders. Leadership training helps students develop leadership potential and incorporates themes including what it mean to be a leader in a communityof diverse populations. (20) To ensure diverse viewpoints are represented, insti- tutions should encourage all students to contribute ideas and articles to the student newspaper. (21) Student affairs professionals should make certain that diversity is part of the residential life experience. This includes ensuring that a diverse pool of resident assistants is selected to interact with students in the residence halls. In addition, training for resident assistants should include matters related to cultural differences. Best Practices Related to Faculty and Administrators (22) Diversity among faculty and administrators enhances the educational experiences of all students and enriches intellectual discourse among the faculty. Institutions recruiting for faculty and administrator positions should target media outlets with diverse viewers. Efforts should be made to ensure that the institution has not used language in an advertisement that would narrow the field of eligible applicants. Effective institutions participate in career fairs sponsored by minority associations, such as the Association of Black Psychologists or the Society of Women Engineers. These activities have been successful in helping institutions to increase minority hires. (23) Some institutions have successfully used fellowships to attract faculty of color to campus. These institutions have fostered an environment of inclusion during the fellowship year, which has encouraged visiting faculty to remain on a permanent basis after the conclusion of the fellowship. (24) Effective institutions foster ongoing collaborations with historically Black colleges and universities and other minority- serving institutions to attract diverse students to graduate programs. These students may serve as college faculty upon completion of their graduate programs.Best Practices 66725(25) Several institutions have worked collaboratively with similar institutions in the region to address the recruitment of diverse faculty. The consortium approach has been successful in expanding opportunities and improving the retention of faculty of color. This helps to increase representation of specific ethnic groups and create a critical mass, which is especially important for small and rural campuses. (26) Institutions should offer training seminars designed to enhance the ability of colleges and universities to hire diverse faculty. The strategies learned in the seminars have proven to be successful in increasing the percentage of faculty of color. (27) To prepare educators for leadership at the next level, institutions should offer professional development to diverse faculty and administrators. (28) Effective faculty orientation includes information about issues impacting culturally diverse students. It is important that faculty understand cultural differences to create a supportive learning environment. (29) Diversity awareness training for faculty, staff, and administrators helps create an inclusive working environment. Effective programs include components for coaching and mentoring that emphasize diversity-minded institutional leadership, supervision strategies, and policy development. (30) Institutions may benefit by sponsoring local chapters of formal organizations of faculty and administrators who share a particular ethnic or gender identity, such as Women in Science and Engineering or the Black Faculty and Staff Association. Such groups advocate and provide a unifying voice for their members, offer networking and professional development opportunities, and serve as an information resource to the college or university administration. In addition, the organizations work to recruit colleagues into fields that have been historically underrepresented by women and minorities. The local chapters often host regional or national meetings of the association. (31) Flexible scheduling options provide incentives, especially for faculty and staff with young children. Some examples are job sharing, teleworking, on-site child care, shift compression, and liberal make-up policies.Assessment and Evaluation (32) An effective part of evaluation is measuring success. Institutions that are successful in closing the achievement gap in retention and graduation rates between minority and majority populations are more likely to attract students and faculty of color. In addition, institutions should keep track of the number of students who participate in multicultural programs throughout the year. (33) Surveys of first-year students and graduating seniors help colleges and universities evaluate their progress in promoting cultural diversity and identify areas in need of improvement. 66826Capitol teChnology University 11301 s pringfield road 410-337-6000 www .goUCher .edU Kent devereaUx president r oseMont avenUe frederiCK , Md 21701 301-663-3131 www .hood .edU andrea Chapdelaine president Johns hopKins University 3400 n orth Charles street BaltiMore , Md 21218 410-516-8000 www .JhU.edU ronald daniels president loyola University Maryland n orth street BaltiMore rev.
