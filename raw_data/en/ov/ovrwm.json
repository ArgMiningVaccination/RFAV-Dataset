Quadracel contains the active ingredients Diphtheria toxoid, Tetanus toxoid, Pertactin, Pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin, 3, Pertussis toxoid, and Poliovirus. Quadracel is a combination vaccine used to help prevent four diseases, whooping cough (pertussis), tetanus, diphtheria and polio, in infants and children. Polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria cause significant sickness and sometimes death in unvaccinated infants, children, and adults. This vaccine is for use in children up to 6 years of age, and is used in infants from the age of 2 months who are at the greatest risk from these diseases. How Quadracel works Quadracel works by causing the body to produce its own protection against whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, and polio. It does this by making substances called antibodies in the blood, which fight the bacteria and toxins that cause these diseases. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with these bacteria and toxins, the body is usually ready to destroy them. Most children will produce enough antibodies against these diseases. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. The vaccine will not give your child any of these diseases. The chance of a severe reaction from Quadracel is very small, but the risks from not being vaccinated against these diseases may be very serious. 2. What should I know before my child is given Quadracel?

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Tell your doctor if your child has been treated with medicines that may affect the body's natural defenses (immune system) such as chemotherapy. Response to vaccines may not be optimal. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements your child is taking and if these affect Quadracel. 4. How Quadracel is given? How much to use - Quadracel is given by a doctor or nurse as an injection into muscle. - For infants under the age of 12 months, Quadracel is given as an injection into the upper thigh muscle.

What should I know after my child is given Quadracel? Things you should do - Keep an updated record of your child's vaccinations. - Keep follow-up appointments with your doctor or clinic. It is important your child has follow-up doses of Quadracel at the appropriate times to make sure the vaccine has the best chance of providing protection against whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, and polio. Call your doctor straight away if your child: - does not feel well after having Quadracel Remind any doctor, dentist or pharmacist you visit your child had Quadracel.
