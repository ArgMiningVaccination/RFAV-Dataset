In clinical medicine, however, these infections are considered a prevalent problem. By 2030, the third most comprehensive reason for death worldwide will be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the World Health Organization. The current arsenal of anti-inflammatory drugs shows little or no benefits against COPD. For thousands of years, herbal drugs have been used to cure numerous illnesses; they exhibit promising results and enhance physical performance. Ginseng is one such herbal medicine, known to alleviate pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IFN-, TNF-, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8) formed by macrophages and epithelial cells. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of ginsenoside are still not fully understood. Various clinical trials of ginseng have exhibited a reduction of repeated colds and the flu. In this review, ginseng's structural features, the pathogenicity of microbial infections, and the immunomodulatory, antiviral, and anti-bacterial effects of ginseng were discussed. The focus was on the latest animal studies and human clinical trials that corroborate ginseng's role as a therapy for treating respiratory tract infections. The article concluded with future directions and significant challenges. This review would be a valuable addition to the knowledge base for researchers in understanding the promising role of ginseng in treating respiratory tract infections. Further analysis needs to be re-focused on clinical trials to study ginseng's efficacy and safety in treating pathogenic infections and in determining ginseng-drug interactions.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-07-05", "cleaned_text": "Tract Infections [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26134095](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26134095) [Biomolecules from Plant and Animal Wastes: From Processing to Application in Food and Medicine]( /journal/molecules/special_issues/Biomolecules_Plant )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-26-04095)]. Several different types of viruses may infect the respiratory tract; these include the adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, virus. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV are also agents of respiratory infections. [2](#B2-molecules-26-04095), [3](#B3-molecules-26-04095)]. Other causes of the rapid spread of RTIs are the cough and sneeze of an infected person. RTIs are divided into upper respiratory tract infections (throat and sinuses) and lower respiratory tract infections (airways and lungs). The root cause of limitations to progressive airflow is the excessive inflammatory response to breath irritants. The inflammation is due to neutrophils, macrophages, hypersecretion, and oxidative stress. To date, the medical practitioners' primary focus has been on the antagonists that inhibit the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. However, none of the currently available anti-inflammatory medications provide satisfactory relief to COPD patients and may end up producing side effects; therefore, safe, effective medications for inhibiting inflammatory response are needed to treat COPD [ [4](#B4-molecules-26-04095)]. An overview of respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria or viruses is depicted in [Figure 1](#molecules-26-04095-f001). [5](#B5-molecules-26-04095), [6](#B6-molecules-26-04095)]. Various forms of ginseng are available, including fresh, dried, boiled, and red ginseng, as well as extracts. These extracts are marketed as dietary, nutritional, and wellness supplements [ [7](#B7-molecules-26-04095), [8](#B8-molecules-26-04095), [9](#B9-molecules-26-04095)]. [10](#B10-molecules-26-04095), [11](#B11-molecules-26-04095)]. These have shown that P. ginseng improves lung function and overall quality of life compared with pharmacotherapy alone. However, few studies have explored P. ginseng against COPD and other associated disorders, such as chronic bronchitis, but these have shown encouraging results [ [12](#B12-molecules-26-04095), [13](#B13-molecules-26-04095), [14](#B14-molecules-26-04095), [15](#B15-molecules-26-04095)]. These studies have resulted in a better understanding of ginseng's phytocomponents, their possible mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, and toxicological profile. The key active component of ginseng was first established by Shibata et al. based on their aglycone moieties as dammarane-type triterpene saponins and ginsenosides. [ [16](#B16-molecules-26-04095)]. The active constituents' composition and quality depend on various factors, such as the method of cultivation, harvesting season, preservation method, age, and part of the plant used [ [17](#B17-molecules-26-04095)]. Naturally occurring ginsenosides have been shown to possess antifungal and antimicrobial properties. Their bitter taste makes them a antifeedant [ [17](#B17-molecules-26-04095), [18](#B18-molecules-26-04095), [19](#B19-molecules-26-04095), cytokines and signaling proteins in promonocytic cells and exerts its anti-inflammatory activity by targeting different levels of the TNF- signaling pathways [ [22](#B22-molecules-26-04095)]. Studies conducted on animals have shown that ginseng provokes a robust immune response that protects against bacterial and viral infections [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-04095), [24](#B24-molecules-26-04095), [25](#B25-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng induces the dissolution and dispersion of mature biofilms and also represses biofilm development. The role of ginseng and its main active constituents in reducing the risk and continuation of flu and colds has been reported in several studies, including clinical trials [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-04095)]. Various controlled clinical trials have been conducted to study ginseng's efficacy in COPD, but these trials were small and biased. Therefore, rigorously designed studies are needed [ [7](#B7-molecules-26-04095)]. 2. The Methodology of the Literature Review [Figure 2](#molecules-26-04095-f002). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the role of ginseng vs placeboes in treating respiratory viral and bacterial infections were reviewed in this article. Relevant animal studies were also covered in this review. 3. Ginseng Structural Features [27](#B27-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginsenosides are saponins that are derivatives of triterpene dammarane. sugar moieties, such as rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, and xylose, are attached to various carbon positions (C-20, C-6 and C-3) [ [28](#B28-molecules-26-04095)]. Each ginsenoside is distinguished by the position of its sugar moiety on the dammarane and triterpene rings. Ginsenosides are generally classified into the following three types: panaxatriol, panaxadiol, and oleanolic [ [29](#B29-molecules-26-04095)]. The chemical structures the three-basic ginseng saponins are shown in [Figure 3](#molecules-26-04095-f003). The most abundant saponins protopanaxadiol [30](#B30-molecules-26-04095)]. than 40 ginsenosides have been isolated from the root of P. ginseng ginsenosides. Among the various ginsenosides, Rg1, Rg3, Re, and Rd have been the most studied. Most of the studies have focused on the role of ginsenosides, rather than ginseng extract, for treating diseases [38](#B38-molecules-26-04095)]. Viruses produce respiratory infections by expediting secondary infections, assisting bacterial colonization, adherence, and translocation through the respiratory cells' epithelial barrier [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-04095)]. Air pollution is the most significant cause of respiratory tract infections due to urbanization and industrial development. Clinical features do not distinguish the bacterial and viral infections, but they do have different treatment regimes. [2](#B2-molecules-26-04095)]. Viruses promote superinfection via diverse and replete mechanisms, including infecting airways and disregulating innate and acquired immune responses. They promote bacterial growth, adherence, and incursion into sterile sites within the respiratory tract [ [40](#B40-molecules-26-04095)]. Rapid molecular diagnostic tests allow us to identify bacterial and viral pathogens [ [41](#B41-molecules-26-04095)]. Correct use of cytological criteria, specimen collection, rapid processing, transport, and antibiotic therapy influence the diagnostic yield [ [42](#B42-molecules-26-04095)]. A blood culture is recognized as the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of fungal and bacterial infections worldwide. Bacterial infection, atypical pathogens and bacteria from sterile sites are all confirmed by a blood culture [ [43](#B43-molecules-26-04095)]. Molecular diagnostic tests have improved our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, suggesting that we may have underestimated viral pneumonia. A patient's age, symptoms, radiographic changes, rapid onset of the disease, and a viral epidemic in the community may help differentiate viral and bacterial infections. No consensus has emerged as to whether to treat patients with community-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics [ [44](#B44-molecules-26-04095)]. The pathogenesis of bacterial and viral interactions explains respiratory infections and may help in the advancement of new methods of management, prevention, and treatment of acute respiratory infections [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-04095)]. 5. Ginseng's Immunomodulator Effect [45](#B45-molecules-26-04095), [46](#B46-molecules-26-04095)]. P. ginseng is plentiful in Korea, China's eastern region, Russia, and Japan. China mainly cultivates P. notoginseng [ [47](#B47-molecules-26-04095), [48](#B48-molecules-26-04095)], while P. quinquefolium is cultivated in Canada and the United States, and has been used by Americans for many years [ [49](#B49-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng contains Gintonin, which is a non-saponin bioactive component. The chemical properties of gintonin are carbohydrates, lipids, and the ginseng protein complex. It is a glycolipoprotein complex that includes three lipid-derived G protein-coupled receptor lactones) is a class of oxygenated ergostane-type steroids that have a lactone in the side chain and a 2-en-1-one system in the ring. These are A-Y, withasomniferin-A, withanolides, withaferin A and withanolide D, are responsible for the majority of Ashwaganda's pharmacological [54](#B54-molecules-26-04095)]. [55](#B55-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng is comprised of active such as saponins, phytosterols, acidic polysaccharides, amino acids, nitrogenous substances, polyphenolic compounds, polyacetylenes, vitamins, and minerals. These can treat, alleviate, and offer protection against various diseases [ [5](#B5-molecules-26-04095), [37](#B37-molecules-26-04095), [56](#B56-molecules-26-04095)]. [57](#B57-molecules-26-04095)]. Korean ginseng comprises about 200 active compounds, including polysaccharides, amino acids, ginsenosides, and peptides [ [11](#B11-molecules-26-04095)]. P. quinquefolium is a generally acknowledged herbal remedy and nutritional supplement worldwide [ [37](#B37-molecules-26-04095), [58](#B58-molecules-26-04095)]. Approximately 100 compounds have been isolated from American ginseng. Several differences have been found between American ginseng and Korean ginseng due to their mechanisms of action [ [59](#B59-molecules-26-04095)]. However, the primary active components in both are Ginsenosides, Rb1, Rd, Re, Rg1, Rg2, Rg3, Rh1, and Rh2. components enhance and stability [ [60](#B60-molecules-26-04095), [61](#B61-molecules-26-04095)]. The pseudoginsenoside F11 in American ginseng and ginsenoside Rf in Korean ginseng and notoginseng differentiate them [ [59](#B59-molecules-26-04095)]. Moreover, the ratio of Rg1/Rb1 also differentiates these ginsengs. American ginseng is represented by a ratio of Rg1/Rb1 < 0.4 and Korean ginseng is represented by a ratio of Rg1/Rb1 > 0.4 [ [61](#B61-molecules-26-04095)]. Sterols and triterpene glycosides belong to a heterogeneous group of saponins and ginsenoside [ [62](#B62-molecules-26-04095)]. After an infection challenge, IL-4 and IL-5 cytokine-producing cells are induced by ginseng. Ginseng polysaccharides demonstrate an immune modulator property [ [63](#B63-molecules-26-04095)]. [64](#B64-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginsenosides have shown antioxidant effects in cell cultures and animal models [ [65](#B65-molecules-26-04095), [66](#B66-molecules-26-04095)]. Direct ROS scavenging effects and ligand-receptor signaling have been suggested as possible mechanisms by which ginsenoside (Rb1) exerts its antioxidant activity. Most of the ginsenosides have been identified as phytoestrogens. They possess a four trans-ring rigid steroid skeleton with a modified side-chain at C20, which is missing in 17-estradiol (E2) [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-04095), [27](#B27-molecules-26-04095), [67](#B67-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng has been shown to possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. It enhances cell-mediated immunity associated with healing and tissue repair, and also reduces the symptoms of respiratory tract infections. 6. Impact of Ginseng on Respiratory Virus Infections [64](#B64-molecules-26-04095), [68](#B68-molecules-26-04095), [69](#B69-molecules-26-04095), [70](#B70-molecules-26-04095), [71](#B71-molecules-26-04095)]. The advancement of vaccines and antiviral therapies has helped us minimize the severity of viral infections and shorten the duration of diseases [ [72](#B72-molecules-26-04095), [73](#B73-molecules-26-04095), [74](#B74-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng radix has been used as an herbal medicine to treat respiratory diseases. A specific guideline has been developed for its use in clinical practice. A summary of the impact of ginseng on respiratory virus infections has shown in [Figure 4](#molecules-26-04095-f004). 6.1. Influenza Virus [75](#B75-molecules-26-04095)]. This virus is the most common cause of a periodic pandemic and an annual endemic infection. Three types of influenza viruses (A, B, and C) have been found. Human influenza types A and B provoke seasonal infections in winter, while influenza type C induces mild respiratory diseases. Influenza viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the properties of their viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Lethal strains of the influenza virus have been a cause of deaths worldwide [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-04095), [37](#B37-molecules-26-04095), [75](#B75-molecules-26-04095), [76](#B76-molecules-26-04095), [77](#B77-molecules-26-04095)]. Several studies have established the potential antiviral activity of red ginseng extracts and their purified components against both in vitro and in vivo influenza A. In vitro, mechanistic studies suggest that ginsenosides, particularly Rb1, will interact with viral hemagglutinin proteins to prevent attachment of the H1 N1 virus to 2-3 sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface. This results in the minimization of viral entry, thereby decreasing the severity of infection. Fermented Red Ginseng extracts (RGEs), protopanaxadiol [PD], protopanaxatriol [PT], compound K and various influenza subtypes (H1N1, ginsenoside Re inhibits virus-induced protein production to protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells from avian H9N2/G1-induced cell death. Mucosal adjuvant RGE inhibits influenza virus A/PR8 during viral infections [ [63](#B63-molecules-26-04095)]. When inactivated virus and RGE were administered intranasally in mice, researchers observed increased levels of influenza virus-specific antibodies with improved neutralizing activities in blood and mucosal secretions. Specifically, a spike in the IgA antibody was noted in the lungs. This resulted in enhanced secretion of Th1 and Th2-type cytokines in splenocytes in response to the infection challenge. The Th2 type response was more pronounced. The adjuvant effect of RGE was comparable to the effects of conventional adjuvants, such as cholera toxin and aluminum hydroxide. [80](#B80-molecules-26-04095)]. [81](#B81-molecules-26-04095)]. Similarly, North American ginseng has been suggested to help prevent and treat viral respiratory illnesses [ [82](#B82-molecules-26-04095)]. The stems and leaves of Panax ginseng showed an adjuvant effect on poultry vaccines [ [83](#B83-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng stem-leaf saponins (GSLS) combined with selenium have exhibited an adjuvant effect on the live vaccine of Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, and intraocular and intranasal immunization in chickens [ [84](#B84-molecules-26-04095)]. 6.2. Respiratory Syncytial Virus [37](#B37-molecules-26-04095)]. Airborne droplets and close contact can transmit this virus. The symptoms of this viral infection include laryngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and high fever, followed by pneumonia, bronchitis, and often death. Newborns show heavier symptoms, while upper respiratory tract infection is the primary manifestation of the infection in older children and adults [ [85](#B85-molecules-26-04095)]. The respiratory syncytial virus mainly affects patients with congenital heart diseases and immunocompromised individuals. To date, no vaccine is available against RSV, despite extensive research efforts [ [86](#B86-molecules-26-04095)]. [87](#B87-molecules-26-04095)]. Viral, host, and environmental factors contribute to disease severity and RSV pathogenesis [ [88](#B88-molecules-26-04095)]. Infants infected by RSV bronchiolitis were shown to have a higher level of interleukin 8 (IL-8) than the control group [ [89](#B89-molecules-26-04095)]. RSV infection caused an increase in the levels of (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), chemokines, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in different vitro models and resulted in an imbalance in type1 and type 2 cytokines [ [89](#B89-molecules-26-04095), [90](#B90-molecules-26-04095), [91](#B91-molecules-26-04095), [92](#B92-molecules-26-04095)]. [93](#B93-molecules-26-04095)]. The efficacy of ginseng in human clinical trials has been proved via in vivo and in vitro experiments, demonstrating an improved immune response against infections [ [37](#B37-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng-induced nitric oxide production relaxes the airways and also contracts smooth muscles. Anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects have been exhibited by the Ginsenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2), an active ingredient of ginseng. G-Rh2 has been shown to control allergic airway inflammation by regulating NF-B activation and p38 pro-inflammatory interferon-gamma (IFN-) levels, IL-4 [ [96](#B96-molecules-26-04095)]. 6.3. Rhinoviruses [26](#B26-molecules-26-04095), [97](#B97-molecules-26-04095)]. Acute exacerbations of asthma are also caused primarily by rhinoviruses (RVs). An increase in submucosal CD3+ lymphocytes and eosinophils were reported in two studies about rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation in normal and asthmatic subjects. The increase in the number of mucosal CD3+ cells was associated with a corresponding increase in airway responsiveness and correlated positively with cold symptoms [ [98](#B98-molecules-26-04095)]. To date, no remedy has been found to treat rhinovirus infection. [99](#B99-molecules-26-04095)]. [100](#B100-molecules-26-04095), [101](#B101-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginsengs were found to affect membrane penetration, inhibit replication inside the cells, and hinder viral attachment. 6.4. Coronaviruses [102](#B102-molecules-26-04095), [103](#B103-molecules-26-04095), [104](#B104-molecules-26-04095)]. The previous two acute respiratory syndromes, (SARS)-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, were responsible for severe health issues. Coronavirus spread worldwide from human to human through droplets of infected patients' sneezing and coughing [ [105](#B105-molecules-26-04095)]. The common symptoms of COVID-19 are a cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, and fatigue, further manifesting into septic shock or sepsis which could cause death [ [106](#B106-molecules-26-04095)]. Panax ginseng may be useful here as an immunomodulator and for preventive and supportive therapy [ [107](#B107-molecules-26-04095)]. [108](#B108-molecules-26-04095), [109](#B109-molecules-26-04095), [110](#B110-molecules-26-04095)]. These risk factors contribute to a higher concentration of reactive oxygen species and oxidants [ [111](#B111-molecules-26-04095), [112](#B112-molecules-26-04095), [113](#B113-molecules-26-04095)]. Antioxidant enzymes stimulate estrogen, which as an antioxidant, lessening ROS production [ [27](#B27-molecules-26-04095), [110](#B110-molecules-26-04095)]. American ginseng has shown antimicrobial effects against numerous strains of bacteria and also alleviates the detoxifying enzymes, along with the level of TNF- [ [114](#B114-molecules-26-04095), [118](#B118-molecules-26-04095), [119](#B119-molecules-26-04095)]. Researchers have suggested that viral infection and immune dysfunctions are due to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is anticipated that ginsenoside Rg1 reduces the peroxidation product malondialdehyde production and increases nerve cells' antioxidant capacity. It also reduces free radical production in chronic fatigue syndrome, an actual cause of viral infections [ [120](#B120-molecules-26-04095), [121](#B121-molecules-26-04095)]. A study was conducted with 100 volunteers to check the efficacy of Korean Red Ginseng's (KRG) against acute respiratory illness. The results suggested that KRG may provide protection from acute respiratory illness or reduce its symptoms [ [122](#B122-molecules-26-04095)]. [123](#B123-molecules-26-04095)]. W. somnifera is utilized to treat nearly all illnesses that affect human health because of its broad area of activity. Several studies have shown that derivatives of W. somnifera can efficiently inhibit various viral infections, including HPV, anti-inflammatory, and prophylactic properties, the Indian government (Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy), as well as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research, have recently approved its use in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2 [ [130](#B130-molecules-26-04095)]. [Table 1](#molecules-26-04095-t001)shows the effects of ginseng on different respiratory virus infections. The probable role of ginseng for coronavirus is shown in [Figure 5](#molecules-26-04095-f005)[ [131](#B131-molecules-26-04095)]. A fourteen-day clinical trial was recently conducted to study the efficacy of the Shenhuang granule containing improvement in the condition of severe COVID-patients [ [106](#B106-molecules-26-04095)]. Thus, it is advisable to choose a reliable ginseng product as adjuvant therapy for COVID patients. 7. Anti-Bacterial Activity of Ginseng [144](#B144-molecules-26-04095)]. In the absence of newer antibiotics, natural products are being promoted to address this issue. Ginseng has been reported to inhibit bacterial pathways, thereby killing bacteria indirectly. It has also been shown to protect the host from bacterial invasion [ [145](#B145-molecules-26-04095), [146](#B146-molecules-26-04095)]. [Figure 6](#molecules-26-04095-f006). Ginseng and its derived [Table 2](#molecules-26-04095-t002). Pseudomonas exist, Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes most of the infections in humans. This type causes infection in the lungs (pneumonia), but it has evolved to circumvent the effects of the antibiotics used to treat it [ [26](#B26-molecules-26-04095), [37](#B37-molecules-26-04095), [146](#B146-molecules-26-04095)]. [164](#B164-molecules-26-04095)]. P. ginseng might also be considered an add-on therapy to treat cystic fibrosis, as it can reduce bacterial infections and biofilm formation. [165](#B165-molecules-26-04095)]. [155](#B155-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng was reported to have a negative effect on the quorum sensing system of P. aeruginosa. This was suggested as a possible mechanism noted in a previous study by which ginseng helped the bacterial clearance from animal lungs in vivo. The ability to enhance and repress bacterial growth could be mutually exclusive [ [166](#B166-molecules-26-04095)]. [126](#B126-molecules-26-04095), [137](#B137-molecules-26-04095)]. Ginseng could play a vital role in combating microbial infections, particularly against P. aeruginosa pneumonia. PMNs are a common cause of cystic fibrosis, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality [ [167](#B167-molecules-26-04095), [168](#B168-molecules-26-04095)]. Thus, ginseng shows good therapeutic activity against P. aeruginosa pneumonia [ [169](#B169-molecules-26-04095)]. 7.2. Streptococcus Pneumonia [146](#B146-molecules-26-04095)]. The human respiratory tract has commensal Pneumococcus, which is the cause of local infections, as well as many invasive diseases, such as meningitis and sepsis, due to its virulence factors. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) has been reported to enhance the efficacy of the pneumococcal pep27 mutant (pep27) vaccine [ [170](#B170-molecules-26-04095)]. KRG, at a dose of 100 mg/kg, demonstrated higher survival rates in mice than the non-treated controls. Additionally, pre-treated mice showed lower morbidity and bacterial numbers. In vivo, the dosing of 100 mg/kg of KRG lowered TNF- IL-1, level, and post-infection 48 h neutrophil infiltration. KRG was shown to defend the host cells from lethal pneumococcal sepsis and also enhanced bacterial clearance. It thereby strengthens cell continuance against pneumococcal infection [ [171](#B171-molecules-26-04095)]. [172](#B172-molecules-26-04095)]. 8. Ginseng Clinical Trials [Table 3](#molecules-26-04095-t003). Ginseng's clinical trials were heterogeneous concerning their variety, species, duration, dose, indications, and participant characteristics. However, in order to illustrate the efficacy and safety of ginseng, future studies need to be stricter and methodologically relevant. No formal inventory has been created showing ginseng in the context of respiratory diseases. Ginseng products are generally used as complementary and alternative medicine in respiratory infections. Most clinical trials have been conducted on P. ginseng and included a relatively small number of subjects, ranging from healthy adults to patients with symptoms. More research is needed to explore the uses of ginseng in the context of respiratory diseases. Evaluations of Ginseng's Impact on Respiratory Pathogens in Human Clinical Trials [180](#B180-molecules-26-04095)]. [117](#B117-molecules-26-04095)]. COLD-fX was also investigated as a seasonal protective drug on 783 patients aged sixty-five years and above. A dosage schedule of 400 or 800 mg/day was given for six months. It was found that COLD-fX was safe and reduced the severity and incidence of upper respiratory tract infections [ [174](#B174-molecules-26-04095)]. [175](#B175-molecules-26-04095)]. [116](#B116-molecules-26-04095)]. [15](#B15-molecules-26-04095), [181](#B181-molecules-26-04095)]. [180](#B180-molecules-26-04095)]. A P. ginseng (G115) dose of 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improved the pulmonary function test of respiratory endurance in 92 patients with COPD [ [166](#B166-molecules-26-04095)]. In two groups of patients [(n = 37) (n = 38)], the first group was given 875 mg amoxicillin and 125 mg clavulanic acid, while the second group was given an anti-bacterial treatment with 100 mg standardized ginseng extract G115 twice daily for nine days. The bacterial clearance was significantly faster for the ginseng group as compared with the antibiotic-only treatment group. G115 ginseng extract reduced the bacterial counts in patients' bronchial systems. Those patients who have complicated bacterial clearance may receive benefit from ginseng [ [14](#B14-molecules-26-04095)]. Additionally, no side effects were reported in the treatment group receiving P. ginseng [ [15](#B15-molecules-26-04095)]. [7](#B7-molecules-26-04095)]. In summary, the results of all clinical trials have shown that ginseng and its compounds have protective effects against infectious diseases. As a remedial treatment in respiratory infections, ginseng shows potential for the development of new herbal medicines. More effective clinical trials are still needed to prove the potency and effectiveness of ginseng against respiratory infections. 9.
