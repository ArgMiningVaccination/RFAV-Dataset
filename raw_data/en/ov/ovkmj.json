BPH is defined as benign prostate hyperplasia referring to the enlargement of the prostate gland due to several factors such as aging which usually occurs in men over 50 years. Prostate cancer is the abnormal cell growth around the prostate gland that can spread to other parts of the body. The term 'benign' in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) indicates that the condition is not cancerous. However, other conditions can trigger abnormal cell growth in the prostate resulting in prostate cancer. Benign prostate hyperplasia can worsen with age leading to improper emptying of the urinary bladder. This can result in UTIs, bladder damage, and blood in urine, and in some cases, even kidney damage. Prostatitis refers to the inflammation of the prostate due to traumatic injury to the prostate or due to the bacteria that entered the prostate from urine or during sex. Benign prostate hyperplasia refers to the enlargement of the prostate gland that squeezes the urethra, making it hard to empty the bladder completely. The cost of the BPH procedure in Chennai can range anywhere between Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 1.5 lakhs. The cost of Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is around Rs. 60,000 to 1 lakh (approx).,The cost of laser procedure (HOLEP) is around Rs. 1 lakhs - 1.5 lakhs (approx). However, this is a general cost and can vary depending on several factors such as the severity of the condition, the medical condition of the patient, and the surgical expertise of the surgeon. The standard duration of surgery for different BPH procedures are as follows - However, the standard OT time depends on the medical condition of the patient and the surgical expertise of the surgeon. TURP is a minimally invasive technique that is considered very effective for the treatment of BPH. However, like any other surgery, there may be some complications that usually depend on the medical condition of the patient and the surgical expertise of the surgeon. Possible complications of TURP include - Incontinence,Improper fluid absorption,Abnormal bleeding during the surgery, which may require a transfusion,Erectile dysfunction,Urethral stricture that can lead to a 'split stream' of urine Usually, patients are discharged within 1-2 days after the surgery. Patients may still have a catheter inside their bladder to aid them in urination. It also keeps the urethra open during the initial healing process for a few days following these treatments. Doctors at Pristyn Care will provide comprehensive post-treatment instructions and explain the recovery period to you. Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) is usually considered for mild cases of BPH and the probability of complication is very bleak. However, like any other surgery, there are chances of complications based on the health of the patient and the surgical experience of the surgeon. Possible complications of TUIP are - Retrograde ejaculation (when semen flows into the bladder),Abnormal bleeding during surgery,Infection around the surgical site,Incontinence Possible complications of open prostatectomy are- Infertility,Impotence,Overactive bladder,Infection,Partial or full incontinence,Leaking of urine when feeling the urge to urinate Although BPH is not a life-threatening condition, it can be very inconvenient. Most men over the age of 40 have some degree of asymptomatic prostate enlargement. As such, it is only diagnosed in men who are exhibiting symptoms of prostate enlargement. It disrupts a person's daily life in several ways: As the large prostate size blocks the urethra, it blocks the passage of semen as well. Moreover, the prostate is responsible for the formation of seminal enzymes, which is impacted in BPH. Therefore, BPH can cause infertility as well. BPH causes prostate gland enlargement which directly blocks the urinary passage by compressing the urethra. Common urinary symptoms observed in BPH are: Patients are asked to avoid sex for 2-3 weeks after the surgery as they are still in recovery. However, this time is not set in stone and they can start having sex after getting approval from their surgeon. In the initial stages, BPH symptoms can be mitigated via medical management. However, as the prostate size enlarges, surgery becomes inevitable for long-term relief. Men with enlarged prostates should limit their alcohol consumption. As a diuretic, alcohol promotes urine formation but it hinders the ability of muscles to relax, causing patients increased difficulty in urinating. It can even trigger complete blockage of the urinary tract. Hence patients can consume small amounts of alcohol but in larger quantities, it may be harmful. Herbal teas such as green tea and hibiscus tea are very beneficial for prostate health as they are very rich in antioxidants. Certain research studies have even shown that they can slow down prostate growth and prostate cancer. Prostate surgery is carried out under anaesthesia so patients generally do not notice any pain. There may be mild pain and discomfort after the surgery due to bladder spasms or urethral inflammation due to the catheter, but these are temporary and disappear a little while after the catheter is removed. Although it is not definitely proven that sitting still can cause prostate issues, some research studies have found a correlation between a sedentary lifestyle and increased PSA levels. Additionally, exercise and a healthy lifestyle directly benefit prostate health. Prostate glands form essential enzymes and hormones present in the seminal fluid that help with sperm function and motility. Thus, a healthy prostate gland is necessary for fertility. Though most patients need to undergo surgery for an enlarged prostate gland, size is not the only factor to be considered when it comes to surgery. Your surgeon will compare your prostate size to your symptoms before making a decision about the surgery. You may have to undergo surgery even with a mildly enlarged prostate gland if your symptoms are severe. There are two types of prostatectomy surgeries and they are: Radical prostatectomy where the surgeon removes the entire prostate gland along with the surrounding tissues. It is usually performed in three different ways such as laparoscopic approach, robotic approach and open approach.,Open simple prostatectomy is where the surgeon only removes the problematic part of your prostate rather than the entire gland. [Benign prostate hyperplasia](https://www.pristyncare.com/disease/prostate-enlargement/) is very common in men above the age of 40 due to increased testosterone levels. It is characterised by high PSA levels and prostate growth in the centre. However, in prostate cancer, the growth occurs in the margins of the prostate gland and leads to an increase in both PSA and alkaline phosphatase levels. Also, unlike BPH, prostate cancer can metastasize and spread to other parts of the body. Just as some foods benefit prostate health, certain foods can damage prostate health. Foods that can negatively affect the prostate gland include: An enlarged prostate gland, or prostatomegaly, is a benign disorder but it can negatively impact the lifestyle in many ways: If you notice any of these warning signs then you may have prostate disease.
