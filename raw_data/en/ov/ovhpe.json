Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend my own remarks in the Ftxcoan. The SPEXKEFL Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from M.isslssippi? There was no objection. Mr. DUNN of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in the security bill which is now before the Congress. and which is causing so much stir among my colleagues as to the method of treat\u00ad ing an old-age-pension set-up, I wish to go on record now in voicing my positive disapproval of the method of paying an old-age pension such as this bill calls for. The administration is wedded to the payment of a reaxm\u00ad able pension to our aged citizens because of the President's original promise to bring such a law about, but this bill is a *I buck-passing bill ** and attempts to offer a small amount to the aged conditioned upon this same amount being matched by the State. Anyone knowing the condition of the States of the Union knows that more than 65 percent of these States are more or less insolvent and can in no wise meet this condition precedent: and this being true. such an old- age-pension plan of alleviating the suffering of those who are walking toward the valley without a sufWienL amount of money to make them comfortable is. in reality, nothing but a foolish gesture. I desire to go on record at this junc\u00ad ture of the debate on this bill to say that we ought to pass a reasonable old-age-pension bill free from the ties this bill contains or else pass no old-age-pension bill at all. I do not believe in telling those citizens of our country who happen to live in wealthy States that they will be fortunate enough to get their pension because their State is able to match the Government appropriation of $15, while those who live in States not so wealthy, and these are by far the malorlty States, will not be able to get theirs because their State is not able to match the amount offered by the Government. This bill should be amended so as to deftnitely assure our people who reach the age of 60 years and are in need that they will be comfortable and will not be compelled to depend upon local politics to give them that which is righteously theirs. The age should be 60 and not 65. 5678 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 SOCIAL-SECURITY BILL Mr. DGUGHTGN. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the oill (H. R. 7260) to provide for the general welfare by estab- Ushing a system of Federal old-age benefits, and by en\u00ad xbling the several States to make more adequate Provision [or aged persons, dependent and crippled children, ma\u00ad ternal and child welfare, public health. and the administra- Lion of their unemployment compensation laws: to establish a Social Security Board; to raise revenue; and for other Puposes, The motion was agreed to. Accordingly the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further zonsideration of the bill H. R. 7260, with Mr. bfG\"ZEYNOLDS in :he chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. Mr. 'lTt?MDWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 25 minutes to i:he gentleman from Ohio [Mr. J-1. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, what I have to say :ihall be extemporaneous, and I hope to touch most of the nu- Inerous titles of the bill. Practically every Member who has 1;poken on this bill up to this time has prefaced his remarks 1tit,h a statement to the effect that this is the most important Ineasure that Congress has considered during his incumbency Jr has ever considered. I do not know that I want to go that I!ar. but I think I can go this far with safety: I think this is t;he-most far-reaching piece of legislation we have considered i n the 10 or 11 years I have been here. I do not know that i t is the most important. because that is a relative term: but vhen I say far-reaching, I mean it is far-reaching in the fact 1*hat it is going to be permanent. We passed not long ago what we have since known to be i;he famous \" N. R. A or the N. I. R. A\" law. This may have 1xe.n a very important piece of legislation, and no doubt was 1mportant; but it is not necessarily permanent. According iD Hugh Johnson, sometimes it is from earth to egg and E;omctimes it is Srom egg to earth; and according to other ciignitaries, it is necwary while others prophesy its early I.epeal. The same thing is true of the big recovery relief act, vhich we passed a few days ago. This calls for $5,000,- zlOO.000to be turned over to the President, and it was very i mportant. inasmuch as no legislation appropriating any such C:olossal amount bss been enacted heretofore, and I hope we 7vill never have a President who will even ask for that much Inoney in the future, much less demand it. However, it is not lermanent legislation and we are surely not going to appro\u00ad : n-late that much every gear. 1935 CONGRESSIONAL This legislation when it is once enacted, if it is of an3 value at all, it is of value by reason of its permanency, or 81 least its promise of permanency. We are launching on a program, several titles of whlcl call for the cooperation of the States. If they cooperate thi: will be permanent. The title with respect to old-age Pen sicns is to be put into effect in cooperation with the States; in fact, every individual title of the 10 or 11 titles of thi! measure is permanent, it is far-reaching, and is going tc bt with us in the next year and in the next Congress and ir the next generation, unless sooner repealed. This is why I say we ought to be careful about it. I thinh it is safe to-say that the overwhelming sentiment of thi! Congress is in favor of doing something by way of economic security. I think we Republicans. whether we have wanted to come to it or not, and for one I have for many years been wilhna and anxious to come to it. have been forced to the conclu\u00ad sion that the world moves on, that progress is the watch- word and forward do we range. If this is the case I do no1 think there will be any trouble at all about passing in thir session of Congress without any partisanship, a large per- cent of this legislation. Most of this legislation is just likf immigration and various other great problems we have k contend with in the Congress. They are not factional, they are not partisan. neither are they sectional. They take intc ccnsideration the welfare of the entire Nation. Insofar as this bill provides for the furtherance of public- health measures it is neither factional nor political. If we were to consider that phase of it and if we went back to itz origin, I do not doubt we would find it was passed by this Congress under Republican administrations. Appropriation for public health is probablg more clearly for the general welfare than any of these titles. In the same way, I fee! sure, you could go back to the origin of the provision with respect to rehabilitation and I think you would find that the original rehabilitation act was passed under a Republican administration. cite these facts only to show you that we ought to ap\u00ad proach this great problem in a nonpartisan way as far az possible, because we are going to launch this measure in this session of Congress and after 1936. no doubt, we will have a Republican hesident in the White House and there- fore it means a lot to the Republicans as well as to the Democrats. We have got to legislate for the future and not for today only. The Republican members of the Ways and Means COm\u00ad mittee worked on this bill just as assiduously as did the Democratic members. Their contributions to the bill by way of discussion and suggestion were as beneficial as those of the Democrats. I wish to pay a tribute to the distin\u00ad guished Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. I may say that never in my experience in Congress have I seen a more fair-minded or a more courteous or a more gentlemanly chairman than our distinguished chairman, [Applause.] He did not break his rule in the handling of this-measure, not in +he least. He conducted the affairs o! the committee in a most honest, upright, and fair manner; and in the consideration of this measure I want the Re- publicans especially to know this bill was considered just as assiduously by the Republican members of the committee, and we gave it just as consistent and persistent and re\u00ad ligious attention as did anyone else. Leaving myself-out. many contributions were made by the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee that found their way into the language of this bill These Republican members. in summing UP their ideas of the bill, have prepared a report designated as \"minority views.\" This report does not bind any individual members, neither does it bind the Republicans as a group, but it sets out to you succinctly what the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee think would be a fair general state\u00ad ment. I agree with the first part of the report submitted by the Republican membership of the Ways and Means Committee, RECORD-HOUSE 5679 I mahdafn that this bill separates itself into two general categories: First. Those which spring from the desire of the Fcderal Government to provide economic assistance to those who need and deserve ft. Second. Those which are based upon the principle of com\u00ad pulsory insurance. In the first group are- Title I, granting aid to the States in meeting the cost of old-age pensions; Title IV. granting aid to the States in caring for de- pendent children: Title V, granting aid to the States in providing for ma\u00ad ternal and child welfare; and Title VI. granting aid to the States in providing for public health generally. Nany people in this country deserve assistance of the Government, both State and National, and they are not \"charity\" people. They deserve it because the iron hand of vicissitude has rested heavily upon them, on many occa\u00ad sions for which they are in no way responsible. There is truth in the statement that the Government, both State and National, owes something to some people. Naturally it does. The Government feels its obligation, and it feels it wants to pay thfs debt. What is one of them? One of those debts is to pay old-age pensions to those who ap\u00ad proach the setting sun of life without sufilcient means to provide themselves decently. and another one is to grant aid of the States for the care of dependent children. Let me go into that briefly. I will not discuss old-age pensicns at length, because that subject has been discussed here by many Members. I have been in favor of old-age PSISiOIIS for years. I helped procure for Ohio the law under which that great State now operates. Ohio has probably the most modem old-age-pension law of any of the States, and have for years advanced State legislation for Ohio that would result in better care for widows whose husbands have been taken away leaving children who must either be separated from the mother or the mather must receive aid. I think every child is entitled to the care of its mother if she is at all worthy. Not many of those who have spoken have said much about title IV. which grants aid to States for the care cf dependent children. Several States have laws dealing with this subject. They handle it in different ways-each State has its own pIan. We should have some provisions like that in the Federal law. We should incorporate all these beneficent legislative proposals into one plan or group so that the Government could reach out its long arm to help all worthy groups. Wemare trying to stabilize this business of heIpi.ng dependent children. We are trying to pass a law here that will be a model for the States, and we are asking for State contribution, we are asking that each State set up its own organimtion Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. Mr. Chairman, will the gentle- man yield? Nr. JENKINS of Ohio. Yes. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. I understood the gentleman to say this is already in the law, that is. Federal participation ln caring for dependent children. The gentleman does not mean that. Mr. JEWS of Ohio. No; I did not mean quite that,. that we have the set-up made; but I mean it relates to the rehabilitation of children, and we have the germ of that on the statute books. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL We have certain child-welfare provisions on the statutes, but they do not cover this par\u00ad ticular phase at alL Mr. -S of Ohio. I did not intend to give the im\u00ad pression that we already have ample and suftlcient legisla\u00ad tion. I wanted to leave the impression that In this pro- 3ram of rehabilitation and child welfare, all of these corre\u00ad lated together, and the germ has been planted a long time. ft. has grown to fruition in the shape of legislation for re- habilitation. and in several of the States it has grown, but in no state has ulis thing dereloped sYstematilxllY. it m I I CONGRESSIONAL never developed as a tree would. well rounded. It has de\u00ad veloped under hard circumstances. Take the great State of. Ohio, that great commonwealth of which we are all proud. We have a law there that deals with the blind, but it ls poorly administered. We have not any provision in this blll with reference to the blind, and I hope when we come to the amending of the bill that some such provision will be put into it, because it also springs from this same inclination to do something for those who need to have something done for them. The Republican membership 011 the Ways and Means Committee have by their report favored the enactment of title I, the old-age-pension title, and title IV, the provision for the assistance and care of dependent children. Title V grants aid for maternal and child welfare. The Republican membership has unqualifiedly endorsed this title and the Republican Party endorses it and we will not yield to anybody, regardless of partisarishlp. to lay hls unhal\u00ad lowed hand on this proposal and claim this legislation is now his own, that it is original with him It 'is not leglsla\u00ad tion that belongs to any party. This is legislation that has sprung up out of a desire of the people of thls country to have the Federal Government participate and help out the States in this grand and wonderful work. The same is true of title VI, which deals with public health. I hope that every provision that I have mentioned, which has hen endorsed by the Republican group, finds its way into this legislation. Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman 3eld? Mr. JENKIh'S of Ohio. Yes; I yield gladly to the dis\u00ad tfnguished gentleman from Georgia. Mr. COX. The gentleman has referred to the minority views on this bill. Personally I was favorably impressed with the statements set forth, but somewhat disappointed to find in the report one phrase. which I will call to the gentleman's attention: We favor such legllatlon as -?All encourage States paying old-age pcnslons to provlde for more adeq'rate beneflts. and WIN encourage til other States to adopt cld-zge-penslon systema And I now read the senkme, to which I refer: However, we t?!teve the amount provlded In the bill to be lnad\u00ad equate, and favor a substantial increase In the Federal contrl\u00ad butlon. Does the gentleman believe, in view of what he knows about the whole question and the condition of the country. that the Government could stand a heavier burden than is imposed by the terms of this bill as drawn? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. I should say. in answer to the gentleman, that he realizes the word \" substantial \" is a far- reaching word. Being a good lawyer, the gentleman knows that the word \" substantial \", as used in the law, means \" reasonable.\" Mr. COX Does the gentleman actually favor an increase of Federal contribution? Mr. JENKTNS of Ohio. If the gentleman desires my posi\u00ad tfon, I can tell him. I think that at this time $15 ls a fair approximation, but there are some States and municipalities which pay much more than that amount. Suppose there is a municipality which wants to pay a maximum of $30. then it will take the Federal contribution of $15, which will make a total of $45. That community pays in the ratio of 2 to 1, as compared to what the Government will pay. Some other community can barely match what the Federal Government contributes. Therefore, that makes an inconsistency and unfairness to some munici\u00ad palities or States. However, I think the maximum of $15 is a fair maximum now. After we have tried this law out for a year or two and we find that there are munlci\u00ad nalities which would like to DRY more. then it can be in-I creased. I am perfectly wllh& to &crease thls to $20, but why not start it within reach of the weaker States? Mr. COX. Will the gentleman yield further? Mr. JENXINS of Ohio. I yield. Mr. COX The gentleman would not favor a Federal grant to a State whose fbianclal condition was bad. In one RECORD-HOUSE APKIL 16 amount. and then give a greater amount to a St& that was prosperous, would he? Mr. JENKlNS of Ohio. I do not understand the gentle- man Mr. COX In other words, the gentleman favors u& formity in whatever is done on the p& of t.& we& Government. does he not? Mr.JENKINSofOhlo. Thlsbllluptothe$15lsonlya voluntary maximum. A State can provide for $5 a month, and the Government would only put up $5 a month So that the bill already provkks 2 sliding s&e. 'Th2t b for the benefit of the weaker communities. I thing that is a w&a thing, because there is no use breaking the b& of 2 wea)~ individual in order to test the strength of a strong one. Mr. COLDEN. Will the gentleman yfeld? Mr. Jl!XKINS of Ohlo. I yield. Mr. COLDEN. With reference to the mlnorlty report, in which it ls stated that the minority favors a substantial in- crease in the Federal contribution, ls it not possible to &d considerable revenue by increasing the luheritance taxes, which might be applied for this purpose? Mr. JENKDJS of Ohio. Oh, I think the gentleman knows the answer to that question tit&Jut su me. Mr. THOM. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ms of Ohlo. I yield. Mr. THOM Was the gentleman's attention called to a ietter from an Ohlo doctor with reference to the aid granted for crippled children, pointing out that in Ohlo the money k distributed through counties, instead of through the State, and that possibly the language of this law, compelling the matching of funds by the State, might exclude relief in the Stsm of Ohlo Mr. J'EmmNs of Ohio. No. I do not recall having re\u00ad ceived such a letter. I may have done SO. But I do not kn ow how that would exclude relief in Ohlo. As the gentle- man knows, we need some changes in our Ohio laws. ~'+JT instance, in a great State like Ohlo we should provfde some system whereby the various agencies set up for relief should be coordinated. I do not mean that our agencies are lneffl\u00ad cient in their own line of work. but in a great Common- wealth like Ohlo, where there are many large municipalities and much revenue, the small county should not be thrown out on its own responsibility. It ought to be taken care of. It ought to get some relief from some of the larger counties. This thing ought to be systematized If I thought this bilI would nothelp the State of Ohlo to round out the a&stance to her poor people better than it does today, I would not be for these provisions of the bill. The State of Ohlo probably does more today than a great many other States, but it does not do as well as it can do. I hope that these different titles will be of great benefit to that great Stste. Mr. THOM. But the question I was interested in was this: Is it a fact that in Ohio the money for the crippled children is provided by the counties instead of the State? Mr. JEINKlN.9 of Ohlo. I do not know the full details of how that is carried on. The best work done in Ohlo, that I know of, is the rehabilitation done under the Federal rehabilitation law, in cooperation with the local authorities. They took charge of a great many crippled children that know of, and the counties in that way are encouraged to extend themselves to the limit, as well as the county age& ties. It is supervised generally by the organi@.ion ln Co\u00ad lumbus, which I think gets iis organization from Wash\u00ad wton. Now, let me proceed. As I stated before, the Republican Membership, has by its reports, indicated how it stands on these different measures. I am not trying to say how anY individual Member ls going to vote or how I am go&I to vote. but I think it would have been wiser ii this legislation had' been divided into two categories. There ana many Members, both Republicans and Democrats, who believe as I do on that propositlon. If we had provided ln one bill ths relief that I have heretofore indicated, that would all hsvs been consistent. It would all have been right along OIW line. But there has been added to this bill many other I CONGRESSIONAL matters. This blIl really had its origin in nothing but the upwelling charity of the American people as it is demon, &rated by the actions of representatives in Congress am by people generally. Everybody is human and reacts tc human imp&es, regardlev of whether he is a Senator. 0; the President. or what not. So I say to you that all of the3 various titles except two had their &ib from that inclina~ tlon. and we ou&t to recognize that. I! it had been cars ried out along thase lines, then we would not be overwhelmec with trouble about a lot of question that will come up wit1 regard to these other titJes. There are many Members ol Cimgres. regardless of politics, who feel just exactly as ! feel about this. If they had had their own way. if they hat not been lashed into line, if they had not been under pres sure. they would not have ag-reed to this. I am not criti. ciziig them. I recognize that when you are part of a politi. cal group you have to go along to some extent; you have tc be loyal; but there comes a time when that goes too fsu absolutely. When more than loyalty is demanded ther tyranny begins. It is out of line with your common sense It is going too far now. We should remember that we arc legislating for posterity and not for the 1936 elections. It is out of line with your own judgment: it is out of line with your own reason, Ad we ought-to stop. Mr. MARSHALL Mr. Chairman. will the gentlemaI! yield? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. I yield to my friend and colleagur from Ohia Mr. MARSHALL. Does not the gentleman aJs.o think it would have been wiser to have divided the bill still further and separated the old-age-pension titles from the compul\u00ad sory insurance titles in this bill? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. The gentleman is exactly right in that. The next paragraph of the report deals with the question of unemployment insurance. I shall proceed to a discussion of that at this time. I am not here to try to force my views on you as the views of the committee. I know there are members of the committee and other Members of the Repub\u00ad lican branch of the House-for instance, the gentleman from Ohio ~M~..MAR~HALL~. who interrogated me a moment ago- who maintain that it would have been better to keep all these insurance matters by themselves. I favor the primi\u00ad ple of unemployment Insurance and have favored it ever since it hay gotten to be a quest!on of vital importance to the pea* I do Mt want to refer to personal experiences too much in my remarks, but in Ohio we have a workmen's compensdion law that is looked up to by all the States as a model. It is looked up to by those who administer that law in the United States as a model, and it was selected as a model upon which the Congress of the United States built Its workmen's compensation law for the District of Columbia. I had a more or less prominent part in perfecting the Ohio law and in preparing the District of Columbia law. It is a fine thing in principle. Why should not i&u&y carry its load? It should carry its load of injuries that come to its emp!oyees; and no State, where they have adopted this type of protection. would abandon it now-1 think I am safe in saying that practically every State in the Union has a workmen's compensation law. It has long since passed the stage of experimentation-none of these States would give it up. There is a relationship between unemployment insurance and workmen's compensation, but there is a very wide dif\u00ad ference. Now, this very wide difference. no doubt, will be developed here by some of those who are opposed to this proposition. I am not opposed to it. I do not know whether it is wise to enact it now: I am not so sure about that, but if we are going to enact it, I hope it works itself out, but I think you will find it will not work itself out with quite the harmony with which the old-age-insurance m-o\u00ad visions will work themselves out; it will not work itself-out with the harmony with which these other titles will work themselves out. But be that as it may, if it is enacted we slmll do the best we can by it, cure its mistakes and defects as they arise, and improve its good dualities as we see them RECORD-HOUSE develop. I Propose to vote for the bill with t&at proposition in it: I will accept it, as I said before, in the how that good will result from It. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. Mr. '+Xx&mm will the gentle- man yield? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. I Held. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. I want to ask the gentleman a question. Cn last Rlday when I addressed the House I said that we appreciated the flne cooperation which the Repub\u00ad lican members of the committee gave to the study of this legislation, and especially do I want to mention, in this connection, my friend who is now addressing the House, and.as I understand from his dZ.scussion here the gentleman from Ohio is not opposed to the principle cl any of the titles in this bill. Ia that correct? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. Oh, yes; I am. I am opposed to the provisions of title II and title VIII, but I have not come TV them yet. Mr. SAMUEX B. HILL. The gentleman is o-d to the principles underlying the provision for old-age benedts? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. The gentleman, I thti. la mating his statement to suit himself. I am ju?t opposed to that principle in this bill. I do not want it qualified. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. Is the gentleman opposing it a% a general proposition? Mr. JENKINS of Ohfo. I oppose it genera.I'!y and spe\u00ad cifically, if that will help the gentleman. [Here the gavel fell.1 Mr. TREADWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 additional minutes to the gentleman from Oh!o. Mr. SAMUEL B. RILL If the gentleman will yield further I want to pursue my line of thought a little further, and ascertain from the gentleman from Ohio d&her he is opposed to the principle underlying title q which is old- age benefits, and title III, compensation. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. \" yes \" or \" no '1. became identical with title IL Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL Mr. JENKRfS of Ohio. which deals with nnemp!oyment I cannot answer the gentleman I ma&ah that title III is not No: it is not. There are princ!ples involved in title m which are not involved in title IL Mr. SAMUEL B. HUL I appreciate they are two dis\u00ad tinct subjects, but I am asking the gentlen& whether he is opposed in principle to either of these titles. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. Yes; I have stated definitely that I was opposed to title II and oppoWM to it-s accompanying title VIII; but I am not opposed to title IIL I doubt. how- ever, whether this is the proper time to enact it. 1 think it wouId be better if it were separated and Dut in a bill by itself away from these other l&ovisions so fi would have a fair chance and so it would operate on its own steam, so we could And. out its weaknesses if it has any and hn\u00ad prove its merits if it develops any. Mr. MAY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. JEN?CINS of Ohio. I yield to my genial Democratio rriend from the Kentucky mountains. Mr. MAY. I think the gentleman from Ohio has ex- pressed one thought that is almost utiversti in the House of Representatives, and that is the proposition that all these various subjects ousht to ha;-e been separated in this legislation so that if a Member wanted to vote for old-age pensions. although opposed to some other title in the bill, he would have the-opportunity to vote for it withcut having to vote for or against all the other titles in the bill. Mr. JElNKlNS of Ohio. The gentleman has the right idea. and I think he has expressed the overwhelming sent& ment of the House except that based on parttsanship. It IS tiortunate that this overwhelming sentiment is not per\u00ad mitted to crystallize into legislation without White Rouse ntervention. I congratulate my Kentucky friend for the rttftude he is taking. Mr. MAY. In the consideration of the unusually large appropriation bill we had a doub!e-barreled proposition ;Rhere we had to vote for both relief and public works l%is matter should be presented to us in such a way that CONGRESSIONAL we could vote against one proposition without voting agains all of them. Mr. JENHINS of Ohlo. Yes; I agree most heartily wltl the gentleman. Mr. MAY. I think that practice ought to stop and the Members should be given a chance to vote for the thing: that they want to vote for. CApplause.1 Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. I agree with the gentleman, ani that has been the practice of this administration from the time of the enactment of the Economy Act down to the present time. I am glad that the Members applaud the statement of my Democratic friend, and I hope that those who applaud will vote that way when we move to separate these titles later. 'Ihe policy of the administration has been to join unpopular measures with popular measures and tc thereby compel the passage of unpopular measures on the strength of a popular measure. When are you on the Demo\u00ad cratic side going to rise up and say that you are Democrats? When are you going to rise up and say that YOU have in your system some blood of John C. Calhoun and those other distinguished Democrats who stood up for State rights? Are you going to continue to allow State lines to be eradicated? Are you going to let the Chief Executive transcend the rights of the legislative branch? When are you, with YOUI majority of 3 or 4 to 1, going to wake up? When are you going to strike off the yoke? I am glad that one Democrat from the mountain section has risen and given a reason for the faith that is within him. It is seldom that any Demo\u00ad crat stands up in this House and eulogizes Andrew Jackson Democracy today is not what it used to be. Mr. MAY. The gentleman will remember that I voted against the rule for the consideration of the large appro\u00ad priation bill because I wanted these things separately con\u00ad sidered. Mr. JElVECINS of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for his contribution. Mr. ARNOLD. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. JENKlNS of Ohio. I yield to the gentleman from Illinols. Mr. ARNOLD. Under the rule under which this bill Is being considered, have not the Members of the House the right to vote up or down every single proposition ln the bill? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. Yes: they have. Mr. ARNOLD. And they have that right with reference to every title separately? Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. May I say that the gentleman is advancing that as a compliment to his party. The gentle- man has no right, and the Democrats as a whole have no right, to claim any compliment for reporting out this bill under an open rule. Why? Because you did not dare report it out any other way. That is the reason. A canvass of your own Members showed that you did not dare vote out a closed rule. You were forced to bring this bill out under an open rule, and that is the kind of rule that should always be brought upon the floor of this House for the consideration of any important measure. If a gag rule had been offered, it would have met the opposition of a united Republican vote and of a large group of Democrats who occasionally venture far enough to yet say their life is their own. Mr. ARNOLD. I understood the gentleman t0 say that the Members of this body had to take this bill as a whole with these several titles. I know the gentleman does not mean to make that statement when we have the right to vote out any section or title of this bill and we also have the right to consider and adopt any germane amendment. Mr. JEh?UNS of Ohio. I do not think the gentleman heard all of my discussion, because I stated the ultimate result and the ultimate effect was due to partisanship. That is what I say now. hfr. Chairman, I proceed to the last paragraph of the rePOH.. which deals with title II and VIII. I may say that those on the Democratic side will not take advice from me, and I do not want to inflict my advice on the Repubhcan side, but it is my opinion titles II and VIII should come out of this bill. They have no business in there. They are being linked with these other popular titles and will be RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 forced to passage if possible. It b an encroachment upon a public sentiment that wells up from the finest impulses of the American heart. It is Purely a business transaction loaded upon charity, you may say. and has no real relation to these other bills. You Democrats ought to rise up in your might and st.rike out these sections. because future generations, if these titles are stricken, will rise up and call you blessed. I am a friend to this legislation, and I have no hesitancy in saying that the legislation would be much improved. When the people find that you have saddled upon old-age pensions and these poor mothers and these weak and crippled children these objec\u00ad tionable titles, they will demand to know the reason why. They will be entitled to know. There was testimony before the committee to the effect that in one section of the country one-half of the births in that section were unattended by a physician, and who would refuse to continue a work now being done to relieve that sit\u00ad uation. I have voted for this principle several times. Now, let us make it a part of our permanent national policy. Why do you load on this bill an insurance matter? Titles II and VIH are strictly matters of insurance. Under these titles a wage earner is compelled to take thls compulsory insurance whether he wants to take it or not. These two titles have been a thorn in the side of the adminictration. the \"brain trust \", and the Democratic Members. In the Ways and Means Committee they have done their best to remove their unconstitutional features. but they have failed. Verily a leopard cannot change his spots. Under these titles the Government is put into the insurance business on a tre\u00ad mendous scale. The following table illustrates that under this bill it is estimated that by 1970 the receipts into this in\u00ad surance fund will reach over two thousand million annually and that the insurance fund will have a reserve of near4 thirty-three thousand mlllion. This figure ls so large that the human mind can hardly comprehend it. Why not Walt until we can see our way clear before we venture on these untried courses? TABLI IV.-Estimated mllllons of dollars] Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, the report ffled by the majority members of the Ways and Means Committee jays not a word about the constitutionality of these titles no. II and no. VIII. I presume thls omission is 8 studled amiss on on their part. They seek thereby to keep from ihe iA embership the fact that this question gave them nore worry than all the rest of the bill put together. In many sessions of the committee, arguments were advanced XJ show that these titles are unconstitutional. Why has lothing been said about that matter on the floor of this BO'JSC? Why did not the chairman of the committee rddress himself for a few minutes at least to the constitu\u00ad ;ionality question? I will tell you why. It is because ha mows and the committee knows that when the Supreme :ourt comes to interpreting this measure, the Supreme Court nay look as it generally does to the discussions had In 1935 committee and to the committee said. and to what is said in the House. If I do not say anything to say that one Republican at CONGRESSIONAL reports as to what ma: debates on the floor of the else on the floor, I wan1 leact rose up in his weah way, and to the best of his ability. and protested againsl this procedure and wants the records here to show of these numerous protests as to the unconstitutionality of these titles. I want this to be msitive in the Rrcoa~. Let t.& Supreme Court know, if it does read the RECOBD of Con\u00ad gress on this proposition. that one individual rose and said that he doubted the constitutionality of this bill, and that the facts are that great, fear has been expressed by mang members of the committee in this respect. In support of my position, may I say that this bill lirst came to the Congress for consideration in the form of the Lewis bill. Later Mr. DOUGXTON. the chairman of the com\u00ad mittee. introduced an identical bill. hlany changes have been msde in the bill since then. When we first commenced hearings on it. the \" brain tz-usters\" and the adminiseratioo spokesmen and even Miss or Mrs. Perkins thought it waz in perfect form, but there have been more changes made and more legislative carpentry done upon it than any other bill that has gone through this Congress that I know any- thing about. They ha-.-e chznged it in many ways. These provisions covered by titles II and VIII that were once all together have been taken out and separated. This was done after weeks of hearings for no other reason than that they were afraid of the test as to its constitutionality. Mr. Chairman, the constitutionality of these two titles is going to depend on this point: Are they related or are they separate? I would like to have those Members who are not lawyers remember that that is going to be the constitutional test. namely, are titles II and VIII related? If they are not related in any way, then this bill is probably ConstitutionaL If they are related, then the question arises. what about the relationship and how does the relationship interfere with its constitutionality? How did the committee or the g-roup who wrote this bill interpret this proposition? Let me tell you how they inter\u00ad preted it,. They put the provlsions of these two titles to\u00ad gether. They put the tax provision and the appropriating provision together, and the Attorney General's Office no doubt. passed upon it. They no doubt thought it was con\u00ad stitutionaL If you will look at the report you wlll find there are 500 or 1,000 names of distinguished people who appear to have collaborated in the preparation of this bill. The list in\u00ad cludes dozens of prominent and near prominent persons, and many unheard-of persons. No doubt all were capable and unselfish. In this list were many professors. [Here the gavel fell.1 Mr. TREADWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman 5 additional minutes. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. As I was about to ask, how did the \" brain trust \" and the Attorney General interpret this measure? Here is the way they interpreted it. They con\u00ad nected them together and after we had been in session about 7 weeks and when we went to work ta draw it UP. what happened? We have a man here who works for us in the Congress who is not a Member of the Congress, a man who works as the head of the Legislative Reference Bureau. Do you know what he to1d us? He told us that a lot of this bill was unccnstitutional. and do you know who is entitled to the credit for drawing up this last bill? It is not the Attorney General: it is none other than Mr. Beaman, and I here and now nominate Mr. Beaman for the Attorney Gen\u00ad eralship of the United States. He ought to be down there, because he is the man who told them what to do. They have tried the best they could to separate these propositions so that title VIlI could pass the test 8s a taxing title and so that title II could be acceptable as an appropriating title and would be free from constitutional objections. Mr. man, title II and title VIII are not separate in the new bill, and let me show you why. They may be physically separate but they are one in splrlt. Under title II you will find what? You wiU find that all the exemptions under title RECORD-HOUSE fT are Just exactly as under title VET. See pages 14 and 46 of the new bill. And all tie taxes levied under title VTII and all the designations and classifications under title II are carried in title VIII, word for word See Pages 46 and 14 of the new bill. There is not 8 line taken o&T They are just exactly alike. Why arr the majority Members so careful not to make the slightest reference to the connection between titles II and Vm. The btxxdciaiies und2r title II are the idsntical per- sons taxed under title VIII. In a brief filed by the Attorney General they cite 8 lot pi decisions, but this brief appears nowhere in the record of the proceedings of the committee: neither do the long sweches. consuming nearly 2 days by representatives fromthk Attori ney General's office. I maintafn that titles II and VIII should be stricken from the bill because they do not aid the more important provisions of the bill, but are a weight on the bill. I also maintain thai; these titles are unconstitutional because tit:e VIH is not, a tax-levying title but is in reality a part of the plan to put compulsory annuities into effect, and that title II depends absolutely upon title VIII for its pre\u00ad miums. I further maintain that title II invades the rights of the State .ind that there is no constitutional provision grant\u00ad ing COngrs the power to 12gislate in the manner sought in title IL In the Attorney General's brief he seeks to establish ti proposition that the courts m passing upon the validity of a statute Which on its face purports to be 8 tax measure +ll not consider the question whether the motive of the leglsla\u00ad tive body was some other than that to raise revenue. He cites as proof of his contention the case of Veazte Bank v. Fenno (6 Wall. 533) and McCray v. United States (155 U. 6. 27, 59). Neither of these cases fs exactly In point, for ln both of these cases the statute in question bore every etidence on its face of being a taxing statute. The court in each of these cases held that it was not concemed with the motive of the legislative body provided the statute on its face recited its proposition clearly. In neither of these cases was there any accompanying sections that were dependent upon each other. In this bill that we are now considering. title II is absolutely of no consequence without title VIII. And title VlII is in\u00ad serted in the bill for no other purpose than to furnish the premiums with which to operate title II. These two titles. taken together, put the Government into the insurance busi\u00ad ness. That is their purpose. Title VIZ ls not a rerenue\u00ad raising section but it is the means by which premiums are forced from the wage earners of the country without their consent. They cite the case of United States v. Doremus (249 U. S. 86) as a case proving the same point. That case is not in point with what is sought to be done in this bill, for.in that case the Iaw was attacked on the ground that the re&\u00ad lations seeking to enforce the revenue-collecting feature of the law were unconstit.utional. The court held that the law ir. question was on its face and ln fact a revenue-raising measure and that was its principal purpose. It further held that the regulations sought to be declared illegal were legal regulations in that they assisted the taxing authorities to enforce the taxing proltions of the statute. They ako cite the case of Manano v. Humflton (292 U. S. LO). On page 46 the following language, which refutes their contention. appears in the opinion, which is a very short me: The statute here under revlew ls ln form plainly a txlng act, with nothing in Its terms to suggest that lt was intended to be myth&$ else. It must be corMrued. and the intent and mean\u00ad ing of the legislature ascertained. from the language d the not, and the words used there- are to be given thelr ordinary mean\u00ad lng unless the context shows that they are dltkently used. In this brief the following language appears: The wndnslon Is inescapable that tti motive cd the Con- In enactlug a law whkh. on lt~ face. purport0 t4a be 0 revenue measure. Is immaterial and will not be consIdered by the cow in psrsing upon its validI@. This is not 8 correct proposition of law. There is an abundance of admrity to prove that such a proposition is CONGRESSIONAL entirely too narrow and restricted. In fact, it is not a fail conclusion for a partisan even to deduce from the case: cited. There is an abundance of cases decided by the Suprem: Court which holds that the Court is much concerned witt (he real purpose of any law the constitutionality of which is brought in question before the Court. In the Child Lab01 case as reported in Two Hundred r,nd Fifty-ninth United States Reports page 23. Chief Justice Taft, ln holding the kw unconstitutional, says: In the light of these features of the act. a court must be blind not to see that the so-calied \" tax '* 1s lmposed to stop the employ\u00ad ment of children within the egc Emits prescribed. Its prohlbitorg and regulatory effect and purpose are palpable. All others can s;,;?nd understand th!s. How can we properly shut our minds It 1s the high duty and function of this Court In cases regularly brou,oht to lts bar to decline to recognize or enforce scemlng laws Of Congress. denllng with subjects not Intrusted to Congress b*Jt left or commlttcd by the supreme law of the land to the control of the States. We cannot RioId the duty even though It require us to refuse to aive effect to lce:s!ation desimed ieglslatlon 14 an insldlous feature because It leads citizens and legislators of good purpose to promote it nl:hout tbou?ht of the serious brencb it aifi make In the ark of our covenant-or the harm which ml11 come from breaklna down recoanlzed standards. In the maln\u00ad tenance of local self-government, on the one hand. and the nntlonnl power on the other. our country has been able to endure and prosper for near a century and a half. Out of a proper respect for the acta of a coordinate branch of the Government, thls Court has gone far to sustsln taxing acts as such, even though there has been ground for suspecting from the weight of the tax It was intended to destroy its subject. But, in the act before us. the presumption of valldlty cannot preva::, because the proof of the contrary Is found on the very face of Its provfslons. Grant the v4:dlty of this law, and all the Congress would need to do, hereafter, in seeking to take over to its control any one of the great number of subjects of public Interest. Jurlsdlctlon of which the States have never parted with, and which are reserved to them by the tenth amendment. would be to enact a detailed measure of complete regulation of the sub\u00ad ject aud enforce it by a so-called \" tax \" upon departures from it. To give such magic to the word \"tax\" would be to break down all corotltutlonal llmftatlon of the powers of Congress and com\u00ad pletely wlpe out the sovereignty of the States. Also in the case of Hill v. Wallace (259 U. S., 66). the following !anguage appears in the opinion of the Court: It ls lmposslble to escape the convlctlon, from a full reading of thls law, that It was enacted for the purpose of regulating the conduct of business of boards of trade through supervlslon of the Secretary of Agriculture and the use of an admlnlstratlve tribunal conslstlng of that Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General. Indeed the title of the act reclteS that one of lta purposes ls the regulation of boards of trade. The manifest purpose of the tax is to compel boards of trade to comply with regulations. many of which can have no relevancy to the collectlon of the tax at all. The act is In essence and on its face a complete regulation of boards of trade, with a penalty of 20 cents a bushel on all \" futures \" to coerce boards of trade and their members into com\u00ad pliance. When this purpose la declared in the title to the blll. and ls so clear from the edect of the provlslons of the blli itself, It leaves no ground upon which the provlslons we have been con\u00ad slderlng can be sustained as a valid exercise of the taxing power. should like to go further into the discussion of this feature of titles II and VIII of this bill, but I hope I have said enough to impress you with my sincerity and with the fact that this is a very important matter and that you should give it your best attention. I think it is as much the duty of the Attorney General to give both sides of these matters careful consideration as it is our duty to do so. I do not think he is justified in taking a partial position. I am glad that the people of the country Yet have a right to look hopefully to the Supreme Court as one branch of the Gov\u00ad emment that will give consideration to both sides of any case. Title VIII is not a revenue title. This whole bill is not a revenue bill. It is an economic-security bill. Sometimes I think that Mr. CONNERY, of Massachusetts. is absolutely right when he insists that there is some question whether this bill should eve-r have been considered by the revenue- raising committee and that it might properly have been referred to the Labor Committee to consider it from the standpoint of its being an economic-security bill. I should like to ask the Democratic leaders who are members of the Rules Committee why they found it necegary tobrtngthls RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 15 bill up for consideration under a special ru!e if the bill is rightfully a revenue bill? We all know that a revenue bill properly reported from the Ways and Means Committee is a privileged bill, and it is not necessary for a special rule to be ordered for the consideration of a privileged bill. MY friends, I repeat that title I and title VIII were ore and the same in the minds of those who conceived this measure. They were or.e and the same in the original bill. They have been separated by letter nr.d word, but they are one in spirit. Who is it that has not heard that great sentence, \"The letter killeth but the spirit quickeneth and maketh alive \"? When the Supreme Court comes to interpret this bill, if it becomes a law, I am thankful for the faith that the Ameri\u00ad can people yet have in that high tribunal that it will give heed to the spirit of legislation as well as to the letter. Under our theory of government the State is the real nucleus of poner and authority. Some people have the mis\u00ad taken idea that government is built up from the family community and the township to the county and .from the county to the State and from the State to the Nation. This is not the case. Originally we had 13 States. These States passed their own laws providing for their lesser subdivisions of counties, townships, and municipalities. These 13 States also gave up a suf5cient of their own sovereignty to establish ..,.---a FCdCial Go,,,,,,,eiit. The States built down to the lowest unit and the States built up to the highest unit. The Con\u00ad gress of the United States can enact only such legislation as is permitted under the Constituticn. Why harm and hinder these great programs of economic securiiy, with which we ail agree, by attaching to them provisions that load them down with uncertainty as to merit, as to justice, and as to con\u00ad stitutionality? I beseech of you that you give these far- reaching propositions the thought and consideration that true, patriotic citizens should give who have no other pur\u00ad pose in mind than the best interests of the Republic. IApplause.3 Mr. DOUGHTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield i0 minutes to the gentleman from New York [Mr. CULLEN]. Mr. CUTLEN. Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen of the Committee, my distinguished friend from Ohio [Mr. JE-~1 has tried to lead the House to believe that-this is not a tax bill, that it is not a revenue bill, and therefore the Ways and Means Committee did not have Jurisdiction over it. The gentleman knows better than that. He sat with the committee for 8 weeks, and he knows that among the provisions of the bill is an imposition of a 5-percent Lax, which brings it within the jurisdiction of the Committee 3n Ways and Means. His contention is so absurd that I am astonished. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. The gentleman does not contend !hat the spirit of the bill is a revenue bill? Mr. CULLEN. The spirit of the law or the bill provides lor a tax, and therefore the jurisdiction was rightly in the Committee on Ways and Means. Now, in regard to his statement about the titles, no indi\u00ad iridual Member is denied the right to vote for any particular Litle. and therefore that argument falls to the ground. Of :ourse. the bill has been changed. Whenever you have structural legislation, you must make changes to meet con\u00ad titions. The main principles of the bill are preserved. The gentleman from Ohio participated in all the hearings. He .oaned the committee his wisdom, ability, and experience to perfect the bill, and yet he comes here and says that we lave to go down the line with our Party. The gentleman vould have to go down the line with his party if the shoe 77a.son the other foot. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. cm. Yes. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio.

Has the gentleman found out Yet when the minority members of the Ways and Means Com\u00ad mittee made up their mind to vote against title II? Mr. CULLEN. After they had several conferences in which am led ti beiieve they did not always agree. It would not be surprising if some of the minority would vote for the bill in its entirety, including title IL Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. CULLEN. Yea. Mr. JENKINS of Ohio. I do not want to let the facetious remarks of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. MCCOR\u00ad MACKI go unchallenged. There might have been some discord among the Republicans about title H and title VHI. but the gentleman knows that all through the discussion the members of the minority opposed that, and furthermore, the gentleman knows that there are members on his side who opposed this proposition. The gentleman from Massachusetts was not always in unison with that measure. Mr. McCORMACK. The views of the gentleman from Massachusetts were substantially incorporated when the so- called \" voluntary annuity *' was reserved by th? committee for further study. Mr. CULLEN. Mr. Cbairma,n. in the statement that I am about to make in regard to this legislation, I respectfully ask not to be interrupted until the conclusion of the statement. The economic-security bill which is now before us for Anal consideration is one of the legislation which have come before Nearly a year ago, on June 8. our dent, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Congress advocating social-security thereafter he created by Executive most important pieces of the House for many years. great humanitarian Presi\u00ad transmitted a message to legislation, and shortly order a committee whose purpose was to make a comprehensive study of the many complicated factors in industrial life which lead to depend\u00ad ency and destitution. and make proper recommendations for overcoming such causes of insecurity. While we are now considering o!d-age and unemployment- insurance legislation it is nevertheless not entirely new to the country because it has been advocated by fraternal organizs\u00ad tions, and particularly the Eagles. Our great President himself advocated it when he was Governor of the State of New York, at which time he was already thinking of the masses of the people of our country. Insofar as Congress is concerned. this is pioneer legislation of a humanitarian character, and the bill reported to the House by the Committee on Ways and Means is based upon the recommendations of the President in his message to both Houses of Congress on January 17 of this year. The Ways and Means Committee. tc whom the President's recommendations for security and unemployment-insurance legislation were referred, held extensive hearings on the bill and after 8 weeks of intensive work the committee reported a bill tc the House which. in my opinion, is as near perfect as possible. The committee gave the most thorough study to every phase of this important subject of social-security and unemployment inmmnca The economic-security bill presents the most substantial evidence to date that our twin objectives of recovery and reform are found in an inseparable unity of purpose and action. While the horror of the depression is still fresh upon our memory, we are taking decisive steps to shake off its lingering aftermath, to prevent its recurrence, and to set UP safeguards for those who may suffer in the future from economic forces beyond the control of the individuaL Old age. unlike unemployment, is a natural consequence that descends upon mankind everywhere with unfailing reg\u00ad ularity. Therefore the bill treats this problem primarily on a national basis. It sets up a Federal system of compulsory old-age insurance, which will provide at least the minimum requirements for health and decency to every worker who has reached 65 years of age. At the same time, the measure is careful to make special provisions for workers who are now so near the retirement age that they will have no chance to insure themselves by their own contributions. Another important feature of this bill is the provision for unemployment insurance. There is no reason why the worker unemployed through no fault of his own should be more neglected than machinery that is idle during the slack season. There is no justification for giving the man who has grown old and tired in the performance of his life's work no consideration for his efforts. The day has passed when the wealthiest nation in the world can remain the most delinquent in iti treatment of the most pressing of all social questions. The proposed legislation is not confined to old-age pen\u00ad sions and unemployment insurance. Federal subsidies are provided to help the States in caring for dependent chii\u00ad dren, in promoting maternal and child welfare, in aiding the crippled, and in advancing public health. While most of this money is to be allocated among the States on a dollar- for-dollar matching basis, there is enough flexibility to safe- guard the poorer localities which are unable to help them- selves. Of course, it must be realized that the bill does not rep\u00ad resent the zenith of perfection in social-security legislation But considering that we are venturing into a region that heretofore has been practically unexplored by the National Government in this country, the bill does embody a step for- ward that is almost unparalleled in its boldness and scope. We are breaking the ground for a structure in which eco\u00ad nomic wisdom and humanitarian impulses shall be blended in perfect proportion to protect millions of our citizens from undernourishment during their formative years, from pri\u00ad vation in their prime of life, and from destitution in their old age. The President emphasized his belief that the Economic Security Committee had evolved a program that would ap\u00ad peal to the sound sense of the American people. It had not attempted the lmpos%lb~ He said- nor haa It falled to exe&se sound and conelderatlon c# all the factors concerned: the natlord credit. the rights and th\u00ad ~potibflltles of S~&CS. the -pacIty of respoo$billtks. and the fundamental neceslty 'ior pro- reeding In a manner that will malt the enthusiastic s-uppmt af titlzens of au SortA Another principle. the President said, was that the actual management of the plan, except possibly ln the csse of old-age insurance, should be left to the States, subject to standards established by the Federal Government: He held, however, that the financial management of funds and & serves should be retained as a trusteeship by the United States Treasury. Legislative proposals to carry out these principles were incorporated in the bill, which has been worked out in col\u00ad laboration with the men and women who compiled the social-security report for the President as well 85 the Ways and Means Committee. The President stressed the importance of State leg&la\u00ad tion, and to this end asked the speediest action by Congress In that connection I might say that Governor Lehman. of New York, which is also my State, advocated the adoption of social-security and unemployment legislation modeled on the bill now pending p Congress I am happy to stat& that both the Assembly and Senate of the New York Legislature has approved such a measure, and it is now before the Governor for signatureb I CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE APaIL 16 In view of New York's record as to the adoption of a social legislation, it is not surprising that this should be tb fourth State in the Nation to adopt unemployment insur ante. I believe that only Utah, Wisconsin. and Washingto preceded New York. There are other proposals pending in the Congress on thi subject, yet in my opinion it is wise for us to proceed cau tiously and carefully in this initial legislation. Thereforf I believe that the bill before us is a step forward in th direction of economic-security and unemploqment insur ante and the careful study that it has received in the hand of the Ways and Means Committee, led by that rugged an sincere personality, Chairman DOIJGHTON, who guided u through this complex problem, I sincerely hopc and tms when the debate is closed on this bill and when we proceec to the S-minute rule, that the House in its wisdom will keel it intact in every particular and pass it just as it has corn' from the Ways and Means Committee and uphold the hand of our great President in the adoption of this humane legis lation.

Mr. LEWIS of Maryland. Mr. Chairman, I enter tht! discussion with a full appreciation of the lack of time to exe plore fully the values of this bill, and that it Is only possible to touch upon some of its ruling considerations. I ask mu colleagues under such circumstances to excuse me from an\u00ad swering particular questions, which might be better deferred I think, until me come to a minute consideration of the bill. It was my privilege for the first time to visit the lands of our ancestors in 1931. The depression was already upon us When I returned, friends were always asking, \" Lzwrs, how did you flnd things in Europe? \" MY answer was that in Holland. Belgium, Prance, and Switzerland at that time con\u00ad ditions seemed to be about their normal, but that in Ger\u00ad many and Great Britain, notably, their conditions of unem\u00ad ployment resembled those within the United States, with this important difference: The agony was taken out of it for the working men of Germany and Great Britain by their social-insurance systems. Over there I found the Prime Minister did the worrying, and why should he not? Who, more than the Prime Minister, the government of a country, was responsible for the unemployment which prevailed? of do the work for which 10 men were required half a generation ago. Now we have to thank the scientist, the inventor, and the engineer for their great achievements, and we do thank them In the long run, doubtless, it is desirable that the work of the world should be accomplished with a mini- mum of labor. But allow me to aiIirm, with all the eamest\u00ad ness of my nature, it is only desirable provided certain funda\u00ad mental conditions are not violated. One of those conditions is the right of a human being to earn his living in the sweat of his face. IApplause. The world does not owe a man a living. I grant YOU, but as surely as a God rules the heavens, it does owe him a chance to make a living1 CApplause.1 And when by adopting such policies the Government has deprived him of that chance, and when the Government's help is asked to save him from starvation--is that help to be regarded as compensation or sneeringly referred to as a dole? Do we take property from our people without compensation? Yet these rights of the worker have been taken away, and this measure is only a partial recognition of the right of the dis\u00ad employed to compensation and equality before the law. PQUALrrT Emax TEIX LAW What do we mean by equality before the law? We are very proud of the principle in this country. The fathers in one of your home towns And it necessary, we will say, to cut a new street across from one avenue to another, but the owner of the property objects. His father died there, -he says, he was born there, he wishes tc die there too. However, the city fathers answer that the welfare and convenience of that community must prevail over his hidi\u00ad vidual sentiment, and they evict him from the premises and tear the building down. But mark you, they do not evict him until they have given him just compensation for the rights of property taken away. Ladies and gentlemen, other countries have long preceded us in granting these disemployed workers some compensation in the moment of their needs and their suffering. Shall we deny them here. in the country of Washington, like equality fore the law? I fear the unemployment sents a chronic condition. think of it the other way. There are two kinds of amount of employment Unhappily. the emphasis to which I have referred rep:+ I know it is more pleasant to inventions. one that reduces the and another which increases it. is being placed on inventions and nethods reducing employment. Let me give two concrete examples that will suftlce. You have, for example. in the work-increasing field, the automobile, with the great road\u00ad auilding activities accompanying it. In the other f?eid I refer D there is the ditch-digging machine that is said with two nen to displace as many employees. perhaps, as 3 hundred. Yom, if those inventions fell like rainfall, if they came equally, hey would compensate each other. If, like the sexes, there ~2.5some power to say. \"One little boy, one little girl; one ittle girl one little boy **. then in the throw of nature an ~uilibrium would result, and we perhaps might not be so ;eriously minded about our great problem But unhappily the emphasis, I say, is placed on the work\u00ad -educing inventions. In the shops and great factories of our country you will find a suggestion box where the worker, iowever humble, is invited to contribute his suggestion bout plant improvement, reducing expenses here, simplify\u00ad ng processes there, all of them working to reduce the gross :mployment necessary.

THF.lw.fFLor- Mssz Have we not as thinkers and lawmakers come to the poln It in our path when we must look upon the employment asseIt as the most important asset in our lives, and as a great sociail responsiblllty? Of course, I know that the employer ma.Y not always regard it that way. His thought has not been sufllciently directed to it. He iS naturally disposed to look upon the employment attribute of his factory as he looks upon the physical property Itself-ilk e his own house-and as if he owned it wholly. But he doe S not own it wholly. The employment attribute belongs as we1!l to the human beings who must exercise it in order to live !. Our industrial order, like the industrial orders which hav e preceded, must accept its obligation to meet the primar: I needs of the human race dependent upon it. previous sys terns have not denied such duties.

Even unde slavery. the owner did not deny his obligation to feed am clothe and doctor the slaves, no matter what might happen to crops or to markets. LEGALSANcrIoNs ANDTRS llcElT l-0 WOES Ladies and gentlemen of the House, there is an absen t chapter in our treatment here today. The bill does not en r by excess of provisions-it errs by a serious omission Be.- fore we have done full justice in this subject and have actec 1 in full wisdom toward it, legal sanctions must be provldec i for a man's right to work. The industrial order must glvf ! him his fair share of the employment available. It must ab\u00ad negate the privilege of turning thumbs down on the father al ; 46. Each worker must be given his day in court with full legti I remedies provided to effectuate this right to work, just 8!3 they are provided for all the forms of property. [Applause.] How dces It happen that this right to work that nobody ' RECORD-HOUSE objectives mentioned in its preamble BS the purpose of the Constitution. But it also received much more specific at\u00ad tention. I am glad to see Virginia faces here today. for I have now to refer to names and incidents that ought to arouse a feeling of pride in the Virginia breast. When the Virginia delegation reached Philadelphia, some- what ahead of the delegations from other States. they ore- pared a plan for a Constitution. General Washington headed that delegation. Governor Randolph Mr. Madison and. I think, also Mr. Mason were members. What did the; propose with regard to this subject? I read now from the preamble of the Vlrginla plan: Re8oZued.Thatthe artlclee of confederatIon ought to be so cor\u00ad rected and enlarged 88 to accompv:sh the obJ&ta proposed by their lnstftutlon: namely. common defense. security of liberty. and general welfere. But how attain this general welfare? Well, the plan pro\u00ad vided \" that the Congress should enjoy the power to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent.\" In other words, Mr. Chairman, when the subject matter transcended the powers of the State because of its geograph\u00ad ical inability to reach both cause and effect, they recognized a general or interstate subject. In such cases the Federal Government should enjoy legislative -power to act. Ob\u00ad viously these great makers of the Constitution, Mr. Chalr\u00ad man, were far from intending to leave a vacuum ln the Constitution as to the field of legislative subject matter on which the State was geographically incompetent to act. They left no such vacuum in the Judicial power to act where plaintiff and defendant reside in different StatpS The in\u00ad tention of the Convention was completely manifest: That the sum total of the powers of the State legislature plus the power of the National L&Mat~ure should equal the sum 1total of the powers of the colonial legislature and the House , of Commons before their separation. Why not? The Vir- Iginia plan in this respect was voted on favorably a number ,of times in the Convention. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair reminds the gentleman from IMaryland that he has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. SAMUEL B. EIIL Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 additional 1minutes to the gentleman from Maryland Mr. LEWIS of Maryland. I thank the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Hn~l. What did the ConventIon do? The Wzshinggn.or Virginia, planwith regardtothls matterbe\u00ad ame the general welfare clause In the Constitution And sow. Mr. Chairman. I have to call your attention to a most mportant accident In the l&tory of the Constitution. As IOU read the Washington Convention copy of the Constitution If September 12, just 3 days before final signature, you will Ind that the welfare clause was preceded by a semicolon at ;he end of the clause on taxation. That is. the taxation and velfare clauses were separated by a semidon I read: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties. has ever disputed in the history of the world-a moral right as fixed as the foundations of society-will not secure a sin& wageworker a loaf of bread tomorrow or save his family from eviction? How does it come that all kinds of property, property ln cats, dogs, cows, or anythIng imaginable, is provided protection through thr processes of the courts and nothing in the way of legal defense Is provided this worker for his inalienable right to work? I do not charge any conscious class dlscrimlnatlon against the lawmaker for the discrimination between property rights and this personal right to work. But I do fear the worker has been the-victim of an unconscious class bias. raz G- L-ASS only have about 10 minutes remaining, and I shall go to the Constitution and our general welfare. The general welfare-the aged grandma, and the aged grandpa long turned away from the mills, the disemployed workmen, now do they relate to this general welfare? My answer is that the causes of their deprivation, as well as unemployment, are general in character. They are not local or personal causes. By \" general welfare \", I mean what the makers of the Con\u00ad stitution meant-interstate welfare. I mean that portion of the public welfare over which the State can exercise no competent legislative power. Wherever the causes and their effects are not both circumscribed within a single State so as to be reached by the processes of its courts or by the mandate of its lawmakers, they are interstate in charsckr. Our un\u00ad employment conditions are certainly interstate and can be said to be often international in character. So I say to you that we have a general or interstate welfare problem before us in our subject today. Now, how about the Constitution on the subject of such general welfare? I do not need to say to you, I am sure, that the general welfare is one of the triology of great 1mposts. and esclses- Semicolon after exckes\u00ad t o pay the debts. provide for the common defense and general -4relfareoftheUnitedStrte& I am reading from the printed lntra-Convention copy of jeorge Washington, who was president of the Convention. rhe copy was turned over to a copyist to write out ln hand m parchment for engrossment, and then a mistake occurred. i comma was substituted for the separating semicolon.

If I understand the question of the chairman rtght. the idea ln his mlnd ls that It is equally as well when you put a comma there, it Is equally as well set apart from what goes before as though there was a semlcolon there. and ii the clause\" to provide for tiie payment of debts and gene& welfare * Is a mod.tkatlon of what orecedes. -YOU should not have either a comma or a semicolon. hfr.

It seems to me to get the last amstructlon you would have to take the comma out. What ls the use of the comma2 A-TPOWXS Mr. Chairman, I think it is clear that with comma or semi- colon the clause was intended as a power, and that Congress may \" provide for the general welfare n not merely through the levying of a tax but by other logical and legitimate meth\u00ad ods; for example, the prescription of justiceable rights and duties generally. It is true that such a power is applicable tc but a limited part of the total field of legislative subject mat\u00ad ter. But when applicable it possesses r&araderistics and properties like the postal clause, enabling the lawmaker tc fully control the subject matter. The break-down of the principle of competition in fermlng and coal mining which calls for a limitation of the production of such products, the equal right of competent men to work and to a share of the Nation's employment, all subjects which the separate State is organically unable to encompass for geogmphical reasons are examples of interstate subjects. the evils of which may nm into catastrophes if an equal interstate power to treat them be denied. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we are at the cross- roads of history. The State is incompetent to act. Either the people have powar to act through their general govern\u00ad ment or we fail in our generation Once before we were at these crossroads. It was on the subject of slavery. The statesmen of that day found an adjustment in the Missouri Compromise Act. But the act was declared void; there was no authority under the flag, it was said, to deal with that problem. and a sword was placed in every man's hand. Ladies and gentlemen, if authority is now denled us, if it is declared that on our problems of the general welfare there is a like vacuum in the legislative authority, down into the vacuous chasm may fall the proud structure of our dual form of government, to arise-if arise we can-not as a Federal Republic but as some soviet or fascist power with all our honored State lines effaced forever. Mr. Chairman, there are a half dozen industrial countries of the world like Germany, England, and the United States that are facing now-1 shall not say the most ominous, but I will say the most difficult problem the human family has ever had to face. Shall this our American Home of Com\u00ad mons enjoy the same privilege of dealing with those subjects enjoyed by the other parliaments of the world, or shall we, in a contraction&t spirit toward our beloved Constitution, deny its healing hand to suffering humanity? Yes, in&&; we RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 face the cross roads. Do not give trust to a policy of drift and fortune. It may lead us further down into the swamps of human suffering and despair. We have examples of how neglect to act has brought indescribable misery to the human race. Look into the Empire of India with its submerged mil- lions. Behold it as the possible future of your own children. And so warned, let us, my colleagues, take the path that led forward to the uplands of justice and social security. CA~plause.1 IHere the gavel felLI Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL Mr. Chairman. I yield one-half minute to the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. RAN- DoLWI. Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, I do not desire thla time to ask the gentleman from Maryland a question, be- cause I. as well as all other Members of the House. have listened with interest to the masterZul manner in which the gentleman hss presented this subject. I simply wish to say to the membership that my able colleague [Mr. LEwrsl went into the mines at the age of 9 years and knows the problems of the worker. He understands what it means to earn a livelihood by the sweat of his brow. I believe the Members of the House should know the fact. IApplause. [Here the gavel fell1 Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. TrcuMl. Mr. TRUAX Mr. Chairman, I want to preface my re- marks with the statement that. in my judgment, the amended Doughton bill, H. R. '7260. will pass the House of Representatives by a large number of votes. I say \" amended *' because I believe there will be worth-while amendments offered and adopted. I have amendments that I desire to offer and other Members have amendments which they desire to offer. I am sure that the Ways and Means Committee, which has given so freely of its time and used so much of its efforts and energies to report a bill to the House that might be practicable and workable, will view these meritorious amendments in the same spirit which they are offered. Mr. Chairman. I unhesitatingly state that I am in some- what hearty accord with the purposes of the 10 titles of this bill, under which its various PrOvisf0n.s are fully covered I think we are all in accord with the main objectives of +he bill, namely, no. 1, old-age peILsiOn.% no. 2, compensation for the unemployed; no. 3, governmental aid to mothers and their dependent children; and no. 4. governmental aid and financial assistance for the protection, conservation. and maintenance of the public health I think it is generally admitted by the sponsors of the bill that it is by no means perfect. Mr. Chairman. I think that they generally admit, as we all do, that this bffl does not tn any manner or means ade\u00ad quately or satisfactorily solve the problems which we seek to solve. However, we all admit that this is a begbming. We admit that unless more effective provisions. such 83 in- creasing the amount of old-age pensions, finding additional sources of revenue, and increasing in the end unemployment compensation, this legislation will eventually fall by its own weight. But, having made a start and having struck the goal which we seek, I am sure that the Congress and those to foliow in its path will think of progress and that they will go forward instead of backward. I think that we Demo\u00ad crats may say that the enactment of this legislation is not LX@ a redemption of the pledges of our great President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, but that it is also a redemption of the pledges of the Democratic Party, and, further, we are giving a favorable answer to millions of distressed farmers, iistressed wage workers, small business men, independent producers, and war veterans, all of whom will be benefited 3ircctly and indirectly by the passage of this humanitarian iegislation I think that we all admit that the cost of this legislatlm will rapidly Increase year by year, not only because of tha natural and rapid increase in the niunber of persons 65 rears of age and over, but because of the very fact that housandsand hundredsafthousandsof individualincomea CONGRESSIONAL have vanished and have &en wiped out by this recent and prolonged depression, and by the fuither fact that the enor\u00ad mous concentration of wealbh and money in this countrs has made it impossible for the sons and daughters to longer support their parents as was the custom in the past. At this point. Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to introduce a tab!e giving the figures on the number of aged people over 65 years. Mr. KNUTSON. Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to ob\u00ad ject, will the gentleman yield to me for a brief time? Mr. TRUAX. I will yield for a question. Mr. KNUTSON. 1,wlthdraw the objection, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN (Mr. Buacn1. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. KNUTSON. The gentleman stated a moment ago that this legislation is a fulnllment of a pledge in the Dem\u00ad ocratic platform. Mr. TRUAX. Yes. Mr. KNUTSON. It reads as follows: We advocate unemployment and old-age Insurance under St6te Laws. Mr. TRUAX. That is what we are doing. We are co\u00ad operating with the States and furnishing half of the money. Mr. KNUTSON. You are detouring in doing it, though. Mr. TRUAX. Well, we are bridging the gap that was cre\u00ad ated by the failure of the Republican Party to do anything at all. ILaughter.1 Mr. KNUTSON. May I suggest that we did not need any pensions when we were in power. because everybody had jobs. Mr. TRUAX. I cannot yield further, Mr. Chairman, I am sorry. Now, Mr. Chairman, there are other plans for old-age pensions that have received Nation-wide publicity and have been somewhat freely discussed by Members of this House. One of the plans which is nationally known, is the so-called 'I Townsend plan\" Under the old Townsend-plan bill, which was introduced, some twenty to twenty-four billlon dollars per year was re\u00ad quired to finance it. This bill was to be financed by a sales tax. I have always been unalterably opposed to the imposition of any sales tax whatsoever, because all sales taxes are SUC\u00ad cessful attempts to shift the tax burden from the rich to the backs of the poor. George White, Governor of Ohio, 193135. was commonly known as \"Sales Tax George.\" He was adamant and un\u00ad yielding in his chosen role of special anointer to and for the rich. He called the Ohio State Legislature bark repeatedly, browbeat them, wore their resistance down until in the end he obtained a 3-percent sales tax. Voters of Ohio exhibited their resentment and enmity by defeating Goremor White for United States Senator in the August 1934 primaries. Former Gov. Vie Donahey. known as \"Honest Vie '*, and a lifelong opponent of sales taxes, defeated Sales Tax George to the tune of 2 to 1. Certain features of the Townsend plan are highly meri\u00ad torious and worth the support of any Member of this Con\u00ad gress. The plan to retire men at the age of 60, remove them from active participation in industry. thus making room for unemployed men of younger ages is most commendable. The age limit of 65 fixed ln the Doughton bill is undesirable and not entitled to farorcble consideration by the real friends and supporters of equitable old-age pension legis\u00ad lation. I heartily favor reducing the age limit in the Dough- ton bill to 60 years. The provisions in the Townsend plan which provide for an immediate spending of all pensions received within 30 days is admirable and one designed to place money lmme\u00ad diately in circulation with its corresponding increase in the Nation's buying power. The pensions received by recipients under the Townsend plan would mean a considerable amel\u00ad ioration of the hardships and tragedies of unemployment. Idle men in the crafts, the carpenter, the painter, the steel RECORD-HOUSE worker. common laborer, could be gainfully employed In use\u00ad ful work. The butcher, the baker, the hardware man, the garage proprietor, the automobile salesman, all would be benefited by payment of old accounts, new purchases, and ServfuS. The whole idea invo!ved here is quite the antith\u00ad esis of the practices and purposes of the greedy and selfish and idle rich whose sole aim, whose sole ambition in life is to amass more and more and more of fflthy lucre. We are now informed that under the provisions of the new bill which has been substituted by Representative MCGROARTYfor the original Townsend plan that the amount will be reduced to $50 per month instead of $200. In the event of enacting this plan into law the system would be pay as you go. No debts, or tax-exempt bonds would be needed Recipients of pensions would receive the money only as it was collected from the taxing sources. This plan of flnanc\u00ad ing certainly has much to commend, and in the event of failure to tax wealth and to tax incomes the way they should be taxed might well be considered. Certain it is that such a plan would restore a vigorous purchasing power among the very classes with whom purchasing power is nonexistent. The revolving-fui,d idea is not only new, it is unique. In&ad of hoarding money it undertakes a real redistribution of money. As a member of the Committee on Labor, I may say that was one of seven who voted to report favorably the so-called \" Lundeen workers' bill.\" Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. Mr. Chairman, w!ll the gentleman sie!d for a auestlon? Mr. TRUAX. For a question: yea Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL What would that cost per Year in hXf%S? Mr. TRUAX. I have no idea. I may say to the gentle- man from Washinggn. probably $3,000,000.000 per year. [Laughter.] I will state to the gentleman, however, that the best fea\u00ad ture of th? Lundeen bill is the provision to tax wealth and alI incomes in excess of $5,000 per year. Any gentleman who has an income of $5.000 per year and who is unwilling to con- tribute his share to keep the unemployed and the old people who have no income or no property, is unworthy of the respect of clear-thlnking men and women, and I am sure the gentle- man from Washington does not belong to that class. CApplause.1 Mr.KENNEY. Mr. chairman, will the gentleman yleld for a question? Mr. TRUAX Not Just now. Let me first complete.my statement. scxLu..- I repeat and summa rize certain statements made earlier in my remarks: The enactment into law of old-age pensions, unemploy\u00ad ment compensation, protection for mothers and dependent children, and the preservation of public health will mark another milestone in the battle for human rights waged by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Seventy-fourth Congress. It is admitted by the sponsors of the bill that it does not adequately meet the situation or solve the problem. It is a beginning, however. I would amend the bill so that re\u00ad cipients would receive $30 to $50 per month at the age of 60, $75 at the age of 65, and $100 at the age of 70. rather than the $15 proposed. I would reduce the age limit from 65 to 60 years. App&an!s for pensions should not be sub\u00ad jected to a property test or be l&.&jacked into signing a pauper's oath. Instead of taxing the public or issuing addi\u00ad tional tax-exempt bonds to raise the extra funds as advo\u00ad cated here, they would be obtained by a capital tax levy on the millionaires, proper taxes on inheritances, gifts, and excessive incomes. Unemployment is due not only to the depression but to tremendous concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. massed industry, and the mechanistic age. I heartily ap\u00ad prove of unemployment compensation. The cost should be borne, however, by the large industrlahsts who profit by the I --- $3 per week for each dependent child, certainly not aln excessive nor extravagant amount. The Lundeen bill 1s self-financing in that it provides for the levying of sufllcien .t taxes on all gifts, inheritances, and incomes over $5,000 pe r year. The contents of the bill are covered in 10 titles. In titl the Federal Government proposes to match an amoun equal to that contributed by the States for old-age pensiom The annuity system, commonly known as \"old-age bene fits \", is provided for in title II, becoming effective to people who have reached the age of 65, benefits beginning in 1942 The amount of the benefits is to be determined by tb amount of wages formerly received by the annuitant. am CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 15 sweat and ton of wage workers.

The Pederal Governmen furnishes one-third of the total amount used in the Stati for this humanitarian purpose. In my State of Ohio we know something about so-callec I '* mothers' pensions \", which is really a misnomer. In title V we are making grants to States for as&stance in the voca. tional rehabilitation of crippled and disabled children. Tht ? funds to be used are upon a 50-50 basis between the State ? and Federal Government. Serving as a member of the Ohic ) State Board for Vocational Rehabilitation for a period of fi years, I am happy to endorse this feature of the social- security program in the highest possible terms. In title VI [ we provide for grants in aid to the States for developing : their public-health services. In Ohlo the department oit health is under the personal direction of the Governor. The ! director of public health is a member of the Governor's ; cabinet. The Federal Government proposes to continue ltz 1 Public Health Service. and particularly in its investigatory work, with every effort at its command. The social-security board created under title VII is to be! an independent agency within the Department of Labor, There is much difference of opinion here as to the merits of this plan or the advisability of having a wholly separate ~ and independent agency in charge of the administration of this broad and far-reaching program. Under title VIII we levy an income tax determined by a certain percentage of wages, starting with 1 percent in 1937 and increasing to 3 percent by 1949. Unfortunately and un\u00ad wisely, in my Judgment, the bill exempts domestic servants and agricultural laborers. I can find no justifiable reason for these exemptions, particularly as relating to farm work\u00ad ers. Certainly the farmer and the farm hand are entitled to every consideration and every protection that may be given to workers in manufacturing industry. Agriculture is the mast wheel of the world Accelerate the motion of it Third. Protection for mothers and welfare of their de\u00ad :pendent children. Fourth. The protection, preservation, and betterment of public health. I repeat, this country has approximately 7.500.000 men and women aged 65 and over. Of this number, practicahy l,OOO,OOO are dependent upon relatives, the public. or the Government for su?port and maintenance. The large ma\u00ad jority of these unfortunates are on Government relief. The number of aged persons over 65 will increase ln the future not only because of the rapid natural increase of persons of this age but also because of the fact that thousands of llder workers now gainfully employed will never be steadily employed again the wiping out of the life savings of thou- sands of worthy persons nearing old age and astonishing nability of sons and daughters to no longer support their parents. At this point I introduce a table from the United states censuses giving startling figures with respect to I.-Actual and csttmatcd number o/ 65 over compared to total population, 1860 to 2000 Yepr ~~~~ - !?&I 1930 from the United States censuses. Twenty-six States have already adopted old-age-pension I11~s. The plan outlined in this bill is one not to tear down II tar destroy these State plans already in existence but to g rant them aid and assistance by matching the amount. of ompensation that has already been provided for in these ; ;tates. It is admitted by the sponsors and framers of this bill that he legislation contained in the bill does not in any manner r means adequately or satisfactorily solve the problem. It ; nothing more than a beginning, and unless other and more ffective provisions. such as increasing the amount of com\u00ad ensation monthly and seeking additional sources of revenue, le legislation may fell of its own weight. Certain it is that le cost of old-age pensions will increase by leaps and ounds and that the only source of new revenue is the tap\u00ad ing of predatory wealth, the taxing of swollen fortunes, and roper limitations on huge individual incomes. Let the rich 1the country, the plutocrats of the Nation, the milhonalree, I ---- -- CONGRESSIONAL and the binioqalres finance the cost of this vital and neces\u00ad sary legislation. If the plan proposed in this bill is enacted into law, by 1960 it would cost the State and Federal Gov\u00ad ernments $2,000,000.000 a year.

( AdminiiM So that the cost of old-age security may not become too burdensome in the years to come, and so that +&heaged may look upon this endowment as a human right, and not as a governmental gratuity, we establish through the mechanics of this bill a system of old-a2e benefits or annuities. These annuities are to be paid out of the Federal Treasury, and all administrative details will be handled by the Federal Government. The benefits provided are in proportion to the wages earned. Adjustments are available which tend ti favor the lower-paid employees and those approaching old age. Benefit psyments start at $l&and reach a maximum of $85 per month.

BILL (H. 8. 8887) The vote by which the bill was reported favorably was 7 for and 6 against. So, to my constituents who are interest& in this meritorious bili I am happy to state that my vote was the deciding factor that reported the bill favorable. The Lundeen bill provides for the Payment of insurance for unemployment, old age. part-time unemployment, &knesa, Bccident, and maternity in amountS equal t0 average local 5692 CONGRESSIONAL wages, the average local wage to be determined by the De\u00ad partment of Labor at Washington. In the case of part- time employment, the difference between the part-time em\u00ad ployed worker's earnings and the average local wage would be paid. The cost for this insurance is to be paid for by the United States Government: and if further taxation is necessary, such taxation shall be levied on gifts, inheritances. and incomes over $5.000 per year. The insurance is to be administered by workers' and farmers' organizations under rules to be set up by the Secretary of Labor. It is specifically Provided that insurance shall be paid to all workers and farmers unemployed through no fault of their own. including agricultural, domestic, professional, and oface workers, as well as industrial laborers, who have reached the age of 18 wars. In unemployment compensation the Lundeen workers' bill provides for $10 per week for the head of a family and $3 per week for each dependent child; certainly not an exces\u00ad sive, exorbitant, or extravagant amount. With living costs soaring, and especially in the industrial centers where mil- lions of wage workers live. the amount herein asked is not too much. This bill includes all workers, mcludii unem\u00ad ployed farmers. domestic, professional, and ofllce workers. The failure of the administration bill to provide for these latter groups of toilers who form the basic structure of our Nation is regrettable and indefensible. Another highly commendable feature of the Lundeen bill is that it Is self- financing in that it provides for the levying of sufficient taxes on all gifts, inheritances, and incomes over $5,000 per year. Can it be that any individual fortunate enough to have an income of $5.000 per year will be unwilling to help support his less fortunate brethren? If so, then he does not deserve the respect nor support of respecting men and women. My contention is that the finances to make it nos\u00ad sible to place the bill in operation we are now considering, H. R. 7260. should be obtained from the suwnich and from the swollen fortunes and huge incomes - YI own Posrrlon From 1910 to 1923 I was the proprietor of one of the larger purebred stock farms in the United States. During that period I made 26 public sales on my farm besides sell\u00ad ing hundreds by mail and shipping my stock to every State in the Union and to Canada, South America, Australia, and Japan As editor of the Swine World, published in Chicago, and field representative I attended dozens of sales for other breeders in many States of the Union. For 6 Yeats. 1923-29. I served as director of agriculture for the State of Ohio. In 1932 I was elected Congressman at large for the State of Ohio by the largest vote ever given a congressional candidate in my St&e. In 1934 I was re- elected by a vote of 1.061.857. being high man in the number of votes received In 82 of 88 counties.. My constituents. I am pleased to classify as being composed largely of farm& wage earners, salaried and professional workers, small busi\u00ad ness men, and !ndependent producers and manufacturers. am a pioneer in old-age-pension legislation in Ohio. In the fall of 1933 I cheerfully gave my time and my best efforts and spent my own money in making speeches in nearly every county of my State in that historic campaign for the adoption of old-age pensions by the people. The people responded and adopted this legislation by an over- whelming majority. I shall continue my ellorts and keep the faith. IApplause. [Here the gavel felLI Mr. SAMIlSL B. HILL. Mr. Chairman. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Mrrcrix~Ll. Mr. bfJ?rcHELtL Of IIlinoIs. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the Committee. I am glad, indeed, to have an opportunity to speak my word of approval for U&s great piece of humane legislation. I have sat here in the House for several days and listened with the greatest interest to the debate on this bill-I have heard the objections raised to it. and I have been wondering what can we say against this leg\u00ad islation that has any weight. I have been wondering if we can conscientiously object to an old-age pension such 'as is provided in thts bill. Can we object to trying to insure the RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 15 wages of these men without jobs? Can we have any objec\u00ad tion to providing for the welfare of children and mothers? Who objects to better health conditions? It seems that there is a great deal of alarm here among the Members of that s!de of the House because of the tremendous burden that this humane legislation will place on industry. I do not share that alarm. It so happens that I come from a group of people who are used to bearing burdens. They have been bearing the burdens of this country since they were brought here almost four centuries ago. I sm happy to represent such a group. I am glad to be one of those who have borne the burdens and helped to build up this country. May I not remind you that at this very moment when we are expressing alarm at the burden this legislation will place upon industry, we have in our vaults in this city nearly half the gold of the world. We boast that our country has the greatest natural resources of any country in the world. What are we to do except to use this gold and these resources for the citizens of this country who are now handicapped be- cause of age, or because of disease. or because of the fact they are unable to secure work? Is it not the custom of those representing our industry to erg aloud when industry Is about to be called upon to do its part in carrying the burdens of the Government? We complain of this bill's being written by experts of the administration. It is such a change from what we have been used to with another party in control of the Government. Then bills were written by people on Wall Street. Only a few years ago this Government, under a former ad\u00ad ml&&ration, turned over to a citizen of my city $85,000,000 with which to try and keep a bank alive that was at the time insolvent. In contrast to this, the present admlmstratlon, in keeping with the customs and platform of the Democratic Party, went to the rescue of Sylvester Harris, a poor Negro farmer in the heart of M.is&sippi's Delta when he called the presi\u00ad dent. and informed him that he was about to lose his farm because he could not pay the mortgage and wanted the Gov\u00ad ernment to come to Ns rescue. It was a new day :n politics when this Government went to the rescue of thfs poor Mississippi Negro farmer. It has long since been the custom of our Government, under another party. to go to the rescue of railroads, great industrial cor\u00ad porations, insurance companies. and so forth. where the benefits went ctirect to the privileged rich. It is a new day in politics when citizens of this Nation at the bottom of the ladder can call upon their Government and receive immediate relief. That was a new idea, and the President said to the man at the bottom of the ladder. \"It is the purpose of this Government not only to help the rich but to help those who are overburdened and poor.\" [Applause;1 The only objection I could have to the bffl is this: It seems to me that instead of helping these poor States that have no money, you are trying to forget them at least for the present, as the bill is drawn, apd help those who in some measure can help themselves. I believe the bill ought to be so amended that there would not be a State in the Union, poor as it might be, whose citizens could not share immediately in the benefits of the bill. [Applause.] I do not think it means much for us to pass a law that will help Illinois. my State. because it might have resources to meet the rcqulrements of the bill: and Massachusetts, that has already met them, and a number cf ether States, while the State of Alabama and the State of Mississiypl and the State of Minnesota, and other poor States could not meet the requirements. The CKALRIW. The time of the gentleman fmm IUl\u00ad nois has expired. Mr. SAMUEL B. E Mr. Chah-man, I yield the eentle\u00ad man 3 minutes more Mr. MITCHELL of IllIn0i.s. Mr. Chairman. the people in these poor States are suffering Just as much 86 the old people in these other States, and must they starve and continue to be a burden on their relatives who cannot admtnlstertothelr wants, while others from more favored States benefit under this bill? I believe the bill ought to be so amended that tbs Federal Government would take the burden on Itself to nee I CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE to it that there 1s not an old person in the country above the age of 65 who would be left in want. I know the purpose of those who framed this legislation in this way. You are afraid that you will encourage some States to remain indifferent on that particular point, but I believe an amendment could be drawn so that you could give these States a certain length of time to quahfy. and all the time that they are qualifying these old people in these poor States would be taken care of as in the other S*2&s. I believe the time has come when we ought to think of all the suffering people in the country. The President's message which was delivered to us on the 17th of January admitted that there were a great many States unable to carry this burden, but after all, are not those the people we should help? How will we feel in our hearts if we make it possible for those of the more fortunate States to enjoy the benefits of this legislation while those that are suffering most in these other States which are not able to take care of that burden must continue to suffer. It is like saying to a sick person, \"You are sick and you need some help, but you cannot get medicine until you are able to walk to the drug store and get it.\" Mr. Chairman, I am new in this body and I do not want to take the responsibility of coming forth with an amend\u00ad ment so important as that, but I do hope some of those who are versed in that sort of thing will see to it that that amendment is offered so that I shall have an opportunity to vote for what I consider a most perfect and humane bill. CApplause.1 Mr. KNUTSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 mlnutcs to the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. ROB~ION~. Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the Committee, it was most interesting to me to note the gracious reception and generous applause ac\u00ad corded our colored Democratic colleague from Chicago by our good Democratic friends from the South. He made a splendid speech and is the Representative of one of the great American districts. It seems that the attitude of our Democratic friends from the South has changed tremen\u00ad dously since the time a colored man sat on the Republican side of the House. I am happy to have an opportunity to address you today on the so-called \" social-security bill \" which purports to give relief to aged needy people and dependent children and provide for maternal, child and public health. I am not a recent convert. I have been advocating Federal old- age pensions, pensions for poor widows and for minor chil\u00ad dren, the needy blind, and the needy cripples for many years. I stood on the floor of this House about 15 years ago and defended the constitutionality of and urged the passage of a measure to provide Federal aid to the States in the re- habilitation of persons crippled in industry. The chief op\u00ad ponent of that legislation was one of the finest and ablest men who ever served in this House. I refer to our distin\u00ad guished former colleague and Jeffersonian Democrat, Mr. Tucker, of Virginia. He really believed that the legislation then being proposed by the Republicans was unconstitu\u00ad tional and violated States' rights. During my service in Congress I helped to pass many measures looking to child welfare and the public health: so this social-security program did not have its birth with President Roosevelt or the Democratic Party. The bill before us now is known as \" President Roosevelt's bill \", but if the provisions in this bill for the needy old people, dependent minor children, and crippled children is to be a true test of the President's interest in these humanitarian policies, we can well say that all the humanity in this coun\u00ad try does not rest in the bosom of President Roosevelt or within the hearts of the Democrats, or that there is no interest in social security or humanity among Republicans or the Republican Party. I do not know of a Member on the Republican side of this House that is not heartily in favor of adequate relief in the way of Federal grants or pensions to the aged needy, to dependent and crippled children, and public health, and nearly all that I have heard express themselves have expressed opposition to the very meager and inadequate provisions in this bffl for these needy groups. I have no purpose to criticize the Ways and Means Com\u00ad mittee or its personneL It is made up of a group of WOP\u00ad derful men, both Democrats and Republicans. There Is no more splendid man in this House than the chairman, Mr. bUGHTON, of North Carolina, and knowing other Demo\u00ad cratic members on that committee, I feel sure that this bill does not express what they really desired to be done; but it is the President's bill, as I understand prepared for him by one of the lesser lights of the \" brain trust \". and the President is forcing many of our Democratic friends to jump through the hoop on this bill as he has on other measures. I wonder if the time will come when these able, experienced, outstanding Democrats will cease to be mere rubber stamps for the Prcident and the \" braln trustera.\" No member of the Ways and Means Committee of this House wrote this bilL Mr. FTKXHER. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. Mr. FIITCHER. Just to Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. should desire, because I have subjects I have in m2i. Mr. FLEICHER. Did not bill? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. I have only a limited time. ask the gentleman a question. I cannot yield. much as but a short time to cover the Mr. B.UV&EAD support that Some of the Democrats sup- ported the vocational education and rehabilitation bill. Yes; I am very deeply and earnestly interested in old-age pensions and for aid for dependent and needy crippled c.h& dren I am in favor of the public health. welfare, and health provisions for poor mothers and needy children. and I am in favor of aiding the workers of this country to lay by something for their old age: but let me say to my Democratic friends, you will wake up before many months roll around and flnd out that this is the most disappointing legislation ever offered in Congress, provided you pass the F'resident'a bi which we are now considering. Many people are under the impression that if we pass this bill that the aged needy people over 65 years of age will re\u00ad ceive a pension of $30 per month Nothing could be further from the truth. It is also believed that the Federal Govem\u00ad ment under this measure is putting up $15 for each needy person over 65 years of age. This is not true. In the first place, no one, however needy or however old, even a hundred years old, can secure one dollar in pension until the several States pass laws prescribing the conditions under which a pension can be paid and levy and collect taxes and match the Government's money, dollar for dollar. This bill provides that the States can fix the minimum age anywhere between 65 and '70 years, until 1940. After that, the minimum age must not be more than 65. Any State can define what is dependency, and can and must fix the amount that it will contribute per needy person About 37 States of the Union have some form of old-age pension. Kentucky is one of these States, but its old-age pension law means less than nothing. It is a mere delusion. It merely gives the fiscal court of each county the right to levy and collect a tax to provide old-age pensions. So far as I know, no county in Kentucky has ever put into opera\u00ad tion that provision of the Kentucky law. Only a few of the rich States have anything like substantial old-age pension laws. Twenty-one have no old-age-pension laws of any kind. Under this law, every State in the Union, with the possi\u00ad ble exception of Delaware, will have to change their old-age pension laws, and those States which have none will have to pass an old-age-pension law. It is contended that Ken\u00ad tucky and some other States will have to change their con\u00ad stitutions, requiring a vote of the people. The appropriation of $49.750.000 is to be the Government% part for the year beginning July 1. 1935. and ending June 30. 1936. Perhaps in a few of the rich States they will be able to change their laws and provide means to match ths Government's money and their old and needy will get some pensions, but I feel that I am perfectly safe in saying if I 5694 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 this bffl Is passed in its present form there will be no old, age pensions paid to anyone in Kentucky, however old 0: however needy, within the next year or 18 months, and per haps not at all. Kentucky is deepiy in debt, with a sale: tax and other burdens on the back of the people of Ken tucky, and the State is going deeper in debt every day. Xen tucky may not be able to match the Government's money We may have to change our Constitution There never has been a time when the old and needI required help as they do now. The Democrats runnhrg fol the House and Senate last year urged the people to sent them to the House and Senate instead of Republicans. as the President and they were pledged to provide old-age pensions They have led miiiions of old and needy people to think thal this relief would come, and come now-not a year, 2 years or 5 years hence. Therefore, I am against the provisions in the Presldent'r bill ailowing the States to fix the age at 65 to 70 pears. II should not be more than 60 years. I am against the protie sions of the President's bill that makes it impossible for aru old needy person to get a pension until and unless the Stak matches the Federal money. I think the limit of $15 of Fed. era1 aid is not adequate. Under this measure, it will Marc it possible for the rich States to get more money and the pool States not to get any money. In other words, those who neec aid most will receive the least, or none at all. The Unitec States should treat ali of its old and needy citizens alike. 1 shall favor an amendment to fix the age at not more thar 60 and for the Federal Government tc contribute at kast $20 or $25 and this to be paid to all those who come withir the orovisions of the bill. without regard to the State con\u00ad tribution, and then in due course of time let the States make such additional contribution as they desire and are able tc make. These old people need help and they need it now. I wani them to get this help and get it now. f2xTEEwDoLLAAs~sxxrY cEsYsA-mA-- ADAY This bill provides only $49,750,000 for old-age pensions for the year beginning July 1. 1935. In the committee's report filed-with this bill it is declared there are over 7,500,OOO people in the United States that are over 65 years of age. At least 6,OOO.OOO of these are needy and dependent. Mr. Donc~~ox, the chairman of the committee, says there are about 4,OOO.COO. but he is very much in error. Let us hear in m!ndtCct the Government does not PUGup $15 for each needy person It only matches the State's con\u00ad tribution. If the State iaw fixes the State's contribution at $2 a month, then the Government would only put UP $2 Per month, making $4 per month in alL If the State puta up $5 per month for old and needy persons, the Government would put up only $5, making $10 per month in alL But let us sup- pose the State puts up $15 per month for each needy old person. Then, in that event, the Government would put up $15. making $30 per month in all. Now, as we have already said, the Government in this bill puts up $49.750,000 for the year beginning July 1. 1935. Suppose ail the States should come in and should match the Government's money with $49,75O,OOO more. Then we would have for old-age pension $99,500,000 for that year; but in order to get this sum all the States would have to come in and matc=h the Government's money. If we divide $99.500.000 among 6.000.000 nersons. it would give each person the magnificent sum of $16.60 a year, about $1.40 a month, or about 4% cents a day. Mr. KNUTSON. Mr. Chairman will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. I have not the time. I can- not Yield. Mr. KNUTSON, I will grant the gentleman more time. Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky.

If we keep on importing from Japan and destroying our textile and other industries under the Roose\u00ad velt poiicies, we will be able to live on $16 per year. Mr. RGBSION of Kentucky. We may be abk to starve on ,policles and conditions like those, but &e cannot live. But now suppose we cut down the number to 3.OOO.000 and then what will each pensioner get under this bill. provided the States all come through? Thirty-three dollars and twenty cents a year. or about 0 cents a day. Suppose Only 1.000,000 applied and were allowed pensions. That would be $09.50. or eight and a fraction doliars a month, provided, d course. the State should come through with its Part Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL Wili the gentleman yiield? Air. ROBSION of EQntucky.

I should like to ask the gentleman where he got the figure that there are 6,OOO.OOO people in this coun\u00ad try today over 65 years of age who are in need? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. That is a general and ac\u00ad cepted report of fact. You can gst that anywhere. Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. Well, where? It was not pre\u00ad sented to the Ways and Means Committee in more than a thousand pages of testimony. Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. I know, but all the k~~owkdge does not reside with the very splendid and able memb&s of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. And it does not all reside with the gentleman when he does not know what he is talking about either. Mr. ROBSION of Kentuc'ky. No: I do not claim that have all knowledge. If you pass this, the President's old-age pension law. inside of 12 months you will find out where the 6,000,OOO are. The life-insurance companies and the United States Government's actuaries show, and these figures have been accepted by the United States Government for many years, that of all the persons in the United States on an average who reach the age of 65. only one of them is we&off. Four are able to support themselves with reasonable com\u00ad fort. Five are able to support themselves only partiaIiy. Fifty-four are totally dependent upon public or private charity or relatives. There you have it. Out of 64 persons who reach the age of 65 years, only iive are able to support them- selves. Another five are only able to support themselves partially. Fifty-four are who&? dependent. In other words, more than four-fifths of the people who reach the age of 65 are wholly dependent and would come under the provisions of any reasonable old-age-pension law. The Ways and Means Committee report says there are now 7,5OO,OOO people in the United States who are over the age of 65 years. Less than one-tenth of these are able to support themselves. An- other group of less than one-tenth are able to support them- selves only partially. leaving more than four-fifths that are wholly dependent and cannot support themselves in any way or at all. This gives you more than 6,OOO.OOO needy and dependent people over the age of 65. Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. The proof showed they were 1.000,OOO instead of 6.OOO.000. The gentleman missed it Just j,OOO,OOO. Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. The report of the Ways and cleans Committee shows there were substantially a million people in the United States over 65 that were either on relief or were the objects of public charity. It omitted the )ther 5,OOO.OOO who are either being cared for by relatives who are unable to do so or are dragging through life hungry and cold. The committee's report shows that the number :eaching the age of 65 years is growing. It is estimated ;hat the number over the age of 65 by 1940 would be 8,311,- 100. by 1980 it would be 17,OOl,OOO. But I said if you only counted l,OOO.OOO, this set-up for the rear beginning July 1. 1935, would pay only $8 per month\u00ad &r by the Government and $4 by the State, provided, of xmrse, the State came in. Many States will not be able for nany years to match the Government's money, and I am &aid that is going to be the situation in Kentucky; and I CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE for these and other good reasons, I shall strongly support and favor an amendment providing that the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment shall pay a reasonable sum as an old-age pension to the old and needy of this country, without regard to State contributions. and do it now. They need it now. Under this bill, millions of them will die during the delay without getting anything. Mr. FLETCHER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. I only have a short time remaining. Mr. FTZTCHER. Does Kentucky have an old-age-pension law? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. Yes: it has one and it fools them not quite as badly as this one will fool them if YOU pass it in its present form ABODY $2.75 W TZM 01 AEOUY TNBEX-POU~Y~SS CENTW DAY Our Democratic friends boast of the aid this will give to the dependent children of America. The Ways and Means report shows, and this was emphasized by the distinguished chairman, Mr. DOUGHTON, that there are 9,OOO.OOO children in the United States under the age of 16 and now on Govem\u00ad ment relief. This bill auwouriates $24.750.000 for relief for these dependent, needy children for the year beginning July 1, 1935, and ending June 30. 1936. ThLs is about $2.75 per child per year, or about three-fourths of 1 cent per child per day, and no State can receive any of these pensions until such State shall pass such laws anG provide funds to match the Federal Government's fund of $1 to be put up by the Government and to be matched by $2 to be DUt up by the State. In other words, the State must DUt up 2 to 1. And for all of these matters-old-age pensions, aid to de- pendent children, maternal and child health, crippled chil\u00ad dren, child welfare, vocational rehabilitation, and public health-there is provided in this bill the sum of $91.491.000. Of course, none of this is available to any State unless such State matches the Federal funds. Yes; this small sum is to meet the problem of giving old- age pensions for an entire year to 6,000,OOO or more needy people over the age of 65, more than O.OOO,OOO needy. de- pendent children, and no one lmows how many crippled children or how many needy mothers will need aid in child- birth, or how many children will need health service and child-welfare care, or the hundreds of thousands of men and women who need vocational rehabilitation, or to cover the entire public-health service of the United States. It is grossly inadequate, and what a great disappointment it will be to the millions of neecy old people, and to the millions of needy children; and even with this small sum. there is a string tied to it-the States must change their Iaws and constitutions where necessary and levp and collect the money before one dollar will be given by the Federal Government to these needy groups. I am sorely disappointed with ihe inadequacy of the President's bill and when the bill is read for amendments I shall not lose an opportunity to help amend it so it will give adequate relief and give it when this bill is passed and becomes a law. YEsELmDAND~ I never doubted but what the President's social-security bill would not only take care of in an adequate and sub\u00ad stantial way the groups that are provided for in this meas\u00ad ure but I most certainly thought it would include needy blind people and needy crippled people. Are there m: groups in this country that need relief more than the poor blind and the poor permanently disabled cripples of what- ever age they may be? There is notEng in this bill for the blind and the cripples unless they live to be 65 or 70 years of age. I shall vote and work to have this bill amended to include the needy blind and the needy cripples and to give to them the same rate of pension 8s the needy old people. IJiTLz-mxrTZa)Tm- This measure is grossb inadequate. Our Democratic friends last year urged support of the Democratic candidates for the House and Senate on the plea they were going to help the needy, unemployed, and pay the veterans cash on their adjusted-service certificates. The administration now tries to avoid payment of the bonus and to give adequate relief to the needy on the ground that we do not have the money. I pointed out in my speech when the 14.800.000.~ bill was UP that a lot of o& Democratic friends were voting for that bill and they would be unable to redeem their promises to the veterans and the needy people. My pied&\u00ad tion is coming true. Under that measure the President pro- poses to increase the C. C. C. so that it wilI cost at I&& $600,000,000 for the next year. Coneress has nassed meas\u00ad ures providing more than a billion dollars for the Army and Navy. This is by far the largest amount appropriated for these in peace time. The other day the House p& a measure providing nearly $1?0,000,000 for so-called \"river and harbor improvement and the construction of canals \" that, more than likely, will never be used much. We am spending hundreds of millions of dollars to burn pigs, to plow up cotton. and to pay peo?le not to raise hogs. not to produce cotton. wheat, or corn. We are expending ten or more millions of dollars to maintain \" hobo hotels.\" These encourage young men to leave home and spend their time in idleness- I could enumerate many other &xns running into the millions of dollars. Yes; we have plenty of money for all these, but nothing. or very little, for the defenders of OUTcountry and their dependents, or for the old and needy. for the blind and cripples, and for needy widows and the& orphan children I I yield to no person my deep interest and sincere desire to help work out a plan to build up a fund that will help to take care of them after they may retire or be unable to follow gainful employment or unable to get work In the President's bill this is called \"unemployment in\u00ad surance.\" This is a misnomer. It has been improperly and incorrectly named. This bill does not provide anyone who is without work with a job. It does not provide one dollar of relief to the millions of unemployed in America un\u00ad less they would be able to get in under the old-age pensions, but this so-called \"unemployment insurance\" deals solely and only with those who have jobs or may get Jobs, It gives no relief whatever to the unemployed, either in jobs or in money. Many of the outstanding leaders of labor groups t.elI us there are more than 11.000,000 workers unemployed in this country. I have heard a number of mg Democratic cub leagues on the floor of this House during the course of the debate on this bill say there are 15,000,OOO unemployed. am quite sure. if we would count the tenant and ahare\u00ad croppers and the farm hands throughout the United States who were thrown out of work and taken off the farms be- cause of the Cotton Control Act. the A. k A., and other new-deal policies, we would find more than 20,000,006 people in this country unemployed. Secretarp Ickes of the Interior Department, in a speech at Philadelphia on yes\u00ad terday, declared that the expenditure of the nearly $5.000,- 000,000 so-called \"works bill \" was Justified. as there were somewhere between 20.000.000 and 30.000,000 people in dls\u00ad tress in this country. From all that the President and others have said we were led to believe that the President was going to bring forth some measure that would give some relief to the unemployed, and when this measure was talked of as being one provid\u00ad ing for unemployment insurance, many people believed it would benefit in some way the unemployed of this country. This measure does not and will not put a single man back to work. It does not give any unemployment insurance or unemployment money to any one of these unemployed. What this bill means by unemployment insurance is that a man or woman who has a job and who continues to work for 5 years, and during all of which period of time he or she will have their wages taxed a certain percentage and the employer will be required also to pay a certain per\u00ad centage of tax on these wages. these taxes paid by the worker and the employer will create a fund so that after this has been done for 5 years and the worker quits work or dies or reaches the age of 65 such worker then wili get ai% I CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 annuity-not on anything that the Go vemment is giving t.43 ized labor, they are opposed to the so-called \" unempIoy\u00ad the worker, but on what the worker and his employer have paid in taxes into this annuity fund. The ordinary workman under this plan would get a very small monthly annuity if he quit work or died after 5 years. If he died or had to quit work before he had worked and paid into this fund for 5 years, then he would receive 3% percent of the wages he had earned up to that time. In other words, the worker would be taxed 3 percent, and if he quit paying before the 5 years were up he would get back 3% percent. He would get one-half of 1 percent interest on what he paid in; but we must not forget that the Govem\u00ad ment does not pay anything into this fund to provide this annuity or pension And this only applies to persons employed by individuals or concerns that employ 10 or more persons. If a worker is employed by any person or concern that employs less than 10 men, he would have no opportunity to participate in this so-called \" unemployment insurance.\" Furthermore, farmers, farm laborers, and servants could not participate in this. This so-called \"unemployment sec\u00ad tion \" of this bill does not mean anything to farmers, farm hands, domestic servants, or to those who work for persons or concerns employing less than 10 people. Now, let us see what sort of pension a worker would get. I present a statement set out in the report of the Ways and hleans Committee on this bill. Tarn KU.-1ZZwtratfne monthly Federal old-age benepts under tttze II For instance, if your wages average $50 per month and FJU paid into this fund for 5 years and reached the age of 65 or were unable to go on further, you would draw an annuity of $15 per month; and if you worked for 45 years, averaging $50 per month and paid into the fund, and retired or were unable to continue work, you would draw $35 per month for the balance of your life. We must bear in mind that a worker's expectancy of life ls not very great after he has worked continuously for 45 years. He will not live much longer. You will also observe that if he earned $250 per month and paid 3 percent tax into the fund for a period of 5 years and then reached the age of 65 or was unable to continue work, he would draw $25 per month, and if he continued to work for 45 years and made a salary of at least $250 Per month, at the end of 45 years he would only receive $85 per month for the balance of his life. The great bulk of Americans now and for some time to come will not receive wages which, under the terms of this bill, would give them a very big annuity after they had worked 30 years or 45 years In naming this \" unemployment insurance *' and getting the impression over the country that something was being done in some way to help the unemployed, this measure will be a great disappointment. Let me repeat, this provision concerns itself solely and only with those who now have jobs or who may get jobs and who pay a part of their wages into the fund and the employer pays a part. for a period of 5 years or longer. In that event, and only in bbat event, will they receive an annuity. -~ANUIRWSlXT- So far as I have been able to learn from the workers Iiving in my own district and the representatives of organ\u00adment insurance provisions '* of this bill. Labor thinks it is tmfalr to them to lew this tax on their wages; and while industry Is also required to pay a tax on the amount of each woker's wages and the taxes from both go into this so-called \"unemployment insurance fund '*, the workers believe that they would not only be required to pay their part of the tax on their wages but that the tax paid by industry on their wages would reflect itself in reducing the wages of the work\u00ad ers; and. so far as I have been able to learn, the workers and the representatives of organized labor are opposed to this bill of the President because it is wholly inadequate. The amount provided for old-age pensions and other relief is entirely too small Congress last year passed a compulsory unemployment insurance or pension bill for all of the railroad workers of the country. -This act is MW before the Supreme Court of the United States. Under that bill the railroad workers are taxed 2 percent of their wages, and a like tax is paid by the railroads. There is no provision in this bill to rep--al that law. If this bill is passed in its present form, there will be a double tax on the workers. Many other industries and their workers carry group In\u00ad surance, and so on. This bill makes no exception or provi\u00ad sion for conditions like that. I think this so-called 1'unemployment provlsbn \" of the President's bill should go out and it should go back to the committee and a more comprehensive and equitable measure should be brought out. As I have heretofore pointed out, this deals solely and only with people who have jobs or who get jobs, because in order to create a fund of this kind, the workers must have a job and their wages must be taxed. MY deep concern ls now to work out a plan, and I think this might be done with a more comprehensive bill, to give relief to the millions who are out of work and who appear to have very little chance to get work I cannot understand why this so-called \"unemployment insurance proposition\" is thrust into this bill. L&or is against it and industry is against it, and I am advised that many of the lawyers on the Ways and Means Committee and other lawyers are inclined to think it is unconstitutional as it is now before us. Of course, if there is doubt as to its constitutionality, somebody will hold up this measure until it can be tested out in the Supreme Court, and this would cause further delay ln bringgg relief to the needy old people, to the needy and crippled children, and to the other groups we are attempting to provide for in this measure; and therefore, if given an opportunity, I shall vote to strike this provision from the bill and have it re-referred to the proper committee for further study and preparation, so that we may have a better bill before us. THxm- MWANDWO~ We are told that there are more than 50,000.000 workers in America. Twenty-seven percent of these are more than 45 and less than 65 years of age-ln other words. about 13.000.000 workers in America are over 45 and under 65. and nearly all of this great army of people are out of work and cannot get work. Under this bill they are not considered, because they are under 65 years of age and are unable to get a dollar of this old-age pension money however needy they may be. They cannot come under the unemployment- insurance provisions of this bill because they are unem\u00ad ployed We have pointed out that persons to get any bew\u00ad fits from this unemployment insurance must have a job because the fund out of which this insurance or annuity is paid is raised by a tax levy on his wages and another tax levy on his wages paid by his employer and he and hi8 employer must continue to pay taxes in for at least 5 years. SO you can readily see that these workers, out of work, and who cannot get work, are not beneflted by any of the pro- visions of this act; yet millions of them have been led to believe that because we speak of \" unemployment insurana a and they are unemployed, this measure would help them. What an awakening and what a bitter disappointment this bill will be to them. They are forgotten in this bill. bPL 1936 CONGRESSIONAL more tragic, they are the forgotten men and women of thi country. I know of no big coal mine ln this country that does no require a coal miner when he enters thelr employ to sign I statement that he is not over 45 years of age. This is true of nearly all of the great factories, mills, and shops, and thi is true, as I understand it. with the railroads. I have also observed that the United States Government, in prescrlbln~ its requirements to take civil-service examinations for Job: under the Federal Government, most of them fix the age -limit at 45 or less, and I know of no civil-service examin% tion that permits persons to qualify who are over 50 year: of age unless it is for professional or scientiilc work ThL same feeling exists in boards and commissions which emPlos those in so-called \" white-collar \" professions or occupations Nearly all, including our Uncle Sam, are discriminating against the men and women who are over 45. Ladies and gentlemen of this House, I ask you what ls tc become of this great army of 13,000,000 workers of thf United States who are more than 45 and less than 65i This bill gives them no hope of relief until they reach the age of 65, an ': mless this bill ls greatly amended, it offer! very little hope to many of them then. I have been putting this question to statesmen, lawyers doctors, teachers, farmers. merchants, welfare workers, ani industrialists for a long time. Most of them say, es my friend of whom I inquired on the floor of the House, they do not know. I inquired of my good friend, who Is on the Ways and Means Committee, what there was in this bill tc help this group, and he said, \" Nothing.\" He ventured, how- ever, to say we had passed the so-called \"works bill\" 01 $4,000,000,000. The most optlmlstic administration leaders do not expect the $4,000.000,000 works bi.U to give work ta more than 3.500.000 people. There still remains, according t.u some estimates, from eight to twelve million people unem\u00ad ployed. There are millions of young. vigorous men and women under 45 who are out of work, and I am quite sure they will get a large part of these so-called \"Federal works jobs.\" It ls claimed by the admlnlstratlon that this four bglion works' job money will be spent by July 1. 1936. If this in the only hope for these workers over 45. there is not much encouragement for them. What will become of them after July 1, 19361 Of course, I do not belleve that the admlnlstration will put 3,500.OOO unemployed people to work. I do believe, how- ever, they are going to give jobs to tens of thousands of Democrats. Can this great group of people be put back to work? Most men at the age of 45 have a wlfe and children. Their financial needs then, as a general rule, are as great or greater than at any other time in their lives. They have more to feed and clothe, provide educational opportunities for, and so forth. I consider this the most serious and pressing problem before the American people. CAN THE NATION FVENISR -JOBS, All of us who have made a study of this matter agree that a great transformation has taken place in our country in the last few years. Under the present set-up is there any way to put back to work any material number of these persons over 45 and under 651 I do not think there is. There are millions of young, stout, able-bodied m-en and women under 45 years of age who are out of work, and most employers will give preference in the future, 8s in the past. to these younger men and women, just the same 8s the Federal Government does when it employs workers in its various departments and activities. Why can we not put these peopIe back to work? Ma\u00ad chinery and efficiency have greatly increased production, yet consumption along many lines has decreased I cannot go into all of them, but, for example, it has not been many years ago that the average coal miner ln /imer\u00ad ica produced I!$ tons of coal per man per day. With mod- em machinery and equipment and efficiency, the average coal miner in America today is producing 5 tons of coal per man per day, and in many mines this has reached the RECORD-HOUSE high level of nearly 8 tons, yet last year America consumed over 100.000,000 tons of coal less than it did a few year8 ago in a single year. They now grind the coal and blow it into the furnace, and every little particle of coal gives up its energy. The use of oil and gas has been tac.re~& I doubt lf anyone would predict that for many years to come we are going to use ss much coal per year as we did 10 years ago. Is it little wonder we have tens of thousax& of coal miners out of work? Take the railroads. 1 can remember years ago a railroad train would come along with 25 or 30 coal cars ln a train. and most of them had 20 tons to the car, and it was con\u00ad sidered a very big cer if it can-led 30 tons. There were many exclamations about \"that long train.\" Now, in the coal regions of my district I sometimes see as many as 150 loaded cars in a single train and each car with 50 tons or more to the car, and it is not an uncommon thing to see tn%lns with 85 to 100 !oaded cars. The freight trains of these days are also going much faster-nearly twice as fast as the other train of years ago. Our present long, heavy train has one man less in the crew than the first train I mentioned. The trains now can and do carry from 6 to 10 times ss much coal, and are making nearly twice as much speed, with one less man to the crew. This unit of transportation is One of the units of production. One man ls doing as much as several men did 25 years ago. We find, also, automatfc switches and automatic couplers. We again are not suqxised that there are less than half the railroad men employed todao than there were some years ago. These railroad men are out of work. How are we going to put them back to work? In one of the great steel mills of my State I am advised by those who know about those things that a few years ago to do a certain unit of work required 121 men With lrn\u00ad proved machinery and equipment 3 men now do what I21 men did. I see great steam shovels making large excavations ln a city block or on highways, with hundreds of idle men stand\u00ad ing by watching the steamshovels. I am informed that some years back it required one or more men to operate one loom in the textile mills. Now one person operates all the way from 40 to 170 looms. The big question ln the textile strike last year was to do something about this stretch-out system. We have the stretch-out system in the automobile fac\u00ad tories, in the mills, shops, on the railroads, in the mines- yes, on the farm. When I was a lad on the farm we would put perhaps a thousand pounds of tobacco, corn, or wheat on a wagon and with a steady plodding old team it would require us about a day to go to town and dellver our load and return to our home. In the past year ln Kentucky observed some trucks with as much as 12,000 pounds of to\u00ad bacco on a single truck, and this truck was going along at the rate of 45 or 50 miles per hour. This farmer could get his load of tobacco to town, unload ft, and get back home almost before breakfast. This stretch-out system entering into every activity of our compIex American life has put millions of good Amer\u00ad icans on the streets and highways looking for work. Yes; we have traveled far in the matter of economy and efficiency Ln mass production, but what about consumption? As a general tie. well-to-do people and people aho can afford it do not eat as much today on the average as they tid 25 years ago. We do not wear any more shirts or dresses. It has been suggested that some wear quite a good leal less. In fact, one part of our population ls greatly :conomizlng ln the use of silks and satins, cotton, and wool in their garments. I realize that consumption could be greatly enlarged. Ihere are countless millions in this country that are cold %nd hungry. They need food., clothing, and shelter, and )ther necessities. Does this condition threaten the welfare rf our country and the perpetuity of our institutions? px CEXAT-CAN MXNACL Many of our people are deeply concerned over what they :lalm is a growing sentiment in our country in favor of :ommunism and sovietism. Others say it means nothing. I CONGRESSIONAL I have great faith in the patriotism and fine common sens of the average American. Communism and sovietism q)oulc mean very little in our country under normal conditions but a great army of unemployed people ln any country is I real menace. Nearly all of these unemployed people are good Americans Many of them fought gloriously on land and sea. in thl air and under the sea, in defense of this Nation: other have lived splendid, industrious. sober lives. They are nov caught between two great millstones. They are burdenec with conditions for which they are not responsible for the making. They do not want charity. They merely want ar opportunity to work and earn a support for themselves am their wives and children. They are only human. What musi be the effect and what is the effect on their minds to see1 work for weelrs-yes. for months and into the years-thal they might feed their hungry wives and children and providt shelter and clothing for them? What must be the sufferlnf they undergo when they see their loved ones lacking the barest necessities of life and with no opportunities for edu\u00ad cation and advancement and with the cost of llvlng mount\u00ad ing skyward lacking meats, fats, and other elements oi proper diet? They are bound to be discouraged. It is an indictment 01 our Christianity and our twentieth-century civilization foi their children to be brought up in these surroundings. The gloom, sorrow, and bitterness of the parents is bound to poi- son not only the minds and souls of the parents but of the children as we.ll. really have been amazed at the fortitude and the splen\u00ad did manner in which this great army of unemployed have deported themselves during these last 5 trying years. I know I have felt the sting of this depression. but not sa deeply as millions of others. Being brought up as the son of a hillside tenant farmer, I knew snmethlng of the prob. lems of the poor, the meek, and the lowly. I do not see how these Americans, with their wives and children suffering with cold and hunger, could be otherwise than discontented and bitter, and added to this has been the policy of the Gov\u00ad ernment of burning pigs, plowing up cotton, and destroying food. This great problem must have the hearty cooperation in its solution of industry. agriculture, and commerce, of those who have jobs, and every good American. Humanity de. mands it, and the self-preservation of all of us and of om country requires it. It must be solved and solved right. 11 cannot wait forever for solution. After all, this is 0Ur coun\u00ad try, and erery honest, industrious man and woman is enti. tled to an opportunity to make a decent living for hlmseh and his wife and children. He has a right to ask for thsi and we should strive to work out a plan whereby he may receive the answer. Mr. fcEzLEF,. What is the gentleman's remedy? Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. There are but two things. We must work out a Plan to create more work and provide more jobs, or divide the work and the jobs that now exist, Mr. NICHOLS. You Republicans ought to do it. You put them out of work Mr. ROBSION of Kentucky. silly statements. The gentleman more serious and illumlnatlng. and women now agree, not only of the world, that the present every other country of the world Cease making such futile, should suggest something Nearly all thoughtful men here but in every country plight of this country and was largely brought about by the World War. It was under your good Democrat, President Wibon. and other Democrats who urged the Amer\u00ad ican pecple to elect him President on the promise he had kept us out of war and led the people to believe that he would continue to keep us out of war. when at that same time war was being planned by your Democratic admink+ tratlon All the records show that there are more people unem\u00ad ployed in America today than at any time in the Hoover administration. Taxes have been increased: the national debt has been increased to nearly $35.000.000.900. As Sec-RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 15 retary Ickes declared the other day. there are from 20,000.~ to 30,OOO.OOO people who need relief ln this country. There were no such-debts and no such number on the relief rolls when hfr. Hoover was President. Your party was elected on the pledge to reduce taxes, reduce the unemployment, and restore prosperity to the country. Your party has violated rvery Pledge. Your party has had control now for over 2 JezrS. Unemployment is on the increase, relief rolls con\u00ad tinue to mount and climb, although during these 2 years Congress has placed in the hands of President Roosevelt more than $25,000.000.000. with unlimited and dictatorial pOWtZ. Therefore, it is UP to your party. You have the control, you have the majority. you have the money, you have every- thing-it is up to you rather than the Republican mlnorlty to put people back to work But YOU will never put people back to work in this coun\u00ad try so long as the Government sticks its finger into every- body's eye and its nose into everybody's business, so long as it issues its billions of tax-exempt securities. burns pigs, plows UP cotton, destroys wheat and corn, md taxes the poor people to pay other people not to produce. If it is fair and right to tax coal miners and railroad workers to plow up cotton in the South an6 pay others not to produce cotton and pay people not to produce wheat and corn and hogs in the West on the theory that we have too much cotton and too many hogs and too much wheat and corn. it would be zqually just to tax them to pay our idle miners not to dig zoal and our idle railroad boys not to run the trains. Your Democratic admlnlstration has put more people out >f work and put more people on the relief rolls and put more politicians and faithful Democrats on the backs of the 4merican taxpayers than any administration since the days If George Washington. The Washington papers the other iay pointed out the fact that on pay day frere. the 15th of 4pril. 1935, it was the biggest sum paid out to Government vorkers ever paid out in a single day in the h&tory of this m&-y. While people are being pushed out of work and nilllons of people are hungry and cold, faithful Democrats ue being saddled as never before on the backs of American axpayers. The cost of living is out of reach of the average uorker of this country-fatback 25 cents and 30 cents a lound, steak 50 cents a pound. If this administration will quit regimenting labor. industry, and commerce and will give the American peopie a chance. they will put people back to work and we will work out of this depression: but my Democratic friends will find out that you cannot waste and squander this country into prosperity. It has never been done and it never will be done. No Democratic administration ever put people back to work. History records that everp Democratic admlnlstra- Lion from the days of Martin Van Buren down to now put :hem out of work. There must be a restoration of confl\u00ad ience in this country. The policies of the Democratic Party nave destroyed confidence. I really believe that lf agrlcul\u00ad ;ure. commerce. and industry were given a real chance un\u00ad employment would be greatly lessened and we would soon E on our way to recovery. But coming back to the origl- Ial proposition-this country cannot go on with 12,000,~9 ;o 15.000.000 workers out of employment. They need relief- lot i year~from now, nor 5 years from now--they need help low.

Mr. Chairman, I do not ex\u00ad et to consume the 10 minutes' time which was given to ne. because I was informed there are at least 30 other Mem\u00ad ers who desire to speak on the social-security bill. I CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE Mr. Chairman. I desire to take advantage or this oppor\u00ad tunity to commend the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. ROB\u00ad SIONI, who preceded me. Speaking as a member of the Committee on Labor, I wish to state that last year we held public hearings on the 5-day g-hour bill. Xany witnesses appeared before the committee. and some of them were offlclals of large industries who pro- tested against the Cannery bii. I asked these gentlemen if they had an age limit in their industries. Many of them replied in the affirmative. I ask the Members of Congress What are we going to do for the men and women between the ages of 45 and 65 who cannot obtain employment? One of the Arst bills I introduced this session of Congress was to provide $100,000,000.000. This money was to be ex\u00ad pended over a period of 10 years and was to be used for the purpose of eradicating slum districts, elimination of danger\u00ad ous grade crossings, reforestation, drainage of swamps. flood control, soil erosion, the purification of rivers and streams, the construction of disposal plants. schools, and hospitals; for the development of surgical, medical, geological, biologl\u00ad cal. and other sciences and for every other purpose which will benefit mankind-in other word.% to end poverty in the United States. According to my bii $10.006.000.000 waj to be expended in the period of 1 year, which would provide emp!oyment for 10,000,000 people in the United States who are out of work. Mr. Chairman, the President of the United States is to be commended for recommending a bill to Congress which is to provide old-age pensions. unemployment insurance, and so forth. This bill in its present form will do but very little to help the aged and the unemployed favor an adequate old-age pension and adequate unem\u00ad ployment insurance. The bill which ls now pending before Congress does not meet the situation. I hope that we will be successful in amending this bill so that the aged, unem\u00ad ployed, and every person who is physically lncapac!tated will be provided for adequately. Mr. DOUQHTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. mxr.Awl. Mr. HARLAN. Mr. Chairman, I was very much interested ln the remarks made by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. ROB~IONI. who has been in Congress, I am told, for some- thing over 15 years. During a great deal of that tlme we were in just as great need as we are today of old-age pensions. old-age annuities, and unemployment compensation; but from that inspired source, or the party which he represents, nothing was produced. Now that an idea has been crystallzed into legislation we are told by the party represented by the gentleman, on the one hand, that the remedies are wholly inadequate and, on the other. they cry crocodile tears to the taxpayers that its cost is going to be terrible. It reminds me a great deal of the pclicy-ln fact, it is carrying out the policy of that party from 1920 to 1932-ln 1920. to the inter- nationalists, they favored an \" association of powers *'; to the nationalists they were against the League of Nations; to the high- and low-tariff advocates alike they sald that the Re- publican Party was the party of salvation. With the same speech their leader held together those ln favor of operating Muscle Shoals and those against; to the drys prohibition was \" noble \"; to the wets it was an \"experiment.\" They have ever been on both sides of all questions, and all things to all people. And so today they come before us again, telling the taxpayers that this is going to bring them dowri to ruin: tell\u00ad ing those in need of relief that the appropriations are wholly inadequate. To those who desire to help they hand out the old well-tried shell game; to those who cry for help they read the Constitution. This brings me, Mr. Chairman, to the proposition raised in the minority report of the committee. in which they boldly challenge the constitutionality of the bilL In view of the fact that the majority report says little or nothing on this subject, I wonder if it might not be worth while to discuss it for a minute. Mr. Chairman, the United States ls about the only country of any consequence in the world where the determination of the constitutionality of an act of the legislative body is not by the legislative body Itself. For this reason we escape some responsibility, but not all, because as soon as we enact a bill instantly it is vested with a presumption. to be overcome only by facts beyond a reasonable doubt, that it l.s constitutionaL We ourselves are acting under our oaths to support that Con\u00ad stitution. So we do owe an obligation to the people and to ourselves to examine into the constitutionality of this bilL The Supreme Court, in describing this obligation, says in the case of Knoz v. Lee (12 WalL 457) : A decent respsct for a coordinate branch of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment demands that the ;udlclary shall presume, until the contrary 1s clearly shown, that there has been no transgressIon of power by Congress. all Members of which act undur oath or obllgetlon to the COILStlhlUOn. The same Court. in El Paso & Northeasters Ry. Co. v. Gutimez (215 U. 5. 67). brings this long-established doc- trine down to date when it says: It is hardly necesary to repeat what thla Cad hsa often aRinned-that an act of Connre~ is not to be declatal l.nmUl except for reasons 80 clear an2 satisfactory a~ to leave no doubt as to it3 unconstltutlonaU~. Yet the mlnorlty report crlticlxes the brief of the Attorney General's office because of its \"weak and apologetic lan\u00ad guage \", wherein it argues for the constitutionality of thla bill, in part. as follows: There mav also be taken into mnslderatlon the stronn uresunm\u00ad tlcn exlsta &t of l&e Conmess. In the llaht of which and of the foreaolna dlscu&on it 1s reasonably &?e to assume that the soclal&x6lty bill, K enacted lnto law, will probably be upheld SJ constRutlonaL. The gentlemen say that is \"weak and apologetic.\" The only thing that is week and apologetic about that proposition, Mr. Chairman. is the fact that it is not expressed in terms anything like as forcibly as the Supreme Court has used many, many times. It is a proposition that we must con\u00ad sider here and we are entirely at liberty to consider. Wherein is the unconstitutionality of this bill? I am not going to enter into a protracted legal discussion at this time. But, briefly, there are two titles in question: One title+title H-provides for payment out of taxes and excise receipts old-age annuities; the other-title VIII-provides for these taxes and excise duties. The power to Pay annuities is cer\u00ad tainly not one of the Federal functions delegated by the Constitution. The same is true of the power to acquire new territory. to charter banks, to operate postal savings, to extend State aid in maternity cases, and to create Federal land-bank and farm-loan associations. Yet all of these functions have been sustained by the courts, either because the Power involved was one of proper implication. or because the person chal\u00ad lenging the right had suffered no damage. Protected by these principles, we operate our Fubllc Health Service, Bureau of Education, Geological Survey, Bureau of Mines. Smithsonian Institute, National Art Gallery, and many ldn\u00ad dred activities. The Supreme Court, ln upholding the constitutfonality of the act creating Federal land banks, says: We, therefore, conclude that the creation of these bar& and the grant of authority to them to act for the Government as depos\u00ad itories of public moneyb and purchase of Government bonds brings them within the crentlse wwer of Conxress. although they may be Intended, ln connection &th other prliileges and duties, -to fahu\u00ad tate the making of loans upon farm securities at low rates of intereet. If the pmchase of Government bonds is a proper b&s for an implied Federal power, then the present law creating this annuity fund is certainly on solid rock. BY 1970 it will have invested in United States bonds over .$32,000.000,000. We shall have to rebuild our tariff walls and create some more panics to owe that much by that time. That means s resto\u00ad ration of our Government to the reactionaries. which is be\u00ad yond the purview of sane prophecy today. Mr. Chairman, may I say that appearing on the brief ffled in the Federal T&d Bank case was the name of Charles Evans Hughes. The names of some of the greatest co&d\u00ad tutlonal lawyers of the country also appeared thereon. Mr. bow Chief Justice) Hughes' brief contained the following: I r----, CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE h-'RI.L 16 Congress may create In Its dkretlon SL) In thin 1nsta.r~~ it hm Government nor expressly restrfct& to the States, then ft created. moneyed lnstltutlons to serve as f3scaJ agents of the Gov\u00ad ernment, and nlso to provide a market, as stated in the act, for was the duty of the Federal Government to =ume control UnIted States bonds. I as being the only agency capable of protecting those rights_._ ~mtitution reserved to the people. ToI trust, however, that before final adoption of this bill, either by this House or in the Senate, title II will be amended so as to provide for the distributicn of the old-age-annuity fund through State agencies similar to those provided for in the distribution of unemployment relief. In this way we will remove from the bill the appearance of a grant by the Fed- era1 Government to a particular class. and will give the bill the additional strength of providing merely for grants to the States. The administrative dii3icult.y arising from people moving from one State to another is certainly no more in- superable in the execution of this chapter than in many of the other present activities of the Government. Is there anything unconstitutional in the taxing provl\u00ad sions of title VIII? It provides an income tax under the almost limitless powers conferred by the sixteenth amend\u00ad ment to the Constitution. It also levies an excise tax on employers for the privilege of hiring labor. This law is framed to operate uniformly throughout the United States, and comes directly under the provisions of section 8 of reserve n~~~th~&~ people generally and then furnish no Govern\u00ad ment to prote zt or enforce that right was to him unthinkable. In a speecl 1 at Harrisburg, he said: I cannot do bettu than base my theory of gov emmental action ~.$$$~b~a~~~ Is and deeds of one or rennsymuua's greatest sons, Wilson He developed. even before Marshall, the doctrine l l l that an inherent power rested In the Nation ;;&i;e,,of,\"e,ebEtid powers .coti~~ed rp21n it by the Con\u00ad ,1where InVolVed ordlnarlly beyond the waspowe; oi the KKL~~ states and was a power exercised mt,nnm , bv sovereign L,.,, Tie laid down the propositlon that l l l nnot act because the need to be met fs not whenever the States CBI one of a single locality, that the NatIonal Government, represent\u00ad ing au tbe pet)ple should have power to act. Our Supreme Court has never accepted this as a 1egaI principal. but in the practical operation of government, since 1912. we have gone a long way toward carrying It into e&ct. There is no Present indication of a retreat. In 1908. Gov. Charles Evans Hughes, in an address at New York City said: \" We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.\" With that view- point now presiding over the Supreme Court and with an executive genius leading the minds of our people b&s hb paths of political and economic health, we need have little fear of the constitutionality of the social security Act. [Applause.] The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Ohio has emh& Mr. DOUGH-ION. Mr. Chahman, I yield 10 m&tea to the gentleman from Montana [Mr. MOIPAGHMI. Mr. MONAGHAN. Mr. Chairman. I want to state at the outset, if there is anyone among you-any dear friend of the beloved Ways and Means Committee and Its outstanding chairman [Mr. Dorronrorr3. or of the President of the United States, Frank5 D. Roosevelt, I may say that my love for that beloved committee. Its chairman, and for the fearless and peerless President of the Unlfed States Is no less than his, but my love of my fellowman and my love of principle and justice exceed my love for both of them. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I assign myself the task of attacking the measure under consideration. I may state at the outset that I believe thls bill Is one article 1 of the Constitution. But it has been stated by the gentleman from Massachuselts [Mr. 'I~EADWAY~, that. since the granting of annuities is an unconstitutional Federal function and the tax provision is to provide funds for this purpose. therefore the tax is unconstitutionaL The Premise of this argument, the unconstitutionality of the appropria\u00ad tion, is rather unstable, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Smith V. &znsas City Tit&? & Trust co.

This House is not interested in listening to an exhaustive legal brief, nor in discussing questions of constitutionality, further than to protect our membership under their oaths, and for that reason I have carefully avoided tedious detail and have made no reference to numerous pertinent cases that are available. However, to summa&e these decisions. we may safely say that there is apparently no precedent under which the courts could declare title 2 unconstitutional. If this should occur, about half of o\\u present Federal activities will be discon\u00ad tinued. Is it within the bounds of reason, then, that title 8. the tax-raising title, otherwise on unimpeachable grounds, will be declared unconstitutional, because these tax funds go to a purpose alleged to be unconstitutional in fact al\u00ad though immune from attack What a futile act that would be! It would simply mean that Congress would be required to provide funds to carry out title 2 from our general coffers and later reenact title 8 as a separate bill with no physical connection with the Social Security Act. That mirrht have happened during the first decade of this centurybuthardlg now. Those were the days when the Supreme Court had this Congress supine and helpless so far as any effective regula\u00ad tion of business was concerned. Those were the days when Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Party smarting under restricted Federal lawmaking powers expressed ideals and dreamed dreams that could not come to fruition until a second Roosevelt came into power. Theodore Roosevelt believed that when from the nature of things States could not administer a necessary regulation (as they cannot do with unemployment relief). and this function was neither expressly excluded from the regulating power of the Federal of the greatest snares and delusions that could be perpe\u00ad trated upon the people of America. For as I analyze its provisions, ln all fairness and justice, I cannot see where the American public at the present moment will benefit one Iota by its provisions-not until 6 years hence, and then It is doubtful whether they will benefit at alL I have analyzed its language, and I harken back to the decision of that now deceased Supreme Court Justice whose memory is revered and will always be revered by the llberaI\u00ad minded and patriotic citizens of America, Justice Holmes, who in one of his famous decisions reprimanded insurance companies for permitting salesmen to go across the length and breadth of America, sell Policies to the People of the country, send out a policy which, on its face, had very glow\u00ad ing and roseate promises, and on the second and third Pages in small and fine print take away almost everything and give only a very limited amount of the proffered protection. This bill. in larae measure, fits that description of Justice Holmes.

There is with respect to the term \" qualifled\" Mr. SAMUEL B. BILL. Absolutely no connection at all; and the gentleman is misleading the House and the country by that statement. The gentleman ought to learn what is in the bffl before he comes here and proposes to eniighten the House and the country upon it. Mr. MONAGBAN. The gentleman is wrong if ne main\u00ad tains that the Supreme Court or anyone else will not read this biil in its entirety and interpret it according to the language found thereIn Mr. SAMUEL B. BILL I say that title I has no con\u00ad nection with what the gentleman is referring to in the last part of the bill-no connection whatever. Mr. MONAGHAN. I am talking about the old-age-pen\u00ad sion feature, and as I read the bill-- Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. It is not affected by the $10 or the $2,000 provision or iu any sense at all, by what the gentleman has referred to in the back part of the bi.lL There is no connection between them at all Mr. MONAGHAN. To avoid further argument, I will take the gentleman's word for it. However, under the provision of the bill whereby the amount of money is paid according to the salary, a person will not be qualified who does not have an accumulated salary of more than $2,000. Therefore, the average citizen will not qualify under this law or be entitled to a pension until 3 or 4 years hence. In addition to this. I may point out the fact that this bill fails because it is dependent for its success largely upon the States that have so miserably failed in the past to cope with this great problem of old-age pension and security. To its great credit, that outstanding member of that organization that has done such splendid work to promote this great cause, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, J-ester Ioble, of my State, was the author of the first old-age-pension law in America. The State of Montana, therefore, was the first State in the Union to pass an old-age-pension law. That old-age-pension law is one of the most liberal in the coun\u00ad try; and yet when I drove around the State of Montana last summer, I was met time after time by aged couples who came to me with tears in their eyes-people who had built up industry, who had pioneered this country, who hzd gone out and developed the great West and had the courage to do it-telling me that the county commissioners of their particular county had conferred upon them a draft for a mere $10 or $6 or $5 upon which they expected them to live, and if they could not find themselves able to live upon that mm. then they could return the $6. the $5. or the $10. and the commissioners would see to it that they were taken to the poorhousek RECORD-HOUSE 5701 1 SaY t.0 YOU. mp fdOW Citizens, that the poorhouse ia no place for a Proud American citizen who has given hia lifetime to the upbuilding of America, its industry and com\u00ad merce.

I voted for the rule mak\u00ad ng this bill in order because I felt, and still feel. that this s the time for adequate legislation for social security; and ve finally have the opportunity of acknowledging this re\u00ad uxmsibility and giving social security to the people of the :omtry. It will be a victory for those who have during '&e 7ears been asking and demanding this type of legislation. During the consideration of this bill we will have an mportunity to offer amendments to title I. which carries )ld-age pensions.

When these amend\u00ad nents are offered, I shall be pleased to support such amend\u00ad nents zx wiii increase the amounts paid our aged citizens in he form of old-age assistance. During the past few months a good deal of propaganda ias been disseminated throughout the country with refer\u00ad !nce to the so-called \"Townsend revolving old-age pension who advocated the Townsend plan have de\u00ad nanded that we as Members oi Congress support that plan vithout amendment.

I am glad to see, however, that re\u00ad :ently Mr. MCGROARIY. the Member who introduced the original Townsend plan in the House, has seen fit to submit t &l.if~ed Townsend plan. and, in my opinion, the modified plan does away with many of the objectionable features of he original plan. &P.

CApplause.1 I am for old-age pensions and I am willing to vote for a pension plan that would pay $56 a month. That does noi bother me.

I am wiihng tc reduce the age to 60 years, because I know that peopk OVCI 60 years of age cannot Ford jobs in industry; but I as OM Member of this House take this cccasion to say that I cannot vote for the Townsend plan so long as it contains its present taxing provisions. I cannot vote for a transaction tax be- cause it would \" run out of business \" every small industry in this country. Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, will the gen\u00ad tleman yield? Mr. BoII.sAIJ. I yield Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. 1 remind the gentleman that Dr. Townsend himself when he appeared before the Com\u00ad mittee on Ways and Means on the original bill stated that he intended and desired that Henry Ford and John D. Hocke\u00ad feller and Morgan and Mellon and men of that type should share under his plan. -Mr. BOILEAU. They sure will share, not only in the pension, but in the benefit they will derive by knocking every small industry out of busmesa-and why do I say 'that? 'ihis transaction tax would be levied against each and every transaction. and let me give you a few illustrations Take, for instance, the chain stores. They do not buy from the wholesaler. they buy direct from the manufac\u00ad turer, and thereby eliminate that one transaction, which is 2 percent. They buy direct from the manufacturer and distribute it to their own stores themselves. They thereby get the advantage of 2 percent over the independent merchant. Mr. MO'IT. Mr. chairman. will the gentIeman yield? Mr. BOILEAU. In a moment. Let us take the auto- mobile industry. Take the large manufacturer. He owns his own mine, he does not have to buy the ore, and he owns his own smelters. He transports the ore from his own mine to his own smelter and he avoids paying a tax on that transaction. He takes the steel into his factory. He owns his own timber and he avoids paying a tax on the timber because he owns the timber himself. He takes it to his own sawmills and brings all those materials into his factory without paying a single transaction tax. He does not have to buy these materials, because he operates on a large scale and manufactures his own raw materials. He pays the tax only on the ultimate seliing transaction. The independent, the small manufacturer, has to pay the tax on his steel. on his tin, on his wood, on his glass, and rubber, and tires, and all those things, so that he has to pay a pyramided sales tax that wili amount in many in- stances from 12 to 15 percent. The large manufacturer would have that much advantage over the small industry which assembles these products, and the result will be that the small man is put out of business. I yield to the gentle- man from Oregon. Mr. MOTT.

As far as the State of Wiconsin is concerned, we are largely a dairy State. I receivb;l a telegram this morning from one of the large weekly newspapers in my district.

I presume the author of the tekgnm mush have meant the Townsend plan aa it was originally written. because he got in touch with me some time ago and wanted my support of the original plan. He apparently does not know it has been greatly modified But in my humble judgment, I can go back to my people and explain to them the obnoxious provisions of the Town- send plan and I will rely upon their good judgment to at lest not vote against me on that issue.

The Daft concern. for titance, and other large process4 I-sand handkrs, cou7d operate cheese factories and process the cheese without paying that one transaction tax, which com\u00ad petition wili knock every Small cheese factory 0Ut of the State of Wisconsin. The same thing will happen to our creamcries. In Wisamsip and all over the dairy sections o2 the coun\u00ad try the Atlantic L Pacific Tea Co. have their own con\u00ad densories They would avoid that one transaction tax. If they had a 2-percent differential, they could knock out every condcnsory in my section. They would have such an advan\u00ad tage over the smali. independent milk plant that the irule\u00ad pendents and cooperatives would bi: forced out of busmesa. I submit to you that the provisions of the Townsend bU1 with this transaction tax would absolutely wipe out all smali, independent business It would tend toward further monopolies, mergers, and combines. It would be the death knell to the small business man of this country, and I for me cannot favor it. It would tend to create more and more zhain stares. The gentleman from Oregon [Mr. M-1 aaid they Were 3oing to offer an amendment to do away with it. How do they propose to raise the money? I woukI like the gentlo\u00ad nan to reply brlefiy. Mr. M07.T. The amendment that I suggested to the 3entleman, and which will be offered In case the rerrlsed !&Groarty bill is presented and held germane. would follow I CONGRESSIONAL section 2. after line 18. on page 6 of the printed bill, EL R. 7154. which is the section providing for the 2-perCent tranS\u00ad action tsur, and would read as follows: Proof&d, howeuer, That in the case of manufactured articles made by assembling together component parts thereof. such as automobUe6, machinery. furniture. etc., the t -on tax hereIn provided shall be levied upon each of such component parts wiiih\u00ad out regard as to whether the same were made by the -ufaC\u00ad turer assembling said parts into such completed manufactured article or whether the s.zme were purchased by aaid m=ufacturer from another; and In computing the transactIon tax to be levied upon the gross dollar value of the completed aYiemb1ed art'clethere shall be added :o such transaction tax a tax of 2 percent upon the gross dollar value of each component part thereof upon which a transaction tax has not been paid: And provided further. That In cases where the manufacturer of an artlde upon which a transaction tax ls payable ls also the producer or owner of the raw material from which sald article ls manufactured. then the transactlon tax of 2 percent upon the ISW material used in the manufacture of sald article shall be added to the transaction tax to be levied upon such manufactured article and ahall be paid by the manufacturer thereof. In my opinion such an amendment would cure the objec\u00ad tion the gentleman from Wisconsin was making when I interrupted him. Mr. BOILJZAU. I thank the gentlerran very much. That Is the multiple sales tax, nevertheless, is it not? Now, I just want to say fn conclusion that if we accept all these amendments--- Mr. MO'IT. Perhaps I have not completely answered the whole of the gentleman's last question. Mr. BOILEXU. I would like to conclude my remarks, as my time has nearly expired. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Wisconsin has again expired. Mr. TREXDWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman 1 additional minute. Mr. BOILEAU. The modification referred to by the gen\u00ad tleman from Oregon does not prevent the chain stores. mail- order houses, and the large operators in the daii tidustry, and so forth, from having such an advantage over the inde\u00ad pendent merchant and small handler of such products that will destroy such smaller industries. In conclusion, I wish to SW that if We are gOh3 to change the amOtW from $200 down to $50, if we are going to change the age limit from 65 to 60 years, if we are going to change the method of raising the money with which k~ PaY the Pension% if we are goti to eliminate this multiple sales tax and so completely change the proposal, who in the name of common sense has the nerve to say that it is the Townsend plan and can give any credit to that organization for the approval of the old-age- pension plan? IApplause. I want to take this opportunity to say that, in my opinion. the one organization that has done more to advance the fnterest of old-age pensions in this country than all others combined is the Fraternal Order of Eagles. an organization that has been consistently fighting for a program of old-age pensions for many years. [Applause.] [Here the gavel fell.1 Mr. DOUGHTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New York [Mr. DICKSTW~. Mr. DICKST'EIN. Mr. Chairman, I do not suppose I have to discuss the Townsend plan very much after the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. BOILEAIJI has left the floor. It was exactly my opiion that the Townsend plan, which will be offered as a substitute, should be voted down. . Since I have sat here and listened to the colloquy and the questions and answers by my colleagues, no one has discussed the other proposed plan which will be offered as a substitute, which is the Lundeen bill. I want to discuss the Lundeen bill briefly, and what I said over the air about this bill on March 20,1935, I will say again: That the Lundeen bill goes almost farther than one can imagine. It proposes to take all the money out of the Trea;i\u00ad nry; whatever is there is going to be taken out. It wiIl re- quire about $14,000.000,000 to distribute $10 a week to each unemployed person, with $3 for each dependent. As though this were not enough, in addition everybody is to be assessed on all income he has over $5.000. I could almost forgive him for that, but it goes still further: The workers then will take RECORD-HOUSE 5703 the money-not the Government, not the Congress, not the President, but the workers--an d distribute it in accordance with this plan. Now I see why all these Communista have been around my house for the last year, because I refused to subscribe to this particular plan. Mr. Chairman, Congress is making history; it is doing something for the aged; and you and I know that when old age creeps upon one it does not affect the rich only or the poor only; it affects everybody, and God knows what a g-red e-mg it would be if the American Congress would pass an honest-to-goodness old-age-security plan and a general social-welfare plan. We must be careful what we do, how- ever. There are some amendments that should be added to +J, e present bill, but it seems to me the pending plan, offered by the administration. by the chairman of this committee. is very constructive, very firm. and has at least some back- ground ot policy upon which as time goes on we can can\u00ad struct a proper unemployment-insurance plan. I say to you that all these so-called \" plans \" which spring up overnight ought to be discarded in one wastebasket. venture the assertion that if somebody should propose a plan for $300 a month we would get a tremendous number of letters favoring it. The people do not seem to realize that the money has got to come from somewhere; that we cannot go into the Public Treasury and take out $14,000,000,000 and distribute it amongst a certain group of people, some of whom do not want to work. Mr. GRANFDZD. Mr. Chairman. wfIl the gentleman field? Mr. DICKSTEIN. I yield. Mr. GRANFELD. I understand the Lundeen unemploy\u00ad ment plan would cost the Government $14.000.000.000 a year.- Mr. DICKSTEIN. Yes. Mr. GRANFIELD. And the original To wnsend plan would cost the Government $24,000,~00.000. Mr. DICKSTEIN. That ls approximately correct. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania Mr. chairman. will ti. genti- yield? Mr. DICKSTEIN. I yield. m. DUNN of Pennsylvania. Will the gentleman please state the source from whfch he gets the mm tht m Lundeen bill will cost 814,000,000,~~ a yearl Mr. DICFEXEEV. Because it starts at age 18 and con\u00ad siders every able-bodied worker above the age of 18, the f armer. the butcher, the grocer, the en-and boy, everybody is included b th&j plan; and the whole countJ.y would be working for the Government. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania One more statement, if the gentleman will permit. I think the gentleman is mistaken If the gentleman will read the report he will fmd that a uni\u00ad versity professor of New York City maintained it would not cost more than $6.000.000.000 at the outside. MI. DICKSTEIN. My opinion is just as good as the pro\u00adfessor,s opinion Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania The pen&an plan only calls a $10 per week with an additional $3 for dependents under forcertain age . Mr. DICKSTEIN. I have gone to the trouble of taking pencil and paper and figuring out how many aged people and how many young peopie there were, beginning at age 18. and I say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania that it will take more than $14,000.000,000. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania The gentleman is mistaken in his figures* however. Mr. MILLARD. Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield for a short question? Mr. DICKSTEIN. I yield. Mr. MILLARD. I understood the gentleman to say that the Commu.n.&t Party endorses the Lundeen bill. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. It is a humanitarian mea.+ ure. More power to the Communists for endorsing it. Mr. DICKSTEXV. It is a fact they have endorsed it. I do not say that the entleman from Minnesota [Mr. Lmo~xx~l introduced his b&1 for any ulterior purpose. He took his action in good faith, but I say to you that this proposed bill. in my opinion. is nothing but nn out-and-out commuptstie I CONGRESSIONAL program-that is the Lundeen bill, which seeks to distrib ute the wealth of the country in one form or another. I so to you that now I can understand why these Communist have paraded around my home and my city with big plac ards. demanding that we support and vote for the Lundeei bill, hecause it is going to put everybody over the age of 1 years on Uncle Sam's pay roll. hfr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman. I know th gentleman desires to be very fair; will he yield for a shor question? Mr. DICKSTEIN. I yfeld. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. What would the gentlemal say should be done to take care of the aged and the unem ployed today? How much money does the gentleman t.hinJ would be needed to take care of them? Mr. DICKSTEIN. I want the gentleman to know that will support any social legislation that is reasonable. I wil go as far as any man in this House. I believe that an olc man or an old woman who has done something for his o her country should be taken care of properly. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. I agree with the gentleman Mr. DICKSTEIN. I say, however, that if we are going tc have legislation let it be on a constructive basis. We dc not wznt any communistic platform or principles in thl American Government. [Applause.1 Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. Does the gentleman believe that the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. LDNDEENI had tha in mind when he proposed his bill? Mr. DICKSTEXN. I do not charge that to the gentlemar from Minnesota. They sold him a bill of goods when the! gave him that bill; and I am surprised, even though I have the highest respect for the Committee on Labor, that tha committee should have reported that kind of bill to the House. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. It is hecause we are very progressive, very intelligent, and very humane that we re. ported that bill out. Mr. DICKSTEIN. But the gentleman and his committ~ were too \" progressive \" when they voted out that bill. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. In connection with anything we do which is h umanitarian we are accused of being Com\u00ad munists, but I am glad to be a Communist if it is going tc provide adequate old-age pensions and adequate unemploy\u00ad ment insurance. Mr. DICKSTEIN. The gentleman does not have to be a Ccmmunist to support old-age pension and old-age securits legislation. I am with the gentleman and compliment him for his attitude. He does not have to be a Communist ta support such measures, but when he votes out a bill which provides that the workers will distribute the money and we have not.hing to do with it and the President has nothing to do with it--the workers going to the Tmasury and taking out $14,000,000,000-I say it is not practicaL Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania. The Labor Department h the Department which according to the Lundeen bill pro\u00ad vides the money. That is in the Lundeen bilL Mr. DICKSTEIN. I do not yield further. Mr. Chairman, I will support any social-security bill which will definitely and positively care for the aged and the un\u00ad employed Not since the days of Woodrow Wilson and that history- making Sixty-third Congress, when so much important legis\u00ad lation was put on our statute books, has there been a Con\u00ad gress which did as much for the people of the United States as the present one. When hundreds of years hence, history of the United States will come to be written in terms of achievement we wlll have to hearken back to the debate of this floor which has now been conducted for several days to find such constructive and solid achievement of government. Our legislation today is record breaking and the statutes we are enacting today will forever lift the specter of want and depression from the shoulders of the American people. We are providing in short for social security, the security of every man and woman who is gainfully employed to see to it that they are not caught again in the throes of unem\u00ad ployment, and security provided for old age so that when RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 15 men and women have passed their prime and are no longer in a position to be gainfully employed, the community should step in and save old age from want. Such in brief are the purposes of the bill, and such in brief are the ideals which this administration wishes to enact into law by way of stabi\u00ad lizing and assuring our people of a fair and honorable living. Now, as to the means. the bill before the House is par\u00ad ticularly commendable because of the fact that it places the burden of providing for social security on the several States rather than the Nation. It will encourage the States in making every liberal provision for old age and unemploy\u00ad ment insurance as its finances may allow, and at the same time gives the Federal Government the right to supervise the vestments of the funds to be used in connection with the several features of the new law. The Federal Govem\u00ad ment is also going to match all of the funds in old-ago insurance so that for every dollar a State may contribute in that connection the Federal Government is likewise going to contribute a dollar, with the proviso, however, that at no time shall the Federal Government be obligated to pay more than $15 per month for any one person. -It, therefore, establishes a sort of standard of old-age insurance at the rate of $30 a month, which, while it may not be sufficient to make an old man live in ailluence, nevertheless, it would deflnitely remove an old man or woman from the rolls of public charity. Personally, I should favor the law to be amended so as co provide for a min!num of $50 per month for the support of the aged. The advance of science resulted in large numbers of men nnd women living to a ripe old age so that the number of people who would be dependent on o&age insurance is likely to grow with the years rather than diminish. It is estimated that in years to come there will be 15,000,000 old people in the United States over the age of 65. although at the present time there are only 7.500,OOO men and women 1x3this country who are over 65 years of age. Out of the 7.500.000 of old men and women aonroximately 1.000.000 are now dependent on public suppo-6 the g&t majority Df them being on relief. In order to permit an individual to establish for himself old-age insurance, the Government ls going to sell directly to everyone in the United States an annuity which will mature at the age of 65 years and which will enable anyone who wishes to carry his own in\u00ad juTa= t0 do so at cost. The Government has not yet prepared any schedules to show in detail as to how this plan will work out, but undoubtedly this plan will become very popular, and there is no question but that large numbers If people will avail themselves of the opportunity of carry\u00ad ng their own insurance against the vicissitudes of old age. I'his will, of course, relieve the communities from the bur\u00ad len of caring for old men and women -and will supplement ;o a very large extent the Government's program for social iecurity. Old-age security is not the only feature of the bill. Un\u00ad employment is even more of a curse of modem society ;han is dependent old age. Some plan of unemployment nsurance had therefore to be devised if ours was to be a :ountry where the individual was to live happily and enjoy .he blessings of civilization. We must not permit a condi\u00ad ion of affairs to arise where large numbers of men and vomen should find themselves an object of public charity xcause of their inability to secure employment. In this :onnection many plans have been proposed and many plans vi11 be brought up on the floor of the House before the Anal rote is taken on the measure. There are plans which throw .he entire burden of unemployment insurance on the State, Ithers throw it upon the employer, and still other plans iivide the burden between the employer and the employee. R-ie bill as it stands seeks to impose this tax on the employer mly, but each State is free to assess the cost not only on he employer but likewise on the employee, and as it appears rom the report of the committee the State of Washington ias already created this liability on employer and employea dike. But no matter how unemployment insurance is to be han\u00ad lied, and irrespective of the method adopted. it sholuld be CONGRESSIONAL conducted on a sound actuarial basis free from any patema\u00ad listic form and free from any appeals to public prejudices. I was always in the front ranks of those who believe that the \" laborer is worthy of his hire \"; who believe that labor should be adequately paid for its efforts. I believe that wages should be adequate to enable the worker to enjoy his life and to reap the benefit of his toil for himself and his far.nilY. I believe that the worker should be adequately compensated, adequately housed, adequately clothed. and adequately taken care of, but I do not believe that anyone should be supported by the Government or should become the ward of our Gov\u00ad ernment. If pernicious legislation of the @pe of the Lundeen bill is allowed to prevail, it will create a drain upon the Trea=uY which will eventually destroy this Government. We cannot live on bounties and we cannot create money out of nothing. 'This country has achieved its standing in the world through the labor of its ITases. and OdY by labor can we expect to thrive and succeed. I have always been a sporsor of the interest of the masses and the interest of labor. While a member of the State legis\u00ad lature and a Member of the American Congress, I always sponsored legislation to help, aid, and assist labor, and was always endorsed for election by labor as a legislator. who has the interests of labor at heart, and whose work benefits the toiling masses of our people. I belong to the same class to which my constituents belong, the class which works with brain or brawn, and which earns brow. I am therefore heartily in favor port it in every way and feel that lies in the intelligent settlement age and unemployment, which tempts to solve. [Here the gavel fell.1 its living by the sweat of the of this legislation. will SUP- the interest of our country of the great problem of old this bill so inklligently at-RECORD-HOUSE The wrtion of the expense of the act which is to be borne by the State is to be met by the imposition of a head tax of $1 a year for the present year, and thereafter $1.75 per year. Payment of this head tax, it is interesting to note, shall be necessary for qualification as a voter, for reg\u00ad istration of an automobile, and makes a husband responsible for his wife's head tax. I regret that the good and the bad. as I see it. are so inseparabiy Joined in this meanire. I read the p:ov!siors of title II and VIII and III and IX and view with apprehension the result of the enactment of the provisions therein con\u00ad tained. I do not know, and I cannot !ind anybody who does know, what may be the collateral effects of the proposed unemployment insurance upon the conduct of industry, upon the mobility of labor, upon the regularity of employment. upon wage negotiations and the level of wages, upon costs of production, and upon the element of competition in industrp. I cannot And the answer in the hearings before the Com\u00ad mittee on Ways and Means on this bill to alleviate the hax\u00ad ards of old age, unemployment, and so forth. However, the experience of the countries that have ta-led out a similar scheme to that which this measure in those titles would es\u00ad tablish has been other than satisfactory or encouraging for us. if I can read and understand the English language. Tineir experience should give us pause. Everybody knows that the real price of unemployment to every community is measured by the lost productive capacity of the unemployed. The direct cost of unemployment con\u00ad sists of the cost of maintaining the unemployed, but it is none the less a charge against the individual taxpayer, whether it is met out of Federal or State funds; out of local contrd\u00ad butions or by private charity, or from any other source. It may be that the time has come when unemployment beneflts must be held to be a national charge, but the Com\u00ad mittee on Economic Security, in making its report to the President, frankly admitted that its recommendations with respect to unemployment compensation are l ' frankly experl\u00ad mental.\" The plan suggested by the committee, which ls before us in substance, is, according to their own admission, one that will secure the much-needed experience necessarp Mr. TREADWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. PLnbrrxYl. Mr. PLUMLEY. Mr. Chairman, I favor the enactment of titles I, IV, V, and VI of this act, covering as they do the pm\u00ad visions for old-age pensions, for maternal and child wel\u00ad fare, and for public health They seem to offer a hope of the solution of the problem of relief from that want and distress which eats out the very soul of many thousands. if not millions, Of our fellow countrymen annually. In some small measure the Provi\u00ad sions of this law should or ought to bring relief to and restore confidence in the body politic, without which there can be no recovery. Old age, which comes to everyone who does not die pre- maturely, is a misfortune if no income has been provided with which to alleviate the burdens of the later years of life. It has taken us a long time to realize that there is a need for some safeguard against such misfortune, which no man can wholly eliminate in this world of ours. While traditionally--and de&n&edly--oppo@,ed to the theorY of paternalism in government and perhaps open to the charge of inconsistency, I have come thoroughly to be\u00ad lieve that some such provisions as are contained in the titles to which I have above referred should be enacted into Law. I am constrained to admit that in the present emergency it is probably necessary that the Federal Government shall become cooperatively responsible for a contribution toward the payment of old-age pensions. I am still of the opinion that it is a matter that of right should be handled by the States as such, though some of the 28 States now having old-age-pension laws, in the present emergency, are not able to carry out the provisions of the law. My own State of Vermont, at the session of its legisla\u00ad ture which adjourned last Friday night, passed an old-age- assistance act by the terms of which assistance is to be given to qualified persons having attained the age of 65 years. It being provided that there be a maximum of $30 per month per single person, half of which is to be paid by the State and half by the Federal Government. A maximum of $45 a month is provided for man and wife living together. Lxxxx460 I for . the development of a more nearlY perfect system. They I anti&ate it will require numerous changes. nevertheless they urge haste and-experimentation Why the necessity for haste? I am opposed to haste and experimentation at the people's expense. I am in favor of talking more time for a more careful study of the situation, and the eventual sub\u00ad rmssion of a more satisfactory plan, which admittedly might later be submitted, if we were not in such a needless hurrY to act first only to be son-~ afterward. The only satisfactory cure for unemployment is work. and it is idle to expect that any system of unemployment insur\u00ad ante will operate well or smoothly or satisfacrorilY, While unemployment remains at such an abnormal level as it has reached in these United States today. Unemployment is an international as well as a national problem. It results from the industrial system under which we live, of which the workers are not the authors, but the victims. After having studied so serious a problem as this for but a year or two, in this era of experimentation, we are readp once more to experiment at a cost so terrific as to be stag\u00ad gering. if we can but comprehend what the result may be if the plan does not work. Other countries, after scores Of years of experimentation and study, have hesitated to do some of the very things it is suggested that we, followlng in- experienced, theoretical, impractical but enthusiastic econo\u00ad mists should blindly do. In my opinion these provisions do the very things which the President would wish to bare us avoid. nameb. they dis\u00ad regard the sound and necessary policy for Federal legisba\u00ad tion for permanent economic securit0 by attempting to apply it on too ambitious a scale before a more carefui and prolonged study of the actual experience of othme;u$tsT would provide proper guidance for such pernron dhctiOn of our efforts. Because the cost may be what it may be and the benefits which are offered for our allurement are so meager, even at 5706 CONGRESSIONAL best, I believe as trustees of those whose ldsrests we are sent here to serve. and as representatives of the people we ought to have something to say about legislation, and both comprehend and apprehend tha good or evil bound to result from the action we take. Titles II and VIII and III -and IX are loaded with dynamite, and I shall vote for the bill containing these features, if I do, with many misgivings. [Applause.3 Mr. DGUGHTON. Mr. Chairman. I yield 5 minutes tc the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. MCCLELLAN]. Mr. MCCLELLAN. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con- sent to revise and extend my remarks and to include therein a resolution adopted by the General Assembly of Arkansas. The CHAIRMAN. Is thete objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. McCLEZLAN. Mr. Chairman, the limited time allot\u00ad ted me does not affcrd an opportunity for a discussion of the various titles of the bill and the piovisions therein con\u00ad tained. Therefore I choose to address my remarks and invite your attetition to title I, \" Grants to States for old-age assistance.\" Before express!ng my views on this chapter of the bill. I cannot refrain from voicing what I intend as, and trust is, constructive criticism of the measure as a whole. In do;ng so, I do not impugn the mot!ves or sincerity of purpose of our beloved President, and the leader of my party, nor of the Ways and Means Committee, who, after extensive hearings, reported the bill in its present form. In thls bill we are attempting to legislate on at least six different subjects, either one of which is of such magnitude and impcrtanre as to merit and command independent thought, consideration, and action. In my humble judgment the wiser course and policy would be to bring in separate bills for each title and subject treated in this measure. This is an omnibus bill and contains many good features and seeks a worthy objective, but there are also many objec\u00ad tionable provisions that should be eliminated. And notwith\u00ad standing several amendments may be adopted, in the final analysis, we shall be compelled to take the bad in order to preserve the gmd. or defeat it. I regret exceedingly our President and the Ways and Means Committee have deemed it wise to have these various subjects ccnsidered in an omni\u00ad bus bill of this fashion. I am hoping I can support it on final passage, but I shall do so reluctantly and only because I am convinced it is the best that can be done at this sessiorl of Congress, and with the hope that it lays the foundation on which we can later build a structure of social and eco\u00ad nomic security worthy of democracy, and which is so sorely needed in this time of our greatest social And economic distress. I am greatly interested in the pmvis!ons of title I. It is gratifying that the national responsibility and obligation to provide assistance to those oi our citizens who, by reason of the infirmities of old age, can no longer earn a living, is being recognized and given legislative sanction. But the indirect way in which it is proposed this recognition shall be given warrants severe criticism. By the terms of this bill we make the obligation of the Federal Government di\u00ad rect to the several States, and in the nature of Federal aid to the States. Whereas the obligation of the Government is direct to every American citizen who comes within the class to be benefltcd. irrespective of State citizenship. This bill attempts to discharge the national responsibility in an in- direct way and this policy is wrong aud will result in unjust and hz-mful discrimination against citizens of the poorer States and favor those of the wealthier States. This means that some American citizens, 65 years of age and older, will receive $15 per month out of the Federal Treasury, this by reason of their State citizenship. Whereas other American citizens of the same class and circumstances will be denied this aid because the States in which they happen to reside are unable to raise revenues to match Fed\u00ad eral funds. This principle is wrong, inequitable, and is un\u00ad fair and should be eliminated from this bill. RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 15 We may concede, without admitting, for the purpose of this discussion, that there is equal responsibility on the State governments and the Federal Government to provide thb relief. If this is true, and the State is unable to meet its obligation in this respect, this does not justify the Federal Government In refusing to discharge its share of the obliga\u00ad tion to the individual citizen. Whether an old-age pension is treated as a gratuity, given solely in the ns'iure of relief and charity, or as compensation merited by reason of loyal citizenship over a period of years, the principle involved is the same. If the Federal Govern\u00ad ment is going to make a gift to a class of its citizens, it should not give to some and withhold from others. Such gift should not be contingent upon the flnanclal circum\u00ad stances an9 ability of the State in which the citizen lives to match dollars for the same purpose with the Federal Government. If any State cannot carry its share of the burden this is all the more reason why the Government should discharge its share of the obligation rather than withhold it. State boundary lines should not be regarded If it is a gift, the grant should be made, insofar as the Fed\u00ad eral Government is concerned. to every citizen alike who qualifies as to age and llnancial circumstances. If it is con\u00ad sidered a debt the Government owes, compensation, pay\u00ad ment, or reward for services rendered, the same principle should apple. My State is unable to meet the responsibility this law im\u00ad poses, and I am persuaded there are other States that will be unable to raise sufficient revenues to match Federal funds, and thus the citizens of these States are going to be denied equal consideration by the Federal Government in this very worthy and commendable undertaking. We must remember in this program we are deahng, not with property rights, but with human beings-with life itself, seeking to make it more secure. The purpose of this legisk\u00ad tion is, or should be at least, to enable a class of our citizens to have and enjoy as they face the setting sun such comforts of life as humble necessities afford. These benefits should not be offered and made possible to some and withheld and denied others If our Government ls going to make a gift or payment for the beneflt of her citizens of a certain age who have no means of support. or pay to them 6 merited compensation, it should be eq:dtably distributed to this clnss regardless of their local residence. We must acknowledge that the Government has ascertained its ability and the propriety of paying $15 per month to this class of her citi\u00ad zens; therefore, justice demands that this blessing be spread upon the table for all and denied to none within this deslg- Ilated class. The amount of the appropriation, $49,750,009, carried in this measure is inadequate. There are 7,500,OOO persons in the United States 65 years of age and over. In my State there are 75,000 of this age. On this basis Arkansas would receive approximately $1 out of each hundred of this ap\u00ad oronriation. or 5500,OOC. Of the 75,000 citi\u00ad zens A&am& -65 years of .age. and over, at 1-t one- third, or 25,000-and this is very conservative--can and will qualify for these benefits. A very simple mathematical c& culation shows that this $500,000 would only provide $20 per :'ear, or $1.67 per month for each citizen in Arkausas entitled to this aid. Assuming this sum is matched by the State, the State and Federal funds will only provide $3.33 per month per person. This is wholly inadequate to provide any measure of substantinl relief. It would be ample, pos\u00ad sibly, to provide for a man and his wife the fund8 to buy a bottle of liniment for him and a box oi headache tablets for her each month. If this be charity, my friends, it is small indeed. If it is compensation, is is too meager to mention. If this bill is enacted in its present form it will prove a great disappointment to those whom it is des!gned to aid and assist. It will discriminate agatit citizens of the poorer States and favor those of the more wealthy. To that. extent it is undemocratic, and we should amend this bil.l+nd I trust it will be-so that the national responslblllty, here recognized, to this claw of our citizens shall be discharged CONGRESSIONAL equitably and without discrlmtnation against any American citizen regardless of h!s State c!tizensh!p. I sincerely hope we w!ll rise to the occasion and amend th!s law so that its beneflts. although hmited, w!ll be denied to none whose age and circumstances qualify them for this assistance. fApplause.1 Mr. Chairman. the following is a copy of House Concur- rent Memorial No. 8 of the General Assembly of the State of AI-: Eons.5 Concurrvnt Memorial 8 To the Ro?wm Me senate and House o/ Representarfvu of the United States of Ammica in Congrwa assembled: We, your memorlalbts. the General Assemb!y of the State Of Arkansas, respecf?~Uy represent that- Whereas the C:mgress of the United Stated of America has now under conslderatlon before the House Ways and Means Committee House Resolution 4120. by Mr. Donc~nxv, of North Carolma. which resolutlon provides for the payment of Federal penslons to needy and destitute cltlzens who have reached the age of 65 years: and Whereas the provlsiona of this resolution require that %hs vs.rlous States of the Union shall make an equal contrlbutlon ti such penslon fund before they. as such Sta*ux, shall be entltled to the beueflts of such old-age pensions: and Whereas the State of Arkansan. with other States of thls Union. are at this time ln such f%nancial distress that they are wholly una' 'e to r&e any sppreclable fun& for d great ad P==mg need, thereby depriving our cltlzens in sharing the beneflta be- stowed upon those of other and more favored States, possessed of much greater financial wealth and resources: NOW, therefore, be It Resolwd by the House of Representatives of the State of Arkan- SLS (the senate jointly concurfag therein), That tbls assembly petltion and memorlallze the Congress of the Unlted States Of America. now ln session at Washington.

Mr. DINGELL Mr. Chairman, may I request at the out- set that I be not fnterrupted during my remarks. I will be glad to answer any questions when I get through with my main discourse. Let me state, nlr. Chairman. that insofar as the advocacy of old-age pensions and unemployment in\u00ad surance !s concerned. I yield to no man in this House as to a keener desire to serve the needy of this country. As far back as 1922 I have taken an active. energetic interest in the program sponsored by the Fraternal Order of Eagles and I have been of some help to that great organ!sat!on. Mr. Chairman. 1 WWt to PC'int Out at this tfme that the present administration under the leadership of President Roosevelt has undertaken to take care of the needy people of this country and he is part!cularly interested in the agedl\\ and !nflrm and u-nderp~vibed- He ~~r~~ in Pro- Vidfw a methai 8uaranteef.w the futm-e of those who tOday are able to purchase for themselves annuities which w!U be ample to Prov!dc for their declining days after they attained the age of 65. Mr. Chairman. this bib has been under consideration by the Ways and Means Committee for over 10 weeks We have had every conceivable kind of advice !n connection w!th its possible operation and rmult and the fair-minded Mem\u00ad her of the House dU concede that the Ways and Means Committee is as generoirs toward the wishes of the mem\u00ad bertip and towards the needs and wishes of our people as is any other committee or any other Member of the House. The Way.i: tuld Means Committee has taken into considera\u00ad tion the possibilities of this far-reaching measure and the ability of this Government at this tragic time to extend itself beyond reasonable limits This administration has under- taken a broad. general program. adding this meawire for social security, such a bill as has never been contemplated before; yet, in spite of that, we are faced today with a clamor for eX&me radic& legislation that ha.9 no bas!s for &iim !nthisHouseatth!stime. The members of thh commiti concede that while we would like from the very outset to create a bill that !s per- fed. it is humanly fmpossible to do so. We have examined andanaLpzed,~yracticeandtheexpaienceofforeign RECORD-HOUSE countries with respect to s!m!bu legislation. We have ex\u00ad am!ned the kws and the practice and whatever experience the respective States may have had with sim!!ar legislation, and with all th!s the committee has whole-hearted& gone into the building up of a bill that will meet the test of t!me. It !s manifestly clear that under the Do-ton bill (H. FL 7260). with the volume of taxes and moneys coming to the Government for ultimate distribution to the needy of this country, billions will hare to be collected and disbursed, and we must proceed in a caut!ous. careful manner. Let us aname. for example, whether or not the pension provision. or title I, of this bill !s generous or not. at least as a first step in the proper direction. The. average mon+m relief cost in my State, which is Michigan, amounts to $3022 for the average family with dependents, and the average relief cost !n the United States of America !s $2583. Under the terms of this bill, if a State meets the $15 contribution of the Federal Government, an aged couple without dependents will receive me amomt of $61) monm from the St,& and Federal Governments. Roughly speak!ng. th!s is twice es much as families with dependents are receiving !n my State today, and better than twice and a hah the MllOllllt Of the average over the United States of America If th!s !s not a generous, a good start, then we cannot appeal to the fairnes! Of the MembershiP of this HORSE MY predecessor on the floor stated that the bill is n!g\u00ad gardly and that it provides for only $50,000.000 on the part of the Federal Government. but he failed to take into con\u00ad sideration the fact that this amount !s only for the first year. He failed to take into account the fact that the aver- age State w!U have to enact laws to meet the minimum re\u00ad quirements of this bill, and this w!ll take anywhere from 1 to 2 years, and !n some instances. unless the Governor calls a special session of the leg!sIature. it wiIl take even longer, and therefore the entire 48 States w!Il not be draw\u00ad !ng upon the Federal Government for their pro rata allow- ante. However, the bill provides that for the second year and thereafter as much as !s necessary to meet the demands of the respective States will Govenunent.

This sum is three and a th!rd times the amount of money now be!ng expended for old-age pensions in the 48 states. Mr. DINGELL. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. MARCANTONIO. Mr. Cha!rman, will the gentleman yield for a question in that corm&ion? Mr. DINGELL I y!eld Mr. MARCANTONIO. Will the gentleman explain why the committee felt !t was necessary to have a means test under title I? Does the gentleman th!nk that !s necessary? Mr. VINSON of Kentucky. If the gentleman win permit, there !s no Federal test. It !s left wide open to the legis\u00ad latures of the State to determine who !s without subshtence and who needs pensions in order to have a suittile sub\u00ad &ten~e. Mr. MARC~NIO. So it is the op!n!on of the com\u00ad m!ttee that this leg!sk&on by no means imposes on the States the necessity of rrqu!r!ng a means test? Mr. VINSGN of Kentucky. The legislature w!Il set forth certain requ!remen& but there !s no means test so far as the Congress !s concerned. It is left open to the States to deter- mine who should have the beneflt of the measure. Mr. DINGHLL. That !s correct. Mr. KICNNEY. Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield? Mr. DINGEIL I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. 6708 CONGRESSIONAL Mr. KENNEY. The gentleman stated that the pension systems of foreign countries were considered by the Ways and Means Commfttee. Mr. DING- Yes. Mr. KENNEY. Did the committee consider the system in vogue in the countries of Norway and Sweden? Mr. DINGELL. I could not say as to the Norwegian and Swedish systems, but the experience of European govem\u00ad merits. as a whole, has been rather unsatisfactory and did not give 'be committee any encouragement. In the final analysis, as a whole, the pension schemes and plans in the European countries have fallen down. Mr. KENNEY. The gentleman does not mean to say that the Norwegian plan has fallen down? Mr. DING- I am speaking of European systems as a whole. I am not singling out the Norwegian system at all, I may say to the gentleman that so far as the work of the committee in connection with this legislation is concerned, we are taking into consideration and covering more territory and undertaking to take care of more people in a more gen\u00ad erous way than any other similar plan that was ever ad\u00ad vanced, at less cost to the citizens of this country than in any similar instance in the world. Mr. KINNEY. I realize +&at, but I do not think the com\u00ad mittee has gone the whole way as it could and as it should Mr, DING-. It is entirely possible that the committee, in its humanly deficient may. would probably fall short in examining everything in the most detailed manner. Mr. RrZNDOLPH. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DINGELL. I yield. Mr. RANDOLPH. I agree with the gentleman from Mich\u00ad igan, who is a member of the committee, and compliment the committee on its splendid work, and I only wish to call the attention of the gentleman to the fact that the Denmark system of old-age pensions has worked successfully. IvP. DINGEL&. Has it met every test thus far? Mr. VINSON of Kentucky. If the gentleman will permit, may I say in this connection, referring to the Denmark sys\u00ad tem, which the gentleman from West Virginia says has worked so satisfactorily. that it is on a noncontributory basis, and that for men the maximum monthly pension is $9 to $15.17; for women from $8.42 to $14.33; for married couples, both over the age of 65. from $13.42 to $22.50. This is the maximum monthly pension, with exchange at par, and I may say to the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. RANDOLPHI that my friend from Michigan is correct in saying that the plan submitted to the House, which we are now considering, for old-age pensions, if enacted, will afford the greatest benefits of any country in the world. Mr. RANWLPH. Will the gentleman yield further? Mr. DING- I yield. Mr. RANDOLPH. The reason that I spoke about the Denmark plan was because Ruth Bryan Owen, our Minister there, is familiar with it, and she has said that the plan is working welL Mr. KINNEY. I wish to compliment the Ways and Means Committee on the job they have done in this bill, but I would like to ask the gentleman from Kentucky whether we cannot have a more liberal old-age pension than any other country anywhere in the world? Mr. DING- Mr. Chairman, I refuse to yield further. Mr. Chairman, I want to call the attention of Members to the fact that this clamoring for liberalizing the payments is something that you can take care of in your own respec\u00ad tive States. If you want to pay $50 per month you can do so, but it seems to me that the Federal Government is liberal enough when it starts the thing along with $15. The indi\u00ad vidual State can pay $35 additional if it chooses. My personal opinion is that if the Federal Government agreed to meet the individual States in any amount that the State legislatures might determine to pay its worthy aged citizens it would be in perfect order, because there will be a natural ceiling that the legislature will fix. when the demand becomes unreasonable the taxpayer will see to that. The taxpayer and pensioner must both be considered. 'Ihrefore, even if the limitation imposed by the Federal RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 Government were entirely eliminated, a natural ceiling Wm be found in every State and will be established by the State legislature. governed by the sentiment of the people, par\u00ad ticularly by those who are called upon to pay the tax. My time does not permit further discussion of the provi\u00ad sions of this bill. The people are interested. however, in the various titles of the bill. The case of crippled children, de- pendent children, widows eligible for pensions, public-health services, and the unsolved question of unemployment insur\u00ad ance which is a recognized curse. We must master this problem regardless of the method employed, and we must do so at the earliest possible date. The specter of unem\u00ad ployment stalks the peace and contentment of our citizens and a solution is mandatory. However deficient the bill might be. Mr. Chairman, and I allow it is not perfect, it is nevertheless a good start. Future sessions of Congress can in the light of experience correct and liberalize the law. [Applause.1 Mr. TREADWAY. Mr. Chairman. I yield 10 mhmtes to the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Cs~wroxel. Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, in the consideration of tl. is bill the first auestion which comes to me is. \" Why has the United States been the last major country to.give serious thought to the consideration of a comprehensive and ade\u00ad quate social-security program?\" One must remember that we have gone along under a monetary and industrial system which has not only permitted, but one might say it has encouraged, great \" washing outs \" of savings, accumulated surplus, and both private and corporate CaPital StrUCtUreS. These \"wash-outs '* have occurred each and every time a great economic depression has taken hold of our economic structure, and they have come without the consent, without contributory negligence on the part of our people, and against their thrifty habits. The great maSS of our people have been the victims of these great forces over which they had no direct control. I believe that all who think must agree that when the \" social security \" of a people passes away, they immediately begin to lose faith in the monetary and political structure under which they find themselves at the time. As we have clearly witnessed the last few years, and as we now witness, the people so afflicted revolt against the contemporary monetary, political, and admhi&ratiVe program. Actual and estimated Federal expenditures for the 3 years 1934, 1935. and 1936 will, no doubt, approach $24,000,000,000. A very large proportion of this is, of course, for direct and indirect relief. In other words, it will have been spent for momentary 1' social security \"-relief in the form of fats, fabric, and fiber-for a vast number of our people who are direct victms of the most recent \"wash-out.\" Based upon the figures presented on page 15 of the report, we find the estimated Federal income from taxes here proposed will, within the next 15 years, amount to $15,000.000,000 tmdk title VIII. sections 801 and 804. and under title IX about five and seven-tenths billions, or a total of $21,033.700,006- lust three billions less than our total appropriations e&i- mated for 1934, 1935. and 1936. Under a plan such as that set forth in this bill there will be some system and pegging down and control and balance 3f the raising of the funds, the making of the appropriations. and the administration of the expenditures that must neces\u00ad sarily follow. This daily thought of having to provide the [unds for the purpose of creating reserves through appro\u00ad priations, to meet such expenditures hereafter, will be a constant reminder of the suffering that comes through bhese \"wash-outs.\" It will, in my opinion, have a great tendency to cause us to figure the cost 85 we go along and thereby bring about a \"national spirit \", operating BJ 8 great force against those other forces which have occmred XJ often and which have been n their destruction through long applied to and against I?lese \" wash-outs \" that have Increasing havoc wili surely motion forces that will prevent dwelling on the payment of so ruthless in their attack and the \"wash-out\" methods too the great mass of our people. come so consistently and with came again unless we set in them. Cur constant thought the taxes here proposed. ths CONGRESSIONAL plans whereby the necessary appropriations will be made, and the administration of the funds flowing from those ap\u00ad propriations will, without question, have a wholesome influ\u00ad ence on all of our people and thus help us to comprehend more fully the necessity of maintaining \" social security \" for the masses. With regret I must acknowledge this bill does not, at the moment, give aid to those who are now in such dire need. This need must be cared for otherwise. It is also evident several years must come and go before the reserve funds, provided out of taxes to be paid, can show their strength in giving relief. As it is necessary to produce before there can be great distribution of wealth to the masses and thereby raising the level of individual possessions, just so Is it neces\u00ad sary to give time in which to accumu1ate reserves out of which distributions may be made. We must not overlook the fact, however. that many of the benefits called for by this bill--such as those to dependent children and for the maternal and child-health services and service for crippled children and child welfare--can begin to operate without delay and on the completion and approval of the plans re\u00ad quired to be set into operation by the respective States. The great tragedy which has come to those in our rural commu\u00ad nities particularlg and in areas specifically affected by the great economic distress of the past 4 years, calls for prompt action and cannot await the creation of reserves through the accumulation of 8 slowly working tax-collecting system. It is now mandatory on the part of Government to give this service without further delay or else we shall have to pay for it tenfold in the year-:; to come. The great social harm now taking place throczh the destruction of the physical forces of those people who are the victhns and who have not suftlcient nourishment And mental and spiritual food that flows to them when life Is full and complete. must be arrested. This bill recognixes the institution of national relief as a permanent one. It recOgnizeS the UnemplOyment problem 8s one that will never pass away and old-age benefits as no longer fn the main attainable by the individual One might make the observation that this is a u sorry day \" in the life of a nation when opportmity for individual effort and accumulation and preservation of the labors of One's life work is no longer to be had However, I for one am of the opinion that our method of mass prod;lction. specialira\u00ad tion. &SsifkatfOn. and faillJlX? t0 reUlgni%? sound methods of distributing as between worker and capital, the buying power of that which ls produced, has brought us to this period in our MiiiOMl life. Cdaidy that class which we call our *' agricultural workers \" has not had its Share of Whilt W&S produced. & proof Of this .vtat.ent I OdJ refer to the great agonies which the several Congg since 1920 have passed through in their attempt to provide some sort of national legislation as would more equitably deal with the farm population. May I also refer to the U Garden of Gethsemane '8, through which this Congress shall have to PUSS in further dealing with this verp problem Just so long as these great ineqUaJitfe.5 exist. just so long will there be a growing need for legislation of the nature here pro- posed, and so much greater will be the need. I wish to express the hope that in our saner hours and when the pressure of distress is less exacting of our time and energy, we mar set about providing means of production, distribu\u00ad tion, and exchange which will make a great amount of the Federal relief here proposed entirely unnecessary. This by reason of the fact that the individual may be in position to again return to self-preservation and reliance and depend\u00ad ence in old age 3s well as in early and middle life-At one time this great country boasted of the existence of that very position Wherein and how did we lose it? To me that ques\u00ad tion is very fundamental. ShaIl we now admit there is no longer such a chance for our people? Have those organic opportunities gone forever? Have we 'slipped m in our political. monetary. and legislative performance ? Is it now too late to make CorreCtiOn of our bad national habits? Shall we now admit that America no longer tiers the oppor-RECORD-HOUSE tunities of the past to the present and those coming gen\u00ad erations? Every Member of this House knows very well our people expect this Congress to enact adequate and fair social legis- JatiOn. especially insofar as the old people who are now with- out income are concerned. Perso&.ly. I do not believe we shouJd stop with providing only for \"old-age benefits.\" I feel we should take a step toward providing for this unem- Ployment problem. I believe Our economic and industrial COnditiOn.5 are such as to make it practical and wise to pro- vide adequate old-age benefits. I think our social, indus\u00ad trial, political, and spiritual situation is such as to demand that we, in this session of Congress, shall do this very thing. Insofar as legislation can make it possible, I am of the opln\u00ad ion we dare not evade this responsibility any longer. Speaking politically, it is my firm belief it will be a sorry day for the present administration and for the one that follows-let it be Democratic or Republican-if this matter of \" old-age relief \" is not provided for. There are now too many men in this country between the ages of 55 and 65 who have, through no fault of their own, had taken from them all income and all accumulated sur\u00ad plus of the frugality of prior years. You know the facts as well as I. These people I refer to are not visiting Wash\u00ad ington. They are not sending telegrams nor writing their Representatives what to do. They are quietly thinking, de- bating, praying, and considering in private homes, on the streets of our villages, at our church meetings and in con\u00ad ference with pastor, priest, and physician, these great eco\u00ad nomic disasters which visit our people too often, leaving them without income, without jobs, homes without a market value and all bringing about the 1~ of their savings aa represented by homes, s&ks and bonds, deposits in bank checking and savings accounts, and a situation wherein their children of 25 to 35 years of age cannot secure a job. These men, now dependent, have been expert workmen in factory; have served long arduous hours in the flelds.M any of them are skilled in the arts and sciences of com\u00ad merce, transportation, banking, and the professions. All their lives they have been good, honest, thrifty citizens making up the backbone of our Nation Now, they will not be content to be discarded and thrown into the scrap heap ~jke an old tin can out of which the food has been taken. They deserve and expect decent t-r-&at. Ag&- the& &\u00ad mand will be exercised in the form of the ballot as it was in 1922. There is a rising tide of tintent gathering mo\u00ad mentum throughout this Nation It is growing more bitter every day. The signal flares are breaking out from the most unexpected sources. Our people have been believing, pa\u00ad tiently waiting. and expecting the \" light '*, but hope is wan-i&r now because of so many promises that have been un\u00ad fulfilled so long. This Congress dare not scrap social se\u00ad cuity. It is my opinion our people back home will not take any excuse we may have to offer them next summer and fall when we face them. Why should they? This should not be a partisan question While engaged in indus\u00ad try and before giving time to matters political, I saw the need of JegiSJatJoU along this line. Today I See a greater need for such legislatiou and I am in favor of passing ft this session of congress. hlr. Chairman, H. R. 7260 ls filled with good and bad. I think it will be a tragedy if this bill is not in some way made more acceptable and beneficial to our people in whose name it is bemz passed. In its present form it is my opinion it will bring great disappointment to our people. I am afraid it will impose great hardships on many. I see in it great discrimina\u00ad t~on. Title II, creating the old-age reserve account through appropriations derived from taxes to be paid under title VHI. will prove to be one of the most far-reaching portions of the bill, both from the Standpoint of taxes assessed and the effects the reserve-fund operations will have. This reserve fund will, in my opinion. play a most significant part in our entire financial and monetary structure, not only that of the Red\u00ad eral Government but of private industry in its --produe\u00ad tlon form I think our baking practices will be vitally CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 influenced by the operation of this fund. Table IV, page 6, put that in the reserve account to be compounded and com\u00ad of the report, indicates this reserve will grow to a minimum o! say six and three-fourths billions of dollars within the first 10 years. Within 15 years this fund will probably be around $15,000,000,000. or, say, equivalent to about 70 percent of our national debt at that time. Here I am referring only to the old-age reserve account, and we have yet to deal with the unemployment trust fund. Now, there is no question but what these open-market operations of the Secretary of the Treasury in the invest\u00ad ment of these two funds will play a great part in the banking and monetary policies of this Nation We are here setting into motion great forces. I might illustrate further by say\u00ad ing that at the present time our banks and large corporations have invested about $16,000,000,660 in Government secu\u00ad rities. or, say, roughly 60 percent of our present outstand\u00ad ing Government bonded indebtedness, including direct and contingent obligations. It has heretofore been the custom for banks and large corporate institutions to largely carry in their portfolios bonds issued by the Government. Of course, in this manner the private individuals, who had money de- posited in banks and who held equities in corporate entities through ownership of debentures, bonds, stocks, and insur\u00ad ance reserves, collectively held or rather owned these Govem\u00ad ment obligations. In that manner the holdings of the indi\u00ad viduals on a collective basis were very materially woven into our financial operations and investment structure. In this bill it is proposed that these bonds be taken from the portfolios of the banks, insurance companies, and large industrial concerns and be concentrated as reserve funds, still belonging, in a way, directly and indirectly, to the mil- lions of our people. Will not this call for a reconstruction of the investment portfolios of first. the banks in a most material manner; secondly. those of large corporations having their idle funds invested in liquid bonds of the Government, and thirdly, the insurance companies? If the banks, deprived of their privilege to engage in the instant purchase and sale of Government bonds (by reason of a greater proportion of the outstanding bonds being absorbed through the investment of the reserve funds), must enter the general bond market it appears to me there will develop great competition as be- tween banks, insurance companies, and large corporations (all seeking a somewhat liquid investment for their inactive deposits, premium reserves, and idle surplus1 for the high class or triple A bonds of industrials and other units of government. It is also interesting to study the forces that are likely to develop as between the open-market operation of banks, large corporations, and insurance companies on the one hand versus the operations of the Secretary of the Reas\u00ad ury dealing in the purchase and sale of Federal obligations and the open-market operations of the Federal Reserve Hoard and System along the lines set forth in the proposed Steagall bank bill. Briefly, any plan which calls for re- moving from the open market the obligations of the Fed\u00ad eral Government is so far reaching as to command our keen\u00ad est thoughts in an attempted analysis of its consequences. Mr. SAMUEL B. HHL. Mr. Chairman., does the pentle\u00ad man yield? Mr. CRAWFORD. Yes. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL. Does the gentleman object to the policy of gradually withdrawing these Government bonds from private holdings and placing them in thk reserve so that to that extent the tax exempts will be withdrawn from these private holdings? Mr. CRAWFORD. I am not equipped to say that I object to that withdrawal. The thing I point out is the staggering influence the operation of this re&ve fund will have-upon our interior monetary and financial structure as it has been developed in this Nation. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL But it Ls a gradual operation, the gentleman understands. Mr. CRAWFORD. Yes. Mr. SAMUEL B. HILL It did not happen over night. Mr. CRAWF'ORD. Understand that. pounded for the increment of the rese.xve aocount,. Mr. CRAWFORD. I understand that; but the infiuence and effect is there just the -same. We have built a bank structure today where every so-called \" liquid bank \" in the United States has placed the deposits which the gentleman and I and the other people have in those banks in Govem\u00ad ment bonds, and now we propose a situation which pulls those out of the investment structure of the Nation ati concentrates them in the hands of the Secretary of the !rreasllry. If I read title II correctly, there will have to be maintained an individual \" case history \" with each and every employee who contributes and who may be a recipient of the beneflts of the old-age-benefit payments that are to be accumu\u00ad lated and distributed. Thus we can visualize millions and tens of millions of \"cases\" and a bureau personneled for the carrying out of the details involved. Title VIII. provid\u00ad ing for the taxing of employees on full salary up to $3.000. while those drawing more than this amount are taxed on $3,000, only will appear to many as discrimination and un\u00ad fair. It may be agreed the class which receives under $3,000 are more likely to need aid to tide over than those in a higher income class. except in times of great economic dis\u00ad aster-then I would assume they are about equal in actual need. The employer deposits 3 percent on same class and amount of wages as the employee pays his 3 percent on. The worker may, theoretically, receive, back 3% percent of the total taxed wages, or the wages on which tax was paid, or it may be paid to his estate if he is deceased. It appears possible for one to receive benefits who never paid a tax. Who knows what the Supreme Court may say about this? Titles IV, V, and VI are all so much needed today that no voice of protest should be raised against any of them. The grants to States for dependent children is to be commended. Many years ago some of our fraternal orders recognized this great need and have gone out and given relief, without any preference to race, creed, or color. This problem has now grown so large it is one which comman ds the most serious attention of the Federal Government. In rural areas and in those areas suffering from severe economic distress, the women are today without hospitahza\u00ad tion. Throughcut the farming areas particularly those hard-working and constructive fine mothers are in such great need of that provision set forth in title V for maternal and child-health service. I only hope that if the amount herein provided proves i.nsuZcient Congress in the fut.*ure will take the necessary steps to meet this problem squarely as it should be met. We have now too long delayed this very necessary assistance. Services for crippled and underprivileged children justtfles itself without any comment. How this matter has been so long overlooked and uncared for is a question which should make us glad of the opportunity to take the necessary steps at this time. One only needs to come in contact with a home which is unable to provide any means of relief for a little child who has been stricken with paralysis to appreci\u00ad ate what this will mean to those homes so darkened with the suffering that follows such a catastrophe. The ravages against our people as a direct consequence of the most recent great \"wash-out *' of their savings, income, and employment has brought squarely before us the great need for a national health service. Throughout the land we have millions of underfed, malnutritioned children grow\u00ad ing up without that medical care so very necessary in child- hood and youth if we are to have strong bodies when we mature into manhood and womanhood. The tragedy is before us. This is one way to meet the issue at this moment. This service should be made avaiIable by the States and the Federal Government quickly. We have, as a matter of fact, too long delayed this provision. Section 602 (19 gives great power into the hands of the Surgeon General. I only hope that in the preparation of rules and regulations and the administration thereof, Mr. VINSON of Georgia. And the effect of it is to take great care will be taken that none of the agencies of medical the interest now paid upon the governmental securities and rekf and certain professions which are of great bene-flt and 1935 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 5711 entirely acceptable to our people will be discriminate against. In the light of all the available information, it might b well to ask. Are we not now in normal times? What proof is there we shall soon return to the high pro ductivity of the 1923-29 period? Under world condition as we know them today, what is normal? If we will give ul our philosophy and practice of \" the economy of scarcity perhaps this question will answer itself. I do believe that in some cases small operators will reducl the number of people in their employ to the end they ma: come under the 'I 10 or more \" employees on the pay roll That will be a natural evasion, or rather avoidance, of the tax herein imposed. Regardless uf whatever tax law may bc designed, we And both evasions and avoidance of the tax To this extent, unemployment will be increased. I thinl we all must admit this. Furthermore, where a small opera, tor doing a similar business alongside another, and who i: employing only 9 helpers while his competitor has a staf of, say, 11 or 12 helpers, will have somewhat of an advan tage insofar as the incidence of the tax in section 901 i: concerned. If the tax is to be a graduated one insofar a: the number of employees are concerned, a situation of thi: kind cannot be helped. Any tax law that may be designee will have inequalities therein. The situation in this respect is not, however, nearly s( serious to me as that wherein the tax becomes assessec against an operation which runs, say, 80-percmnt direct labor cost versus one which runs only 20-percent direct labor cost believe it can be generally stated that a product carryin: direct costs of 80-percent labor and 20-percent material gen\u00ad erally sells on a much lower margin of proflt mark-up thar one which consists of 20-percent direct labor and 80-percenl material. If this observation be irue. it appears the flrd processor will be paying a 3-p,mcent (more cr less, dependim upon the terms of the State law) pay-roll tax on 80 percenl of his cost with a much lower margin of profit than doe: the operator who pays a 3-perce.nt tax on only 20 percent oi his cost with a h&her margin of proflt to work on (Rough steel or iron castings might be used to illustrate the former, and machine tools or precision tools the latter.) There is one phase of this proposed legislation which I cannot refrain from commenting on, and it is that wherein the farmer is exempt from paying an excise tax on his labor pay roll. He now has no way to controX either his production or the price at which it sells. His costs are almost entirely that of labor. To tax him on this bill would add to his already impossible burden. For 15 years he has valiantly fought against the combination of forces workin! against him. His overhead burden is too great for him tc carry and by the thousands he stands before his home watching the auctioneer and' the sheriff \" close him out *' and in this manner the great \"washing-out process \", which started years ago, continues on its rampage. IApplause.1 Mr. DGUGHTON. Mr. Chairman I yield 7 minutes tc the gentleman from New York C&?r. Prxr&xl. Mr. PFEIPER. Mr. Chairman snd members of the Com\u00ad mittee, the President, seeing 'be growth of discouragement and unemployment among the people, the dole having proved a failure, suggested legislation on social security which was read by the Clerk of this House at the beginning of this Sf?SSiOlL The object of this legislation was to provide ways and means for the welfare of the unemployed, old age. direct relief of the indigent sick, hospitalization, crippled children maternity, and so forth. Let us turn back to the year 1918. when the Unlted States entered the World War. Do you not recall the active part the hospitals played in relieving the burden of the Govem\u00ad ment and Government hospitals? It wes then a case of the Government appealing to the hospitals, now it is a case of the hospitals appealing to the Government. In view of this, I would like to appeal to all Member of the House in reference to this legislation insofar as it con\u00ad cerns hospitals and the part which they are now being forced to play in this period of national reconstruction due to the depression. Permit me at this time, too, to call your attention to title IV of the bill referring to the social-lnnu\u00ad ance board. The primary factor in working out a plan which would beneflt hospitals throughout the country would be the se\u00ad curing of facts as to the financial status of the majority of hospitals which serve their resnective communities. The leading medical societies of the country and the American Medical Association. embracing in its membership some 109.000 of the physicians of the United States, have as their primary considerations the welfare of the people, the preservation of their health and their care in SiClcnes, the advancement of medical science. the improvement of medi\u00ad cal care, and the provision of adequate medical service to all the neonle. These ~hmicians are the only body in the United States qualified by experience and training to guide and suitably control plans for the provision of medical care. I deplore and protest those sections of the bill which place in the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor the responsibility for the administration of funds for these pur\u00ad poses. I also conde*mn as pernicious that section of the bill which creates a soci.~:-insurance board without specification of the character c:' its personnel to administer functions essentially medical m character and demanding technical knowledge not av.:Zable to those without medical training. The doctors. therefore. should not only have a voice in the making of such a plan but also a voice in carrying out the said plan. This subject is worthy of your intelligent and sympathetio consideration as it affects so many of our people today. Due to the decrease in emnlovment and the increased num\u00ad ber of these on relief, who, when sick, seek free services in r~ur hosnitals. in manv instances treatment being not only rf emergency type-but sometimes of many weeks' dura\u00ad tion. 'All of which adds greatly to the burden which the charitable hospitals scattered throughout these United States are now being forced to bear without any aid what- soever from the Federal Government. Hospitals found their pay patients disappearing and their :harity patients increasing at a rate that threatens flnan\u00ad :ial destruction. This Government has appropriated and spent billions of dollars for home and work relief for the unemployed, but t as yet has not taken into consideration the sick men, vomen, and children who are in need of hospital care. The Government forgets all about them, and these unfortunates nust look to private charity for mercy. The charitable hospitals. in good times, find it impossible .o balance their budgets- even after resorting to drastic economic measures. and never at the expense of the comfort and welfare of the-patient. None of our institutions which depend upon public generosity .for their maintenance are leelim! the denression so much as the charitable hospitals. The majority bf hospitals which have been ever ready to render aid and comfort to the indigent sick will be forced, lue to lack of financial aid, to either curtail their services rr close their doors if the Government does not step for- ward and provide some means in this bill to take care of his serious situation. A majority of the people of this country believe that the :haritable institutions are money-making plants and eam\u00ad ?stly believe that the doctors working therein receive enor\u00ad nous salaries; but the truth is, as this great body knows, :hat these hospitals are charitable institutions and the doc\u00ad ,ors working therein receive no salaries and the help less ban those on relief. Most of us fail to realize that thess iospitals have to pay the same rate for gas, electricity, tele\u00ad ihone. and so forth as any other commercial or manufac\u00ad uring business who can charge the cost to overhead: but not :o with the hospital. Why. of course, they pay the butcher, he baker, the coal man, and every other man, plus the harsh rdustfce which is being done them by the collection of the mxxss tax under the A A. A. legislation, which has been stimated. imposes an additional burden upon the hospitals ff millions of dollars per year. I do not think it ~85 the dent of the legislature to do this: nevertheless, it h so nterpreted by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Thus, to my I 5712 CONGRESSIONAL way of thinking, they are taking advantage of taxing these charitable hospitals which are taking care of the needy sick in order that they may take care of the unemployed or needy well. These charitable institutions have their backs up against the wal!. Endowment funds disappearing. contributions few in number and amounts, private patients rapidly dwindling. free patients increasing in number both in the hospitals and out-patient departments, causixx deficits which in one hos\u00ad pital in my State amounted to $215,000 in 1933. This situa\u00ad tion which exists in my State exists in many others as well. Mr. Chairman, Permit me to read to this House clippings from newspapers in reference to u situation: [From the W88hln@.nn Times.

It 1s said that between 300 and 500 commutitles are wlthout hos\u00ad pitals. The suggested $10.000.000 bulldlng fund would add at least 20.000 beds to the total in the Nation's hospitals.

I want to read just a paragraph from a letter which I received from a friend of mine, Mr. R. D.

The cotton-textile situation and the plight of the cotton mills, both in the North and South, is most tragic. I do not need to tell the Members from the South. They realize the seriousness of the situation just as I do. It is not necessary to tell the cotton-growing farmers and the workers who pick the raw cotton what it means to those 9.000.000 people who gain their livelihood from raw cotton. It is not necessary, Mr. Chairman. to draw to the attention of this House the fact that Soviet Russia intends to export l,OOO,OOO bales more of cotton than ever before. The Soviet Government is paying her people a bounty, not to decrease production, but to increase it. She is allowing her farmers to sell their cotton at a lower cost abroad. YOU know what that will do to our cotton market in foreign countries. you how what it will do to your cotton farmers in the South, if the market for raw cotton !n this country is killed. I speak not from my heart alone. It ls not a question of the heart, but it is a question of the mind of intelligence. I know you will help me in every respect to keep our market at home and to protect your cotton growers Of the South and your textile mills of the South, just as we want to pro\u00ad tect our northern mills. It is not a party matter. It is not a sectional question. It is a Nation-Wide question.

The social-security bill, which is before us. provides for the general welfare of our people by establishing 8 system of Federal old-age benefits, and by enabling the several States to make more adequate provision for aged persons, dependent and crippled children. maternal and child wel\u00ad fare, public health, and the administration of their unem\u00ad ployment-compensation laws, to establish 8 social-security board, and for other purposea I am inclined to the-belief expressed by the minoriiy of the Committee on Ways and Means that this bill does not go far enough in making prov&.ion for those classes of our people affected by the legislation. I favor a system of old-age assistance which will furnish a more nciequate security, and one that will encourage all the States of our Union to adopt an old-age pension system. Under the terms of the bffl now under consideration the Federal Government makes 8 monthly contribution of only $15 to those persons who meet certain legal requirements and who have reached the age of 65 years. The Federal contribution of $15 8 month is positively insufficient. It provides a grudging and niggardly security against the trials and tribulations of old age. A Federal contribution of $15, matched with 8 State contribution of $15, f8ils ~abso1utely to provide 8 proper subsistence. It is hardly nece%ary for me to go into the daily items of expense necessary to main\u00ad taln a proper standard of living on the part of any individ\u00ad ual, whether old or young. When one considers the items of food. of clothing, and of rent, and of fuel, it is impossible for the aged in our country to subsist in a decent manner on $30 a month. I hold the opinion that it is the duty and responsibility of our Government to provide not only a bare subsistence for this class of our people but that it is an obligation of our Government to furnish them with those little coinforts which will make life worth living. I am persuaded to the conviction. after studying this problem for many years, that the contribution on the part of the Fed\u00ad eral Government should be $30 8 month, and that this con\u00ad tribution should be matched by each State which accepts the provisions of this bill, so that the old people of our coun\u00ad try over 60 years of age, instead of 65 years of age. will be the recipients of $60 per month. On this sum, and only on this sum, can the aged in our country live with the peace and contentment that we hope to give them by the enact\u00ad ment of this legislation. Massachusetts, always 8 leader in civilization's progress in America, has been foremost among the States of our Union in legislation for the social and economic advance\u00ad ment bf our people. Under the present pension system in my Commonwealth, the average monthly pension paid Is $24.35. This assistance at present is so bound up with red tape, and legal restrictions that mar!7 times the purpose of the law is defeated. I can never be unmindful of the generosity of the people who for years resided in the most humble section of my dis\u00ad trict, known as \" the ward \" in Sprlnpfield, Mass., who early in my public career honored me with the right to represent them in the general court of Massachusetts. They, like many others, were the real builders of this Nation. They RECORD-HOUSE were the men and women who morning to go into the factories late at night, 8fter 8 hard day's ple, with millions of others in APRIL 16 left their homes early in the and shops, returning home work. Although these peo- America, worked hard and steadily for many years, they are today, through no fault of their own, dependent upon public charity. They are entitled to a better reward for honest and faithful toil. I realized then, as I do now, the necessity of legislation of the char\u00ad acter of that which we are considering today. I am no new convert to the movement of social security. As 8 member of the State legislature in 1917. with other of my Democratic colleagues, I urged and voted for the enact\u00ad ment of 8 system of old-age pension. Very few votes were cast for this legislation at that time. When the time-worn arguments were advanced against such a legislative innova\u00ad tion, some of us who sponsored this old-8ge-pension system for Massachusetts were characterized as Socialists. We were told that to provide such a system of security meant the dis\u00ad appearance of the virtues of thrift and independence, and that our Commonwealth would be taldng 8 step backward instead of forward. However. the contest for social and economic advancement continued, and finally, several years ago, Massachusetts adopted 8 system of old-age security. We know now, after years of suffering and hardship re\u00ad sulting from unemployment, that the time to have provided security for the aged was years ago. I do not intend, with the knowledge and experience that I h8ve gained over the past 20 years, to subscribe to legislation that fails to meet adequately and properly the responsibility of the Govem\u00ad ment toward its aged. I cannot forego the opportunity of paying my respects to the various plans which have been submitted to the Con\u00ad gress for consideration. Panaceas of every description have been urged upon the Membership of this House by many well-meaning cltixens throughout the country. In my dis\u00ad trict, as in many districts, advocates of the Townsend plan have attempted to force that system of old-age security upon the Government. We have been ridiculed because of our attitude honestly expressed. as to the feasibility of the Townsend plan. Several months ago, through the medium of the news- papers in Springfield, Mass.. I bespoke, very plainly, my atti\u00ad tude on the original Townsend plan. Prom that day until this moment certain leaders in the movement have attempted to cajole and force me into 8n advocacy of this plan. Ap\u00ad parently some of them do not know me. I h8Ve been Criti\u00ad cized and misrepresented before and I have seen leaders come and go. I have always been a firm believer that unless the article for sale is the best, it cannot be sold to Americ8Ix3 in America. Threats of defeat on election day do not scare me. I have been threatened many times by leaders of grOUp.9 interested in their own selfish advancement, but I have al\u00ad ways done my duty as I saw it. Abuse does not alter my course. I have been abused many times for doing my duty, and I can assure certain agitators of the Townsend Plan that I will still do my duty to my country and my district as see it. The original Townsend plan has already departed to the realm where repose many other wild schemes of recovery. If the original Townsend plan was feasible and practical, it would have had no greater advocate in the Congress than myself. The original plan was abandoned by its promoters because of its unsoundness. It was not offered to the people of this country as a plan of old-age assistance. It was of\u00ad fered as a panacea for the depression. I have read the hearinas which were held before the Committee on W8Ys and Means. and I have read the testimony of Dr. Townsend. I am satisfied, thoroughly so, that he failed absolutely to make out a case for his original plan. His plan of pay. $200 8 month to those that qualified, over 60 years of age, would have caused our Government to spend annually 8 sum SF+ proxlmating $20,000,000,000. It would have raised the cost of living so that very few of our people could eat. let alone pay the taxes to support the plan. His original plan if adopted would have forced our great Government into bank\u00ad ruptcy. He contended that this sum of $20.000.000.000 could I 1935 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 5715 be raised by 8 transaction tax. It was his theory that b.Y' reported that that Committee, having had under considera\u00ad taxing our people the Government could raise the money r. and that the forced spending of it would revive industry t 0 such an extent that the people of our Nation would enfo P the greatest prosperity that they had ever known If hi S theory could have been put into practice, the Way out of th e depression would have been as simple 8s the recitation of the a-b-&. His philosophy of more taxes and more spend ing. he contended, was the way out of the depression. Hi was a new economic philosophy, one that had few advocate? but apparently had many followers. If economic recover: could be attained by having six or seven million people spent $200 8 month. why not have 20.O60.000 people spend the same amount in order to accelerate recovery; it simply could no be done. It is regretted that any group, any place in ou: enlightened America, would attempt to delude and misleac the aged of this Nation. Our old people are not interested i- $200 per month. Their only interest in this life is a safe and comfortable convoy during those years, which 8re fea in number, before they pass to the Great Beyond. Dr. Townsend. in the abandonment of his original plan . vindicates my statement to the press of SpringEeld. Mass several months 8go that it was \"fantastic \" and \" absurd.' : He has sponsored 8 second plan, and now 8 third plan . which provides monthly payments ranging from nothing tc) $200. based upon a a-percent transaction t.8x which hf ? hopes will provide sufbcient revenue to pay those over 60 years of age a monthly pension. This plan has his 8pprOVd t and is known as the u revised Townsend plan.\" I understand I it will be considered by the Congress when efforts will be! made to substitute the McGroarty biil when this legislation is read under the 5-minute rule. I understand further that certain Townsend agitators in my district 8nd elsewhere continue in their attempts to fool our elderly people into the belief that Dr. Townsend still advocates 8 $200 a month pen\u00ad sion for those over 60 years of age. This attitude of fooling the aged is indeed cruel and unpardonable. Under this revised Townsend plan a maximum monthly payment to citizens over 60 years of age will be $50. and it is generally agreed now that a a-percent transaction tax, at its best, could only provide $4.000.000.000 in revenue. I 8m one Member of the Congress who is interested in the welfare of our elderly citizens. and I am hopeful that this Congress will make adequate provision for them, giving them the customary comforts of life so that the remammg years of their existence on this e8rth will be years of contentment. The other provisions of this bill. relating to child welfare, public health, and unemployment insurance 8re worthy con\u00ad siderations. While the provisions with reference to unemployment in\u00ad surance fail to meet adequately my ideas they 8re a step in the right direction, and 8s we move into the years that are ahead, I am conEdent that by amendment and reform. the provisions relating to this subject will provide more substan\u00ad tial relief for our people. have endeavored to clearly state my position on that part of the bill which relates to old-age security. I trust that amendments will be offered when the bill is considered under the 5-minute rule, so that the amount of the Pedcral contribution will be increased from $15 a month to $30 a month, with the proviso that it shall be the duty of each State to provide for its citizens over 60 years of age, an ad\u00ad ditional $30 8 month. This total of $60 a month. I believe, can be financed by Ihe Federal and State Governments, and then ample provision will be made for the aged in our country. I do believe, however, that all the purposes of thisbillare praiseworthy. and that our National Government. by this legislation, will provide social relief for millions of our deserving citizens. Mr. DOUGHTON. Mr. chairman. I move that the Com- Initt.H! do now arise. The motion was agreed to.

Mr. T'RBADWAY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object-8nd I do not intend to object1 would like a thorough understanding on the point of reading the bill by titles. I understand that this in no way will interfere with the offering of amendments under any title, that each title :is to be read separately, and while under consideration :amendments gernmne can be offered on any section in the :individual title. Am I correct in this 8ssImlptioIl? The SPENCER. The gentleman is entirely correct. Mr. BOILEAU. Mr. Speaker. reserving the right to ob\u00ad ject, I appreciate the fact that this will not prevent Mem\u00ad ibers from offering amendments, but, of course, with this Imodi.Ecation-it would permit the distinguished Chairman I3f the Ways and Means Committee to move to close debate Ion any title and unless there is a very liber8l allowance Imade for Members to offer amendments and have time to Iexplain them the House could cut off Members from the (~pportunityofoifering amendmentstoeachofthesectio3s 4tithebilL Mr. TREADWAY.

Personally I have no particular interest in 7vhether it is done or not, but I do think that every reser- 7ration of protection to the Members is being m8de under the program as mappedout. It simply means that the gentleman and dthers dmfrulv situated to him will have their amendments re8dy when; itle is read. We recognize the fairness of the &airman he committee and his associates. No one is going 'to 1oSe my rights by this unanimous-consent request MY. COOPER of Tennessee. I think the gentleman from iVisconsin will agree that the only e.fIect that this will have : s to probably limit pro forma amendments to some eXhS. Mr. BOILBAU. I would not have any objection if all pro 'orma amendments were eliminated. As I rezd this bill, here are 70 sections, and there will be opportunity for 10 ninutes debate on each of those amendments Members k-ill have an opportunity in that way to express their view3 is we go along. Mr. DOUGHTON. I may say that there is no disposition bt all to interfere with the presentation of amendments or o prevent any Member from offering 8memimentS. Mr. BOILEXU. If the gentlem8n will give his assurance hat Members who have bon8 Ede amendments to offer wilI iave an opportunity to offer them. I have no disposition to Ibject.

Mr. DOUGHTON. He wili have the s8me time and Op- F&unity that he would have h8d under the rule as it b I CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE now drawn There mlght be so many amendments offerec here that if 5 minutes were allowed to each Member 1 would keep us here until doomsday. Mr. BOILEAU. There are some sections of the bill whlcl are not considered very controversial. Some Members ma! have a desire to offer amendments to those particular sec. tions and they would not have the opportunity under thl: request because the rules provide you cannot close debatc until debate has begun. For this reason, there would be a1 opportunity for a B-minute speech on every section. Mr. DOUGBTON. We could not bind ourselves under this rule any more than under the original rule, but then is no disposition or intention to take advantage of anybody Mr. BOILEAU. With the gentleman's assurance tbal every Member will have a reasonable opportunity to offer amendments to the various sections, and particularly those that are controversial, I will not object. Mr. DOUGBTON. The gentleman will have the same assurance as if the original rule were adopted. Mr. MKXIENER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right ti object. what advantage is to be gamed by this procedure fl the assurance asked by the gentleman from Wisconsin fz given? Mr. DOUGBTON. We may not gain any. It is the hope that we will be able to expedite the consideration of the bill Mr. MICBENER. We would just get through a sectior that much quicker and before we know It we are on the next section and it is too late to offer amendments to the lasl section. Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. As I untertook to observe a few moments ago, the only thing tlr-at could be accomplished, as I see it, is to reduce the number of pro forma amendments I think that is about the only result to be accomplished, and think that would be desirable. Mr. TREADWAY. I do not understand from the gentle- man that it even prevents pro forma amendments. It would simply limit the number. The Members would not offer so many pro forma amendments perhaps. Mr. COOPER of Tennessee. It would reduce them to some extent. Mr. DOUGII'ION. It will expedite the consideration o! the bill, with due consideration to each and every Member. Mr. BOILEAU. Is there any way in which we could limit debate to bona flde amendments and exclude pro forma amendments until all bona flde amendments have been con\u00ad sidered? I appreciate, of course, what one gentleman might consider a pro forma amendment another gentleman might not so consider. Mr. YINSOB of Kentucky. A pro forma amendment might be used to get time in debate upon a so-called \" bona flde \" amendment. Mr. BOILEAU. With the gentleman's assurance, I have no objection. Mr. DUNN of Pennsylvania.

There was no objection. Mr. BEITER. Mr. Speaker, the growth of social con\u00ad sciousness in America is not the privilege claimed 89 due of any one political party, nor is it manifested only in govern- mental action. It can be traced in the platforms of all the part&, in &-=si&nts' and Governors' messages, in acts of legislatures, in judicial decisions, and in the conduct of mu\u00ad nicipal affairs. The cause of this legislation is in striking contrast to these mementos of a day when not even the term \"social serv\u00ad ice \" had been coined, for, in its present sig-niflcance at least. social service and social legislation has been the develop\u00ad mcnt of veiy recent years It cannot be denied, to be sure, that in business and in politics we are still individualists, but there is much evi\u00ad dence that even in these fields concern for the common welfare is coming to be a determining influence, while in the field of social legislation there has been within the past few years such expansion and deepening as scarcely has a precedent. Necessity is said to be the mother of invention. The emergency of depression has developed many and varied plans for the annihilation of depression and the return of prosperity. Charity ln any form has always seemed an abhorrent thing, and it must be so especially to the useful citizen who, through the vagaries of life, finds his old age only a series of disheartening days of dependency upon friends, relatives, or institutions. How much better, more logical, and hu\u00ad mane, then, to provide a system on a national scale of retiring our citizens on an old-age-compensation basis? We retire our postal employees, veteran soldiers and sailors, policemen, flremen, teachers, and others. Certainly, to my mind, the rank and file of our citizens, deserve the equal advantages and security in old age which these special groups of citizens enjoy through organization and their willingness to contribute a small share of their earnings to a pension. Many persons wiIl say that it is the duty of everyone to save for his old a.ge-to lav aside some part of his earnings ln stocks and bonds, or in banks, so that he may be assured of enough to live on In his declining years. Others wm say that there are institutions for the aged and infirm. You have only to look around you to see a few of the millions of our citizens who, unfamiliar with the ways of money and finance, saved for years, only to find themselves destitute with the winter of lifetime approaching. Senator Husk LQNC Plans to scatter the wealth by taking from the rich and giving to the poor. He advocat,es this because the wealth of the Nation is practically $300,000,- 000,000. and the greater part of it is owned and controlled by a very small percentage of the total number of people in the country. If this wealth were liquid and capable of division, the plan would not be quite so fantastic. When it is considered that nine-tenths of this wealth consists of buildings, plants, and machinery and its use made entirely impossible if divided into parts, the impossibility of cariying out the plan seems evident. Thse plants can serve but one purpose-the pro\u00ad duction of goods. So far as the whole People are con\u00ad cerned, it matters not whether he who designed this ma\u00ad chineiy continues to operate it or whether some other man of equal knowledge of business shall take it over. What does matter is that it shall be so operated as to produce the largest amount of goods possible in order that the comforts of life may be more uniformly distributed among the great mass of people. In ancient times the laws of the Medes and the Persians were regarded as the unchangeable rule of conduct for the human race. These laws have long been abandoned. But the law of gravitation existed before and since. The law of RECORD-HOUSE APRIL 16 supply and demand was then, aa weIl as now. recognw by all intelligent people and in the long run has controlled the activities of all peoples. The 1930 census showed that there were 6633.805 persons in the United States aged 65 or over. Of this group, 2,204.- 967, or 332 percent were gainfully employed Needless to say, that percentage has greatly decreased in the last few Year= The depression had begun when the census was taken, but it was not recognized as a major economic de- Pression until some time later. men the normal lowering of the maximum employment age which has been an accom\u00ad paniment of the machine, would make for a decrease since 1920 in the percentage of 65-year-old persons who are gain- fully emploYed. To prove this, one needs only to compare present employment figures of this group with those of some 40 years ago. For an instance, 73.1 percent of the men 65 years or over in 1890 were gainfully employed. but in 1930 on& 593 percent were so employed Pension provisions for old age are by no means lacking. Industry began making them as long ago as 30 years. Trade unions and churches have pension systems, too. Some of the States, including New York, have set up funds to replace the old poorhouse system with modernized methods of caring for aged dependents. According to a report last Year by the American Association for Social Security, there were then in this country about 100.000 persons receiving public old-age pensions, about 60,000 receiving care in alms- houses, and an equal number in benevolent homes for the aged. In addition, about 140.000 persons were receiving in\u00ad dustrial pensions, and about 20,000 from trade unions, fraternal 'societies, and churches. The number of persons receiving retirement pensions from Federal, State. and municipal employees' funds. including teachers. was placed at 100,090. None of these groups included the military pensioners. At the time the association made this report 477230 old people were on the unemployment-relief rolls and its report stated that hundreds of thousands cf aged dependents were being supported by children or other rela\u00ad tives. & to the efilcacy of industrial-pension plans, Murray W. Lattimer, of Industrial Relations Counselors, Inc., re\u00ad po rted 2 years ago that industrial pension paYmen& at the beginning of 1932 \"probably came close to $lOO.OOO,OOO per annum.\" The depression revealed weaknesses in many of the plans and a consequence was the abandonment between 1929 and 1932 of about 10 percent of the industrial pension SySbDS OlX?ratb&? h 192% b&XeOVer, in the case of per- haps 30 percent of the empIoYees stiIl under pension systems in 1932. the benefits had been reduced in various ways from the 1929 scale. It is not possible in brief scope to present a clear picture of all the ramifications which thus far have made inadequate the existing systems of old-age pensions as the machine in\u00ad creasingb does the work that old but skilled and wilU.dg hands formerly did. These few facts, however, help to reveal the size of the task InVOlVed To finance the cost of old-age benefit in the security plan we are considering, there will be a tax of 2 percent on pay rolls, beginning in 1937. This tax will increase to 6 percent on pay rOhs in 1949. The empIOYCrS and elIIP~Oyf!eS will con- tribute to this in equal amounts. In the first Year this tax is expected to produce $400.000.000. When the tax increases to 6 percent, the Yield is expected to be $1,250.009,000 annualb. These estimates are based on the wages of today, not on the wages and employment of the flush years of prosperity. Out of these funds compensation would be paid to workers who lose their Jobs and to persons who reach the age of 65 years after having been gainfullY employed. It is expected that 50 percent of all persons now gahifully employed, or 15.000.009. would derive these benefits. There are provisions in the plan for other persons who are not accommodated by the above features of it. These pro- visions will be financed by direct taxes upon the public. The National and State Governments would assess equal fUnOIl& upon the welfare________________ s4.~.ooo sdmlnlstratioa-------_-___---------_--------- plan contemplates that revotig fMd of $32,000.- OOO,OOO-the greatest in all history-will be accumulated in 30 years from the receipts for old-age berWX.s alone.
