You want relief, of course, and research shows that prescription hormone replacement therapy helps with [hot flashes](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a47372/what-are-hot-flashes/) and other symptoms of menopause, with no significant increased risk of health problems like heart disease or diabetes, says [Stephanie Faubion, M.D., MBA](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/faubion-stephanie-s-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20054845?_ga=2.15629110.1896141411.1649884023-1342983036.1649884023), internist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida and medical director of the [North American Menopause Society](https://www.menopause.org/). Most natural remedies, on the other hand, don't have the same level of research behind them, although some have been used to ease menopausal symptoms for years. If you're hoping to avoid putting extra chemicals into your body, or you want to use natural remedies to optimize whatever treatments you're already using, that's understandable, and you may well find them helpful. Just be sure to check with your doctor before trying any dietary supplement or herb. All of the solutions below are backed by some research; more studies are needed on some of them, but read on to discover what's known so far about these options and choose what's worth trying for your specific symptoms. Ease hot flashes with black cohosh... According to the [North American Menopause Society](https://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-symptoms-and-treatments/natural-remedies-for-hot-flashes), black cohosh can help some women reduce hot flashes \u2014 with an emphasis on \"some,\" because studies on the effectiveness of this herb have produced mixed results. If you want to give black cohosh a try in supplement form, definitely speak to your doctor first, because there's been some concern that it could be linked to liver problems. One thing that's not a concern, however: Researchers no longer think that black cohosh affects the body in a similar way to estrogen. This is important since the herb was once seen as having a negative hormonal impact on a woman's uterus or [breast health](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a39503610/breast-lumps/). If your doctor gives you the all-clear, it's worth giving it a shot to see if it can cool the heat for you. Keep in mind that the supplement industry is not well-regulated; when buying, look on the label for third party verification (such as from NSF, USP or Consumerlab.com) that the brand contains what it says it does. ... or with soy ... Ask your doctor whether a soy supplement might be right for you - many studies indicate that [soy](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a20707020/is-soy-good-or-bad-for-you/) can reduce hot flashes to varying degrees. According to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/nonhormonal-treatments-for-menopause) [ data](https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/nonhormonal-treatments-for-menopause), a compound found in soy called daidzein converts to the chemical equol in your intestines. Equol is important because it can duplicate the effect of estrogen in your body, lessening menopause symptoms. More research is needed, but a 10 mg supplement taken twice a day could help. As with any supplement, ask your doctor for a reputable brand. ... or hypnosis. Being treated with hypnosis could cut the frequency of your hot flashes, say a number of randomized [clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3556367/) \u2014 plus, it could help improve sleep. One recent pilot [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747247/) even found that hypnosis reduced by half the number of hot flashes in women, plus lessened their severity. Another recent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097677/) by Indiana University showed that self-hypnosis can cut menopausal sleep disturbances by 50% to 77%. Learning how to do it yourself from a trained and certified hypnotist or hypnotherapist could be new way to get relief. Protect your bones with calcium. A woman's risk of osteoporosis climbs during menopause and beyond, because bone loss speeds up significantly during these years, according to the [Endocrine Society](https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss#:~:text=Menopause%20significantly%20speeds%20bone%20loss,are%20affected%20by%20osteoporosis%20worldwide.). You can help keep brittle bones at bay by focusing on your diet. \"The most important food for menopausal women is dietary calcium to keep bones strong,\" says [Julia Edelman M.D](https://www.juliaedelmanmd.com/bio/)., FACOG, NCMP, a board certified gynecologist and certified menopause clinician in Greater Boston and the author of [Menopause Matters: Your Guide to a Long and Healthy Life](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0801893836). Overall, women over 50 should get 1200 mg of dietary calcium a day, and drinking 10 ounces of a calcium-fortified milk product provides 600 mg; [fortified almond or cashew milk](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g27128821/best-milk-alternative-substitutes/) contains 450 mg of calcium per cup. Other good non-dairy sources: [soybeans](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a20707020/is-soy-good-or-bad-for-you/), dark leafy greens, [canned salmon](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g5147/healthy-canned-foods/?slide=8) and figs. Reduce depression with soothing music. A small [new study](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/9000/The_effect_of_music_therapy_on_menopausal_symptoms.96827.aspx) by Turkish researchers found that listening to relaxing classical music reduced depression in menopausal women, and the researchers concluded that this could be considered as a non-drug therapy. The researchers asked women in the study to listen to music 18 times in a six-week period and saw a significant decrease in their depression scores, compared to a control group that didn't listen to music. Why is [music](https://www.menopause.org/docs/default-source/press-release/music-therapy-and-depression.pdf) so therapeutic? Because it stimulates the secretion of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, as well as the hormone oxytocin. Listening to music can also lower stress hormones such as cortisol. The result: Your blood pressure and [heart](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a38833764/heart-health-facts/) rate lower, and your breathing slows. \"There is little downside to adding music therapy for menopause symptom management,\" says Dr. Faubion. Make time to enjoy your favorite feel-good music every day \u2014 but also keep in touch with your healthcare provider if you're concerned about your mental health. Use lemon balm for a slew of woes. [A review of numerous studies ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783135/)found that this herb, which is a form of mint, can be helpful in treating the [sleep problems](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/g26963663/best-sleep-apps/), anxiety, and GI symptoms that menopausal women often experience. In essential oil form, lemon balm's sweet scent is refreshing and relaxing at the same time. Put a few drops in a [diffuser](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home-products/g25999098/best-essential-oil-diffuser/), sit down, close your eyes and let yourself relax. A small, double-blind, placebo-controlled [study](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/lemon-balm) also found that a 600mm supplement dose of lemon balm, taken for one week, made study subjects feel both calmer and more alert. Talk to your doctor before taking lemon balm supplements because they can interact with some meds, including sedatives and thyroid medication, according to [Mount Sinai](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/lemon-balm), and be sure to choose a reputable brand that has third party certification. Try deep breathing to help you relax. Stress is a health-bummer for many reasons, including exacerbating menopause symptoms. So it makes sense to find ways to lessen its impact on your body. Consider [deep breathing](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/g32267191/mindfulness-activities/) and progressive muscle relaxation: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419242/) shows these can cut the frequency of hot flashes and help you feel less [anxious](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a32058076/what-does-anxiety-feel-like/) due to menopause. It was a small study and its authors cautioned that more research is needed \u2014 but since these practices might help and there are plenty of other health benefits provided by both, they're worth a shot. Here's how to try both: Close your eyes, breathe in deeply, hold for a count of four, then breath out, repeating at least four times. Then stand up straight, legs apart, and reach both arms to the sky, tightening all the muscles in your body, from your fingers to your toes. Now let your muscles go totally limp one body part at a time...one hand at a time, one arm at a time, your shoulders, your trunk, one leg at a time...until you're totally relaxed.
