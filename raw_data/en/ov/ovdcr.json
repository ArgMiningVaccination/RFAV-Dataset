Therefore, you need a mechanism that helps protect your body from those harms. Well, that is the function of the immune system. Simply put, the immune system is made up of special organs, cells, and chemicals that work together in order to protect you from bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It is the first line of defense against pathogens. Once it attacks a microbe that seeks to harm you, it keeps the record of such a disease. This way, it can recognize and annihilate the disease whenever it shows up again. It provides three major types of immunity: innate, adaptive and passive immunity. Parts of the Immune System They are broadly divided into six: White Blood Cell: Also known as the leukocytes, the white blood cells are essential fighters of the body. To keep you safe, they keep traversing your entire body in search of invaders. They are chiefly found scanning through the blood and tissues looking for microbes. The moment they sense these invaders, they launch an immune attack. Complement system: It works closely with the antibodies to keep you safe. It has numerous plasma proteins that interact with one another in order to rid your body of pathogens. This part also combats infections by triggering a series of inflammatory responses. A good example is zymogen, which is an enzyme commonly found in the gut. Lymphatic system: This is a network of tubes scattered all over the body. It is made up of nodes, vessels, and the blood cells (both white and red blood cells). This network manages your fluid level, deals with cancers and bacteria, and takes up excessive fats in your intestine. Spleen: The spleen is an organ that houses several microbe-fighting cells. When it comes to filtering the blood to rid it of microbes, the spleen takes care of that. It also removes damaged red blood cells. Bone marrow and Thymus: Well, the thymus is a blood-filtering organ. Located in the upper-front part of the chest, the thymus has two lobes connected by the isthmus. It goes without saying that the hematopoietic precursor cells develop here. On the other hand, the bone marrow is the engine room where all cells that fight for your body are created. Skin: The skin is often considered the body's largest organ, protecting it from disease-causing agents. It is an important barrier that prevents harmful substances from getting into the body. How Acupuncture Boosts the Immune System Your defense mechanism depends on your body's overall performance to function. This means that poor nutrition, cold weather, lack of essential vitamins (chiefly Vitamin D), stress, and excessive exposure to microbe-causing agents adversely affect your body's defense mechanism. It is a no-brainer that when your immune system is down, you automatically become sick. From the perspective of Western medicine, acupuncture strengthens your immune cells, such as red blood cells and T-cells (otherwise known as T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells). When you apply acupuncture, it spurs those cells to reproduce at an appreciable rate, thereby helping your body fight its invaders. In other words, it is boosts your immune system. The traditional therapy also enhances hormonal and cellular immunity in patients struggling with immune-related ailments. Diseases linked to immune system weakness are colds, asthma, fatigue, AIDS, cancer, hepatitis, allergies, etc. What Else Should I Know About Acupuncture for Immunity Boost? According to [traditional Chinese medicine](https://www.zhouwellness.net), someone is sick because their immune system is down, leading to lack of body balance. This, on the other hand, creates an environment where germs, diseases, and bacteria thrive. Once acupuncture is introduced, it restores the body by creating the necessary balance. The therapy is effective for boosting your defense mechanism because it tends to tackle the root cause of the weakness. This is not the case of many immune boosters out there. In cases of hyperactivity, some drugs suppress your body's defense mechanism. [This is opposed to fixing the root cause of the health challenge. Upon getting traditional therapy, you are sure of a long-lasting remedy for immune issues. It is even fascinating that acupuncture can treat a variety of health challenges. In some cases, acupuncturists combine it with cupping, herbs, moxibustion, and adequate nutrition to keep you healthy and strong. For the acupuncture points for energy boost, experts believe it is the Zusanli acupressure point. However, it is advisable to see a professional for this session. ] Conclusion It is safe to say that you have learned the essential parts of the immune system and the roles they play to keep you going every day. Several studies have shown that going for regular acupuncture sessions can strengthen your defense mechanism. For instance, in one 2007 study, Norwegian researcher Lorena Arranz and her team showed that acupuncture could improve the immunity among anxious women. Moving on, when you have plenty of T cells in your body, you can be sure it will fight for you. With acupuncture needles in your skin, they signal your brain to get ready to attack its invaders. It is noteworthy that the increased cellular response that acupuncture triggers lasts for several days. There is no gainsaying that acupuncture is for everyone - both sick and healthy, as it boosts your immune system. Why wait until you are completely down before going for an acupuncture session?
