After being on twenty two medications within a year, I decided to try to get healthy naturally.\" Mary sought out acupuncture, massage, chi-gung, yoga and meditation and found relief for her symptoms. \"As my health improved, I wanted to reach out to others and help them achieve what I was able to do.\" Utilizing these natural modalities to heal herself lead to training in: Massage Therapy, Yoga, Aruyeda, Bio-Feedback and Esthetics.
