By their own claims about what is or isn't in their medications, they are chemically and physically identical to sugar pills. The only difference is the homeopathic pill has had a magic spell cast upon it, which gives it mystical powers of healing. Or would, if we lived in a universe where magic spells actually work.[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30149039#p30149039:8c7tx2qz said:itdraugr[/url]\":8c7tx2qz][url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30148979#p30148979:8c7tx2qz said:bag[/url]\":8c7tx2qz][url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30148667#p30148667:8c7tx2qz said:p3psi[/url]\":8c7tx2qz][url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30148301#p30148301:8c7tx2qz said:cos_1[/url]\":8c7tx2qz] But some of these alternative treatments actually contain dangerous contents, because there's not much quality control. And you're ignoring that people are often avoiding treatments with proven greater chances of success, because they don't trust the medical community. There are some good reasons not to trust \"big pharma\", but those reasons don't mean anyone should trust \"alternative\" either. \"Some\" is correct. Not all. My concern is that legitimate herbal sources will be grouped into this crusade. And my entire argument is that this issue needs to be approached with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. I'm most definitely not ignoring that people are ignoring treatments with greater chances of success. Steve Jobs was really stupid for not pursuing western medical treatment. To that end, the AMT community needs to learn how to work with western medicine instead of viewing it as the enemy, but western medicine needs to: 1) Be more open to investigating and integrating AMT community, and 2) Address the reasons people feel the need to pursue AMT, namely cost & trust of western medical treatment Integrating western + alternative approaches for a holistic treatment (e.g. acupuncture and tai chi to supplement & reduce the side effects of chemotherapy) is the future, and launching crusades against one form of medicine or another risks stamping out a form of medicine before we've had the opportunity to fully vet it. Wormwood, for example, might have been included in this fight against homeopathy and supplements. Turns out its active ingredient lead to a cure for malaria and the Chinese have been using it to treat Malaria for two thousand years. Western medicine would never have figured that out because we neither have the funding to validate all the things, nor do we take alternative medicines seriously. Until we fix the lack of access to and trust in western medicine, and we learn to properly vet and integrate alternative therapies with our primary therapies, we can stamp down homeopathy all we want, but something else will always appear in its place. \"Western medicine\" and \"alternative medicine\" are misnomers. There are only two types of medicine: 1. Medicine that is backed my scientific research and has been thoroughly scientifically vetted in it's efficacy, 2. Medicine that has no scientific viability or proven efficacy. My attack has been focused on homeopathy, which falls under the later. I am not saying that some folk cures or remedies considered \"alternative medicine\" have no merit. What I am saying is these remedies should not be marketed until they fall into type one above. At that point they are no longer considered \"alternative medicine\". Cannabis is a good example of this. Historically it has been shunned by the medical community as an ineffective substance with no medical potential, and now the medical community is slowly coming around to accepting it as a viable treatment for certain conditions. All due to rigorous scientific study. Every time homeopathy is put to scientific scrutiny it fails spectacularly. Proponents point to placebo is a desperate defense, but placebo is not homeopathy, it is placebo. This week's episode of It's Okay to be Smart seems to be topically relevant: [The Strange Science of the Placebo Effect]. We know homeopathy is bunk. It's not real medicine. It doesn't exceed the performance of placebos, which means that at best it's the equivalent of taking a sugar pill.

Homeopathy can't be challenged by law since the law says it works. The only thing that the FDA can do is go after products that are not made according to the homeopathic pharmacopoeia. The only way to get out of that is to change the law and there are some very powerful (comparatively speaking) interests to prevent that as the FDA found out when it tried to suggest that maybe new homeopathic remedies should go through the same validation process normal medicine has to go through.[url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30148247#p30148247:1x4t5s3w said:p3psi[/url]\":1x4t5s3w][url=http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=30148151#p30148151:1x4t5s3w said:bag[/url]\":1x4t5s3w] Homeopathy is dangerous by displacement.

So educate the public, prosecute companies making legitimate false claims by enforcing the laws we already have, and force companies to live up to their own quality standards by validating contents & quantities of their products.

Hard to believe that this industry has been unregulated for so long, making statements without requiring any kind of proof. I've used jack3d quite a bit, and would love to be involved in a class action if they were using ingredients that they knew caused harm to the body. While this needed to happen, particularly in the realm of supplements for physical fitness as opposed to more general vitamin supplements and the stuff you can now find in a Kroger... Complete and utter paranoia about herbal remedies and supplements in general is unwarranted and unhelpful. It's also true that general practicioners and nutritionists really need to be the same discipline. That means that they need to not only keep a list of specialists to refer to, but it makes zero sense that a dietician or a nutritionist should be a specialized field when it's so integral to people's daily lives, whether it's dietary advice or herbal remedies. Herbal remedies should also never, ever, be used to treat an acute life-threatening condition, and many chronic life threatening conditions such as cancer shouldn't ever be addressed via experimentation. As dangerous as misprescribed medicine is (I had a friend who died of heart failure recently because an idiot doctor prescribed him Adderall) and as more and more doctors are being shown to have random gaps in their knowledge and understanding of diet and nutrition even in specialist fields like gastroenterology, most academically trained doctors are as close as one can get to medical infallibility. Short of the refusal of treatment of the patient themselves of a sound mind, a doctor's orders still need to be legally binding even over the objections of family, and this country is too afraid of malpractice suits to allow that. That includes a doctor being capable of refusing service or charging fines if a patient gallavants off and attempts treatments against their advice when specific action plans are put in place. Doctors need to be ready, willing, and not legally liable, to discount services they have already provided and not billed for yet, and then cut bad patients loose in these cases. GIVEN ALL OF THE ABOVE, it doesn't take that long to do an hour's worth of research on a given herbal supplement to cobble together information from Wikipedia, WebMD and whatever blogger sites you're going to find to, if not make the informed decision to experiment, at the very least start a conversation with your doctor. If your doctor can't answer questions about certain herbal or alternative remedies, it means they haven't done their job and need to use some of their time for research. Any non-surgeon has the spare time to perform this research during non-peak times of the year outside of going to conferences, that is what we deal with the broken medical billing/insurance systems for, so they can act equally as scholars and practitioners. For example: Most of the U.S. has a moderate-to-severe magnesium deficiency that is not being solved by multi-vitamins. It addresses random soreness and the potential for sciatic nerve pinches over time, as well as the overall function of muscles in the body. It's not strictly a bone mineral alongside calcium but helps with joint pain and can enhance the body's ability to adjust the spine back into place with the help of a chiropractor or a back surgeon's advice. Vitamin D is a mood enhancer and helps even out sleep patterns. Beyond Vitamin D, you can get melatonin and valerian root to address sleep problems before going straight to something with massive side effects like Ambien. Valerian root is also a mild treatment for anxiety attacks and mild-to-moderate nervous breakdowns due to stress over time. It's not a placebo and other than a small portion of the population for whom it has mild psychotropic effects and causing a lack of focus in lieu of making them drowsy or calm, it's remarkably effective for cases that don't yet warrant slapping someone on a prescription potentially indefinitely. Slippery Elm has been severely overlooked in supplementing medication for ulcers and digestive tract irritation or helping smokers and sufferers of sinus infections, as well as recovering alcoholics. Slippery elm has a proven ability to help regenerate the mucosal lining of most of the body's digestive tracts and sinuses, something no prescription medicine that addresses inflammation bothers to do, but is essential to help rebalance flora internally. Slippery elm is a huge tool that many doctors are overlooking in treating ulcerative colitis and chron's disease after suppressing the immune system's inflammatory reactions, so healing just takes way longer than it needs to. St. John's Wort has more and more frequent clinical trials proving an effectiveness against symptoms of depression and manic episodes both that are equal in strength to stimulants or anti-depressants, with fewer of the downsides. Food allergies caused by the old food pyramid recommendations are poorly understood to the point of complete inexcusable ignorance. While not every single food product needs to be Chipotle and Jamba Juice, a better understanding is required that a white person, a black person, an Asian person, and an Arab cannot all eat the same diet and not suffer various allergy symptoms over time, especially depending on what region of the world most of their family tree existed in prior. This is by definition the job of general practitioners to know by heart, but too many of them are not as trained in-depth in diet and nutrition as they otherwise should be. Nutritionists shouldn't exist, herbal or otherwise, because they should be in a clinic or ER, making house calls, and giving this advice in addition to the other referrals. These are just a few examples of where the medical community can quite often be guilty of inexcusable ignorance itself, not due to a lack of competency but because of a poor distribution of research funding. If you want the public to stop self-experimentation in order to save money and get help properly, you need to perform rigorous clinical trials on these medicines without impugning on people's freedom yanking them from the shelves. You do still need to slap the wrist of companies that are demonstrably harmful, but it is an accepted risk of the free market that selling snake oil will lead some otherwise intelligent people to incorrectly jump to the conclusion that Big Pharma knows less than they do about their own bodies. That risk cannot be addressed legislatively. As much as many of the commenters here are irrationally pissed off about that fact, they have no actual plan on how to address that fact other than to cause potentially a couple million in deaths from medical confusion and inaccesibility to inexpensive non-emergency treatments for a period of about 30 years for the medical field to catch up. And right now, the medical field's track record isn't so great, there's too many gaps in their knowledge they quite frankly shouldn't have right now considering the sheer amount of crap they regularly and collectively forget to re-review that was already written about between the 20's and 60's alone.
