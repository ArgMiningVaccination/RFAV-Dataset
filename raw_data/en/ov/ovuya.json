As Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent, states in the article, \"They [researchers] reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.\" However, after manufacturers halted the major use of thimerosal in vaccines in 1999, the researchers' theory did not prove to be correct. In fact, from 2004 to 2007, the rate of autism in California raised from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children. Doesn't this show skeptic Americans anything? If we actually continued to be cynical about the situation and stopped using thimerosal as a preservative, what would make our vaccines safe to use? Hope? Vaccine and Autism Controversy Many parents are skeptical about getting their children vaccinated because of the fear that it may cause autism. The question of whether vaccines cause autism is still a controversial subject among many citizens today especially parents. Some citizens argue that vaccines are not safe and could potentially cause autism. Parents believe that vaccine caused their child to develop autism because autism symptoms become apparent around the same time that children were getting their routine vaccinations (WebMD). Many people believe that vaccines are completely safe and do not cause autism in fact some citizens argue that all children should be vaccinated to prevent sickness and serious diseases in fact there have been many studies conducted to prove that vaccines do not cause autism. Despite controversial claims, there is no scientific evidence that links vaccines to autism. One of the most controversial stories in today's medicine is between autism and vaccinations. Autism is a disorder that makes it difficult for people to communicate with others and form relationships with them. It has been thought that vaccinations that children receive at an early age cause autism. Autism has become more prevalent over the years and scientists are still unsure how the disorder has come about. Some parents have taken it upon themselves to not vaccinate their children because they believe it will cause their child to become autistic. The real question is do vaccines really cause autism and if so which vaccine is it? Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder Summary of \"Vaccines Cause Autism\" In the article, \"Vaccines Cause Autism,\" Michael Snyder, an attorney and writer, attempts to convince parents of young children that autism is directly linked to childhood vaccinations. He claims that numerous toxins, including thimerosal, are present in vaccines that are forced into the bloodstream, later causing neurological and brain damage to children. He says that autism has risen by 78 percent over the past decade, and that 1/88 children in the US have an autistic disorder. Snyder believes that most autistic individuals start out completely normal, and that the vaccinations they are given are harming them. He blames the pharmaceutical companies for being too Some parental concerns persist that vaccines may cause Autism. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed throughout the years. There is a major worldwide increasing rate of Autism diagnoses. Theories have centered on measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines being administered. Studies have showed that For recurrent generations, there encompasses numerous controversies surrounding vaccinations for children in addition to the unfavorable reactions that may arise. The chief concerns are whether vaccinating causes serious developmental delays such as autism in children. The aim of this composition is to enlighten others that vaccinating children does not bring about autism. By means of scientific exploration along with advanced medical diagnosis in children, researchers currently recognize that the increase in autism claims are not vaccine linked. Science or Pseudoscience? I. Vaccines & Autism Do Vaccines cause Autism? II. Abstract Do vaccines cause autism is a question that has been bouncing around for over twenty years. The increase in the number of diagnosed cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder has increased significantly and due to the impact this has in people's lives Today, parents are not vaccinating their children for a number of reasons, whether it is religious beliefs, it is not natural, and some parents are even trying to link vaccinations to the rise in autism. This however has been proven false and stated in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The increase in vaccinations and the increase in children with autism happened at the same time, which leads some parents to believe that is why their child was diagnosed with autism, but this is correlation not causation. There is no real scientific test to diagnose autism and it is based off of the child's social and communication skills and their behavior. A retrospective study was done from 1980 to 1994 where scientist recorded the amount of children receiving the measles vaccination and the amount of children diagnosed with autism. Over this time span, there was only a 10% increase in the amount of children receiving the MMR vaccine and 572% increase in children with autism. If the MMR vaccine was the cause of autism, then they should have increased at the same rate and therefore concluding that autism is caused by other unknown factors. Vaccination Safety In a country where health and safety are top priority all across the nation, America has recently had an epidemic. Everyone is worried about the safety concerns about their children getting vaccinated. There are many fears of vaccinations amongst our country, despite the fears, vaccinations are quite safe The risk of Autism through vaccination theory was once again disproved by a study conducted in 2013 by the Journal of Pediatrics. At the head of the study was Dr. Frank DeStefano, who is the director of the Immunization Safety Office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was conducted using 256 children who had autism and 752 children who did not (Lindeman para 3). By looking at \"antigens, the substances in vaccines that cause the body's immune Ever since the invention of vaccines, there has been debates going on between whether or not vaccines cause autisms. In the past couple of decades, there has been a decrease in children receiving vaccines by the autism fright. The dispute between vaccination still continue even to this day even though the claim that vaccines cause autism have been proven by research as false while the benefits of vaccines have outweighed the risks. Vaccines protect small children from life threatening diseases but build their immune system to help in defending \"Despite overwhelming propaganda in the mainstream media that vaccines do not cause autism, one poll found that one out of every four parents now believe that vaccines cause autism\" (Vaccines Cause Autism). Parents who listen to the media rather than the doctors don't want to accept the fact that there is no connection between autism and getting vaccinated. As one doctor explains in viewpoint, \"There is more likely a coincidental link between immunization schedules and diagnoses of autism because the disease tends to arise when children are young, around the same ages that they are receiving vaccinations\" (Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism). Children get vaccinated against 14 diseases by the age of two, along with annual flu vaccinations. Even though many doctors have mounting evidence proving the safety and value of vaccination, many parents are still passionately opposed to them. \"Many people believe that the increased number of vaccines children now get twice as many as they did in 1980 and can receive up to 20 injections by their first birthday are to blame for the rise in kids with autism spectrum disorders (ASD)\" (Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism). It's completely coincidental that autism comes out around the same time that many of the vaccines are given to the children. Parents blame the vaccines because they don't want to accept that their child developed Thimerosal is arguably the most debated ingredient that is contained in vaccines. Thimerosal is a \"mercury-based preservative\" and is used in order to \"prevent contamination of multidose vials\" (\"Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism\"). Anti-vaccinators argue that the mercury contained in the preservative is the culprit for causing autism to There is much speculation over whether or not vaccinations can lead to autism. Many people are concerned that autism may be linked to vaccines in the ingredients in them that children receive. Although there are many who support this theory, biology has shown that there is no link between vaccinations So, the big question is how do people get autism? Some say autism is caused by a person's genetic make-up. Still others blame the environment for the causes of autism. The big fight is to try to blame mandated immunizations for the rising number of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to Offit \"immunizations have no connection with children who may have autism. According to a study published in England where only 12 children who had "}
