I firmly believe that through Crystal Healing, Homeopathy and lifestyle choices alongside good nutrition that this can happen. I have been interested in crystals since I was a toddler. I always had a deep curiosity and love for the mineral kingdom. I was always wondering why we wore jewelry and would be the child searching the beaches to see if I could find \"treasure\" and would play with mum's jewelry ALL THE TIME!!! I've always had an affinity with crystals. I qualified as a Crystal Healer in 1998 and have been practicing ever since. I work with crystals across a range of services. I do Body work, Energy Clearings on properties and Businesses. I also provide Land Healing's and Blessings for properties too. Often people will use my services when moving into a new property or trying to sell a property. I have also developed my very own treatment which I call a Crystal Facial, this is a combination of a crystal healing and a facial. The feedback from my clients is that it is a profound experience unlike any other that leads to shifts in their lives.. My Journey Into Homeopathy My deepest purpose and the thing that gives me the most joyful expression is helping people heal themselves, facilitating their connection back to who they really are.Sarah Hayes My Past And Future I am now submerging myself in the healing field even more by joining The Healing Haven Team and looking forward to helping as many people as I can.
