Appointed Director of the Human Performance Laboratory and Research Center, University of Miami, 1982 Our Masters Degree Program in Exercise Physiology was initiated in January 1983. At that time, we had only 2 graduate students one Masters, and one doctoral student studying exercise physiology. We now have approximately 70 Masters degree students and 2 5 doctoral students majoring in Exercise Physiology. Our department is now called Kinesiology and Sport Sciences and we have 3 different Masters degree tracks in Exercise Physiology 1) Clinical and Applied Physiology 2) Strength and Conditioning 3) Nutrition for Health ad Human Performance. We have also initiated an undergraduate major in exercise physiology. At the graduate level, we have initiated a new certificate program in \"Women's Health\", which will be intricately related to the doctoral research pursued in our program. We also have tw o laboratories, Max Orovitz and the Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology covering over 12,000 square feet of space with sophisticated physiology equipment. We have performed collaborative research with the Diabetes Research Institute at the Medical School, the Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy at the Medical School, Department of Industrial Engineering, Behavioral Medicine, School of Nursing, and with certified Athletic Trainers and team physicians in the Departme nt of Varsity Sports and Athletics. We now have a 5- year program for talented freshmen wishing 21 to obtain their Master's degree in Exercise Physiology in an accelerated 5 -year program.

Responsible for overseeing the design and functional operation of the newly renovated Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology. We now have a biochemistry and hematology area, a body -composition analysis area, a metabolic area and a cardiopulmonary testing area . Furthermore, undergraduate and graduate laboratory students are learning to operate and interpret data collection generated from a very sophisticated laboratory. 10. Initiated the first 5 -year Accelerated program for Exercise Physiology majors. By taking graduate credits and summer courses in their senior year, KIN majors can now get a graduate degree in five years. Other KIN areas in Sports Medicine and Strength and Conditioning are now following this lead. 11. Created t he Pre- Athletic Training major to facilitate the transition of Freshm an students (majors) into the Athletic Training major. Retention improved 200% and enrollment continues to rise. 12. Offered the first u ndergraduate course in Sport Administration that is televised to students at ING Academy in Bradenton, FL. These students are attending class live through satellite capabilities through the School of Continuing Education. ING is now interested in develop ing a satellite Master's degree program in Sport Administration in Bradenton, FL. 13. Initiated collaboration with the \"Study Abroad\" program at the University of Miami. Our first study abroad class was in \"History of Sport\" which took place in Rome, Italy. 14. Hosted the Translational Health Literacy Workshop for Haitian -American High School Students entering Miami- Edison Health Academy at the Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology, June 14 - July 12, 2006. 15.

Moved more difficult classes back to junior and senior level. 35. Initiated the country's first joint colloquium featuring diet and exercise for the care of Breast Can cer Patients. Titled \"From Surviving to Thriving: B ridging Theory with Practice\", t his was a joint effort between Sylvester Comprehensive Center, School of Nursing, and School of Education & Human Deveopment. 36. Transitioned the Department name change from \"Exercise and Sport Sciences\" to Kinesiology and Sport Sciences. 37. Developed the first departmental newsletter in Kinesiology and Sport Sciences called the \" KIN Insider \". 38. Added a new require d \"Biomechanics\" class and an \"E vidence Based Sports Medicine\" class to the Exercise Physiology and Athletic Training Majors, respectively. 39. Changed the BS degree in Education to a BS degree in Exercise Physiology 40. Created the first \"Kinesiology 322 Laboratory Book\" for all students, Fall 2015 These significant activities were accomplished while continuing to perform research, write manuscripts, make presentations, chair theses and dissertation committees, supervise projects/field experiences, solicit funding and teach courses in Exercise Physio logy. 38 Recently Developed 1. The first Nutrition and Integrative Physiology Masters degree program. 2. The first Interdisciplinary online Women's Health Certificate Program . 3. The first departmental Facebook page. 4.
