The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:07 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Morella, Ros-Lehtinen, Weldon, Waxman, Cummings, Schakowsky, and Clay. parliamen- tarian; Mark Corallo, director of communications; John Callendar,counsel; S. Clay, Nicole Petrosino, and John Rowe, pro-fessional staff members; Robert A. Briggs, chief clerk; Robin Butler,office Michael Despres, minority counsels; Ellen Rayner, minor-ity chief clerk; and Jean Gosa, minority assistant clerk. Mr. B URTON . Good morning. A quorum being present, the Committee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' written and opening statements be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits, or extraneous or tabular material referred to be included in the record. Withoutobjection, so ordered. During the 106th Congress, I initiated oversight investigations to look at the dramatic rise in autism rates and the many concernsabout vaccine safety. Autism rates have skyrocketed. Conservativeestimates suggest 1 in 500 children in the United States is autistic.However, those rates are dramatically higher in some places suchas Brick Township, NJ, where the rates are 1 in 150. I think Con-gressman Smith, who is going to testify today, represents part ofthat area. In the first quarter of this year a child was diagnosed with au- tism every 3 hours in California. Last year, that rate was every 6hours. Look at that graph. They are having an absolute epidemicout there. Indiana is seeing a similar trend in increased rates; 1 in 400 chil- dren in my home State is autistic. Between December 1999 and De- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 for special education services for children with autism went up 25 percent. That is a 25-percent increase inrequests for taxpayer-provided services in just a year. We have a national and potentially worldwide epidemic on our hands. It cannot simply be better reporting or an expanded defini-tion of autism. There has to be more to it than that. As with any epidemic, we need to focus significant energy and re- search on containing it. We need to locate the cause or causes. Weneed to determine if this is the same condition we understand au-tism to be or not. Could this epidemic of children who regress into''autism '' be another condition being called autism? We need to be aggressive in developing and making available ap- propriate treatments for both the behavioral issues and the bio-medical illnesses related to this condition. And we need to providecredible and timely information to the public. Has the public healthsector responded adequately and appropriately to this epidemic?We will be hearing from witnesses over the next 2 days to find out. Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder, is devastating to families. I know this from personal experience. My grandson, Christian, wasborn healthy and developed normally. His story is not much dif-ferent than that of the thousands of families we have heard fromover the last year. He met his developmental milestones. He wastalkative. He enjoyed being with people. He interacted socially. Then Christian received his routine immunizations as rec- ommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention andhis life changed dramatically and very rapidly. We now know thatthrough his shots, he may have been exposed to 41 times the levelof mercury than is considered safe by Federal guidelines for a childhis size. This was on top of other mercury exposure from earliervaccinations. Within 10 days of receiving his vaccines, Christian was locked into the world of autism \u2014within 10 days. Is it related to the MMR vaccine? Is it related to the mercury toxicity? Is it the environment,including food allergies? Or is autism purely genetic? Some wouldhave us believe that a child 's regression into autism within a short time of vaccination is purely a coincidence. I ask those individualsto show me the science that proves this theory. On Monday, the ''Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine and Autism Report '' was released by the Institute of Medicine 's Committee on Immunization Safety Review. We have Dr. Marie McCormick, theChair of this committee, here today to talk about the findings andrecommendations of the report. I realize the headlines over the last 3 days have said that the committee found no connection between the MMR vaccine and au-tism. I would urge all of you to read the entire report and recognizethat the committee found that there was insufficient evidence toconclusively prove or disprove a connection between the MMR vac-cine and acquired autism. And yet, on television all across thiscountry, every parent saw that there was no connection betweenthe MMR vaccine and autism. Yet, that is not what the report said. I believe a disservice has been given to the American people about this. Parents need toknow the risks involved with certain exposures their children haveto face. And they need to have all the facts, not part of the facts. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb be noted that the committee notes in its conclusions that it could not exclude the possibility that MMR vaccine couldcontribute to Autism Spectrum Disorder. In the scientific community, there is an accepted hierarchy of re- search methodology that builds a balanced foundation of the evi-dence. That is in attachment 1. What we learned from the Instituteof Medicine is that the research has not yet been conducted tobuild this hierarchy of evidence regarding the question of whetheror not the MMR vaccine may be linked to the increased incidenceof autism. We have substantial parental observation, which should never be discounted. And we have several case studies and laboratory evi-dence showing measles virus in the guts of autistic children whohave bowel dysfunction. And we also have several population-levelepidemiological studies. While the Immunization Committee noted that the epidemiologic studies do not support an association at a population level, theirreport stated that ''it is important to recognize the inherent meth- odological limitations of such studies in establishing causality. '' In essence, the studies that have been published and held up by the public health community as ''proof '' against Dr. Wakefield 's hy- pothesis can never answer the question of whether or not MMRvaccine is linked to autism in some children. We do not haveenough research to make an evidence-based final conclusion. Whatwe have is a clear indication that a problem exists for some chil-dren. We need to do the research to get our arms around that prob-lem, so that we can prevent any further escalation of this epidemicof acquired autism. When the Institute of Medicine formed their committee, we were assured that there would be no one on the committee who had tiesto the vaccine industry. We were told there would be nobody con-nected to the vaccine industry involved in the research done by thiscommittee. So I was disturbed to learn that the committee sent thisreport out for review and comment prior to becoming final to nu-merous individuals who have ties to the vaccine industry, includingthe manufacturer of the MMR vaccine. They sent it out for critiquing, and there were changes made by these other people outside. They also sent it to at least one individ-ual who presented to the committee, but not to Dr. Wakefield andthe rest of the presenters. This preferential treatment is disturb-ing, and I would like to know why they did not send it to everybodywho was a presenter. I am including in the record a letter I received from one of the reviewers, and a previous witness to this committee regarding hisconcerns about flaws in the evaluation of the published research.He is with the University of Oklahoma, the Health Center. Andthat will be included in the record. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I want to read just one part of his letter. ''The report highly criticizes the peer review publications that cite a causal association of the MMR vaccine and autism and doesnot provide a similar critique of the peer review publications thatcite a lack of association of the MMR vaccine and autism. '' It also says, ''One of the publications that are used to support the lack of the MMR vaccine and autism cites support of Merck andCompany in the acknowledgements. '' They are the producer of the MMR vaccine. This is not mentioned in the Institute 's report and could be con- sidered potentially as a pre-existing bias. We want to ask the per-son who is going to be testifying about the report why that hap-pened. They also sent it to at least one individual who presented to the committee, but not Wakefield. I am including in the record this letter I received from the re- viewer about what he believes to be the flaws in the evaluation ofthe published research. He also raises concerns about the lack ofthe Institute 's acknowledgement in their evaluation that one of the publications used to support a lack of a connection between theMMR vaccine and autism was sponsored by Merck, the manufac-turer of the MMR vaccine. We have a very long hearing today. I am going to ask the wit- nesses to stick to the time limit so we can get through all the pan-els and have time for questions. We will be hearing first from mycolleagues and friends, the chairmen of the Autism CongressionalCaucus \u2014which I am proud to be a member of \u2014Congressman Christopher Smith of New Jersey, and Congressman Mike Doyle ofPennsylvania. The record will remain open until May 11.I apologize to Mr. Waxman for talking so long, but I feel very strongly, as you know. Mr. Waxman, you are recognized for an opening statement.[The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The issue of autism has been getting increased attention in Con- gress over the last several years, and this attention is overdue. Iwant to commend you, Mr. Burton, for your efforts to increase pub-lic awareness about autism through these hearings. Autism is a particularly frustrating disease. We still do not un- derstand what causes it and we still do not have a cure. All weknow for sure is that its impact on families can be devastating. During the hearings held in this committee, we have heard par- ents tell tragic stories of children who appear to be developing nor-mally and then all of a sudden retreat into themselves, stop com-municating, and develop autistic behavior. Other parents have tes-tified that their children never start to develop language skills, andinstead early on manifest symptoms of autism. I can only imagine how frustrating and difficult this must be for families. And I appreciate how urgently we need to understandwhat causes autism, how to treat it, and if possible, how to preventit. Fortunately, Congress is beginning to respond. Last year, I co- sponsored a bill to increase NIH 's funding for autism research. This funding was authorized as part of the Child Health Act, whichI also supported. This year, Congress ' challenge will be to appropriate the funding authorized by the Child Health Act. We will not make real progressuntil we make sure NIH has the funding it needs to research thisdebilitating disease. At our first hearing last year, we heard moving statements from the chairman and several witnesses that they had firsthand experi-ence with observing signs of autism shortly after children receivedthe MMR vaccine. These witnesses voiced their suspicion that au-tism was caused by the vaccine. I was deeply concerned about these remarks. Vaccines are unique in medicine. Other medicines are administered to sick people tomake them better. But vaccines are given to healthy children andthey are mandatory in many States. When I heard the chairman 's concerns, I was disturbed by the possibility that a vaccine thatStates mandate could be making healthy children sick. But at the same time, I was also worried for another very dif- ferent reason. Vaccines are one of the greatest success stories inmodern medicine. Because of vaccines, children no longer sufferbrain damage or die from measles or are paralyzed by polio. I real-ize that publicizing fears that vaccines may cause autism couldcause some parents to stop vaccinating their children. And I worrythat this could be counterproductive. In the name of protecting ourchildren from autism, we could actually be subjecting them tomuch greater risks of deadly or debilitating diseases such as mea-sles, rubella, damage affecting developing fetuses or brain damagefrom meningitis. The theory that the MMR vaccine may contribute to autism had been carefully reviewed by the British Medical Research Counsel,which found no evidence to support it. However, what we needed,I believe, was more study. That is why I proposed during lastyear's hearing that Chairman Burton join me in requesting that the Secretary of Health and Human Services convene a panel of ex- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb that the MMR vaccine could cause au- tism. HHS responded to our request by contracting with the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences, to con-vene a panel of independent experts to review vaccine safety issues.The Institute of Medicine identified potential experts and then sub-jected the experts to strict criteria that excluded anyone who hadfinancial ties to vaccine manufacturers or their parent companies,previous service on the major vaccine advisory committees, andprior expert testimony or publications on issues of vaccine safety. The first issue this independent panel considered was the rela- tionship between the MMR vaccine and autism. This panel of inde-pendent experts convened by the Institute of Medicine issued itsreport on the MMR vaccine this Monday. The report is careful andanalyzes all the scientific information available and it concludesthat there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a link be-tween the MMR vaccine and autism. The Institute of Medicine report is consistent with the findings of the British Medical Research Council. It is also consistent withthe conclusions of the World Health Organization, the AmericanMedical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.Taken together, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the MMRvaccine is highly unlikely to be a cause of autism. The next vaccine issue the Institute of Medicine will examine is whether there have been adverse effects from thimerosal, a mer-cury-containing vaccine preservative. Because of concerns aboutmercury in vaccines, FDA has acted to remove thimerosal from thechildhood immunization schedule. In fact, the entire vaccine sched-ule is currently available without thimerosal. From a public healthperspective, the remaining issue is whether FDA made the rightdecision in choosing not to recall the thimerosal-containing vac-cines that are still on doctor 's shelves. FDA made the decision not to recall the vaccines because of con- cerns about a potential vaccine shortage. While there may be a the-oretical risk to children from the thimerosal, FDA knew that thereis a very real risk to children if there is not enough vaccine avail-able to protect them adequately from dangerous diseases such aswhooping cough or diphtheria. Moreover, FDA was also aware thatthe Centers for Disease Control 's surveillance has not shown any relationship between thimerosal and developing mental delays. Based on these facts, FDA 's decision seems right, but I will wel- come any further insight that the Institute of Medicine is able tooffer. I sympathize with the parents who have testified at our hearings and who will testify today. I want them to know that I am commit-ted to doing everything Congress can to address the problem of au-tism. It is clear to me that we need to research aggressively thecauses and treatments of autism. Unfortunately, I believe the an-swers must come from science. I thank the witnesses for appearing today and I look forward to their testimony. Mr. B URTON . I thank the gentleman from California. Mr. Horn, do you have an opening statement?Mr. Kucinich, do you have an opening statement? VerDate Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. And thank you very much, Mr. Waxman, for makingit possible for me to be a member of this committee. I have to say, in having the opportunity to sit through these com- mittee hearings, I am taken with the concern for public health thatboth of my esteemed colleagues have, Mr. Burton and Mr. Wax-man. I cannot say that I have formed any conclusion about this be-cause I think it is important to be open to new evidence. I do think it would be significant and important at this moment to read from the summary from the Immunization Safety Reviewfrom the Institute of Medicine, which says, ''The Immunization Safety Review Committee concludes that the evidence favors rejec-tion of a causal relationship at the population level between MMRvaccine and ASD. However, this conclusion does not exclude thepossibility that MMR vaccine could contribute to ASD in a smallnumber of children because the epidemiological evidence lacks theprecision to assess rare occurrences of a response to MMR vaccineleading to ASD and the proposed biological models linking MMR toASD, although far from established, are nevertheless not disproved. Because of the limitations of the evidence, the significant public concern surrounding the issue, the risk of disease outbreaks if im-munization rates fall, and the serious of ASD, the committee rec-ommends that continued attention be given to this issue. This com-mittee has provided targeted research and communication rec-ommendations. However, the committee does not recommend a pol-icy review at this time of the licensure of MMR vaccine or of thecurrent schedule and recommendations regarding administration ofMMR vaccine. '' It seems to me that this summary, which comes from the docu- ment that is under discussion, does have an inconclusive nature toit in the overall issue, even if it does not recommend removal oflicensure of the vaccine. So in exploring the issue of this hearing,why the increased rates, I think the persistence of our chairmanon the issue of autism and holding these hearings to update lastyear's work is well taken. Often, hearings such as these raise more questions than they give answers, and a determination for finding answers is an exam-ple that researchers need to follow. In order to find more answers,I do not believe we should narrow the scope of the research. Rath-er, it is my hope that through the testimony of parents, Dr. Wake-field, and others we will be able to gain a broad view of the factorsthat may cause autism. A recent report released by the Immunization Safety Review Committee at the Institute of Medicine is important in this regardbecause, again, I want to state the conclusion of the committee thatthe evidence favors rejection of a causal link between the MMRvaccine and ASD is not the whole story. Media reports haveseemed to focus on the first part of the conclusion. The second part of the conclusion, which is perhaps equally im- portant, is that there is not enough evidence. The committee alsoconcludes that the epidemiological evidence is lacking in bothbreadth and precision. That, by definition, means that we need todo more research. It means we need to do more specific research. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb would agree with Mr. Waxman that given the bene- fits of the vaccine, we do not want to be in a position where wetake the position for challenging health risks to a broad spectrumof America 's children, I believe we also need to look at these in- creased incidents with a sense of mission to find out exactly whatis going on. The conclusion that the review made also notes thatbiologic models that link the MMR vaccine and ASD are frag-mentary. The committee identifies the limitations of the availableevidence, which can only mean that it is too soon to narrow ourscope of possible answers. Currently, there is $58 million in autism research funds at NIH. Congress needs to focus on more funding for more research. Iwould submit, instead of focusing just on the brain as the solesearch of autism research, we need to have a more holistic ap-proach and review the entire body system. Indeed, there is someevidence \u2014admittedly, limited \u2014that shows that vaccine may cause a physical reaction in the digestive system that may cause autism. Also, as I understand it, there is no conclusive research on whether or not autism is caused by genetic factors or environ-mental factors. We may need to look at food allergies, vitamin defi-ciencies, and pollutants for their potential role in causing autism.By looking at the entire human body and not just the brain as thesubject of research, we may find answers to questions that we, asMembers of Congress, the Autism Congressional Caucus, parents,researchers, and others seek. I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses. I encourage Federal agencies and Congress to acknowledge their testimony andhave a broad scope in working to uncover the cause of autism withadditional and improved research. Again, I thank the Chair.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Kucinich. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.Ms. R OS-LEHTINEN . Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I merely wanted to congratulate you once again for your valiant efforts in helping bring this potential connection to light. Perhapsthere is a connection between the onset of autism and the vaccina-tions, perhaps not. But I know it is an important issue for thiscommittee and it is something that should be taken seriously. I congratulate you for sticking to your commitment on this, in spite of the overwhelming pressure you must be under from themainstream scientific community to let it go. I know in my commu-nity we have many cases of autistic children, children beingtracked by the school system in a different manner. Maybe we arejust getting better with diagnosis, but it just seems alarming to me,in my area of south Florida, the high number of children with au-tism. I think it is an important issue for our committee. I think you have been a valiant leader in this fight. We do need to improve thescientific evidence. We need to fund the research. We need to edu-cate doctors in a better way because many times those symptomsare going by unnoticed and the pediatricians just shrug their shoul-ders and say, don 't worry, this is just a phase that child is going through. So we need to improve funding and we need to improvethe education for the medical community as well. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for being brave enough to stick to your agenda and to keep our committee seriously lookingat the connection between vaccination and autism and just raisethe awareness on the issue of autism itself. And I congratulate ourcolleagues, Mr. Smith and Mr. Doyle, for forming this coalition, ofwhich I am proud to be a member and with which I am proud tobe associated. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Mr. Clay.Mr. C LAY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee today. I also welcome the opportunity to meet with my fellow Members ofCongress who are co-chairs of the Autism Caucus, RepresentativeChristopher Smith and Representative Michael Doyle. I especiallywelcome the parents of autistic children who are witnesses. It isnoted that all of the parents on the panel are doctors. Additionally,I welcome all other witnesses of panels three and four. Mr. Chairman, my No. 1 focus while I am in office is children. I am a father, as are you, and I am especially grateful that you ex-tend that parental concern through this committee. Autism is a de-velopmental disorder that appears within the first 3 years of achild 's life. The exact causes are unknown. Many scientists who study autism find that it occurs during fetal development, whilesome speculate that there may be a form or forms of autism thatoccur in the early years of a child 's life. Some parents and researchers subscribe to the theory that this form of autism may be caused by vaccinations. Presently, no con-firmed scientific basis links vaccinations with autism and some ofthe studies that support some of these theories have been discred-ited. These are questions to which we must have answers. I have a 4-month-old son and a 7-year-old daughter. To you parents who arewitnesses today, your children could just as well have been my chil-dren. This is an area that must be given all the resources and at-tention necessary to find causes, effects, and solutions. At this point, Mr. Chairman, I would yield back the balance of my time and ask unanimous consent to enter my statement intothe record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, your prepared statement will ap- pear in the record. [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] VerDate W ELDON . I just wanted to mention my good friend from Ohio, Mr. Kucinich, said earlier that NIH funding for autism research isat $58 million. I believe that actual figure is substantially belowthat, more in the range of $15 million. I think there is going to beanother hearing to get at that issue, but I just wanted the recordto reflect that. Indeed, that is a big part of our problem. We are not funding enough research in this arena. I thank you for calling this hearing,Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Weldon. Mr. Cummings.Mr. C UMMINGS . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing today. During the 106th Congress, the Government Reform Committee held numerous hearings on vaccine safety and the theories on thecorrelations between vaccinations and autism. Earlier this week,the Institute of Medicine Committee on Immunization Safety Re-view released a study that reported ''there is little evidence of a causal link between vaccinations and autism. '' I agree with Dr. Steven Goodman of the Johns Hopkins Univer- sity of Medicine \u2014which so happens to be located in my district \u2014 who was a member of the IOM panel, when he said that ''the risk of not immunizing is much greater than any risk from immuniz-ing.'' Vaccinations provide important health protections so that our children will not be at risk for a variety of illnesses and diseases.Without vaccinations, the diseases we are now protected from willreturn. I applaud the CDC, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institutes of Health, the Foodand Drug Administration, as well as the Kennedy Krieger Instituteand the Center for Development and Behavior Learning at the Uni-versity of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore for their con-tinued research in this area. The causes of autism are unknown. There are some effective treatments for some children, but there is no cure. My heart goesout to parents, grandparents \u2014like you, Mr. Chairman \u2014and fami- lies of autistic children. I am convinced that with further researcha cause and cure will be found. I am also concerned that there have been approximately 2,800 cases of autism reported in my home State of Maryland. I am alsoconcerned about the rise in the number of autism cases in Califor-nia, New Jersey, and other States. As such, I strongly believe that all theories for the cause of au- tism must be objectively and thoroughly researched. I echo the sen-timents of the ranking member of this committee when he ex-pressed last year in the Los Angeles Times that autism must notalarm the American people and steer them away from vaccinatingtheir children. I welcome the witnesses here today. I look forward to the testi- mony. Thank you very much.Mr. comment? Ms. Schakowsky.Mr. B URTON . If not, Congressmen Smith and Doyle, would you come forward, please? We will start with you, Mr. Smith. We normally swear in our witnesses, but I do not think we need to do it with you, too. Mr. Smith. STATEMENTS OF HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH, A REP- RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JER-SEY; AND HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA Mr. S MITH . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and the members of the committee for allowing my good friend and colleague, Mike Doyle, and I to be here on behalfof our Coalition for Autism Research and Education [CARE]. It iscurrently made up of 115 Members of Congress. It is bipartisan. Itwas formed recently and we have our first major briefing on Fri-day. The reason for the Coalition is to try to sensitize Members tothe need for more research dollars, more focus on this very, verydebilitating and heartbreaking tragedy that has been experiencedby increasing numbers of Americans. I think most of you know that autism is a developmental dis- order that has robbed at least 400,000 children of their ability tocommunicate and interact with their families and loved ones. Thedisorder, at least the common, prevalent number used, is found in1 of every 500 people in America, although that number may haveto be ratcheted upwards, given some of the more recent evidencethat is coming forward. My interest in autism has been a 21-year interest. I first got in- volved when the Eden Institute and Dr. Holmes in Princeton, NJbrought me to one of their group homes and showed me the kindof work they were doing. I worked with him and others throughoutthe years to try to do what we could. But, frankly, I have been amazed at what has not been done at the Government level through the 1980 's and into the 1990 's on this affliction, this disorder. What brought me into it even more so in recent years \u2014in one of my largest towns, Brick Township, I became aware throughBobby and Billy Gallagher, a very devoted husband and wife who have two children with autism. They did their own study, if youwill, in Brick Township and found that there was an exorbitantnumber of cases of children with autism. They became alarmed andbrought this information to me. They had the documentation andwe spent the better part of 3 hours reviwing it. In subsequentmeetings, it went on and on as we renewed it further. We finally brought the CDC and other Government agencies into Brick. Frankly, I was amazed, shocked, dismayed, and saddened byhow little the CDC and some of our great Government organiza-tions knew about autism. It was as if the studies were passive, theinformation collected was little to nonexistent \u2014and that includes in my own State. This began an effort to try to do more, to try toat least get a handle on the prevalence of autism. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb real? Is it imaginary? Is it fic- tion? And as you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, what is the causa-tion? Looking at your witnesses and knowing of your own deep,personal commitment, I want to congratulate you at your doggeddetermination to get at the reason. Why do we have this terribledisorder seemingly cropping up in larger numbers in our commu-nities, as we saw in my own Brick Township, NJ? What wasfound \u2014and this was very disconcerting \u2014after a professional study by CDC, was that rather than 1 in 500, the number was 4 per1,000 in Brick. What are the reasons? Nobody really has any an-swers. The questions and the answers we have gotten in terms ofnumbers only bring about more questions about why the preva-lence? Why does there seem to be a cluster or why do we have ahigher number throughout the country? Our own Department of Education in New Jersey has seen more cases. Maybe this is just better reporting or maybe we have a prob-lem that is an epidemic that has gone largely unnoticed. In 1991there were 241 cases. That has grown to an incredible 2,354 casesin 1999, an 876 percent increase. In just 4 years, the number ofautistic children aged 6 through 21 has more than doubled. So wehave a problem that really begs a significant increase in funding,commitment, and prioritization within our Government. Last year many of us argued successfully that the amount of money going to the CDC and NIH be increased. We are doing itagain this year, making a similar request to the appropriators thatmore money for prevalence and other studies be forthcoming. Finally, Mr. Chairman, last year we did get a breakthrough with the Centers of Excellence in Autism Epidemiology that was con-tained in Public Law 106 -310. I had introduced legislation that had that in it. We worked with a number of organizations and indi-viduals. Mike Bilirakis, our good friend who chairs the committee,put it as title one of his child health initiative bill. Now that isawaiting full implementation so we can get a better handle on au-tism with these new centers of excellence looking at prevalence andother issues associated with it. Again, I want to thank you for your leadership. Let me offer one note of caution. I know the IOM study suggests that there is nota link. And I know that one of their witnesses will be here todayto amplify that. But I chair the Veterans Affairs Committee. I re-member when the very first amendment I offered dealt with theAgent Orange issue. Tom Daschle, now the minority leader over onthe Senate side, and I offered an amendment to try to provide serv-ice-connection disability and enhanced medical care for our veter-ans who had been exposed to dioxin, the contaminant contained inAgent Orange. For years, what we thought was credible evidence was laid aside and they said there was no link, there is no link, there is no link.Finally, in the latter part of the 1980 's, the evidence became so compelling that at least three anomalies associated with that con-tamination were finally deemed service-connected and were deemedworthy of compensation. My hope is that this report not end the issue, but only lead to more studies to find out what that causation really is, because wereally do not know. Again, it is encouraging. I am a great fan and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb For the record, back in the early 1980 's, as a member of the International Relations Committee \u2014and you remember this well, Mr. Chairman \u2014I offered the amendment to create the Child Survival Fund and put $50 million in it. Now ithas grown to over $200 million to immunize the world 's children against pertussis, measles, tetanus, and other debilitating diseases. So I am a great believer that immunizations save lives. But if there is a problem, we need to be candid enough, aggressiveenough, and honest enough, for the sake of our kids, to go at thisand find out what is the causation. God willing, there is no connec-tion. But we need to pursue that aggressively. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Hon. Christopher H. Smith follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Smith. Mr. Doyle.Mr. D OYLE . Thank you. Chairman Burton and members of the committee, I thank you very much for inviting me to speak with you regarding autism andthe goals and expectations for the Coalition for Autism Researchand Education [CARE]. I want to personally thank you for your interest in expanding our knowledge of autism and autism spectrum disorders and increasingresearch funding as well as for your members in CARE. Your lead-ership has brought desperately needed attention to a major chil-dren 's public health issue that has been neglected for the past 50 years. As you know, autism is a life-long disorder that significantly im- pacts the lives of those affected with the disorder as well as thelives of parents and relatives. I need not tell you, Mr. Chairman,of the profound effects autism has on parents and loved ones whoprovide care for every 1 of these 1.7 million individuals. Autismchanges lives forever. Based on the latest evidence, we can safely say that autism and autism spectrum disorders are now at an epidemic level here in theUnited States with over 1.7 million individuals affected. That is 1out of every 150 to 170 children born. During my tenure as Congressman, I have had numerous meet- ings with concerned parents, researchers, and advocates who arestruggling to get autism research and treatment issues to the fore-front of lawmakers ' minds. The vast majority are frustrated by the lack of research and essential treatment and services for their chil-dren. It is because of them, Mr. Chairman, that I became commit-ted to forming a congressional organization for autism advocacy,along with my good friend, Chris Smith, who I knew already hada strong interest in autism from his work on the ASSURE Act lastsession, and the Coalition for Autism Research and Education wasborn. With CARE, our major goals are to ensure substantial increase in research funding while ensuring that families receive the high-est quality treatment possible in accordance with today 's knowl- edge. If we accomplish these goals, the number of children bornwith autism can be substantially reduced and the revolution bio-logic treatments of the future can be achieved for those who al-ready have autism. I join you in your grave concern of an autism-vaccine link and feel strongly that we must examine what vaccines may be doing toour children and thoroughly investigate the late onset autism-mea-sles vaccine connection. Identifying a vaccine-autism link will helpcountless individuals who develop autism after a vaccination, butwe need to fully explore all possible avenues to help those who de-velop the disorder by some other means. In my view, we must learn to identify the genetic and biologic basis of susceptibility to vaccine complications so that children atrisk can be identified and their vaccinations delayed, while childrennot at risk can continue to receive vaccinations and the protectionfrom brain injury and death that they provide. In addition, identi-fying the causes of autism will not cure the 1.7 million individuals VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb must also strive toward the revo- lutionary biologic treatments of the future so that there is hope forthese children and adults. The decoding of the human genomeopens the door for the development of cures for autism in the life-time of children born with autism today. The bottom line is that we need a lot more funding for autism research. The opinions and testimony this committee will hear areproof of that. I am concerned that if we focus the lion 's share of funding on one suspected cause of autism that we could uninten-tionally pass up vital advances in other areas. I want to providea lion 's share of the funding for research into both the treatments and causes of the disorder equally for the sake of all 1.7 million in-dividuals and families that are now living with the disorder, manyof whom were born prior to the introduction of vaccines. Autism lasts a lifetime and often children with disorders outlive their parents. We need to care for and educate autistic childrenand adults, provide properly trained staff and educators to meetthe highly complex and specialized needs of these individuals. Allof this can become very costly over the lifetime of an individualwith autism. Steps must be taken to reduce the disability associ-ated with autism so that more and more individuals can work andlive semi-independently. In my home State of Pennsylvania, the Autism Society of Amer- ica estimates that we have 73,686 individuals with autism. Autismcosts Pennsylvania an average of $50,000 per person per year. Itmakes good sense to invest in research now so that we can getquality services to families and realize the ultimate payoffs of pre-vention of this disorder in the future and cures for those childrenand adults who already have autism. Continued funding of NICHD 's 4-year-old Genetics and Neurobiology Network must be maintained if we are to achieve thisgoal. Combined with the creation and funding of at least five newcenters of excellence and three epidemiologic centers, autism re-search in America can reach new heights and achieve new break-throughs for autism. Congress must continue to fund existing au-tism research programs without taking away the much neededfunding for them to pay for new ones. I believe that any expansionof research programs must come with a corresponding expansion offunding dollars. In closing, Mr. Chairman, in western Pennsylvania, we are fortu- nate to have one of NICHD 's collaborative programs of excellence at the University of Pittsburgh. This 4-year-old program is not onlymaking a substantive contribution to the understanding ofneurobiology and genetics of autism, it is providing guidance toState legislators in developing surveillance and treatment centersin our State. I would like to extend a personal invitation to you, Mr. Chair- man, and to each member of this committee to come and tour thisfacility, as I have, meet the researchers and staff, and speak to in- dividuals with autism and parents about their struggles and needs. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing today and for the opportunity to testify this morning. [The prepared statement of Hon. Michael F. Doyle follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Thank you, Mr. Doyle. Let me start with you Representative Smith.In Brick Township, as I recall \u2014and you may have to refresh my memory \u2014there were some toxic chemicals or something there. What were those chemicals? Mr. S MITH . We had problems with a number of toxic chemicals. As a matter of fact, we invited the ATSR, the agency that looks forenvironmental pathways, to come in and they did their own studyand ruled out \u2014based on the proximity of where the children with autism lived and whether or not they were close to the river \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . What were the chemicals? Do you recall? Mr. S MITH . PCBs \u2014there were a number of chemicals. It was a witch 's brew in essence of chemicals. They did look for a number, and I could provide that for the record. Mr. B URTON . I would like to have that. Did they find any mer- cury in there? Mr. S MITH . I do not believe they did. Mr. B URTON . But they found PCBs? Mr. S MITH . Yes, and others. We are a very industrial State in the State of New Jersey. Many of those chemicals were dumped intothe river and got into the water system. But despite concerns about that, when an overlay of where the children were living was done, there seemed to be no causationthat could be attributed to an environmental pathway. So theyruled that out. Mr. B URTON . How many were there? Mr. S MITH . There were 4 per 1,000. Mr. B URTON . So 1 in 250. Mr. S MITH . And 6.7 for the full spectrum. Mr. B URTON . Representative Doyle, you indicated that there were 170,000 children in Pennsylvania who are autistic? Mr. D OYLE . Mr. Chairman, 73,686. Mr. B URTON . And you said that it cost $50,000 a year to take care of those people that are autistic. I guess the one thing I would like to point out to anyone from CDC or health agencies, or anyone connected with our Govern-ment \u2014let's just say we reduce that $50,000 to half and we only had to spend $25,000 per person for the rest of their life to dealwith their autistic problems. If 1 in 250 or 1 in 500 people are au-tistic, you are talking about so much money that we cannot affordit. We are going to have people walking around that are going tobe lost and will be causing all kinds of problems for our entire soci-ety. It could cause tragic consequences for the entire country. So there has to be more research done to find the causes and if possible to find ways to minimize the damage done to these peopleso they can be productive members of society. I am very happy for both of you being here and for you sponsor- ing and supporting and starting the Autism Caucus. I am veryhappy to be a partner with you on that. Anything I can do to helpyou get more money for this research, just holler. We will be gladto do it. With that, Mr. Horn.Mr. Clay.Doctor. VerDate for any of our panelists?If not, thank you both for being here. I look forward to working with both of you. I appreciate it. Our next panel is Dr. James Bradstreet, who will be introduced by Congressman Weldon; Dr. Cindy Kay Schneider, of SouthwestAutism Research Center in Arizona; Dr. Jeff Segal of Greensboro,NC, formerly of Terre Haute, IN; and Dr. Sharon G. Humiston, ofPlattsburgh, NY. Would you all stand, please?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . We want to try to confine the remarks. I know you have prepared statements that are much longer than 5 minutes.But if you would, I would like you to stick as close to the 5-minutelimit as possible because we have 14 witnesses today and we wantto have time for questions. Let me start with Dr. Bradstreet.Dr. Weldon, do you want to introduce him?Mr. W ELDON . Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a real pleasure and honor for me to be able to welcome and introduce my good friend and colleague \u2014that is, medical col- league \u2014from the Melbourne-Palm Bay area, Dr. Jeff Bradstreet. Dr. Bradstreet is well known to the community I live in, both as a practicing family physician and also for a radio program that wascarried nationwide, the Good News Doctor. He is a fellow of theAmerican Academy of Family Physicians. With the development ofautism in his son, he has emerged as one of the leading practition-ers in treatments of autism and currently receives referrals fromthroughout the country from parents who have been devastated bythis disease. It is a real pleasure for me to be able to welcome you, and I am looking forward to your testimony as well as that of all the otherwitnesses we have today. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Weldon. Dr. Bradstreet. STATEMENTS OF JAMES J. BRADSTREET, M.D. FAAFP; CINDY KAY SCHNEIDER, M.D. FACOG; JEFF SEGAL, M.D.; AND SHAR-ON G. HUMISTON, M.D. Dr. B RADSTREET . As a minor introduction to myself, I had abso- lutely no interest in autism until it affected my son, at whichtime \u2014in a very short amount of time because of a complete lack of local resources \u2014I wound up having to dedicate myself full-time to this activity which, in the end, was apparently a blessing. [Slide presentation.]Dr. B RADSTREET . This is just to remind us that we cannot over- focus our attention on just the vaccine issue. There is a host of en-vironmental toxicological issues that may be interacting with thevaccine constituents to cause problems, and this U.S. News articlepoints to that. I want to point your attention to this, which is from the Novem- ber 17, 2000 Oregonian. There are now over 3,000 children in Or-egon \u2014I am in Florida, but I was lecturing in Oregon and meeting with researchers at the medical school. That makes a prevalence VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb in 190 students. The national average, actually, based on re- cent statistics I have been able to acquire from the Internet \u2014the reference of which are all in my written statement \u2014may be as low as 1 in 140. That is an extraordinary prevalence. I also want to point your attention to the red line, which shows the point in time that we introduce the infant HiB vaccine andshortly after that, the Hepatitis B vaccine to newborns on the firstday of life \u2014what happens to the prevalence of that disorder in Or- egon during that period of time. This is from the U.S. Census on Americans with disabilities. The blue arrow is slightly above, but that number is 1.8 percent of chil-dren under 3 being labeled as developmentally delayed \u2014which is a synonym for autism, in many cases or certainly autism spectrumdisorders. If you go to the 3 to 5-year-olds, that is 2.7 percent of children that are labelled developmentally delayed by our U.S. Government.I would tell you that is a multi-trillion-dollar problem coming thatyou are going to have to deal with, and that is a huge prevalence.That is an epidemic by anybody 's standards. This is the British Medical Journal article that is so famous or infamous in terms of supposedly refuting the incidence of autism-MMR relationship. Again, I do not want to over-focus on any oneparticular vaccine, but look at when the infant HiB was introducedinto England with that red arrow and what happened to the inci-dence at that point in time. Is there an interaction between MMRcomponents and HiB? Is there science behind that? I would tell youthat there probably is. This is from the Mayo Clinic. Briefly, thisis a 2000 article that came out in the American Journal of Gastro-enterology that said that measles virus infection is associated withinflammatory bowel disease. The IOM report states that no casesof vaccine encephalitis have ever been reported, but what aboutthis case that came out in 1999 that says that measles-inclusionencephalitis caused by the vaccine strain of measles was provenusing PCR data. In addition to that, the IOM report also states that MMR may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but concludes thatit is still safe. This is from the recent Journal of Pediatrics abouta month or so ago that shows that there is in fact markedautoimmunity in these children 's intestinal tract. This is most like- ly an autoimmune disorder in general. This is the parent 's view of what it looks like. That is what for 4 years of my son 's life I got to change about three or four times a day and my wife got to change another threeor four times a day as he had chronic diarrhea. The parents havea rather dim view of what chronic inflammatory bowel disease andautism look like. I want to let you know that it can be fixed. This is part of my Christmas card from one parent thanking me for the fact that infact it is nice to have a child with a well-formed bowel movement.And that child is doing extraordinarily better now that theenterocolitis is taken care of. Autoimmunity is a process where the immune system gets con- fused and turned around and thinks that maybe the child is atfault for this. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 the insulator of the brain nervous system, is clearly a problem and there are many things that we are findingin the kids that are abnormal that are affecting melanization. Thevaccine constituents may be part of that. Just briefly, there is a host of credible science that autoimmunity and vaccines are related. We are seeing in our clinic of over 1,000children in Florida, who come to us from all over the world \u2014in fact, I will be leaving shortly to spend 2 weeks in Indonesia where,after instituting a World Health Organization vaccine program,they went from essentially no autism to an epidemic in Indonesia,as well. I have been hired to go over there for about 2 weeks towork with the government and teach doctors how to take care ofthis disorder. I am a clinician and I have to take care of kids. This is a little difficult for you to read, but it is in my report. Let me just statethat this is from the Utah State University. This is cerebral spinalfluid of a child who regressed after an MMR vaccine that showsautoantibodies to myelin basic proteins being positive as well asmeasles virus in the spinal fluid. All other variables were negative. I would conclude from that \u2014as did the physician and the re- searchers who have looked at this \u2014that in fact that is an MMR re- action in this child since there was no measles in this child 's his- tory. This just shows that it is not just Dr. Singh at the Utah State University, but myelin basic protein antibodies are prevalent andwe can find them at many different laboratories. We also know that Hepatitis B is an issue, and this shows that as early as 1985 we knew that Hepatitis B constituents had proteinpeptides that could in fact induce autoimmune encephalitis in rab-bits through molecular mimicry. These are the same proteins weare injecting into our children. We know that the French have identified a problem with demelanization following Hepatitis B vaccine. We see problemswith melanization in autism every day in our facility. This is a quickie just to show you that while there are a lot of different peptides out there, hemophilus peptides do induceautoimmunity to myelin basic protein from the Journal of Immu-nology in 1999. Exposure to mercury and other constituents will induce the same autoimmunity to brain elements, and that is a review article thathas over 174 references. Is mercury a problem? It is certainly inthe vaccines. This shows just a brief overview of the amount of mercury that is available to children through the vaccines. It is a tragedy. Thereis a lot of mercury in our environment. It should not have been inthe vaccines. This is my son 's first mercury test. That little dot on the fourth column on the left that says toxic elements is in fact a very highlevel of mercury. That is 15.7 parts per billion, which is extremelyhigh. This is his first post-provocational urine using a standardprocedure that has been developed; 24 micrograms per gram in hisurine. This is a New Jersey family \u2014for Mr. Smith. This is a heavy metal study from a child. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb with autism. That is his first post-provocational urine. It shows extraor- dinarily high levels of lead and mercury. One would conclude thatperhaps this is an environmental exposure, so I tested the entirefamily, trying to be a good doctor. Look at Mom. Mom is a nurse, Mom has had some vaccines, Mom has a lot of amalgams, but look at that. Mom 's mercury is not too bad. Maybe it is not too bad. Maybe Dad is a battery factory worker \u2014actually, Dad is an engi- neer, but let us go to Dad. Dad shows very little. He does havesome amalgams as well. How about a 4-year-old sibling that has never been vaccinated that has grown up in the same household. There is essentially nomercury in that child. That causes me, as a physician and as a cli-nician great concern. In this situation, it looks like heavy metalsare a problem. The only place I have to look \u2014the only difference between one child and the other \u2014is vaccination. Is mercury toxicity a problem in autism? That bottom line on that graph is a mercury level that is so high it could cause neuro-logical developmental disorders. The zinc level is almost at criticallevels of deficiency. Those two combinations cause problems. In summary, TH -1 and TH -2 imbalance where marked TH -2 in- sult has occurred through the vaccination program is well docu-mented from researchers at the University of California at Irvine.TH-2 causes autoimmunity as vaccine-related. We see it in our kids every day. That is basically the issue we think that thimerosal plus environ- mental mercury causes the initial TH -2 skewing and autoimmunity. Aluminum adjuvants, which are in the vaccines,adds to that infant. Infant HiB, again, is a strong TH -2 impulse agent. Newborn Hepatitis B is another TH -2 agent. All these so far have been associated with autoimmune reactions, with the excep-tion of aluminum. Pertussis is a TH -2 potent stimulator. This is an immune system within the child that is primed to react so that when MMR doescome along, we are going to see autoimmune reactions to brain andto bowel. We see it every day. This is an epidemic ofneurodevelopmental catastrophe. This is my son at the Smithsonian. That is what I think autism must feel like to children and to families. That is a T-Rex \u2014big teeth, big problem. But we do know that with love, prayer, andsound medical behavioral action, this does not have to be a catas-trophe and there is hope. The last picture is how Matthew is today. He is a happy well- adjusted child, who is much better. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Dr. Bradstreet, thank you for that very informative testimony. I will have a number of questions for you. Our next speaker will be Dr. Cindy Kay Schneider of the South- west Autism Research Center. Dr. S CHNEIDER . Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Dr. Cindy Schneider. I would like to express my gratitude and that of the hundreds of families I represent to Representative Burton for his scrutiny of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb issues related to autism and his leadership in bringing these concerns to your attention. In 1995, my son Derek and daughter Devon were diagnosed with autism. After visits to several specialists and series of medicaltests, we were left with a diagnosis and nothing more. No treat-ment, no plan of action, and no hope. The following year, Dr. Ron Melmed, Denise Resnik, and I found- ed the Southwest Autism Research Center, a nonprofit organiza-tion dedicated to serving the needs of individuals with autism. Wedeveloped a questionnaire for the purpose of obtaining medical, de-velopmental, behavioral, and family histories. We began to sendlaboratory specimens to researchers around the world. This became the infrastructure of a data base which now con- tains information on approximately 500 children with autistic spec-trum disorders, their siblings, and 200 unrelated controls. Many ofthese children have undergone extensive psychological testingthrough our center and hundreds have participated in clinical re-search trials. In this very limited time, I would like to share withyou the highlights of our findings. We looked first at patterns of development; 60 percent of children in our data base spoke their first word prior to 18 months of age,indicating that early language development was usually intact. Themajority of children acquired motor skills at the expected age aswell. Because my children experienced a distinct loss of language and deterioration in health after their first year of life, I looked for thispattern in other children. When asked if their child had a normalor near-normal period of development followed by regression, near-ly 80 percent of parents told us yes. The most frequent age of regression was between 13 and 18 months. Consider the possible explanations for this deterioration.These might include a metabolic defect which over time results inneurological damage in a previously healthy child. Exposure to tox-ins in the environment could do the same. Infections, either natu-rally occurring or acquired through vaccination, must also be con-sidered. For the past 3 years, we have collaborated with researchers in Rome on a genetic screening project. Antonio Persico and FlavioKeller have conducted detailed evaluations of 184 families in Italyand the United States, including 44 of our children at SARC. Inves-tigation of four candidate autism genes revealed that three havelittle effect on a child 's risk of developing autism. The fourth gene is related to reelin, a protein critical in early brain development. In the Italian population, carrying a variant of this gene more than doubled an individual 's probability of having autism. In the American subjects, the risk of autism associated with the inherit-ance of this allele is 19 times the usual risk; 20 percent of individ-uals with autistic spectrum disorders carry this gene. The inherit-ance of the long allele of this gene results in a lower production ofreelin. Interestingly, viral infection further reduces reelin produc-tion and may explain frequent reports of children 's deterioration into autism following illness or vaccination. Other research at SARC has focused on the health problems as- sociated with autism. Of the 500 families interviewed, 48 percent VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb children have a history of chronic diarrhea, chronic constipation, or alternating gastrointestinal symptoms. Theincreased incidence of bowel disease in individuals with autism hasbeen confirmed by multiple investigators over the past 4 decades,yet has been largely dismissed by the physicians caring for thesechildren. Our interest in the gut-brain connection intensified in 1997 when we learned of several children with autism who experienced re-markable improvement following the administration of a gastro-intestinal hormone called secretin. In 1998, we initiated the first clinical trial of the safety and effi- cacy of synthetic human secretin in the treatment of autism; 30children were enrolled in this phase one study. Improvements werenoted in language, social awareness and interaction, sleep pattern,and gastrointestinal but were not captured on standardized psycho-logical and language tests. We saw that some children benefitedfrom this treatment, yet the study of this heterogeneous groupfailed to demonstrate this benefit. Over the past year, we have collaborated with Repligen Corp. and four other sites across the country in the first phase two clini-cal trial ever performed in the treatment of autism. There were 126children who completed this double-blind, placebo-controlled study.Each child received three doses of either synthetic human secretinor placebo at 3-week intervals. Unlike previous secretin studies, enrollment was restricted to children between the ages of 3 and 6 who met strict inclusion cri-teria. These criteria included a diagnosis of childhood autism, amoderate to severe level of impairment, little or no language, andsignificant gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition to formal psycho-logical testing, we asked parents to report their children 's status at the completion of the study using a clinical global impression scale. Treatment with three doses of secretin produced a significant de- crease in the symptoms of autism in 42 percent of children, while27 percent in the placebo group improved. Further data analysis isunderway and will take several months to complete, but early find-ings indicate a biochemical market which may predict secretin re-sponse. Additional research planned at the Southwest Autism Research Center includes expansion of our current data base through recruit-ment of additional families and extensive medical and behavioralassessments of these children. Genetic testing for candidate autismgenes and screening for several metabolic defects will be per-formed. An associated research priority will be the establishment of a sib- ling screening clinic in which younger siblings of children diag-nosed with autism will undergo the same testing. The recurrencerate of autism is approximately 5 percent, meaning that parents ofa child with autism have a 5 percent change of having another af-fected child. Siblings age zero to 3, the age of onset for autism, willbe evaluated every 3 to 6 months. In this way, identification of riskfactors will facilitate diagnosis and treatment at the earliest pos-sible age. This program will also allow prospective data collectionrelated to the natural history of autism, its associated biochemicaldistinction, and the role of suspected environmental variables. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb of these programs on a national level could allow the genetic environmental variables responsible for the devel-opment of autism to be identified in the foreseeable future. I thank you for your attention to this subject and look forward to participating in the materialization of this vision. [The prepared statement of Dr. Schneider follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Dr. Schneider, Dr. Bradstreet, and the others. Do we have copies of your studies? I would like to have as much documentation from all of you as we can get because we are goingto have the people from HHS and FDA here. I want to submit yourstudies to them \u2014along with Dr. Wakefield 's and others \u2014and ask them to give us an evaluation of those studies based on their reportand their research. In other words, I want to get a comparison. They are saying one thing and you guys are telling us something else. Dr. Segal, welcome. It is nice to have a Hoosier here \u2014although we love you guys, too. Dr. S EGAL . I was born in South Bend, by the way. Mr. B URTON . Once a Hoosier, always a Hoosier. [Laughter.] Dr. S EGAL . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak. In October 1999, I became a member of a club I never wanted to join. My son was given a diagnosis of regressive autism. I am the father of 4-year-old twins, a boy, Joshua, and a girl, Jor- dan. I practiced as a neurosurgeon. My son developed normally andhit all of his milestones. He was jolly, sweet-natured, and verybright. Before his second birthday, he started losing the languagehe had acquired. He became hyperactive and inattentive to thepoint that I though he was deaf. By the time a physician confirmed the diagnosis, my wife, Shel- ley, and I already knew. We were devastated. I investigated treatment options. The first treatment consisted of occupational therapy to address his sensory issues. The other earlyintervention that we chose was called ABA, or applied behavioralanalysis. ABA breaks down everyday actions into discrete steps.The training is delivered as one-on-one therapy and involves 40hours of work a week. It is expensive, exhaustive, and extremelytime-consuming. Most families we spoke with were on waiting listsfor ABA treatment. As time was our enemy, we moved to NorthCarolina. I quit my practice and devoted my time to investigatingbiomedical options. At this point, I am pursuing three main projects. First, help my son. If I can help him, I can help others. Next, I am researchingtoxicologic causes and treatments as it relates to autism. I amdoing this in concert with the Department of Physiology at WakeForest School of Medicine. Finally, I am exploring pharmaceuticaloptions. I dug deep into my right pocket and started a drug com-pany based on medications that are likely to be relevant to helpingthose with autism. At the same time, it turns out it is probably rel-evant to treating Parkinson 's, schizophrenia, and other illnesses. I have a few observations I would like to make.The number of children with autism or related disorders is ris- ing. Do not take my word for it and do not ask physicians. We needto ask teachers. These kids are filling regular and special educationclassrooms to over-capacity. We have heard the argument that the number of kids with au- tism is static and that doctors are just better diagnosticians. I havetwo points. Where are the autistic adults who were never diag-nosed 20 years ago? Surely they have to be somewhere. Also, physi- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 time than ever truly talking with patients and families. More diagnoses are made by tests and machines. No lab-oratory test exists for autism. The diagnosis is based strictly onclinical examination. Finally, the average time between onset of au-tistic symptoms and diagnosis is still years. We are not better diag-nosticians. The California Department of Developmental Services is adding one new child with full-blown autism every 3 hours. Estimatesvary, but we are looking at approximately $2 million to raise anautistic child to age 21. The number of physicians who have a deep understanding of au- tism treatment is small. These doctors are overworked and it takesmonths to get an appointment. Many of these doctors have affectedchildren of their own. Since autism is a systemic condition that in-volves that GI tract, immunologic system, and central nervous sys-tem, it requires expertise by multiple specialists. Finding all thespecialists who have an interest in treating autism can be adaunting task. The statistics quoted by academicians are at odds with reports by parents. For example, the standard autism literature does noteven recognize a general connection with the GI tract and autism.However, families report that up to 80 percent of their childrenhave GI problems. Standard literature suggests that only 20 per-cent of autistic children regress, that is, they develop normallyuntil age 2 and then become autistic. The majority of parents thatwe see report that their children fall into the regressive or acquiredcategory. Andrew Wakefield has theorized about a connection between GI problems and autism. His work suggests that the measles virusfrom vaccines might persist in GI tissue. This association mightalso have a causal role in autism. This work urgently needs replica-tion, yet many gastroenterologists conveniently dismiss his workrather than test his theory. Incidentally, it would not be difficultto validate or refute his hypothesis. Eighty percent of autistic children have abnormal EEG activity in brain areas associated with speech. It is believed that these ab-normalities might contribute to language deficits. Correct diagnosisrequires at a minimum an overnight EEG. Most kids are given a1-hour EEG, informed that it is normal, and never properly treat-ed. Not infrequently, the EEG is normal, and a more sensitive testcalled the MEG is abnormal. MEG is located in only a handful ofcities and is quite expensive. Insurance companies do not readilypay for this test. Once correctly diagnosed, children may be givenanti-seizure medication, which can help. Speaking of insurance companies, they do not readily pay for much of anything that is autism-related. Laboratory tests are paidout-of-pocket by parents and most research is being borne at theparent 's expense. ABA treatment is extremely expensive. It works for about half of the children. Costs are approximately $30,000 to $70,000 a year.The parents will frequently turn to school districts to make thesetreatments available. Where one lives determines the type of treat-ment one receives. It is not uncommon for the school district to liti-gate against parents so they will not have to provide that service. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb children in large classrooms. This effec- tively warehouses the child and minimizes potential for futuregain. Waiting lists for services are all too common. I could spend a lot of time talking about the need for toxins re- search, but I would like to touch on this for just a second. The Centers for Disease Control recently reported that 1 in 10 women of childbearing age in the United States are at risk of hav-ing newborns with neurological problems due to mercury exposure.Until recently, vaccines had thimerosal as a preservative. Thimero-sal is a preservative that contains organic mercury. Organic mercury is widely recognized as a neurotoxin. In one study, lower or scores neurologic function tests were found yearslater in children who had been exposed prenatally to intermittentdoses of methyl mercury. These doses happened to be from dietaryexposure at levels that had been previously thought to be safe. The vaccine manufacturers, to their credit, have stopped making new vaccines with mercury as a preservative. But many of thesevials still sit on doctors ' shelves. Also, RhoGAM is given to RH neg- ative mothers and this medication still has thimerosal. As an anecdote, I spoke with two fertility doctors. They were not aware of the mercury issue. They were livid that this type of medi-cation had a preservative that had ''cleared '' safety tests and was being given to a pregnant woman. With more vaccines being recommended to an already-full vac- cine schedule, and many vaccines administered earlier in life, thepotential for mercury toxicity in children is quite real. The symp-toms of mercury poisoning and autism are quite similar. I recently analyzed 250 hair samples and found that 30 percent of these children had tested two standard deviations above themean for various metals: aluminum, arsenic, and antimony. Theseagents are ubiquitous in the environment. It is my belief that au-tistic children may not be able to clear these toxins from their bod-ies. Chelation treatment is one way to remove metal toxins from the body. It uses compounds that have a propensity to grab metal tox-ins. There are many unanswered questions regarding chelation. Isay that historically the reputation for chelation is quite poor. AndI say this as a physician who had never previously entertained theidea of chelation for any chronic condition. It is extraordinarily dif-ficult for a practitioner to get funding to study chelation. It is justas difficult to get doctors to consider it as a viable treatment. My scientific work is focused on analyzing genes and proteins that detoxify heavy metals in autistic children. My hypothesis isthat some children are genetically predisposed to the inability todetoxify the metals to which they are exposed to in the environ-ment. These metals may come from vaccines, food, or the environ-ment. The major detox pathway for heavy metals ismetallothionein or MT. I am researching whether or not these chil-dren have defective MT genes or if they are unable to make appro- priate amounts of this protein in response to the insult. This couldexplain why not all children exposed to the same environmental in-sult develop autism. I will close, knowing I am well over the time. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb abundant funding for research, particu- larly treatment. We need to fund fellowships to increase the num-ber of skilled doctors who are treating autism. We need to main-stream autism as it relates to insurance payments. It is a biologicalcondition and should not be constrained by policy limits on mentalhealth coverage. We need to standardize payments for ABA treatment across the country. It is unfair that some families are on waiting lists for 2years to access coverage. We need to get the vials of thimerosal-containing vaccines off the shelves through recall. Mr. B URTON . Amen. Dr. S EGAL . We have adequate stocks of vaccine. It is not a prob- lem at this point. We need to clear the shelves. And doctors do notknow what is sitting on their shelves. We also need to remove thi-merosal from RhoGAM. We need to seriously test the hypothesis that vaccines are not al- ways as safe as is currently believed. In addition, combinations ofvaccines have potential risks that have never been explored. Iclearly understand the public health import of diseases we are pre-venting, but we need prospective studies. Finally, licensing boards need to be less heavy-handed to doctors offering off-label treatment to families that are desperate for treat-ment. Off-label use of medications is common in all fields of medi-cine. The standard by which these physicians should be judged isrisk versus benefit. Thank you for your time.[The prepared statement of Dr. Segal follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Before we go to the next witness, let me tell you that every Congressman who got a flu shot from the Capitol Hillphysician \u2014they do not know this \u2014but they all had thimerosal in- jected into their bodies. They all had mercury put into their bodies.I got the shot and afterwards I looked at the insert and found that. There are a lot of people who believe \u2014like you do \u2014that a num- ber of senior diseases, like Alzheimer 's, could be contributed to by us having injections of mercury. And nasal sprays the doctor gaveme, the preservative was thimerosal. So we are getting mercury inall kinds of things, not just for children, but for adults as well. So to my colleagues, if you had a vaccination for flu \u2014and I went over to see the doctor, who is a wonderful doctor and a good friend,and he did not know it was in there. Dr. S EGAL . And it is followed with a tuna fish sandwich, to boot. [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . Now, do not start telling me I cannot eat tuna fish. [Laughter.] Dr. Humiston.Dr. H UMISTON . Thank you for inviting me to speak on behalf of my son, Quinn. I wish you could meet Quinn. He has big eyes as brown as choco- late, and when he grins, you see those two big front teeth. He hasthe smooth, lean, muscular limbs of a child for whom movement isperpetual. You would never guess when he is sleeping that withthat perfectly handsome face and that perfect 8-year-old body thatQuinn has almost no language, that Quinn will bite and claw peo-ple in fits of aggression, which at times, appear as spontaneous anduncontrollable as a seizure, and that Quinn, on a bad night, canget along on as little as 3 hours of sleep. You think you have all the answers until you become a parent. I did not even know all the questions. The main question my hus-band and I have had to address is, what are we going to do nowto help? We initially decided to use behavior analytic treatment, an edu- cational technique derived from research on operant condition. Aone-on-one therapist gives the child short and clear instructions fora desired behavior. For example, Say ''Hi.'' A correct response gets an immediate reward. For example, the therapist smiles and says,''Great job. '' An incorrect response may be ignored or may trigger the therapist to prompt the child. As recommended, Quinn received40 hours each week of one-on-one therapy. Studies at UCLA hadshown that many children had significant improvement with thistechnique and replications at three other sites confirmed their find-ings. When I say this, it sounds so rational. We were faced with this devastating diagnosis and we went through the literature andtalked to every expert we could find. We found an intervention onwhich there was encouraging evidence, so we threw ourselves, dayand night, into getting and keeping the therapy in place. I assure you that it did not feel rational at the time. I had the panic-strick-en urgency of a person staring down the barrel of a gun. My son 's brain development, I believed, depended on me finding the righttherapy in time before we was too old to be helped. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb mercury experts at the University of Rochester have advised us not to get chelation therapy for Quinn. I was told thatchelation is not recommended even for acute mercury poisoning.Brain damage done by mercury poisoning is irreversible. You donot see improvement after chelation. Finally, I was told that thesafety of this intervention is not known. My husband and I have tried other interventions: a phenol-free diet, a gluten-free and casein-free diet, medications includingRitalin and Prozac, and cranio-sacral massage. We tried to get se-cretin and found a place where we could get a dose or two for$10,000, but by then evidence was accumulating that it was not ef-fective. There have been more questions. Because I am a pediatrician, and particularly because I used to work for the CDC National Im-munization Program, many people have asked me if MMR causesautism. As you are well aware, two exhaustive independent reviewshave become available on that topic. The American Academy of Pe-diatrics, of which I am a fellow, has made a summary of their re-view available to all pediatricians. They report that the availableevidence does not support the hypothesis that MMR vaccine causesautism or associated disorders. Separate administration of measles,mumps, and rubella vaccines to children provide no benefit overadministration of the combination MMR vaccine and would resultin delayed or missed immunizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics is dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of children. The AAP has proven itself to beabsolutely dedicated to vaccine safety. They quickly withdrew theirrecommendation for rotavirus vaccine at the first sign of a problemand recommended the move away from thimerosal-containing vac-cines even during the information-gathering period. These actions have given me added assurance of their open- mindedness regarding the MMR-autism hypothesis and have addedweight to their findings. Similarly, the Institute of Medicine, the supreme court of medi- cine, convened the Immunization Safety Review Committee to ad-dress this issue, and they found ''that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship at the population level between MMR vac-cine and ASD. '' The committee felt that the relationship been MMR and autism would be extremely rare, if it occurred at all. The next question is about thimerosal. And we all look forward to IOM 's review of this topic. I am aware of an interesting recently published report from the University of Rochester that shows thatnone of the blood mercury levels observed in full-term infants stud-ied shortly after vaccination exceeded the most recently revisedlowest level of maternal blood mercury considered to represent po-tentially significant exposure to the developing fetus. So what are we going to do now to help? Despite intensive ther- apy, my son has not been helped dramatically. And that is why Iam here today. I am absolutely certain that we need more research.I am pleased that IOM was asked to review the question of MMRand autism, and I am pleased that they will review the thimerosalquestion. I am pleased that NIH is proceeding with the scientificevaluation of alternative and complementary medicine. I am de-lighted with the progress made by the collaborative programs of ex- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 trust that funding is assured for the fu- ture. I am excited by the creation of the congressional Coalition for Autism Research and Education and most especially by the Chil-dren 's Health Act of 2000. I am encouraged to hear that the CDC has created a new Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Dis-abilities. All this activity is especially heart-warming for a parentbecause autism research has been significantly neglected up tonow. We need good autism epidemiology in the United States to deter- mine risk factors and true rates. We need basic science researchinto the nature and causes of this disorder. And we need clinicalresearch to determine what works and what does not, what is safeand what is not. As we all know, appropriations are the key. A financial invest- ment now could, in maybe just a few years, prevent another motherfrom having to face the questions I have had to face. There is amotto: ''You can have it fast, good, or cheap, pick two. '' In autism, research, we cannot afford to go slowly or have poor quality. Thatis why parents want Congress to fund high-quality research at thehigh level it deserves given the disorder 's frequency, its devasta- tion, and notable past neglect. And we need significant research funding that comes with a com- mitment to the long term. Scientists are poised on the brink of suc-cess, but it may not come tomorrow. Like the families of autisticpeople, Congress has to be in this for the long haul. How should the autism research agenda be set? Foremost, sci- entists should be encouraged to follow the cues of epidemiology andbasic research. Listen to parents carefully, but do not neglect to fol-low through based on the leads from science. Autistic families need better services \u2014educational services for the autistic individuals, parent training for handling autistic off-spring through their lifetime, and respite services that are so es-sential in coping. Finally, parents need to see residential care fa-cilities in place that will help with the question my other childasked me, what is going to happen to Quinn when you and Daddydie? The question for this committee and all of us is the same as the initial question my family faced, what are we going to do now tohelp? [The prepared statement of Dr. Let me just say that I admire your view, Doctor, that the health agencies are doing a good job. And I think for themost part they are, but I would like to bring to your attention thatthe rotavirus vaccine \u2014the advisory committee that recommended that\u2014was kind of split. Some of the people thought there should be more testing done on the rotavirus vaccine. But the chairmanof the committee had financial interests in the company that manu-factured a rotavirus vaccine. Dr. H UMISTON . The chairman was John Motley, who had no con- flicts of interest at all. Mr. B URTON . Let me just tell you that we have already checked. We looked at the financial disclosure forms. The chairman \u2014\u2014 Dr. H UMISTON . It could not have been the Chair. He has no \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, there were a number of people on there who had financial interests in the rotavirus vaccine. And that vaccinewas put on the market. Within a year, we had one child die anda number of them had serious problems. We are looking at andhave found some financial conflicts of interest among other peoplewho are in the decisionmaking process. That is one of the reasons why many people in Congress are very concerned about things like the report we just received. And thatreport was not categorically saying that the MMR vaccine was nota cause of autism. It did not conclude that, if you read the wholereport. Let me just ask a couple of questions here.First of all, does the MMR vaccine, when it is being produced, does it include in any way in the production mercury? Do any ofyou know that? Dr. H UMISTON . It does not. MMR does not contain thimerosal. It contains no preservative because it is a live vaccine. Mr. B URTON . I am asking in the manufacture of it because in the manufacture, we have been told \u2014and I do not know that it is true\u2014there was mercury in some of the production of the vaccine. But you are saying that categorically, that is not \u2014\u2014 Dr. H UMISTON . No, because it is a live vaccine. The live vaccines do not need preservatives. Dr. S EGAL . I would say that we do not know. I would say also that in the manufacture of the drug we are working on, there ismercury in the process and we take pains to remove it at the end.We think that it is all out. But I think the answer to your question is that we do not know. I do not know that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But there is mercury used in the process? Dr. S EGAL . I do not know. I do not think anyone here knows. Mr. B URTON . We want to check on that and find out about that. Mr. Bradstreet, are you stating that the combination of the thi- merosal-containing vaccine with the MMR vaccine causesneurologic, immune, and GI problems in susceptible children? Dr. B RADSTREET . I think that would be incomplete, but I am say- ing that in part. I think there are a number of environmental factors that are skewing the child 's immune system toward a predilection along the autoimmune lines. I think that thimerosal is one of those issues.The aluminum adjuvants is another issue. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I discussed \u2014the Hepatitis B vaccine and HiB\u2014also are capable, as is pertussis \u2014of pushing that TH -2 re- sponse so that by the time we get to the 15-month level or so andwe give the MMR vaccine, it is the next TH -2 potential responding vaccine that the kids get. For some of the kids, it is just too much. However, I have a number of kids who, immediately after the Hepatitis B vaccine \u2014within days \u2014seem abnormal and never re- cover and evolve autistic-like symptoms. I have heard the samething after pertussis. So it is not just MMR by any means, but there is a significant number \u2014perhaps half of our families \u2014who now claim they had a perfectly healthy child and within days \u201410, 14 days, whatever \u2014 their child was completely changed following the vaccine schedule. That, in and of itself, is not conclusive. But it certainly causes one to look very, very hard at that subject. Epidemiology, in andof itself, is not going to give us that answer. Mr. B URTON . You talked about the mercury. That was in the Hepatitis B vaccine as well? Dr. B RADSTREET . Yes, as well as in the HiB vaccines. Almost all the HiB vaccines have mercury in them as well. So those are mul-tiple sources for mercury. Mr. B URTON . That is exactly what happened with my grandson, within days after his. Dr. Bradstreet, are you seeing improvements with the treating of children to remove mercury? Do these children appear to be morevulnerable to other toxic metals? Dr. B RADSTREET . I think that something \u2014and I am not sure what it is at this point in time \u2014has wounded the body 's normal and natural metallic defense. We have a system in the body de-signed to prevent environmental toxins like mercury and lead andother things from being toxins within the body. Many things pro-tect the body. However, for whatever reason, certain children seemto be unusually vulnerable to that. There is abundant data now available that individual variability at the time of the mercury exposure to thimerosal \u2014we do not know how susceptible that child is. We do not know what other sourcesof mercury he has had, whether it was RhoGAM or diet or environ-ment. We do not know how much he is going to get. And we do notknow the status of his ability to defend against that mercury. Wekind of cavalierly give it assuming that because it is below somesort of EPA threshold \u2014although, with the combination of the mul- tiple vaccines that is not true \u2014that it is going to be safe. I think that there is something about certain children that makes them very vulnerable to mercury. Mr. B URTON . I have some more questions. Mr. Horn.Mr. H ORN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Segal, I believe you mentioned RhoGAM, and the content of thimerosal. Dr. S EGAL . That is accurate, yes. Mr. H ORN. What would be the behavioral changes if one used that consistently? Dr. S EGAL . I am not sure I understand that question, but let me take a stab at it. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb be given to RH nega- tive mothers to prevent a reaction with children in terms of attack-ing their blood cells. Thimerosal is used as a preservative. It is given to the women \u2014 at this point \u2014while they are still pregnant. The mercury preserva- tive would be able to cross through the placenta and get into thedeveloping infant. The theory would be that it would harm the de-veloping fetus, at which point you would see neurodevelopmentalabnormalities. Mercury is an accumulative problem. That is, as you continue to be exposed to mercury, the body struggles with trying to remove it.When it builds up to some critical level, which cannot be predictedin the individual child, we have the potential to seeneurodevelopmental problems. Mr. H ORN. So this is nothing to do with Rogaine, which relates to hair, and so forth? [Laughter.] Dr. S EGAL . Not to my knowledge. Mr. H ORN. You have 2 million people across America who will wonder. Dr. S EGAL . I think they can rest comfortably. [Laughter.] Mr. H ORN. Dr. Segal, do you think the genetic component of this problem may be the inability to these children to clear toxins andmetals from their bodies? Dr. S EGAL . I think that is the first step. I think there are mul- tiple problems that are individually necessary but not sufficient. Ithink the first step is a genetic predisposition. I think that pre-disposition relates to the ability to detoxify against environmentalinsults. Mr. H ORN. Do you agree with the comparison of the symptoms of autism and the symptoms of mercury toxicity as similar? Do yousee that? Dr. S EGAL . I think the parallels are astounding, yes. Mr. H ORN. And that has been a lot of your research? Dr. S EGAL . That is correct. Mr. H ORN. So you are speaking from scientific research? Dr. S EGAL . That is accurate, yes. Mr. H ORN. Thank you very much for your testimony. I was very interested in it. Dr. Schneider, are you seeing children with increased toxicity to other substances, such as arsenic? Dr. S CHNEIDER . Absolutely. My own children have high levels of arsenic. After some research, I learned that is because I live in theState of Arizona where mining has been and still is occurring andour water supply comes from Colorado where the same can be said.Gold is mined with cyanide. Copper is minded with arsenic. It isso prevalent in the Phoenix water that no one is using Phoenixwater. We have to get our water from Colorado, which really is notmuch better. I have a reverse osmosis system in my household, and I mistak- enly thought that removed heavy metals. I found recently that wasnot correct. I had to pay $5,000 to put in a water system which didremove arsenic and mercury from our water supply. Mr. H ORN. That is the Phoenix water system? Dr. S CHNEIDER . Yes. VerDate see that throughout Arizona? Dr. S CHNEIDER . I have not looked throughout Arizona, but cer- tainly there are metal-toxic children throughout Arizona. Mr. H ORN. We see the same thing in Los Angeles where we have had various types of industries, small and large, where the metalsjust get into the underground water supply. That has become amajor problem. I know EPA has studied this. What studies haveyou seen that lead to a different \u2014arsenic as it goes around \u2014some say you cannot deal with it because it is in this or that. I just won-der what kind of research you have seen where it is clear that itis hurting people substantially. Dr. S CHNEIDER . Quite honestly, I do not do that kind of research and I am not as familiar with it as I intend to be because I wasfocusing more on the mercury aspect. But I find now that mercuryis not our only problem. We are exposing our population to manytoxic metals. Mr. H ORN. We understand that typically children with autism are first diagnosed by a developmental specialist or psychiatristand that the physical problems with these children are not ad-dressed. What do you think must be done to ensure that these children receive appropriate medical care? Dr. S CHNEIDER . At our research center, we have initiated a phy- sician outreach program, which is now in the stages of developingeducational material for physicians, planning conferences for physi-cian education. The reality is that most parents diagnose their chil-dren and then go to their pediatrician who tells them that they donot think so. Then they go back again and eventually get referredto the proper specialist and have the diagnosis confirmed. In my own case, our pediatrician is a dear friend of mine and I have the greatest respect for him, but he did not know autismwhen he saw it. And that is very, very typical. We need to changethat because, as many of us know, the earlier the child is diag-nosed and the earlier the intervention is begun, the better thechild 's chances of having a partial recovery. My own children are 8 12and 912years old now. I would say the clock is ticking. Mr. H ORN. In some of Chairman Burton's earlier hearings, we found there were a lot of medical journals of which there are prob-ably a couple hundred\u2014I have seen them in our library in LongBeach\u2014that have glowing reports of this or that and they do notreally tell you the effects on it. Do you have some feelings that thevarious professional groups and segments of this and that special-ist, and some of their yearly meetings\u2014they ought to have meet-ings that relate autism to all of the things that they might not\u2014they go through medical school and there is great ignorance therein many ways, just like nutrition was, which was a simple thing.Doctors ought to know something about nutrition. Well, doctorsought to know something about this. Now, how do we communicate with them where they read it, and they see it, and it means something? Dr. S CHNEIDER . You are absolutely right because the reality is that pediatricians or family practitioners were not educated in thearea of autism. Their image of autism is a child rocking and bang- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 head on the wall. Many of our children do not do that, thank goodness, yet still have autism. So the physician outreach is a very important project for us. But what we realized when we spoke to the residency programs in ourcity is that pediatricians in training right now \u2014a pediatrician has 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, and 3 years of resi-dency \u2014in that training process, they talk about developmental dis- abilities for about 1 month, and autism is only one portion of theirfocus. So there really is very little exposure to this area. If you think about what happens in terms of medical education after training, it is primarily in the form of conferences. I am sorryto say that most conferences are sponsored wholly or in part bypharmaceutical companies. The message they want to get acrosshas much to do with treatment of the condition for which they havea drug. So you have to understand that it is up to the physician to edu- cate himself or herself after training and to take into account thesources of the information they are receiving. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Horn. Mr. H ORN. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I will tell you my son-in-law is a doctor. And many doctors pretty much take at face value the recommendations andthe research done by the CDC and the FDA. I can tell you thateven here on Capitol Hill \u2014like I was talking about the vaccine we get for the flu \u2014I do not think any doctors up here even knew that there was mercury or thimerosal in it. Mr. Blagojevich.Mr. B LAGOJEVICH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Humiston, our staff has just checked with Merck, the only li- censed manufacturer of the MMR vaccine. The staff was told \u2014and perhaps you can confirm this \u2014that there is no mercury in that vaccine. Is that consistent with your understanding? Dr. H UMISTON . Yes. My understanding is that there is no mer- cury and there is no mercury in the process of making it. It is thi-merosal-free, as opposed to the vaccines that have mercury in theprocess but not actually in the vaccine. Mr. B LAGOJEVICH . Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . We will check on that. Dr. Weldon.Mr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question for Dr. Bradstreet.You have been doing a lot of research \u2014and really any of you can comment on this \u2014and you have talked to a lot of researchers. Have you encountered any lack of willingness or intimidation to re-search in areas that might suggest that there are problems withvaccines in terms of its impact on the careers of researchers ortheir ability to get funding in the future? Have you encounteredany comments to that effect? Dr. B RADSTREET . Yes. Actually, we work with researchers at sev- eral major university medical schools around the country. Many ofthem or their department chairmen have related back to us thatthere is significant fear and apprehension about doing a study thatlooks into vaccine safety for fear of being blacklisted by the phar- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 future funding of research. Many pediatric departments or infectious disease or immunology departmentsaround the country at medical schools are completely dependent fora vast majority of their research budget and operating expenses ongranting from the vaccine manufacturing companies. Many of thosevaccine manufacturers make a host of different drugs. If you look then at the potential liability issue \u2014determining for example that thimerosal may be harmful to children \u2014what that means from a liability perspective, a beginning of life neurologicallydamaged child that has a life expectancy similar to yours or mine,70 or 80 years of care \u2014that is cataclysmic. So they will go a long way to potentially suppress research along these lines. It is something that needs to be addressed and there need to be independent sources of funding completely apart from the drugcompanies. Mr. W ELDON . Have any of the other witnesses encountered com- ments to that effect? Or would you rather not comment on thisissue? Dr. S EGAL . I would rather not comment on that issue. I would say, without getting into detail, the answer is yes. We have encoun-tered that difficulty. But as we are trying to make in-roads interms of additional research projects, I feel any comment I couldmake would be fragile. Dr. H UMISTON . At the University of Rochester, because my devel- opmental pediatrician is one of the researchers for the centers ofexcellence, I am aware of what they do. They are getting fundingto look at vaccine safety issues. Mr. W ELDON . I have a question about the incidence. The incidence in boys is four times higher than the incidence in girls. The incidence in the population is estimated at being \u2014some say as high as 1 in 100 \u2014most likely 1 in 500 or somewhere in be- tween, according to a lot of researchers. But that doesn 't that mean that the incidence in boys is substantially higher? Aren 't we talk- ing about it being somewhere between 1 in 50 and 1 in 250? Dr. B RADSTREET . Just to be specific, we are talking about preva- lence, which is the amount of disease in the population of childrenor boys. Incidence would be the new cases that are coming on-lineper population on an annual basis. That is probably very high aswell, although there is much less incidence research being done ascompared to prevalence. We know that it is very prevalent. A lot of children have this. If you look at Oregon as an example \u2014and all the citations are on pages 5 through 8 of my testimony \u2014clearly Oregon is very conserv- ative. The State is run by a physician. Mr. W ELDON . If I could interrupt you for a second, the Oregon data you showed was less than 1 in 200. Is that correct? Dr. B RADSTREET . Yes, 1 in 190 in Oregon. Mr. W ELDON . What does that make it in boys? Dr. B RADSTREET . It is probably something like 1 in 50 or 1 in 70 in boys if you factor the four to one difference in occurrence ratein boys. Mr. W ELDON . Dr. Segal, you kind of made the comment as a joke, but this issue \u2014I have had CDC officials in my office talking about whether we have an epidemic or not, and they cite how the DMS - VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 changed. But you made an excellent insight. If we are just diagnosing it better, what happened to all the adults? Is anybodyresearching that or looking into that? Dr. S EGAL . If it is a question of diagnosis, the adults have to be somewhere. They did not disappear. The problem is that they arenot there. The numbers have gone up. I think that is the only con-clusion we can make. Mr. W ELDON . But nobody has done a research study looking at adults who are in institutional care, have some kind of psychiatricdisability, who were perhaps previously diagnosed as mentally re-tarded, who may have actually had autistic spectrum disorders.Nobody is looking into that, to your knowledge? Dr. S EGAL . To my knowledge, no one is. I would comment that Dr. McDougle, when he was at Yale, had a great deal of interestin adult autistic patients. So he may be able to comment on thatfurther. He will be in the third panel. Mr. W ELDON . I know I am running out of time. I just have a question for Dr. Humiston. You quoted from the IOM study that the committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship at thepopulation level between the MMR vaccine and autistic spectrumdisorder. I fully expected them to say that because if they did notsay that and it got out in the press, then parents all across Amer-ica would start rejecting the vaccine and we could have a huge ex-plosion of measles. But then they did go on to say in the next section that they did note that their conclusions did not exclude the possibility thatMMR vaccine could contribute to ASD in a small number of chil-dren because the epidemiologic evidence lacks the precision to as-sess rare occurrences. I assume you agree with that section of the report as well.Then they further went on to recommend further areas of re- search \u2014and they have several areas of research they recommend \u2014 to include to develop targeted investigation of whether or not mea-sles vaccine strain virus is present in the intestines of some chil-dren with ASD. Essentially, they are calling for what I had encouraged them to do when I testified before them, to encourage NIH to fund the du-plication of Dr. Wakefield 's and O 'Leary 's work. I assume you have seen Dr. Wakefield 's micrographs and slides of inflammatory bowel disease in these kids, and you have re-viewed Dr. O 'Leary 's PCR research showing the presence of mea- sles virus particles in the intestines of these kids. Dr. H UMISTON . I have not reviewed his micrographs. I am not a gastroenterologist. I am an emergency medicine pediatrician. Mr. W ELDON . I am an internist, but I have ended up having to get very familiar with all this. If you listen to all the press reports, they loaded up at the begin- ning of the press report that IOM says this is fine. Then they go on and \u2014at least the better coverage of what I saw of all this \u2014to say that further research is recommended. I do not want to accusethe IOM of talking out of both sides of their mouth. They were ina very, very delicate situation. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb some concerns about the way the study was passed through some of the reviewers, or some of the witnesses who havehad a track record of being critical of this work. But I think wehave a very serious issue here. You cannot refute a clinical andpathologic report with an epidemiologic study. You cannot do that.It is bad science. You have to fund an attempt to duplicate the clin-ical study and the pathologic study. Would you agree with that?Dr. H UMISTON . I am in agreement that the study should be rep- licated. I am in agreement that epidemiology alone does not refute. What IOM reviewed was not just simply two or three articles. It was many. Mr. W ELDON . I know. Dr. H UMISTON . And I did have the privilege of being in the room during the IOM report. So I was privileged to hear about changesin autistic brains of children in areas where the brain develops andis used for different things at different times. So theneuropathologist was describing how this could explain how we seeregression. There was one researcher there who showed how blood spots taken on the first day of life had different levels of vaso-active in-testinal protein present in day 1 of children with autism, differentlevels than controls. I think IOM took Dr. Wakefield 's hypothesis very seriously, as I think it deserved to be taken very seriously. I also do not think that when you say in a light way that this is what you expected of IOM \u2014I have great respect for those sci- entists. They came from many fields. And many of them did notcome from vaccines. So I think that taking that lightly is a disservice to those sci- entists and to the work of people who are moving forward with ge-netic explanations. Mr. B URTON . We have to have a vote. We have 6 minutes left on the clock. Mr. W ELDON . I just want to clarify one thing. You are accusing me of taking it lightly what they were doing. I do not like that at all. I consider this report a good report. I waspleased with the results of this report. But for them to spotlightand put the focus of public attention on the serious issues beingraised about the safety of this vaccine by Dr. Wakefield, it is goingto cause parents \u2014just like it happened in England \u2014to quit giving the vaccine. So they were in a very awkward situation, in my opin-ion. I personally believe that there is a problem with this vaccine. And there is a subset of children who have a genetic predispositionto having problems with this vaccine. But further research is need-ed. I do not want to be accused of taking their findings lightly. I con- sider this basically what they should have done. They did what wasneeded. Mr. B URTON . Let me just conclude \u2014and I hope you will come back for the third panel, Doctor, because I value your input. Let me just say to you that they did send that report out for re- view to people from various pharmaceutical companies, and there VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb as I understand it, or corrections or perfections done on that report. I want to find out what those were. Let me just ask two quick questions.Does secretin cost $10,000 for two doses? I think my grandson got secretin and I know it did not cost that. Dr. S CHNEIDER . There certainly are some practitioners who charge that much. That is absolutely true. Dr. B RADSTREET . Mr. Chairman, $200 to $300 for what used to be available is no longer available is a fairly common cost to thephysician. Relatively commonly, physicians double the price ofsomething that they buy. So if they buy a vaccine for $20, theywould like to sell it to the patient for $40. So that is an outrageousprice. Dr. S CHNEIDER . Our regular pediatrician would not give it us. We were trying to find any source. Mr. B URTON . And my other question is, can chelation remove mercury from the brain? Dr. B RADSTREET . There is no evidence of that at this point in time. Mr. B URTON . Anybody else? Dr. S EGAL . I agree. There is no evidence one way or the other. In fact, I spoke with two mercury experts. One suggests that mer-cury stays in the brain indefinitely. The other said that mercuryis cleared within 50 or 75 days. The bottom line is that nobody knows at this point.Mr. B URTON . We need some research on that point as well. Dr. S EGAL . Yes, we do. Mr. B URTON . We will dismiss this panel. Thank you very, very much. We really appreciate it. We would like to have your documentation and reports in total, if we can get those, so we can submit those to the health agencies. Thank you very much.We will be back. We will stand in recess to the fall of the gavel and go to our third panel as soon as we get back. It should beabout 10 minutes. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . We have a very large second panel. It is very, very important, though, that we cover all this territory. There will beother Members coming back from the floor in a minute. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . We will VerDate J.

GERSHON, DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMYAND CELL BIOLOGY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Dr. M CDOUGLE . Thank you very much, Chairman Burton and committee members. Thank you for the opportunity to come andspeak with you today. In addition, I would like to thank you personally for your recent efforts to assist our work in autism at the Riley Hospital for Chil-dren in Indianapolis. It is very much appreciated. I was asked to come today to talk a bit about our current clinical, educational, and research activities at the Indiana UniversitySchool of Medicine. I am currently the chairman of the Departmentof Psychiatry as well as the director of the section of child and ado-lescent psychiatry and the chief of the Autism/Pervasive Develop-mental Disorders Clinic. I have been doing research and clinical care in the area of autism for the past 12 years or so. I came to Indiana in 1997, and at thatpoint wanted to establish a formal autism clinic. At that time, wehad approximately 100 children with a diagnosis of autism andother pervasive developmental disorders in our clinic. We broughtthose children together into a formalized manner and then beganto build a clinical team. At that time, I was the only child psychiatrist on the team and we had one clinic coordinator. We soon realized \u2014once we got the word out that we had a formal clinic \u2014that we needed to expand our clinical operation significantly. We currently have an active clinic census of over 500 children. So in 3 years the census within the clinic has gone from 100 to 500.The disturbing and alarming part of that is that our waiting listsare out 9 months in advance now to bring children and families infor a new evaluation. So we have 9 months of people on the waitinglist to even begin to get in to see us. At the same time, we are stilltrying to provide good care for the 600 current families within ourclinic. In an effort to meet some of these clinical demands, we have begun to hire additional faculty. I have added another full-timechild psychiatrist, a nearly full-time behavior therapist, and a so-cial worker to work with families to provide resources and helpthem with a number of the sticky issues they face. Despite those additional clinical personnel, the waiting list per- sists. So I can certainly say firsthand that we are working veryhard in Indiana. Autism is not rare. And we are having difficultykeeping up with the pace of personnel, despite adding additionalpersonnel. One problem with providing clinical care is that the reimburse- ment for such care is very poor. It becomes an issue as to how youare going to fund additional personnel to care for the growing popu- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 when insurance reimbursement is often noth- ing or minimal. So that is an issue that I think needs to be ad-dressed to a greater degree. With regard to research, I am an expert in the area of psychopharmacology. I would say I am pretty good at diagnosingautism and related disorders and treating symptoms of autism thatcan become quite problematic. These symptoms \u2014many of which have not been mentioned yet today \u2014include aggression toward self, aggression toward others, property destruction, hyperactivityand inattention, interfering repetitive or ritualistic behavior, aswell as the core disturbance of autism, which is a disturbance inthe ability to relate appropriately to other people. And we have a number of medicines we are studying in an effort to try to reduce some of these symptoms so that the child may bebetter able to participate in non-drug treatments, to be able to sitstill and pay attention in speech therapy and other educational ac-tivities. But many times these symptoms I mentioned are so severethat the child cannot even get into a school or educational settingto benefit from these alternative treatments. I would like to thank the National Institute of Mental Health. Approximately 3 12years ago they instituted a program to develop research units on pediatric psychopharmacology. They put out anRFA specifically to develop centers focused on autism. We were for-tunate enough to be chosen as one of those centers in addition tofour others across the country. We recently completed our first study of a medication through this program with a medication called Risparidone, targeted reallyat some of the more severe symptoms of autism, including aggres-sion, self-injury, and irritability. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We entered 101 children in adolescence into thisstudy, which will make it by far and away the largest medicationstudy ever conducted in autism to date by at least half \u2014twice as large. So the idea of having multiple centers working together toget a larger sample size more quickly makes a lot of sense. I wouldlike to see the RUPP networks continue to be funded. In addition, we have begun to explore a number of what we call investigator-initiated studies. When we read the basic science lit-erature, we get ideas about medicines or compounds that might behelpful for some of the symptoms of autism. We then go and tryto generate some pilot data that if there is something to it we thenapply for Federal funding. We have initiated a number of studieswith some of those compounds. The other areas of research in autism to date that I think are hopefully going to be fruitful include those that have been success-ful in investigating disorders in other areas of medicine over time,and that includes genetics. Certainly there have been large dollarsput into the genetic research of autism to date without really sig-nificant results. What that tells us is that this is a complex disorder, that there may be multiple genes involved in autism, and my guess is thateventually we may find in fact that multiple genes might be con-tributing to just certain small populations of autistic children. Soit is going to be very difficult to pin down a gene or genes for au-tism, although clearly there is a genetic basis. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb focus most of my energy on treating people that currently have autism. That has been emphasized today, not only the needto find the cause but to treat those people we already have withautism. I would like to see more funding put into treatment \u2014not just drug treatment, but other forms of treatment \u2014for autism. The question came up earlier \u2014and Dr. Segal referred it to me \u2014 regarding adults with autism. When I began my work 12 years agoat Yale University, at the time I was not a child psychiatrist. Dueto various factors, I was not allowed to see children \u2014maybe for a good reason. But I really wanted to study autism, so I initiated aclinic for adults with autism, which was really unheard of at thetime. My colleagues looked at me strangely and said, why would you want to study adults with autism? I asked them what they thoughthappened to children when they grew up. Most people view autismas a childhood disorder. In fact, it is a childhood-onset disorder thatlasts forever. Those individuals, in fact, are out there. One of my moonlighting jobs while I was in Connecticut as a consultant to the Departmentof Mental Health \u2014and I actually went to the State hospital and the ''back wards '' where adults were hospitalized, and not infre- quently could I identify individuals that had a history consistentwith an earlier diagnosis of autism. So they are out there, often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia or other disorders. But I will say that since I have been in Indianaand am now seeing kids, the ratio of kids coming to me versusadults is highly skewed in the direction of newer onset of cases inchildren. So the adults are out there, but there are many, manymore kids and younger individuals who are being referred at thispoint. I have a sense that the numbers are increasing significantly.Again, I do not know the reason for that. Mr. B URTON . Can you sum up, Doctor, so we get to some ques- tions in just a few minutes? Dr. M CDOUGLE . Sure. I have really touched on our clinical and research efforts. The other thing I would like to highlight would be our efforts in edu-cation. That is something else that has been brought up today. Pediatricians and family practitioners are not adequately edu- cated about autism. I never heard about autism in medical schoolat all and first learned of it during my second year of psychiatricresidency. So what we are doing within our clinic is having all themedical students in fact rotate through our clinic with us so that \u2014 we are the second largest medical school in the country \u2014a large number of students are at least now seeing individuals with autismand being exposed to those treatments. I think that is important. Mr. B URTON . Very good. I think we will come back and talk with you. You are doing a good job there and I am happy to work withyou. Dr. M CDOUGLE . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Wakefield. Dr. W AKEFIELD . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a great pleasure to be back here and provide you with an update and recommenda-tions following last year 's meeting. [Slide presentation.] VerDate Let me just give you my terms of reference, and that is that we are dealing with a subset of children on the autisticspectrum. What I am going to present to you is based upon the sci-entific data. It is not fragmented. It is based upon a logical, hypoth-esis-testing framework. It is not anti-vaccine. However, it is notbased upon assumptions of safety or coincidence. It is not an iso-lated opinion. It is the opinion of a growing number of physicians,as you have heard today, and it is based on conventional methodsof listening to the patients and parents and the new-kid-on-the-block in this context is public health. Let's go to the clinical history, which I will just briefly review, and that is of normal early development, of developmental regres-sion, and the majority of parents cite the contemporaneous regres-sion of their child following MMR vaccination. There is onset of as-sociated neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. The childrenalso suffer recurrent infections. You have heard that bowel symptoms are common in autistic spectrum disorder children, particularly in the United States, be-tween 47 and 80 percent. So these findings may apply to a largeproportion of the pediatric population with autism. The GI systemare often masked by behavioral problems and if a history is nottaken by an expert in gastroenterology, then these can be missed. The question for the physician is, do these symptoms in these children reflect underlying intestinal disease? The medical profes-sion hitherto have said, no, they do not. The answer is, yes, theydo. We have now published several papers, peer-reviewed papers. The first in the Lancet in 1988 and then in the American Journalof Gastroenterology in 2000, which was met with a very favorablecommentary from the editor. And just a few weeks ago we pub-lished on the characteristics of this bowel disease in these children,comparing it with classical inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn 's Disease and enterocolitis, and normal controls, peer-reviewed andpublished data. We are presenting next week in Europe the discov-ery of not only a disease in the large intestine, but a disease in thesmall intestine as well. And you have heard a great deal about autoimmunity. The dis- ease in the intestine of these children is an autoimmune disease.There are antibodies in the blood of these children that bind to thelining of the bowel and seem to be part of an inflammatory reac-tion. The key features are of developmental regression, swelling of the lymph glands in the bowel \u2014this is consistent with a viral cause. The enterocolitis and inflammation throughout the gut is consist-ent with a viral cause. And the immunodeficiency we see in thesechildren is consistent with a viral cause. The important thing, though, Mr. Chairman, is that parents were right. The medical profession was wrong. This issue of coincidence \u2014and this is an important one \u2014a child receives the MMR vaccine in the second year of life, and this iswhen the first signs of autism are noted. Bear in mind that we aredealing with regressive autism in these children, not of classicalautism where the child is not right from the beginning. But coinci-dence is a situation you arrive at by due scientific and clinical in- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb not something that you assume from the outset. That is not good medicine; it is not bad medicine; it is nothing atall. We will gain nothing from looking at children who had a single dose. But can we gain something from looking at children who hadmore than one dose? It is very important to raise this issue becausethis came up at the Institute of Medicine 's review. Here we have a group of children, each time line representing one child, and these children received not one dose but two dosesof the MMR vaccine. What we see is that in many cases the redsquare and circle represent their contemporaneous regression intoautism and subsequent deterioration. The green square and circlerepresent their first and second exposures to the vaccine. What we see in many of these children is a double-hit phenome- non. They regress after the first dose, and then they regress fur-ther after the second dose. Let me give you an example, that is thechild with the larger icons. This child did not receive his first MMR vaccine until he was 4 years 3 months of age. This is not just recognition. He then deterio-rated into autism. Clearly, this was not even autism by definition,a disintegrative disorder. He then received his second dose at 9years of age and disintegrated catastrophically. He became inconti-nent, his feces and urine, and he lost all his residual skills. Thisis not coincidence. The reason I am concerned about this, Mr. Chairman, is that at the IOM 's review there was considerable concern and anxiety raised over these double-hit issues, these double-hit cases. The datawere requested from me to be discussed in the closed session of theIOM, such were the concerns of the committee members. However,they find little or no mention whatsoever in the IOM 's report. The IOM 's report gives one and a half pages coverage to Dr. Fombonne, who was one of the co-presenters. It was sent to himfor review subsequently so that he could make amendments. It wasnot sent to me. It was also sent for review \u2014as you pointed out \u2014 to people who have a clear conflict of interest in the vaccine arena. The reason it was not sent to me, I am certain, Mr. Chairman, is that these cases were not included. This analysis was not in-cluded. And that gives me great cause of concern. Let me read you a comment from the IOM 's report. ''However, well-documented reports of similar outcomes in response to an ini-tial exposure to a vaccine and a repeat exposure to the same vac-cine, referred to as challenge-rechallenge, would constitute strongevidence of an association. '' When we look at those, you see them. Those represent strong evidence of an association. They are wellworked-up and well-characterized cases. So the question is, is the virus present in the diseased intestine? These data were presented at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting ear-lier this year, and they were overseen by experts from the NationalInstitutes of Health. Is the virus present in the gut? Yes, it is. The viral gene and the protein are present. Where is it located? It is located in the specific cells that we would recognize if it were the cause of this disease. How much is there? It is certainly a low-level infection. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 presence of the virus with different tech- nologies? Yes. We have now applied 10 different technologies tothis. Does the presence of the virus distinguish these children with autism from controls? It is present in 93 percent of the childrenwith autism and 11 percent of controls. And can it be confirmed in independent laboratories? Bearing in mind that Professor O 'Leary 's laboratory was completely independ- ent from mine initially, these further studies are underway, andthe answer provisionally is yes. The question we have now, Mr. Chairman, is, what is doing there? We are not saying it is the cause of this regressive autism,but the question is, what is it doing there? That is the next phaseof our logical progression. What is the link between the gut and the brain? We do not know, but it certainly is biologically plausible that one exists. It may bethat it is an autoimmune process shared by the gut and the brain,or it may be that there are toxic contents of the gut that are get-ting through and hitting the brain in a situation similar to thatwhich we see in patients with chronic liver disease. Here is a child whose only treatments have been to the gut. He is an autistic child whose only treatments have been diet and con-trol of his gastrointestinal inflammation. You can see that by solelytreating the gut there is a demonstrable improvement. What about the shortcomings in epidemiology? In short, Mr. Chairman, they have tested the wrong hypothesis. My colleaguesand I have not proposed any hypothesis thus far that can be testedby epidemiology. We are still in the process of defining the param-eters of this disease. In particular, we are concerned with whatmakes a child potentially vulnerable to a subsequent adverse out-come to an MMR vaccine. What sets the child up to then respondadversely to the vaccine? What I have done is spent the last 3 years traveling the world and interviewing patients in our own clinic to try and establishfrom the clinical histories what those vulnerability factors mightbe. When we look, we see that there is a strong family history ofautoimmune disease, particularly on the mother 's side \u2014of diabetes, thyroid disease, or Crohn 's Disease, for example \u2014that the child re- ceives the vaccine in the presence of an infection or in the presenceof recent or current antibiotic use, that the child has preexistingallergies, particularly food and milk allergies, and that the child re-ceives many vaccines at the same time. These are consistent elements that have emerged in the clinical histories that I now believe may represent vulnerability factors. So let 's look at what the data show. The hypothesis that has been tested and put down to me \u2014which has nothing to do with me, whatsoever \u2014is that if this is related to MMR vaccine, then at the point of introduction of the vaccine there should have been a step-up in the numbers that should have levelled out as the vaccine up-take was saturated. Is that a reasonable hypothesis? Can we assume that the back- ground susceptibility of the pediatric population has remained con-stant? No, I do not. I do not think we can do that. What we actu-ally see is an increasing incidence. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 trend analysis for autism in the United Kingdom and California have confirmed the rise. The data are entirely consistentwith an increasing vulnerability of infants to adverse reaction to anMMR vaccine. They are certainly consistent with the clinical his-tories of affected children. And again, I am not saying that this inany way proves causation. What I am saying is that we will gaininsight into this disease from taking appropriate clinical historiesand investigating and set up our epidemiologic hypothesis basedupon that. Now we have a hypothesis that can be tested. So in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, there is a group of children whose autism is associated with developmental regression,immunological abnormalities, intestinal disease, persistence ofmeasles virus infection in the intestine, and onset following MMRvaccination. What I would recommend is that there be a high-levelstrategic meeting that is formed and a working group formed underthe American Gastroenterological Association to investigate thisspecific group of children with the aim of providing appropriate andnecessary clinical care for these children. That is an absolute priority. The medical profession has let them down very, very badly thus far. And a research strategy needs tobe defined by this group in order to understand this disease. There needs to be immediate institution of active surveillance for vaccine-related adverse events. Passive surveillance has known tohave failed. I believe that monovalent vaccines should be madeavailable. This should be an issue of parental choice. I think itshould be a priority that we identify those vulnerability factors \u2014 for example, a child who might be on antibiotics \u2014and exclude them from vaccination until they have improved. We also need a policyfor identifying and protecting susceptible children, and most impor-tantly thereafter, informed choice. It is ultimately a pro-vaccine argument, Mr. Chairman. If we have the ability with a single vaccine to prevent not only the acutedisease, but this concurrent exposure, then we have the ability toprotect children both against measles, mumps, rubella, and againstthis devastating consequence. Thank of Dr. Wakefield follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you, Dr. Wakefield. Do we have your entire report?Dr. W AKEFIELD . Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . We will submitting these reports to the health agencies of this country and we will get a response from them afterthey review the reports. Dr. Spitzer.Dr. S PITZER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask with respect that if I need to be cutoff \u2014be- cause there has been a lot of work done since I was here at thiscommittee last year \u2014that I be allowed at least to share with you what is in the future, the research that has been planned, some ofit that has been called for, and which is going to be undertaken byan intercontinental group in nine countries and three continents todeal with some of the issues because this is the first time it hasbecome public \u2014and appropriately so \u2014because 1 year ago, here in this room, I decided to commit the rest of my epidemiologic careerto exploring these issues, if nothing else, out of admiration for thefamilies. Mr. B URTON . We will allow you a little extra time. We have the other speakers. Because of time constraints, we have a little bit ofa problem. But any additional information you have, you may restassured will be put in the record and we will pass it on. Dr. S PITZER . I will go as quickly as possible, particularly on those issues that are not specifically future-oriented. The kind of research Dr. Wakefield does, with which I am famil- iar as much by the literature on an arms-length basis, is char-acteristic of laboratory and of clinical research which asks thequestion, can it happen? Epidemiology asks the question, does ithappen? And then seeks answers in that direction. The vast majority of the literature \u2014and I have looked at pretty much everything the IOM looked at in the last 15 months on epide-miology \u2014is inconclusive or uninterpretable answers. We are trying to remedy that, and I will explain why in questions or otherwise. [Slide presentation.]Dr. S PITZER . My perspectives are those of a professor of epidemi- ology and of public health medicine. I believe in immunization asthe pillar of public health, but this does not mean that each newproduct can be exonerated from very careful evaluation, not just ofeffectiveness but of safety. I have no sponsorship. The first time I have had coverage of my travel expenses was today. I work for no one. This is an initiativedone without sponsorship and as neutral as I think can be attainednormally. And I have no family members in the nuclear family orextended family with autism. That is not the motivation for my in-volvement, although that is a noble involvement. Autism is an outcome \u2014with very great respect for parents and families of children \u2014that is as serious as death. It could not be less significant if I were involved in a mortality study resulting fromMMR. The big differences are that the families of autistic childrencannot grieve. It is their love, their commitment, and their undyingoptimism that masks the severity of autism. It is very important.It is part of the reason I made a commitment to the strategy forthe future of autistic research. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 of Medicine in a sense agreed. It said the disorders are incurable, permanent diseases that result in a serious develop-mental problem in children. Incidentally, I was only able to get the executive summary. I came from overseas last night to be here. Where I was, I could notget the full report, so I can only quote the summary. If asked, Ishall do that later. I decided, having finished a review of much of the literature and the research literature on March 1st, approximately, when I sub-mitted my paper to appear this month, that one has to really worryabout autism based on the epidemiologic literature. And I will sum-marize it quickly. There is no evidence epidemiologically one wayor the other that either rules in or rules out the problem. A few days later, I was pleased to read the briefing document of Dr. Soto and his colleagues to the Institute of Medicine Committee,which reached pretty much the same conclusion \u2014differences in words and emphasis \u2014but pretty much the same. You cannot rule it in or rule it out. Yesterday or the night before last, I saw that executive sum- mary. You could interpret it the same way, but the wording andemphasis and what got to the press \u2014the public relations version, if you wish \u2014was that immunization is widely regarded as one of the world 's most effective tools for protecting the public health and the evidence favors rejection. If they are 48 -52 percent, I am 52 -48 percent. It is in the other direction. There has been no research that predicts the validity andinterpretation of Dr. Wakefield 's research, with which I have had nothing to do so far. Until that is set aside, I could not make thatstatement, although we are within percentage points, probably, ofthe verdict looking at the same literature. There is a great deal found in the report that alludes to causa- tion. In biological population science, you have to demonstrate asso-ciation before you get to causation. Normally, unless the results arevery dramatic, you have to invoke the laboratory and the clinicalscience at the same time as the population science to reach thosekinds of conclusions following criteria such as the Bradford Hill cri-teria, much as the surgeon general did with smoking of cigarettes30 years ago or so. So we have not gotten to association yet. None of the studies have gotten there, and certainly \u2014say, the Taylor Study \u2014cannot refute or confirm association, certainly not causation. That studymandated in the United Kingdom just does not prove anything. Itis a preparatory, preliminary, hypothesis-generating study, not ahypothesis-testing study. And that is where we need to go. These are the headings \u2014I will go over them very quickly, Mr. Chairman \u2014the issue of the epidemic of autism, natural history of autism \u2014I will let you read them for a minute. Speaking as an epidemiologist, there is an epidemic. It is not re- futable on the evidence that is there. I am saying it, even thoughthe great majority \u2014except for one or two studies \u2014they are all prevalence studies. A prevalence study is inexpensive and that iswhy one leans in that direction with the meek resources that aregiven for this kind of research. You need incidence to clearly dem-onstrate or refute an epidemic. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 peer-reviewed published study that did incidence \u2014 which is a case study out of the Boston Collaborative SurveillanceUnit at Boston University, based on the British data base \u2014it is an incidence study and it shows an epidemic. It is a seven-fold in-crease. In California, you reported yourself, Mr. Chairman, that there are 700 new cases \u2014which is incidence \u2014in the past 3 months. Com- pared to the same seasonally adjusted period of 3 months 7 yearsago, that is a 404 percent increase. That is an epidemic. In Ireland, just the day before yesterday, there is a three-fold in- crease in prevalence done in the last few months. And in Cam-bridge University, a study showed a 10-fold increase in prevalence.These are numbers that are not the basis upon which you questionan epidemic. We have an epidemic of autism and I assert that, asan epidemiologist, with confidence. There is a widespread assumption that the autistic symptoms typically do not emerge until the child 's second year, about the same time that MMR is first administered, a sensible observationmade in the executive summary of the IOM. And you, Mr. Chair-man, in your introductory comments asked for the science about allthis. I have been working pro bono with the autistic families in the United Kingdom, who are challenging Merck, Smith-Kline, andothers about the possible association. In documents I read of theattorneys of those companies, the statement was that 55 cases ofautism were reported worldwide in the last 20 years of childrenwith autism. But I said, wait a minute. There are 505 cases in this list here. Where do they get that? Apparently, they are reported on thewrong color of paper to the yellow card system, so it does not makeit into the official statistics. So I decided that we should do an observational exercise \u2014I bare- ly call it a study \u2014abstracting each of the medical records of these children and having some summaries to help us understand whatis going on. We did it. I had an interdisciplinary team do this natu-ral history of autism on a self-selected sample. I admit that. Thisis not representative of anything. We did not even do statisticaltests for that reason. The children had to be less than 15. They had to be free of symp- toms not only before MMR but for the first 30 days after to biasit against us. All symptoms, signs, and diagnosis had to be in writ-ing by a health professional, not just casual reporting \u2014which is meaningful, but nevertheless difficult to validate. We ended up with 493 medical records that could be used. I was sort of sobered. I entered a room that was full floor to ceiling andwall to wall with records. There was not enough space to work, butwe did it anyhow. The average width of a chart was three volumestotaling more than 10 inches. That is what we were looking at. This was looked at independently by the professor of family med- icine of McGill, by a clinical psychologist from the University ofGlasgow, by myself as an epidemiologist, and we had research as-sistants helping us with the tasks. It was a descriptive analysesonly, as I said. I am reporting it for the first time. We met last Fri-day for the final analysis. We may end up by one-half percent be- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb questioned three records, which are being checked on now. That is what we were doing last Friday and we are writing thepaper now, which should be sent in a week or so. So there you see 493 medical records. The numbers there for ex- clusion, the 372 eligible subjects \u2014most of the ineligibility was that they had symptoms early on and we wanted to bias it against us.We had 70 percent of those cases as classic autism; 7 percent wereatypical autism; aspergoes were 8 percent. Of those cases, 40 per-cent were regressive, 40 percent were failure to develop, and 9 per-cent were both. But most importantly \u2014and that is with reference to the evidence you were looking for \u2014this is not good scientific evidence, but it is a start \u2014if you see there, the median years from receiving the first dose to making the diagnosis was 2.6 years. That means that halfthe cases were 2.6 and greater. And there was great variation. If you look at average, which is a bit higher, it is 3.2. But the median is more accurate because of the distribution. And the rangeis from 0.5 to 11.9 years of delay. The correlation does not evenexist, the date of vaccination and the onset of this category of dis-eases. I would just like to allude to this, Mr. Chairman. I have been looking for 17 months for studies with scientific admissibility thatare adequate pharmacological-epidemiologic evidence of safety,which you would need when a concern has arisen in the communityabout safety of a particular drug. I have not found any. I have notfound it. A proper study of safety under the current conditions,given the frequency of the disorder, would require about 450,000children. I went through that with statisticians at Cambridge. Andthat has never been done. And the ''safety studies '' published are of scores of patients. That is a type of sample size which is simply inappropriate, insufficient,and not a scientific way to look at the safety of a drug. I am aston-ished that the authorities in the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates, and my country of Canada are not requiring it the sameway they have required us to do it for all contraceptives, for theright reasons. The problem is incorrect length of followup as much as anything in these cases. For instance, the Medical Research Council reportwidely cited in the United Kingdom as setting aside the concernfollowed an unrepresentative subsample of the sample of childrenI looked at for 3 to 6 weeks when the range is from 0.5 years to11.8 years. The study is simply not valid for that reason alone andcannot be invoked to demonstrate safety or the lack of a need forconcern. There is no problem if you do not look. The companies know that. Those of an opinion that there is no association say that epi-demiologists have shown no evidence. Of course, they have. Andthey have all been small studies. I call them phyto studies to mystudents. Phyto means arenal products in the ocean. It doesn 't make any difference in the levels in your understanding. Nobody has looked. And the cost of looking is that of millions of dollars. Is that OK? Yes, it is OK. Look at the millions of dollarsof profits. One way of pretending you are looking but not lookingis by under-powering the studies. They are not powered sufficiently VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb able to deal with the no-difference issue leading you po- tentially to what we call a type two error statistically. I will just tell you \u2014and it is in the written record \u2014the Finnish study reported widely by the press in Britain \u2014much like likely the IOM reports will be somewhat misrepresented \u2014does not in any way demonstrate safety or lack of it because it is a passive surveil-lance study designed for other purposes and then reanalyzed foranother reason. I give a page and a half of reasons why that studyjust does not mean anything one way or the other. It is in the writ-ten record, Mr. Chairman. Research priorities \u2014I will list them quickly and I will end up with the study. Ongoing research in laboratory and the clinic \u2014I will not say any more. A lot has been said about treatment, but I would add a wordthat I hardly ever hear and that is about palliation. The familiesneed treatment as much as the children, and palliative strategiesneed to be undertaken. I am sure my clinical colleagues couldn 't agree more with that. But it does not get priority in potential focusof support. Correctly designed safety studies. Correctly designed incidence studies. And case-controlled studies. This past Saturday and Sunday, we met at Heathrow Airport, representatives from six countries out of nine possible candidates,to decide go/no-go on a major intercontinental study. The IOM saidthe committee does propose targeted research efforts and more rig-orous data-gathering procedures. Much of the problem in existingresearch is that you are going into data that were created for apurpose other than exploring that hypothesis. That is a lot of theproblem. This is going to get around that. Mr. B URTON . Doctor, are you about to wrap up? Dr. S PITZER . I need 3 more minutes, or less, if I can. We reached a ''go'' decision on Sunday, a few days ago. We have been working on it since. I am going back to it. We are going to explore risk factors other than MMR as well be- cause there is no point going in 5 years and then deciding that weshould have looked at something else. We are going to try to avoidthat. The candidate countries are on the slide, nine countries. Why so many countries? In England, Canada, Denmark, and the United States there is such an overwhelming coverage that obtaining control is almost im-possible. You have to have control. The contestants of clinicalscience and epidemiology and laboratory science as well is compari-son. Without comparison, you have generation of hypothesis in themain, very seldom testing of a hypothesis. You ask in epidemiology, how is your spouse? And you will prob- ably hear something like, compared to whom? [Laughter.] You have to have comparison, and that is why we are proposing a case-controlled study, and to do much of it in-country. Polandonly has 35 percent coverage today. The rest is univalent. Thesame with Argentina and the same with France. Selected features of the study \u2014quickly \u20143,500 cases and 7,000 unaffected controls. Exposure risk factors: MMR, mercury, othervaccination, childhood diseases, genetic factors, not to exhaus- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 The outcome is the entire spectrum of autis- tic disorders. Why 3,500 cases? Because, as has been said by many already \u2014 and I am pleasantly surprised \u2014we will likely find the problem in a subset. It is a multifactorial problem, almost certainly everyoneseems to agree. But we do not know what that subset is in ad-vance. I would propose that a subset of less than 10 percent \u2014it is either not discoverable or not as important. So we are making 10 percentthe threshold. That gives you 350 cases and the corresponding con-trol that may give us important answers. Finally, it is investigator-initiated. We are not responding to any request for proposal, therefore we have to create the protocol andthen ''sell it '' to objective, independent organizations. The cost is es- timated to be $17 million to $21 million over 5 years, $125,000 inthe first year. Is that a lot? It is the equivalent to the annual cost of care and support of 0.3 percent of autistic children in the United Statesalone. We have only methodological support from the United Statesso far. We have support from most of the other countries. We willdo it. We would like to work with the United States. We do notneed the United States or the United Kingdom, for that matter. Wehope we can push ahead with this and look for some of the answersthat are being called for. I apologize for the delay. Thank you for your attention.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Spitzer. We will take your whole program and submit that, along with the others, to HHS and askthem to take a hard look at that. Dr. Haley.Dr. H ALEY . I am probably one of the few people here who does not treat patients. I am a research scientist and I work in a lab. I was asked some time ago to look and go to the bottom line. Are the vaccine mixtures that we are placing in the children toxic? Ifthey are going to have an effect on autism or any disease or anyneurological disorder, there is a good possibility, if it comes fromthe chemical level, that vaccines have to show some toxicity at themolecular level. We did test vaccines, and I will make this very short because I know we are in a hurry. We compared the vaccines with and without thimerosal from the same source, the same type of vaccine, and those with thimerosalpresent were remarkably much more toxic \u2014over 10-fold to 100-fold more toxic than those without thimerosal. There was one outstand-ing exception, and that was the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccinewas as toxic as the vaccines with thimerosal, but there is no thi-merosal in the MMR. We measured mercury levels, and I think thethimerosal is not there, but we would want to do a lot more num-bers of vaccines. But there is something in the MMR vaccine that does inhibit the enzymes and the brain protein systems that we have very dramati-cally. I do not know what it is. I would point out also that the toxicity is thimerosal in a vaccine mixture. In our studies, we looked at combined toxicities becausewe are not rats living in a pristine cage. Aluminum is a neurotoxin, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 you throw that in with thimerosal, which breaks down to ethyl mercury, a well-known toxin. You donot know what you will get without doing studies. I have lookedhard and cannot find them. I am surprised they were not done, butnot totally. This is just something we do not know the answer to. We do know that ethyl mercury is very, very toxic. Of the studies you can read about, of the three children that have been intoxi-cated that I have found \u2014they all died with 1 microgram per ml levels. That is considerably below what they would do, but you justdo not hit a point and then die. You start a linear progression ofhealth effects. The other thing, when we talk about the level of mercury that is toxic, you cannot compare mercury to ethyl mercury to dimethylmercury. They are different compounds. Ethyl mercury, methylmercury, and especially dimethyl mercury are much more toxicthan an equivalent amount of mercury on the atom or mole basis.So you cannot compare them. I would also point out that the reason mercury does not kill us immediately is that a lot of it depends on our health. We all liveat a level where we have reducing equivalents this high when weare 20 years old. We are full of spit and vinegar. And the mercurylevel is down here and we are handling it real well. As we age, thelevel of glutathione, metallothione, and other proteins that we syn-thesize in our bodies \u2014because the energy level drops down \u2014gets to the point where we are getting more balanced. When we get tooold or too unhealthy, then we pass this. Then the mercury can takeover and start having the effect of damaging the healthy proteins,the proteins we really need in the body. I would also point out that this level can drop precipitously if you have a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. It will drop dramaticallybecause it is fighting to take care of the oxidants because the mol-ecule that removes mercury from our body is also the molecule thattakes care of the reactive oxygen species, the normal aging prod-ucts, and the materials we call oxidating stress products. I am surprised, when I understand the data that they are pre- senting here \u2014we know certain children are born that are autistic. These vaccines need to be cleaned up because even if they did notcause it, who would want to give ethyl mercury to a child that isdestined to get autism? It is a very poor idea. You really need toclean the vaccines up. I cannot imagine why they did not take thevaccine mixture and test it, on the very base level in a test tubeagainst a bank of enzymes or against a brain homogenate to seewhether or not they were injecting toxicants into these children. Itis very clear that has happened. I would also point out that we have a problem with combined toxicities. People that smoke are heavy in cadmium. And cadmiumand mercury, if you combine them together in a test tube and testsystem against tubulin \u2014which is probably the first protein affected in Alzheimer 's Disease \u2014that you can have a non-toxic level of mer- cury, a non-toxic level of cadmium, and you add those two togetherand you will get over 50 to 60 percent toxicity on a comparativebasis. Combined toxicities and the multiplicity of the events that are caused by mercury \u2014mercury is somewhat similar to alcohol in that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb get exposed to it they behave differently \u2014so it is very difficult when you want to look just at someone who isan autistic. To me, that is a name and it is a tantology. Autisticsdo this. And yet, I say, do all autistics do that? No. Then there isa difference. They are not the same. You have to look at them dif-ferently. So we have a very confused issue here that I think weneed to look at. I would also point out that in the vaccine issued, the one thing that really makes the vaccines toxic to infants \u2014you are giving the same shot to an infant that you give to a 180-pound soldier. Infantsdo not have bilary transport. They do not make bile when they arefirst born and for some time after that. The bilary transport systemis how the body removes mercury from the system. Babies cannotdo that. So it is the equivalent of drinking alcohol and not beingable to metabolize it. It builds up. It would stay there and be muchmore damaging to an infant than to someone who is an adult whohad the ability to rid the body of the mercury. Aluminum is removed by the renal system. Infants have an im- mature renal system. They cannot handle heavy metals and get ridof them as fast as we can. If you give them multiple shots withhigh levels of mercury, I do not know how well they handle it. Ihave not been able to find any data where this has been tested. Sothe mercury and aluminum levels would buildup in these infantsif they had multiple shots before they got to the point where theirbilary and renal systems were totally mature. The aspect of genetic factors \u2014I was in New Zealand I talked to a doctor by the name of Mike Godfrey. He is a friend of mine andhe and I have talked a lot about Alzheimer 's Disease and the in- volvement of mercury. Johns Hopkins University showed severalyears ago that there is a risk factor, a gene called APO-E protein.There are three copies, two, three, and four. Two is protectiveagainst Alzheimer 's Disease; four puts you at high risk for the dis- ease. If you look at the chemistry of the APO-E proteins, this can be reflected in the fact that it is a housekeeping protein that clearsthe brain of waste materials. If you have APO-E2, you can carryout two atoms of mercury for every atom of APO-E that goes out.If you have APO-E4, you can carry out none. He took this and looked at autistic children. When he did the screen of autistic children, there was a huge preponderance of themthat had APO-E4, indicating that there is a genetic risk factorwhich deserves further study. And it does implicate that the inabil-ity to detoxify the cerebral spinal fluid may be at least part of theneurological aspect of this disease. I am not a physician, so I donot go there to make answers about that. I have also been in a fight with the pro-dental amalgam people for many years, as I did research about 10 years showing that mer-cury dramatically inhibited the same enzymes that are dramati-cally inhibited in an AD brain. And everyone says there is not enough mercury there to do it. Recently \u2014and it is in the report I did\u2014they have found that studies using neurons and culture, that levels of mercury approximately 100 to 1,000-fold less than youhave in your brain, when you place it with neurons in culture will VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb of the two diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer 's Disease. I went to NIH and screened the grants they fund. We found one where they are funding the ability to make a better amalgam thatwould leave less mercury because there was some concern aboutthe mercury being released, which, according to the ADA is a to-tally safe level. But there are no grants looking at the effects oflow-level mercury exposures to Americans. But we are placinggrams in our mouth and micro grams in our vaccinations. I cannot say, nor would I say, that vaccinations cause autism. However, if the data holds up that I have been seeing with the re-lationship, I think it is an awfully good suspect, at least one of theco-factors that might aid in the onset of this disease. So I wouldreally recommend and encourage you to put some pressure on NIHto look at the contribution of different forms of mercury we put inour medicines and in our dentistry to see what effect they have onthe neurological health of Americans, especially autistics. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. you, Dr. Haley. You may rest assured that we are going to put as much informa- tion before them and \u2014if you want to call it pressure \u2014pressure them as much as possible to research all of this. Dr. Amaral.Dr. A MARAL . Mr. Chairman and members, my name is David Amaral and I am a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at theUniversity of California, Davis. The last 3 years, it has been my great privilege to be the re- search director of a new clinical research experiment called theMIND Institute. MIND stands for Medical Investigation ofNeurodevelopmental Disorders. I deliberately referred to the Insti-tute as an experiment because of the unique way in which it cameinto being, the unique way in which it governs its research, clinical,and educational programs, and the unique focus on understandingthe biological basis of autism and other neurodevelopmental dis-orders in order to discover treatments and ultimately cures. Historically, parents of children with autism have been given lit- tle hope and frequently advised to institutionalize their child andmove on with their lives. This option was unacceptable to four Sac-ramento-area fathers, all of whom had sons diagnosed with autismin the 1990 's. Chuck Gardner, a general contractor, Rick Hayes, an investment management, Rick Rollens, former secretary of theCalifornia State Senate, and Lou Vismara, a cardiologist, joinedforces to create the concept of developing a world-class researchand treatment center devoted to understanding the biology of au-tism in order to find treatments for theirs and other 's children. These four dads approached the UC Davis health system with the idea of forging a unique partnership between a University med-ical center and parents of autistic children to develop an institutewhere families could bring their children for state-of-the-art one-stop diagnosis. Those children diagnosed with autism or otherneurodevelopmental disorders would then become subjects for mul-tidisciplinary research aimed at understanding the causes andmedical ramifications of their disorders. Once the biology of autismwas better understood, then the clinic would become the provingground for new treatments that would be developed based on thenew research findings. The MIND Institute research program, since that time, has fol- lowed a number of parallel paths of development. It is importantto point out that the Research Committee, which is charged withall decisions about research direction at the Institute, is made upequally of parents and senior scientists at UC Davis. The commit-tee has agreed that the prime directives of MIND Institute re-search are to remain open to all possibilities of causality, to carryout rigorous research in a collaborative multi-disciplinary fashion,to carry out innovative and even highly risky research if there arepotentially large payoffs, and to try and determine the critical pathto understanding the biology of autism in order to develop treat- ments as quickly as possible. The MIND Institute research program currently has four compo- nents. It has a UC Davis intermural program, and we are attempt-ing to develop a critical mass of researchers and facilities at UC VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb carry out state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary re- search on autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. It is clear that certain forms of research and therapy will only be accomplished when an intimate relationship is established be-tween the clinic and basic science. This is really the guiding visionof the MIND Institute. We have an investigator-initiated grant program. It is important to note that more than half of all the research funds allocated tothe MIND Institute have actually been distributed to researchersat other UC campuses and other research facilities internationallyto carry out research on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.This extramural program is guided, again, by the parent-orientedphilosophy that it is more important to get the critical research ac-complished quickly than get the credit for accomplishing it at aparticular institution. We also have targeted research initiatives. Funds have been allo- cated to carry out research in areas that are currently underrep-resented or in need of immediate attention. The MIND Institute,for example, has launched a nationwide effort to investigate the po-tential relationship between vaccines and autism. I will say moreabout that in a moment. Finally, we have a MIND Institute scholars program. A major impediment \u2014and we have heard this today \u2014to rapid progress to research on autism is the relatively small number of scientists andclinicians who have autism as their primary area of interest. To en-courage young scientists to enter the field, the MIND Institute hasfunded pre-doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows throughoutthe University of California system. It is hoped that these MINDInstitute scholars will be the future leaders of autism research. Let me briefly highlight some areas of current and future MIND Institute research. The first I would like to mention is the biomark-ers program. One of the first grants funded by the MIND Institute was award- ed to a team from the California Birth Defects Monitoring Pro-gram, who collaborated with Dr. Karen Nelson from the NIH andwith investigators from the MIND Institute. We heard a little bitabout this this morning. The so-called blood spot study sampled the blood spots that are taken from all children born in California. The investigators soughtto determine whether there might be abnormal levels of certainpeptides in the blood spots of children who were later diagnosedwith autism. This highly risky \u2014what some would call a fishing expedition \u2014 made the striking discovery that several peptides were elevated inchildren who later became autistic or mentally retarded, but werenot elevated in children with cerebral palsy or normal control sub-jects. This has led to the suspicion that more sophisticated tech-niques might provide a diagnostic marker for those children whoare susceptible to autism. Of course, the significance of this finding is that there is substantial suspicion that while autism has a ge-netic component which makes children susceptible to the disorder,they must encounter another factor \u2014a so-called second hit \u2014that brings on the not clear what the second hit may be \u2014we have heard that many parents and others are concerned that it might be child-hood vaccination or environmental contaminants \u2014regardless of the precise identity of the second hit, if susceptible children could bedetected at birth or before, once the causative agents are deter-mined, these children could be protected from exposure. Therefore,finding a biomarker of autism is the highest priority of the MINDInstitute research program. One strategy is to employ the power of the Human Genome Project. In January 2001, the MIND Institute announced that itwas allocating $1 million to develop a new neurodevelopmentalgenomics laboratory. The laboratory aims to identify a genetic pro-file or fingerprint of those children who may be vulnerable to au-tism. The goal of this program is to have an accurate diagnostictest that will be used to evaluate all children at birth, like the chil-dren are currently tested for Phenylketonuria. A second initiative has been our vaccine-autism link research. As initially described by Mr. Rick Rollens in testimony to this commit-tee on August 3, 1999 \u2014and we have heard much about this today \u2014there is strong suspicion among parents that one ideology of autism of a child is associated with child vaccinations. Whilemany organizations have been hesitant to take on this issue, theMIND Institute considered this to be a fundamental area for imme-diate action. If there is an identifiable culprit in existing vaccinesthat cause autism, then the removal of the agent or changes in vac-cination policy could reduce future cases of autism. In August 2000, the MIND Institute issued a request for pro- posal for research leading to precise scientific data on the potentiallinks between vaccines and autism. With a private donation of $1.2million and additional funds from the State of California, the RFPwas advertised nationally and throughout the UC system and sev-eral grants have already been funded to carry on this research. Another area of research is on the epidemiology of autism. The California State Legislature commissioned the UC Davis MIND In-stitute to carry out an evaluation of the factors that have led to thenearly 300 percent increase in the number of clients with autismin the regional center system and allocated $1 million for this ef-fort. The principal investigator of this study is Dr. Robert Byrd inour Department of Pediatrics. The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether fac- tors such as in-migration or diagnostic shift can account for someof the increase in clients with autism. If you can discount some ofthese factors, then it has to be something else and we will look atthose factors as well. The study team has been assembled. Thefield work is planned for September through December of this year.The analysis and reporting of results are slated for June 2002. Another important area of work is what we call the autism tissue program. Much of the progress that has been made in the under-standing of Alzheimer 's Disease has come from the neuropathological and molecular biological analysis of post-mortembrain tissue. Literally hundreds of thousands of brains have beenevaluated through recruitment at Alzheimer 's research centers throughout the United States. In contrast, fewer than 40 autisticbrains have been subjected to post-mortem analysis. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 is clearly a very difficult issue that requires utmost sen- sitivity and compassion, progress in the understanding of the biol-ogy of autism will rely on the acquisition of well-preserved braintissue from autistic patients. So to facilitate the goal of acquiringand distributing this resource, the MIND Institute has joinedforces with the autism tissue program, sponsored by the NationalAlliance for Autism Research and Autism Society of America Foun-dation, to carry out the nationwide campaign to make parents andfamilies aware of the need for tissue donations and to develop anefficient acquisition network that will allow optimal use of this pre-cious resource. And the last area I wanted to mention is a recently announced international meeting for autism research. There is currently nonational or international meeting that brings together all scientistscarrying out research in autism. The MIND Institute has joinedwith Cure Autism Now and the National Alliance for Autism Re-search to launch the first international meeting for autism researchin San Diego on November 9 and 10 of this year. This meeting willencourage presentations of all types of research dealing with anyaspect of biological basis of autism or experimental approaches totreatment. It is expected that this meeting will contribute to increasing the awareness of new research findings and should foster new areas ofresearch as well as new collaborative efforts. So to summarize, the MIND Institute has quickly established a multi-component research program that is designed not only tohelp the children of today but those of the future. First, we arebuilding a strong local infrastructure that will be uniquely capableof carrying out translational research on autism. Patients will notonly be diagnosed in the clinic, but will become subjects for re-search. Once new findings lead to new treatments, the clinic willbe the proving ground for these approaches. And once a new treat-ment is proven, it will be distributed to institutions worldwide forimplementation. Second, at the same time as research is carried out in Sac- ramento, the MIND Institute will support innovative researchthroughout California and eventually, with adequate fundraising,throughout the world. Third, in addition to our own efforts, we will partner with other advocacy and research groups, including the NIH, to foster effortsthat must be carried out through a concerted effort. Through building a strong research team and collaborating na- tionally and internationally, it is my hope that we will ultimatelyunderstand and defeat autism. In the meantime, the MIND Insti-tute will do everything in our power to treat children who are cur-rently afflicted and strive to prevent new cases in the future. Thank you very much.[The prepared statement of Dr. Amaral follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Amaral. Dr. Miller.Dr. M ILLER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for inviting me to this congressional hearing. I do so in my capacity as an epidemiologist who has worked for 22 yearsin the Public Health Laboratory Service in the United Kingdom onvaccine-related issues, with specific expertise in studies relating tovaccine safety. For clarification, I should say that the PHLS in a non-govern- mental public body whose role is to provide a national capabilityfor the diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention of communicable dis-ease and the provision of independent advice about the control ofcommunicable disease to help professionals and the Department ofHealth. The remit of the Immunization Division \u2014which is part of the PHLS \u2014of which I am head, is the national surveillance of im- munization programs, including the safety and efficacy of vaccinesthat are in routine use. Together with statistical colleagues in the PHLS and other aca- demic institutions, over the years I have conducted a number of ep-idemiological studies designed to investigate various putative ad-verse events after different vaccines, including MMR, DPT, andmore recently oral polio virus vaccine. These are referenced in myCV. In some of these studies, evidence of a causal link between a spe- cific adverse event and a vaccine has been found, and risks as rareas 1 in 10,000, 1 in 22,000, and even 1 in 143,000 doses have beendetected. In other studies of possible adverse events, the resultshave been entirely negative. This is the case with the epidemiolog-ical studies I have conducted related to the postulated link betweenMMR and autism. Similar negative findings have been found inother work conducted elsewhere on the potential epidemiologicallink between MMR and autism. These epidemiological studies have been designed to test the hypotheses implicit in the case reports and population trends in au-tism that Wakefield and others have interpreted as evidence of acausal link with MMR vaccine. The published evidence cited \u2014some parents of autistic children say that the onset of symptoms in theirchild first occurred shortly after MMR, that prior to MMR theirchild was developing normally, that the onset of behavioral regres-sion associated with MMR is typically accompanying by bowelsymptoms, and that there has been an epidemic increase in theprevalence of autism which coincides with the introduction of MMRvaccine. The studies I shall describe have been designed specifically to test the hypotheses that are implicit in these observations. I thinkit is disingenuous of Dr. Wakefield to say that he has inferred nohypotheses. I think it is also disingenuous of Dr. Spitzer to say thatthe study I was involved with was essentially a hypothesis-generat-ing study. It was specifically testing a prior hypothesis that was de- rived from Wakefield 's paper in the Lancet where the evidence that is put forward for an association between MMR and autism is theonset of regressive features or other behavioral disturbance shortlyafter MMR. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 the findings of the various epidemiolog- ical studies \u2014which are described in detail in my written submis- sion to this committee with full references \u2014are as follows. There is no evidence that the onset of autistic symptoms is more likely shortly after MMR vaccine than at any other time. Indeed,new evidence which is shortly to appear from my colleagues andmyself in a vaccine journal shows that there is no evidence thatMMR vaccine increases the likelihood of autism at any time aftervaccination. Children with autism are no more likely to have received MMR vaccine than normal children. The introduction of MMR as a rou-tine immunization for children in the second year of life has notbeen associated with a step-up increase in the incidence of autism. When analyzed by birth cohort, there is no correlation between MMR uptake and prevalence of autism. I recognize that the Wake-field hypothesis has now moved on and has evolved \u2014possibly under pressure of these epidemiological findings \u2014but it is impor- tant to remember that the published work of Wakefield and othersin relation to the putative link has been tested in the studies Ihave just described the findings of. Most importantly, the final finding I will describe and show you the data from the study which is not yet published, there is no epi-demiological evidence to suggest the emergence of a new syndromeof autistic enterocolitis associated with the use of MMR vaccine. As I said, this latest finding, which I think is most pertinent here in relation to the postulated existence of this characteristic regres-sive autism with autistic enterocolitis \u2014I would like to present the results of this later study here. If it is true that vaccine-attributable cases typically present with developmental regression and bowel symptoms, then the proportionof such cases should have increased since the introduction of MMR.That is a logical conclusion and a logical inference from the hypoth-esis that is implicit in the data Dr. Wakefield has shown. To test this hypothesis, my colleagues and I have updated our 1998 study of prevalent autistic cases in the North Thames Regionof England by carrying out a further survey in 2000, 2 12years later. The prevalence data of the more recent birth cohorts showsthat the rise in the early 1980 's and early 1990 's has now levelled off with no significant increase in prevalence in birth cohorts from1993 onward. The current prevalence rate is about 1 in 350 to 1 in 400 chil- dren. That is a high rate. And I would like to make it clear at thispoint that I do not in any way believe that this is a condition whichshould not attract substantial amounts of funding. We need to findthe etiology and we need to find effective treatments. However, the question of whether there has been an epidemic in- crease or whether that prevalence was there all the time but hasonly been recognized with appropriate diagnosis and referral mech-anism I think is open to question. Certainly, my colleague, Profes-sor Brent Taylor, who is a consultant community pediatrician, is ofthe opinion that the rise we had seen prior to 1993 was due to im-prove recognition and referral of cases rather than a real rise. Ithink the fact that it has flattened off since 1993 is consistent withthat interpretation of the data. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 main purpose of this updated study was to test whether there has been an increase in the proportion of cases withregressive features and bowel symptoms associated with MMR. [Slide presentation.]Dr. M ILLER . This shows that amongst children \u2014there were 500 children in this survey \u2014of children with regression \u2014we con- centrated specifically on children with regression and bowel symp-toms. You can see there the portion of children with regression cat-egorized by whether they had ever had MMR or indeed any mea-sles-containing vaccine, whether they had that vaccine prior to pa-rental concern \u2014those are the cases that could possibly be caused by the vaccine, they were normal until they had thee vaccine \u2014or whether they had the vaccine after parental concern. You can seethat there is no significant difference in the percentage of caseswith regression by MMR status. A similar analysis done of the percentage of cases with bowel symptoms by MMR status again shows no significant difference be-tween those three categories of autistic children \u2014no MMR, MMR before onset, or MMR after onset. Looked at another way, if we look at the percentage of cases with regression by year of birth, going from 1979 up to 1998 \u2014and re- member that we introduced MMR in the UK in 1998, so in themiddle there \u2014you can see there has been no change in the propor- tion of cases with regression by year of birth. Similarly, there has been no change in the cases of bowel symp- toms by year of birth. Neither did we find that there was any char-acteristic bowel features in association with the use of MMR vac-cine, constipation and diarrhea. These results are currently beingsubmitted for publication. In conclusion, in my view, the available epidemiological evidence, both from the United Kingdom and elsewhere, does not support alink between MMR and autism of the nature and frequency implic-itly postulated by Wakefield and others and the basis of their pub-lished work so far. I recognize that the hypothesis has now evolvedand moved on. Indeed, it provides strong grounds for rejection ofthe hypothesis that MMR is responsible for the reported rise in au-tism and that such cases are characterized by behavioral regressionaccompanied by bowel symptoms. Clearly, no epidemiological study could prove that MMR vaccine never causes autism, however rarely. In this regard, epidemiolo-gists are no different from any other scientist in that proof of anegative is impossible. As with all epidemiological studies of any putative adverse event, the existence of a rare, idiosyncratic causal association cannot beentirely excluded. However, the existence of such a putative asso-ciation between MMR vaccine and autism is at present entirelyspeculative. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. Miller follows:] VerDate Miller. Dr. Gershon.Dr. G ERSHON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Dr. Michael Gershon, professor of anatomy and cell biology at Columbia University in New York. Life is often unfair. The unfairness of the life dealt to autistic children, however, is so unfair that it defies comprehension. Themental elements of autism, which may sentence an innocent childto a life in virtual solitary confinement, are bad enough. To haveto endure that sentence in gastrointestinal misery outdoes thetrials of Job. The withdrawal from social contact that characterizesautism is so striking, moreover, that the abnormal behavior of af-flicted children has historically tended to blind non-parental ob-servers to symptoms from their gut, which in comparison, seemtrivial. Historically also, the possibility that there might be a pathophysiological link between the gut and the brain has not beenconsidered, even by scientists who should have known enough to doso. Help to alleviate the gastrointestinal accompaniments of au-tism, therefore, has only recently been sought and investigation ofthe involvement of the bowel in autism begun. Given that the involvement of the bowel in autism has not pre- viously been studied, there is little that one can say right nowabout the causes of that involvement except that it is a topic worthconsidering. Certainly, the incidence of gastrointestinal problems inchildren with autism appears to be high and if one really looks forthese conditions even higher. Professors Wakefield, Horvath, andtheir colleagues, therefore, have done a real service for patientsand the biomedical community in publicizing the association of gas-trointestinal abnormalities in autism. At the start of a new field of research, such as the role of the gut in autism, one naturally formulates hypotheses that one cantest. Hypotheses are very much a part of the scientific method. Un-fortunately, it is relatively easy to construct an argument in sup-port of a favored hypothesis, but an argument differs from evidenceand should not be confused with it. An argument can serve to moti-vate hypothesis testing, but evidence is required for hypothesis con-firmation. The hypothesis that MMR vaccine is a cause of autism is sup- ported at the moment by a well-crafted argument. There is, how-ever, little or no hard evidence available to support that hypoth-esis. Furthermore, based on my understanding of gastrointestinalfunction and the nature of the blood brain barrier, I believe thatit is unlikely that the hypothesis, as originally formulated byWakefield and others, that MMR causes autism is correct. The hypothesis that MMR is causally related to autism, which has been associated with Dr. Wakefield, postulates that the attenu-ated measles virus component of the vaccine persists in the bowelof those vaccine recipients destined to manifest autism as a resultof their vaccination. The persistent measles virus is thought to elic-it an immune response that is then postulated to increase the per-meability of the intestinal epithelium, giving rise to a ''leak. '' This leak enables toxic materials \u2014in particular, opioid peptides \u2014to be absorbed from the intestinal VerDate the bloodstream and are carried to the developing brain. The so-called rogue peptides, which are derived from the gut, crossthe blood-brain barrier and damage the developing brain, givingrise to autism. The evidence that measles virus actually persists in the bowel is controversial. The idea that measles virus persists has been re-cently been supported by Drs. Wakefield and his collaborator, Dr.O'Leary, with data derived from sensitive molecular biological tech- niques, which suggest that the virus is present in the bowel, butin very low copy numbers. These data are still largely unpublished, and the findings have not yet, to my knowledge, appeared in a peer-reviewed journal.Other investigators have not been able to reproduce the molecularobservations. Furthermore, test samples containing coded amountof measles RNA from cultured cells and from transgenic mice \u2014 which express the human measles virus \u2014that were sent to Dr. O'Leary by Dr. Michael Oldstone were not read with the effective- ness needed to support the claims of low copy numbers of virus per-sisting in the gut of vaccinated individuals with autism. Oldstone has concluded that the record of performance would not be acceptable for certifying a clinical laboratory. The virologicalsupport for the hypothesis of measles virus persistence, therefore,is not established and cannot be considered so until it is independ-ently confirmed. The data supporting the next step \u2014the leak of toxic opioid peptides into the body from the lumen of the bowel \u2014is scanty at best. Urinary observations of such are unreliable. The thought that inflammation damages the epithelial lining of the bowel, causing its permeability to increase, is plausible. On theother hand, there is no reason that a leak in the gut should be aone-way leak. Nor is there any explanation as to how a leak couldbe specific so as to let only some molecules through and not othersof the same size and shape pass through. No movement of peptides or proteins from the tissue fluid to the intestine has been detected in autism or as a result of MMR vac-cination. Protein-losing enteropathy has not been reported to be as-sociated with autism, nor has it been reported to be a sequela ofMMR vaccination in any significant number of people. On the other hand, if the bowel were to be permeable in a size manner so that the large molecules of the body do not get out, thensmall molecules from the gut would go both ways through the pro-posed hole. That would cause massive malnutrition and malabsorp-tion in the patients, which has not been reported. So the absence of a telltale protein-losing loss or a failure of ab- sorption in patients en masse with autism and in recipients ofMMR vaccine thus suggests that the postulated leak of the gut ad-mitting opioid peptides does not indeed occur. To paraphrase SirArthur Conan Doyle in Sherlock Holmes, the failure of these thingsto occur and the failure of absorption is the dog that did not bark.The postulated leak of the bowel is thus unlikely to occur or to besignificant. The idea that opioid peptides or other toxins enter the body from the bowel and cause autism overlooks another filter that is in placeto remove them, and that filter is the liver. Everything the gut ab- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb to the liver as a consequence of the circulation. There is no evidence that MMR damages the liver. The postulatedopioid peptides, therefore, would have to be absorbed in over-whelming amounts to overcome the ability of the liver to removethem. The liver is exceedingly good at removing opioids. There isno other toxicity noted in organs and the fact that the liver is thereand is normal in patients with autism suggests that this postulatedbarrier is not overcome. Finally, once the presumptively toxic peptides \u2014if they ever could \u2014overcome the barriers of the intestinal epithelium and the liver, which does not seem likely, the blood-brain barrier remains.That barrier is constituted by special vessels in the brain and itought to be impenetrable to opioid peptides or other toxins. Howthese so-called toxins get across is unknown. One molecule that islarge that does get across is leptin, which is a natural hormone,but it has its own transporter. No such molecules are known. Sofor a gut-derived peptide to be a cause of autism, one has to as-sume that a miracle occurs to cause the blood-brain barrier to open,like the Red Sea did for Moses and the Israelites during the exodusfrom Egypt. Finally, there is no reason to assume that MMR is the only \u2014or even the most likely \u2014reason for an association between gastro- intestinal disease to be associated with autism. The nervous systemof the gut, the enteric nervous system, resembles the brain bothstructurally and chemically, and is known to share its fate in otherconditions, including Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases. It seems reasonable, therefore, to postulate that the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism is high becauseautism is a disease with manifestations in the gut as well as in thebrain. Alternatively, a brain that functions abnormally because ofautism may cause the bowel to function abnormally. Similarly, ifthere is a problem in the bowel, it can disturb the brain. Let me tell you, Mr. Chairman, as I prepared for this talk, I be- came painfully aware of the kinds of problems that can happen inthe bowel as the brain is disturbed. [Laughter.] In summary, therefore, I think that there are alternative expla- nations for much of this and that the preponderance of evidenceand the nature of the function of the gut, liver, and blood-brainbarrier combine to indicate that it is unlikely that the hypothesisassociated with Dr. Wakefield that MMR vaccine causes autism iscorrect. The idea that the measles virus persists in the gut of vac-cinated individuals is supported only by data that is controversialand has not been confirmed. The proposal that the bowel leaks due to measles virus persist- ence and absorbs opioid peptides or other toxins assumes a one-way leak. Since leaks are intrinsically not one-way, but holes in abarrier, body proteins or ions would be expected to flow out and nosuch movement has been detected in MMR or autism. The hypothesis that toxins are absorbed does not take filtration by the liver into account or explain why gut-derived peptides arenot removed. Finally, it does not explain why peptides can get through the blood-brain barrier to cause autism and there are alternatives VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb more plausible that can explain the association of GI malfunction in autism that have nothing to do with MMR. In closing, I would just like to say that I sympathize tremen- dously and empathize with patients with autism and their parents.But it may be counterproductive for patients with autism, theirparents, and for the whole population to devote energy and re-sources single-mindedly to the pursuit of a single theory of autism,when that theory might be false. The effort diverts scarce resourcesfrom avenues that might be needed and productive and should bedevoted to this terrible condition. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. Gershon follows:] VerDate Let me just start off by saying that I know just a couple of things. No. 1, there is an epidemic. There is a huge quan-tum leap in the number of children that are autistic. That is irref-utable. That is No. 1. No. 2, I know that my grandson, Christian, was a normal child starting to speak and doing everything that was normal and 1 dayhe got the DPT shot, he got the MMR shot, he got the HepatitisB shot, the Polio shot, and the Marcus Influenza shot, and 10 dayslater he had those bowel problems, had chronic diarrhea, ranaround hitting his head against the wall, flapping his arms, and hecould not talk anymore. That may be just a coincidence, but it happened. I saw it with my own eyes, so something happened. Whether it was the MMRshot or the mercury that was in these other vaccines or a combina-tion of the two, I do not know. But I do know that hundreds ofthousands of children in this country and around the world are suf-fering because of autism, and many of them are suffering from au-tism shortly after having received one or more of these vaccines. Dr. Haley, you said that there was about a 10-fold occurrence of autism in children who had the mercury vaccines and the MMR.I am not sure exactly how you said it. Dr. H ALEY . I was not making any mention of the rate of autism. Mr. B URTON . What were you saying? Dr. H ALEY . It is on the back page of the handout. When you compare the toxicity against the bank of enzymes or against enzymes in a brain tissue, if you add the vaccines that donot contain thimerosal, they show the least amount of toxicity, es-sentially, very little at all. Mr. B URTON . Right. Dr. H ALEY . If you use the same vaccine, only with thimerosal added as a preservative, they are tremendously much more toxic. Mr. B URTON . You said about 10 times, did you not? Dr. H ALEY . I am being very conservative; 1 microliter of these vaccines will totally inhibit these enzymes. You can sometimes add10 microliters of the non-thimerosal-containing vaccines and seejust a few percent \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . You also said that similar things occurred with the MMR vaccine. Dr. H ALEY . We also measured the mercury level because some of the vaccines we received had been used a bit. We looked at thelevel of mercury. It fit what you would expect. There are low levelsof mercury in the non-thimerosal-containing vaccines. There issome in all of them. The ones that had thimerosal added werequite high. The MMR came across as if it had no thimerosal added. There was a small amount in there. I think it would be similar to thosethat had no thimerosal added. There was mercury in there, but notvery much. Mr. B URTON . There was mercury in the MMR vaccine? Dr. H ALEY . Yes, but a very small amount. Mr. B URTON . But there was mercury in the vaccine? Dr. H ALEY . Yes, but the toxicity \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Merck, when we called awhile ago, said that there was no mercury in the MMR vaccine. You are saying that therewas a very small amount. Dr. H ALEY . Yes, we found it. I would want to do 20 of them be- fore I came up with an average, but we did find a small amountof mercury. It was very tiny, though. The MMR vaccine, unlike those vaccines without thimerosal, was very toxic. It was as toxic as if it had thimerosal in it. Mr. B URTON . So would you say it was 10 times more toxic than a vaccine without thimerosal? Dr. H ALEY . I would say so, yes. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Spitzer and Dr. Wakefield, I am sure you are squirming there. Would you like to make any kind of commentabout what you just heard? [Laughter.] Dr. W AKEFIELD . Generally, Mr. Chairman, or in specific relation? [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . The whole hypothesis of your research was pretty much trashed by the last two witnesses. Dr. W AKEFIELD . I think Dr. Miller confuses inference with impli- cation. She says that implicit in what we had written was a hy-pothesis. That, unfortunately, was her inference rather than ourimplication. What we have written \u2014and this is one of the earliest articles where we articulated a hypothesis \u2014I am afraid this is in scientific jargon \u2014the hypothesis hypothesized that autistic enterocolitis is an emergent, inflammatory bowel disease that follows a low-dosecompound viral exposure. Basically, that this subset of autism withan inflammatory disease is an emergent form of inflammatorybowel disease that follows a very atypical pattern of viral exposurethat requires not one virus but an interaction between viruses andpossibly other things as well. And we go on in that same paper \u2014and I will not go into the de- tails because it is too much scientific jargon \u2014but it comes back very much to what Dr. Bradstreet was talking about. If the devel-oping immune system is impaired in some way from developing anappropriate anti-viral response to exposure to mercury or othervaccines, if it is skewed in the wrong direction, then it may behaveaberrantly in the face of a virus. I am very happy to provide Dr. Miller with a copy of this paper and I will include one for your records. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Dr. Spitzer.Dr. S PITZER . I would first like to make a comment. There has been implication about comparing benefits and costs or good and harm in this situation. The understandable zeal, as in-dicating in the Institute of Medicine report, of coming close to wip-ing out a disease and the sequela of measles through the measuresthat are being taken is a very laudable goal. If we think, on the other hand, that say 10 percent only of autis- tic children are those in which we eventually find a link betweenthe disease and that vaccine were the case, a conservative estimateis 150 children per 100,000 with autism \u2014reducing it by 10 percent is reducing 15 near deaths, if you wish, in the community. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb to the other side of the coin, comparisons are almost always made, as I have read them recently in the literature, withno immunization at all as opposed to making the reference the bestacceptable alternative, which is univalent measles vaccine. Thegrandchildren I have I want to have vaccinated, but with univalentunless it is clarified. That would reduce in UK statistics, which I only give in a pre- liminary way \u2014I was just looking at them last Friday for the first time \u2014going from second to MMR meant a reduction of about 16 per 100,000 to usually zero or close to zero in developed countrieslike the UK. It really is about the same, even if only 10 percentof autistic children are affected. That means it is important that we look at subsets, even small subsets. If we can prevent 10 percent of autism by a more judiciousstrategy of immunization, to that extent we will have balanced theledger of harm. Last, I would like to stress in my case, I call myself a worried agnostic. I do not know whether there is an association. I think theevidence leans slightly in the direction of supporting an association.Perhaps causation, but at least association. I only feel that I aminvolved in one cause, and that is the pursuit of truth through sci-entific, admissible science, even if it takes 4 or 5 years to get tothe first step. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Spitzer. Mr. Waxman, do you have some questions?Mr. W AXMAN . Yes, I do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Dr. Wakefield, Marie McCormick is the Chair of the Institute of Medicine 's Committee on Immunization Safety Review. She said at the press conference at the release of the report that the MMR vac-cine is as safe as a vaccine can get. How do you respond?Dr. W AKEFIELD . That is a very interesting comment. It is rhetori- cal inasmuch \u2014let me put it this way. When the vaccine was first put together in 1969, one of the concerns I had in particular wasthat of interaction of viruses one with another. It is called viral in-terference. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. Wakefield, we are limited to 5 minutes each, so I would really like a very terse and clear response. Dr. W AKEFIELD . When the MMR was first put together, it was evident that the viruses interacted one with another. That was as-sumed to be a benign process. That was a major mistake, in myimpression. I do not believe that when you put them together it isa benign process. It alters the outcome from the vaccine, it altersthe immune response. Mr. W AXMAN . Do you think the MMR vaccine is as safe as a vac- cine can get? Dr. W AKEFIELD . No, absolutely not. Mr. W AXMAN . That is your view, but the Institute of Medicine is not the only organization that disagrees with you. Your work hasalso been scrutinized by the Medical Research Council and theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and none of them has found anyevidence to support your hypothesis. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 testimony, you demonstrate that the propor- tion of autistic children with regression or bowel symptoms has notchanged over the period in which the MMR has been used in theUK and is also no different for children who have never had anMMR vaccination or those who developed autism after the vaccine. What does that suggest about Dr. Wakefield 's theory? Dr. M ILLER . I obviously do not want to put hypotheses into Dr. Wakefield 's mouth. The hypothesis I would infer that should be tested on the basis of his suggestion of an autistic enterocolitis syn-drome is that there should have been an increase in the proportionof such cases with regression and bowel symptoms associated withthe use of MMR vaccine. I cannot find that in a large sample. I findthat at variance with any inferences I might make about what Iwould expect to have happened on the basis of Dr. Wakefield 's theories. I therefore have to come to what I believe is a reasonable conclu- sion that my observation does not support his hypothesis. Mr. W AXMAN . In other words, your new findings show that MMR is not linked to bowel syndrome and is not linked to autism. Andthis research, combined with the IOM report, really show thatthere is no evidence to support a causal connection between autismand MMR. We have limited resources to devote to this cause. As a public health official and an epidemiologist, do you think that more re-sources should be devoted to investigating the MMR-autism con-nection? Or are there better places to devote our resources? Dr. M ILLER . As I said in my testimony, I think the question of what is the cause of autism \u2014it is a common condition and we need effective treatments \u2014is extremely important to answer. I think that there have already been quite a number of resources devotedto the question of MMR and autism, both looking at the evidenceby expert committees plus individuals like myself doing as best wecan with epidemiological studies. These have been uniformly nega-tive. As I said in my oral testimony, one cannot rule out a rare idio- syncratic response. However, in relation to what is the major causeof autism, I am firmly of the view that MMR has been excludedas a major cause of autism. Therefore, I do not think it would beprofitable to \u2014if you like \u2014hijack the research agenda to con- centrate on answering this question, which is derived basicallyfrom speculation and unsubstantiated and, as yet, still unpublishedevidence in relation to MMR and autism. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you. Dr. Gershon, an important part of Dr. Wakefield 's theory, as I understand it, is that the measles virus persists in the gut. Yetfrom what I understand, no other scientist has been able to rep-licate Dr. Wakefield 's findings of the persistence of measles virus in the gut. Moreover, I also understand that Dr. O 'Leary, Wake- field's associate who does the looking for the measles virus, was tested to see if he could correctly identify measles virus in infectedsamples and he failed that test. Do you know if that is correct? If so, can you explain the signifi- cance VerDate It is correct. And the significance of it is that the evidence we have heard \u2014which is largely unpublished and is not supported or duplicated by other laboratories \u2014is not adequate to support Dr. Wakefield 's hypothesis. So the evidence that the per- sistence of measles virus goes on in the gut is simply unfoundedat the moment. Mr. W AXMAN . Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous con- sent if I could have another 5 minutes to pursue questions becauseI have a conflict and have to run to another meeting. Mr. B URTON . Go ahead. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. Haley, your research demonstrates thimerosal inhibits enzyme activity and that demonstrates that the thimero-sal, in your experience, is dangerous to the enzyme in the petridish. Don't we need to know how much thimerosal is in the vaccine be- fore we know whether it is dangerous to a human being? Dr. H ALEY . Toxicity is always related to dose, but also size, the ability to clear it, the health of the patient, the metabolic status,if they were suffering from a spurious ailment it would be moretoxic. Mr. W AXMAN . So the research you are presenting today does not definitively answer the question of whether the amount of thimero-sal in childhood immunizations is dangerous or not, does it? Dr. H ALEY . That it is dangerous? Mr. W AXMAN . Yes. Dr. H ALEY . I think if you consider the aspect that we are dealing with multiple toxicities and exposures to mercury from a lot of dif-ferent sources that adding an abundance of mercury to a child \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . My question, though, is whether the amount of thi- merosal in the childhood immunizations is dangerous, the amountthat is in there. There may be other exposures. Dr. H ALEY . The amount from the vaccine alone would probably be not enough by the data we have seen. But again, that would de-pend upon the health of the patient you are giving it to. Mr. B URTON . Would the gentleman yield? Mr. W AXMAN . Sure. Mr. B URTON . Is there a cumulative effect of mercury \u2014\u2014 Dr. H ALEY . Yes. Mr. B URTON . In other words, my grandson \u2014and I appreciate you yielding \u2014got nine shots. I think four or five of those shots he got on that 1 day contained mercury. They said that was 41 timeswhat was normal. Would that cumulative effect have an adverse impact?Dr. H ALEY . Absolutely. Mr. B URTON . Did you hear that, Henry? Mr. W AXMAN What was that answer? [Laughter.] Dr. H ALEY . There are a lot of reports out there with infants that have been exposed to excess ethyl mercury generating compounds. Mr. W AXMAN . Are you aware of an abstract study funded by NIH that looked at the blood mercury levels of full-term infants follow-ing the administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines? Dr. H ALEY . Yes, I am. My opinion on that is that blood mercury levels have been considered by many people not to be worth verymuch to the extent of mercury toxicity. It is a retention toxicity. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb I would like to read the conclusion of that abstract. ''Low levels of mercury can be detected in the blood of some full- term infants following the administration of vaccines containingthimerosal. None of the blood mercury levels observed in the stud-ied infants exceeded the most recently revised lowest level of ma-ternal blood mercury considered to represent a potentially signifi-cant exposure to the developing fetus. '' That seems to disagree with your testimony. That seems to be at odds with what you are saying. Dr. H ALEY . If anybody is saying they can look at the level of mer- cury in blood after a vaccination and then come to the assumptionthat this did no harm to that patient, I sincerely disagree withthem. Mr. W AXMAN . Does the research you have represented today prove that the mercury in vaccines causes autism? Dr. H ALEY . Absolutely not. Mr. W AXMAN . In your testimony, you stated that infants cannot clear mercury from their bodies. But a recent study conducted bythe University of Rochester testing mercury in infants found thatmercury was detected in the infants ' feces. Don't these findings prove that infants can clear mercury from their bodies? Dr. H ALEY . I did not say they could not, I said that they could not do it as well. They have reduced bilary transport. It takes awhile for that to develop. And from what I understand, they get thevaccination on the day they are born. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. McDougle, first I want to begin by commend- ing you for the excellent work you are doing to advance our under-standing of how to treat autism. Much of your attention is focusedon determining the causes of autism, and that is important, but itis also important to help individuals and families who are sufferingnow. I understand you are in the middle of a 5-year grant to develop medications to treat the symptoms of autism. Can you give us apreliminary assessment of the effectiveness of some of the medica-tions you are studying? Dr. M CDOUGLE . Yes. I would say that the first study we com- pleted was with a medication called Risparidone. Although theblind has not been broken yet and we are not aware of who wason which placebo or drug, certainly a number of children have im-proved and benefited with particular improvements in the areas ofaggression, self-injury, irritability, and I think has ultimately im-proved their quality of life. Mr. W AXMAN . So some of them are working? Dr. M CDOUGLE . Yes. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and my col- leagues. Mr. B URTON . I hope you did not miss the response from Dr. Haley on that one thing because we have asked this question ofothers when you were not in attendance, and that is that the mer-cury in the vaccines has a cumulative effect. If the child gets eightor nine shots in 1 day, as my grandson did, he is getting an exorbi-tant amount of mercury in one dose. In my grandson 's case, 10 days later he was autistic. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb . I want to thank all the witnesses. For me, person- ally, I am just trying to find out how we can direct our researchfunding better to try to get some answers to some of these ques-tions. Dr. Miller, you described the Public Health Lab as being a non- governmental public body. Do you get funding from the BritishGovernment, though? Dr. M ILLER . Yes, in the same way the National Health Service is funded by the British Government, but we are not an arm of gov-ernment. Our relationship to the Department of Health and Gov-ernment is the same as the UK National Health Service. Mr. W ELDON . Is all your funding from the government? Or does some of it come from other entities? Specifically, does any of itcome from the pharmaceutical industry? Dr. M ILLER . Our core funding comes from the government. As with the National Health Service, researchers like myself apply forfunding from research agencies, research funds from the Depart-ment of Health. I have no commercial interests in any vaccine com-pany. I do not act as a consultant or an advisor to a vaccine com-pany. I do, along with other individuals, have research funds forspecific studies, largely clinical trials, from vaccine companies. Ihave not been sponsored from any of the work that I do on autismfrom vaccine companies. I should say that in relation to the circumstances under which any funding comes from such commercial sources, the legal depart-ment of the Public Health Laboratory Service draws up a verystringent contract with the commercial company to ensure thatthere is total scientific independence of the PHLS in publicationand interpretation of those results. This is a standard procedure fororganizations such as the PHLS. Mr. W ELDON . So you are saying that the funding comes from the British Government and some of it does come from pharmaceuticalcompanies, but you have these \u2014\u2014 Dr. M ILLER . A small amount for specific research projects. I am also an advisor to the Medicine Control Agency, that is similar to the FDA. And as a requirement for that, we have a dec-laration of interest. Should members of the committee wish to seethe funding I have received and for what purposes, then they arefree to view that. I am not sure if it is on the MCA Web site. So there is a full declaration of interest. The ability to provide independent scientific advice is scrutinized by the MCA in relationto the type of financial benefit that is received for research studiesfrom companies. I have not been prevented from having any inputover advisory matters in relation to the research funding that Ihave received. I should say, it is a very small proportion of the total amount I have received for research studies. Mr. W ELDON . It would be very comforting to me if the PHLS would just spend $500,000 and try to recruit 50 kids with autisticspectrum disorder and gastrointestinal symptoms and just scopethem and try to duplicate his findings. It is very little comfort tome, all these epidemiologic studies, because the hypothesis is notthat MMR causes all forms of autism. If you are operating under VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb MMR causes a small percentage of the cases of autism, then that may be very, very difficult to detect in an epi-demiologic study. If the British Government is all concerned about vaccination rates declining because of Wakefield 's findings, why don 't they just scope 50 kids? What is the problem? Dr. M ILLER . I would like to say first of all that you have put your finger on the nub of the question here. I think you have acceptedthat the epidemiological evidence has already excluded MMR as acommon cause of autism. I said in my testimony that it is impos-sible epidemiologically to prove that it could never cause it. So the question is, for how rare an event would you like a study to be set up to exclude or to find that sort of risk? For the purposes of spending public money, if one has excluded MMR as a frequent cause of autism \u2014\u2014 Mr. W ELDON . I would like to interrupt you, because I have a lim- ited amount of time. He came in my office and showed me the pictures. I have spoken to people. I am an internist. These kids have florid inflammatorybowel disease. Why can 't somebody duplicate this study? We have this poor, lone guy coming here constantly, year in and year out. [Laughter.] And Dr. O 'Leary, might I say, is the guy who identified Herpes Simplex Type A. He came here to the NIH and all of the peopleat NIH supposedly dismissed it as being invalid and ultimately itwas found to be true that Herpes Simplex Type A causescarposisarcoma. O 'Leary is a very, very reputable scientist. Why can 't we repeat O 'Leary 's data? Dr. M ILLER . First of all, we have to wait to see the virological findings published in a peer-review journal. As Dr. Gershon said,we have not yet seen those. The Public Health Laboratory Service, as I mentioned, its remit is the national diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention of commu-nicable disease. Autistic enterocolitis, as far as I am aware, is notdemonstrated to be a communicable disease, nor indeed to resultfrom vaccination. Now whether there is a syndrome called autistic enterocolitis which has distinctive pathological features, fenotific presentation isanother question. And maybe gastroenterologists, in combinationwith autism experts should be looking at that. It is not a questionfor PHLS. Mr. W ELDON . The responsibility to duplicate his work is not something that your department would \u2014\u2014 Dr. M ILLER . Our responsibility would relate to the question, if there is such a syndrome, Is there evidence that it is associatedwith MMR? Analyses of that has come to the conclusion that no \u2014whether or not there is such a syndrome, whether or not it has relevance tothe current prevalence of autism is another question, and academic institutions with expert gastroenterologists and autism expertsmay indeed be looking at this. I would say the Medical Research Council has funded a large study to look at the question of etiology of autism and what the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 are to try to throw some light on it, but it is not a ques- tion related to vaccines or communicable disease. Mr. W ELDON . I have some questions for Dr. Gershon. This is not published, but I have been told by some of the people doing research in treating children with autism that a substantialpercentage of them do have elevation in their liver function tests. If that were published and proved to be true, would that affect your opinion regarding this theory of these neuroactive peptides? Dr. G ERSHON . It would affect my opinion if the elevation of liver function tests were such that it would affect the ability of the liverto act as a filter. Mr. W ELDON . So you would want to see very significant ele- vations, not very mild elevations. Dr. G ERSHON . For example, jaundice. Mr. W ELDON . You would want to see jaundice? Dr. G ERSHON . I would like to see some evidence that the liver is failing in its job as a filter. I would also like to have some evidencethat material is moving from into the gut from the body. I wouldlike to see some evidence that the intestinal epithelial barrier isfailing. And I would like to see some mechanism to get whatevertoxins are so-called absorbed through the blood-brain barrier. Mr. W ELDON . Regarding the blood-brain barrier, it was brought to my attention that a Dr. Connolly published in the Journal of Pe-diatrics in May 1999. Maybe you might be familiar with this study.The title of the article was ''Serum Autoantibodies to Brain in Lan- dau-Klefner Variant, Autism, and Other Neurologic Disorders. '' It was basically showing antibodies to brain endothelium. Are you familiar with that study at all?Dr. G ERSHON . I have seen the study. Mr. W ELDON . That does not affect your opinion at all about this theory? That study has no impact? To me, that study suggests that there could be a possible link and explanation here. I am not saying there is, as a scientist my-self. I think I would want to see more research. But you dismissthe theory outright, and that study suggested to me that in someof these kids there may actually be a breakdown in the blood-brainbarrier. Dr. G ERSHON . That study did not demonstrate a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier. It showed autoantibodies. That is a dif-ferent issue. The existence of antibodies \u2014it could be an autoimmune mecha- nism, I guess, is what you are implying \u2014that helps to break the blood-brain barrier down. There could be a lot of things. Every step along the way, an improbable event could happen. But there are a lot of steps along the way. I would like to direct your attention to two other points. One part of my testimony and one further one. I pointed out that there are alternative mechanisms by which to explain the association between bowel disease and autism. Oneneed not postulate a set of improbable mechanisms to get toxinsinto the brain. The bowel and the brain communicate by othermeans. The fact that both are involved in autism is, to me, estab-lished. As I said at the outset, Professor Wakefield is to be com-mended for publicizing that. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 other hand, I do not think it is established that the rea- son for the link is MMR. The bowel has many mechanisms of af-fecting the brain and the brain the bowel. The same disease, au-tism, can give rise to symptoms in both places. The other thing, in regard to what you said about scoping \u2014if the British Government or our Government were to scope a lot of chil-dren and find inflammation in the bowel, I would expect that theywould in fact find that. Nobody, to my knowledge, is quarrellingwith the aspect of what Dr. Wakefield has published, which is thatsome children with autism have in fact inflammatory bowel dis-ease. That is not in contention. What is in contention is that re-sulted from MMR and that there is persistent measles virus in it,that what they detect is not just passenger leftover from the vac-cine that is not real virus. It is very hard to show that. And Professor O 'Leary \u2014I am not saying he is not a good molecular biologist. I think he is an excel-lent molecular biologist. But when asked with coded samples thatwere sent to him by Michael Oldstone to show that he could detectthese low copy numbers which are postulated, he did not pass thetest. He identified successive samples differently on different occa-sions. He missed some diagnoses. When there were very largeamounts of measles virus, he could detect it, as could everybodyelse. And here we have a situation where other laboratories are trying to duplicate this finding of measles virus, and they are not doingit. Yet this laboratory has failed the test of coded samples to do it. Mr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman, could we have Dr. Wakefield? Mr. B URTON . Dr. Wakefield. Dr. W AKEFIELD . I am sorry, I have to take issue with that. That is a complete misrepresentation of the data. First, Dr. Gershon suggests that other people have looked in the intestine of these children for the detection of measles virus. Noone has done that, to my knowledge. So the only laboratory thathas looked in the intestinal biopsies of these children is Dr.O'Leary 's laboratory. Other people have looked in the intestines of children with Crohn 's Disease for evidence of measles virus, which we have suggested. Indeed, one of the people on the panel of theIOM presented data at the American Academy of Pediatrics lastJune showing that they had could identify measles virus geneticmaterial in children with Crohn 's Disease and some controls. I want that to go on record. That has been presented.So independently groups from Canada and from Japan have found measles virus in the intestines of children with inflammatorybowel disease. The issue of the study with Michael Oldstone was not as it was portrayed. I am very, very concerned that Michael Oldstone shouldbreach confidence of data that has not been presented in anyforum, and has not even actually been finally analyzed. But in factwhen they did analyze them, the only discrepancy was that there was no contamination at all, but a very, very, very low copy num-ber of the virus, which the tacman PCR system \u2014which Dr. O 'Leary helped develop \u2014detects the virus found that they might be able to detect it in two out of three samples. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb merely a function of low copy viral detection. It is now a function of the ability of us to find viruses in vanishing smallamounts with technology that is not available in Dr. Oldstone 's lab. So the data have not been presented fairly, and I want that to goon record. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Weldon, you can keep the time, but I want to make a comment or two because I have no more questions for thepanel. Then I will let you conclude the questioning. A lot of kids are ruined for life. I detect a close-minded attitude on something that is so important \u2014not to one child, my grandson, but to hundreds of thousands of kids. Every 3 hours in California \u2014 it was every 6 hours just about a year ago \u2014but every 3 hours in California, there is a new child with autism. Every 3 hours. It is a horrible, horrible thing to have to live with, not just for the child but for the parents, the grandparents, and everybody else,not to mention the cost. So we have some people that have a closed mind about various theories about this. I think this is a time for everybody to be opento almost any theory, if it is cost-effective, to look at it to see if itcan be proved or disproved. I want to tell you a story. Louis Pasteur was kicked out of the medical profession and ostracized for 17 years and then he wasknighted. And it was because everybody had a closed mind. I have a very good friend who lives in Australia. His name is Dr. Barry Marshall. I do not know if you have ever heard of him ornot. But I went to Africa and I was in the jungles of Angola andI came down with a bug, I thought, because I could not eat any-thing or keep it down for 2 years. It was awful. So I went to gastro-enterologists. I went to several of them. And they all said it wasmy nerves and strain on my body. They gave me Zantac andPrilosec and everything else under the sun. Then I read this article about this guy named Barry Marshall. I think it was in one of the major publications. He was a scientistdoctor from Australia. He said that the stomach problems in 90percent of the people in the world was caused by a bacteria. Every-body said that a bacteria cannot live in the stomach. He went and gave a speech to a symposium in Belgium. After he gave the speech \u2014or right near the end \u2014they literally started laughing at him because it was impossible for a bacteria to live inthe lining of the stomach and he was crazy. So he went home anddrank the bacteria \u2014not unlike what Louis Pasteur did. He went home and drank it and got deathly ill and cured himself with thecombination that he gave me. I went down to see him after 2 years of suffering and he tested me. My doctor said I didn 't have that. But I went to see him and he gave me this concoction of bismuth and antibiotics and some-thing else. I took it for 2 weeks and I have not had a problem since. But the close-minded doctors who were experts, who had all the answers, told me that I could not be cured, that I had to take these stomach pills for the rest of my life. All I can tell you is that wehave a problem with kids that is humongous. It is going to affectthe whole world if we do not do something because we are vaccinat-ing kids all over the world. If mercury or the MMR vaccine or VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 is is causing it, we need to find out and we need to find out pretty darn quickly. For people to have closed minds when 1 out of 150 or 200 kids in Oregon or 1 out of 400 in the United States or 1 in 500 in theUnited Kingdom are coming down with autism is almost criminal.You ought to explore everything to find out what the answer is. With that, I will shut up.[Applause.]Mr. B URTON . Dr. Weldon. Mr. W ELDON . I just have a couple of quick followup questions. Dr. Wakefield, Dr. O 'Leary came in my office and showed me his PCR data, all the different versions of that. I think he ran eightdifferent types of tests. Why hasn 't that been published yet? We have had Dr. Gershon point that out repeatedly that it has notbeen published. What is the problem? Dr. W AKEFIELD . There is no problem. It is being presented for the first time at the American Gastroenterological Association inAtlanta in May. It has been peer-reviewed and we will see howthat goes. But it is awaiting publication at the moment. We have been asked to provide strain-specific sequencing. In other words, the acceptance is that the virus may well be there. Isat down with Michael Oldstone himself who said that he acceptedthat we found the virus. NIH 's measles expert who came to trouble- shoot this said that the virus is there. But the reviewers haveasked for strain-specific sequencing. Those studies are being con-ducted at the moment and we will put those into the papers. It isan entirely reasonable question and one that we are answering. Mr. W ELDON . So you expect publication after that issue is de- cided? Dr. W AKEFIELD . Once we have addressed that issue, yes. Mr. W ELDON . Just one more question for you, Dr. Miller. Were you on the original panel that approved the MMR in Eng- land? Dr. M ILLER . No, I had no role in that at all. Mr. W ELDON . That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I want to thank you all very much. You have been very patient. You have been sitting for a long time. You have beenvery helpful. We will submit all your statements and all your comments to the health agencies here. We will continue to fight on to try to find asolution to this problem, with your help. Thank you.We have one more witness who could not be with us tomorrow, Dr. McCormick from the Institute of Medicine. She is the chairmanwho did the report that we had heard about. Dr. Weldon, you can stay for Dr. McCormick, I hope. She was the chairman of the committee that did the report that was recently re-leased. I need you. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. B URTON . Do you have an opening statement, Dr. McCor- mick? Dr. M CCORMICK . Yes, I do. URTON . You recognized. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 MCCORMICK, MDSCD, CHAIR, COMMIT- TEE ON IMMUNIZATION SAFETY REVIEW, INSTITUTE OFMEDICINE, ACCOMPANIED BY WILLIAM COLGLAZIER, EXEC-UTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES; ANDSUSANNE STOIBER, EXECUTIVE OFFICER Dr. M CCORMICK . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Marie McCormick. I am a professor and Chair of the Department of Maternal and Child Health at Harvard School ofPublic Health and I Chair the Institute of Medicine 's Committee on Immunization Safety Review, which released its report on MMRVaccine and Autism on Monday, April 23rd. I appreciate the oppor-tunity to provide testimony to you based on the findings of this re-port. A copy of my testimony and the executive summary has beensubmitted for the record. Dr. William Colglazier, executive officer of the National Academy of Sciences, and Ms. Susanne Stoiber, executive officer of the Insti-tute of Medicine accompany me. As I mentioned, two committee members are here, Dr. Steve Goodman and Dr. Constantine Gatsonis. The genesis of this report was a December 1999 discussion be- tween the CDC and the IOM regarding the need for an independ-ent group to examine vaccine safety concerns. The CDC and NIHformally engaged the services of the Institute of Medicine in Sep-tember 2000, which in turn appointed the committee in November2000. The committee is comprised of 15 members with expertise in pe- diatrics, immunology, neurology, infectious disease, epidemiology,biostatistics, public health, genetics, ethics, risk perception, andcommunication. To preclude any real or perceived conflicts of inter-est, committee members were subject to strict selection criteriathat excluded anyone who had participated in research on vaccinesafety, received funding from vaccine manufacturers or their parentcompanies, or served on vaccine advisory committees. The committee is charged with examining three vaccine safety issues each year for 3 years. The committee was asked to assessthe scientific plausibility of the safety concern, the significance ofthe issue in a broader social context, and to suggest appropriate ac-tions. The first hypothesis the committee was asked to consider isthe linkage between MMR vaccine and autism. The MMR vaccine has been extremely successful in virtually eliminating measles, mumps, and rubella in the United States.Measles cases, for example, dropped from over 400,000 per year inthe pre-vaccine era to only 100 in 1999. Some are concerned, though, that the MMR vaccine might cause autistic spectrum disorders. These are incurable, permanent, andserious developmental problems in children and adults. Scientistsgenerally agree that most cases of autistic spectrum disorders re-sult from events that occur in the prenatal period or shortly afterbirth. However, concern arises about the MMR vaccine because au-tistic symptoms typically become more evident in the child 's second year, about the same time the MMR vaccine is first administered. A growing body of work has examined this subject. In a study published in the Lancet in 1998, researchers describe 12 children VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb problems, including autism, shortly after receiving the MMR vaccine. Since then, this group and others havefurther examined this potential relationship. To evaluate the hypothesis on MMR vaccine and autistic spec- trum disorders, the committee conducted an extensive review of thepublished, peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature. We heldan open scientific meeting including a broad group of researchersand vaccine safety advocates. Finally, a working group of the com-mittee conferred with parents of autistic children and vaccine safe-ty advocates to discuss their concerns. The committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship at the population level between MMR vaccineand autistic spectrum disorders. The committee bases this conclu-sion on the following evidence: a consistent body of epidemiologicalevidence shows no association at a population level between MMRvaccine and autistic spectrum disorders; the original case series ofchildren with autistic spectrum disorders and bowel symptoms andother available case reports are uninformative with respect to cau-sality; biologic models are fragmentary; and there is no relevantanimal model. However, the committee notes that its conclusion does not ex- clude the possibility that MMR vaccine could in rare cases contrib-ute to autistic spectrum disorders resulting in a very small numberof affected children. This possibility arises because the epidemiolog-ical evidence lacks the precision to assess rare occurrences and theproposed biological models, although far from established, are nev-ertheless not disproved. In its significance assessment, the committee considered the bur- den of measles, mumps, and rubella infections, the burden of autis-tic spectrum disorders, and the level of public concern. Measles,mumps, and rubella can lead to significant morbidity and mortalityand treatment of these diseases is limited. Outbreaks of measles, mumps, or rubella disease could easily occur now were MMR immunization rates to decline as a result offears about MMR. Yet, because MMR vaccine is a mandatory vac-cine that is administered to healthy children \u2014in part, as a public health measure to protect others \u2014the responsibility of the Govern- ment to ensure the safety of the vaccine is high. The burden of au-tism, an incurable and serious disorder, requires consideration ofall possible etiologies. In addition, the level of public concern aboutMMR vaccine safety is high. Because of the limitations of the evidence, the significant public concern surrounding the issue, the risk of disease outbreaks if im-munization rates fall, and the burden of autism, the committee rec-ommends that further attention be given to this matter. Specific recommendations regarding policy review, research and surveillance, and communication follow. In terms of policy review, the committee does not recommend a policy review at this time of the licensure of the MMR vaccine orof the current schedule and recommendations for administration ofMMR. The committee concludes that further targeted research on the possible contribution of MMR vaccine to autistic spectrum dis-orders in some children is warranted. For example: use accepted VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 assessment protocols for autistic spectrum dis- orders to enhance the precision and comparability of research re-sults; explore whether exposure to MMR vaccine is a risk factor forautistic spectrum disorders in some children; explore whether mea-sles vaccine-strain virus is present in the intestines of some autis-tic children; and encourage all who submit reports tot he VaccineAdverse Event Reporting System about MMR vaccine and autismto provide as much detail and documentation as possible. The committee heard from parents that obtaining unbiased and accurate information on the possible relationship between MMRvaccine and autistic spectrum disorder has been difficult. The com-mittee recommends that governmental and professional organiza-tions, CDC and the FDA in particular, review some of the mostprominent forms of communication regarding the relationship be-tween MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder. Direct inputfrom parents and other stakeholders would be invaluable in con-ducting an evaluation of communication tools. In its discussion of recommendations, the committee identified more general concerns that it could not adequately address in thisreport. It intends to address these in the future. This concludes my oral statement and I would be happy to an- swer any questions. [N OTE.\u2014A copy of the Institute of Medicine publication entitled, ''Immunization Safety Review, '' may be found in committee files, or obtained by calling the National Academy Press at 1 -800-624- 6242.] [The prepared statement of Dr. Dr. McCormick. What does this mean? ''However, the committee notes that its conclusion does not exclude the possibility that MMR vaccine couldcontribute to ASD in a small number of children because the epide-miological evidence lacks the precision to assess rare occurrences ofa response to MMR vaccine leading to ASD and the proposed bio-logical models linking MMR vaccine to ASD, although far from es-tablished, are nevertheless not disproved. '' What does that mean?Dr. M CCORMICK . What that means, I think is what Dr. Miller said, that the level of analysis you are able to do could not rule outrare occurrences. In terms of the biological model, we were talking specifically about the type of evidence Dr. Wakefield had presented. Unfortu-nately, because it was an open meeting, Dr. Wakefield was reluc-tant to present his full range of data because it would also haveto be put out on the Web and it was considered pre-published. Mr. B URTON . I understand, and I do not want to cut you off, I just want to bear on this question. On television all across the country, we saw yesterday that our health agencies and your committee said that the MMR vaccinewas not going to be a contributing factor and could not cause au-tism. Dr. M CCORMICK . Based on the evidence that we got to the com- mittee, that is true. Mr. B URTON . What does this mean, that you just said? Dr. M CCORMICK . We are leaving the door open for additional evi- dence because we could not hear the evidence that was being pre-sented. We were not provided the evidence on the presence of mea-sles vaccine. It does not mean that that whole theory is going tobe proven, we are just saying \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Let me read this to you again, ''although far from established, are nevertheless not disproved. '' So what you are saying is that the causal link is not disproved. Is that right? Dr. M CCORMICK . No, we are saying it is not established. Mr. B URTON . But you are saying that it is not disproved. Dr. M CCORMICK . It is not established, either. Mr. B URTON . So you do not know, do you? Can you say categori- cally, 100 percent, that the MMR vaccine is not a contributing fac-tor to autism? Can you say that? Dr. M CCORMICK . No, because we said in rare cases. Mr. B URTON . That is the point. You put out a report to the peo- ple of this country saying that it does not cause autism, there isno causal link, and then you have an out in the back of the thing.You cannot tell me, the committee chairman, under oath, thatthere is no causal link because you just do not know, do you? Dr. M CCORMICK . Because in part we were not provided the evidence \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Do you know? Dr. M CCORMICK . I do not know. Mr. B URTON . Then why did you say so in the report? Dr. M CCORMICK . Because the bulk of the evidence \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb the bulk of the evidence? But you do not know. You just said that. Dr. M CCORMICK . In fact, most of the reports I saw indicated that. Mr. B URTON . Do you know what it is like to have an autistic child? Dr. M CCORMICK . I do. Mr. B URTON . You have an autistic child? Dr. M CCORMICK . No. My brother has two. Mr. B URTON . Your brother has two? Dr. M CCORMICK . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Then you know what he goes through? Dr. M CCORMICK . Yes. Mr. B URTON . Do you know how many kids are getting autism? Every 3 hours in California, there is a new child with autism. Itused to be every 6 hours. You used to have 1 out of every 10,000kids who were autistic. We do not know all the answers. We do not know if the mercury, the thimerosal in the vaccinations are causing autism. You do notknow for sure whether the MMR vaccine is causing autism. Dr. M CCORMICK . I know it is not causing most of the cases of au- tism. Mr. B URTON . But the point is, if you are the one that it does cause \u2014if your child is the one that does get it and we find out there is a causal link, isn 't that awful? Isn 't that awful? I just have to tell you, as I said to the last panel \u2014and you heard what I said about Louis Pasteur and Dr. Barry Marshall, didn 't you? Dr. M CCORMICK . Yes. Mr. B URTON . This is such a serious thing with hundreds of thou- sands of people that are going to be autistic and be a burden onsociety for the rest of their lives, it is going to cost us trillions ofdollars \u2014when you talk about 1 in 250 or 500 kids \u2014they are going to grow up and they are going to be a burden on society. We shouldnot close the door to any avenue of research to find out what iscausing that. It is not being caused just by genetics, I do not believe, because you are having a huge quantum increase in it. Something is caus-ing it and we ought to be open to everything. Dr. M CCORMICK . In fact, the report, sir, does recommend contin- ued attention to this linkage. Mr. B URTON . I know, but that is not the point. Of course, I read that. But most people in this country did not. All they heard on television was that there is no causal link, none.I heard doctors saying that this has been studied by experts notconnected to the pharmaceutical industry. Now let me ask another question, because this is pretty impor- tant, too. You sent this report out to a group of people to look at, didn 't you? Dr. M CCORMICK . I did not send out the report. Mr. B URTON . Somebody sent it out, did they not? Ms. S TOIBER . I am sorry. I would answer those questions because the committee is not responsible, the Institution is. Mr. B URTON . Stand up and be sworn. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you send out the report to be reviewed? Ms. S TOIBER . Not personally, but institutionally, we sent out the report. Mr. B URTON . And you sent it to Linda Cowan, Eric Fombonne, Neal Halsey, Samuel Katz, among others, right? Ms. S TOIBER . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . Neal Halsey and Samuel Katz are people that do not subscribe to the theory that the MMR vaccine might be a con-tributing factor, right? Ms. S TOIBER . I have no idea, sir, what they subscribe to. Mr. B URTON . Well, let me tell you they do. Those two people do not believe that the MMR vaccine is a contributing factor to au-tism. You sent it to them for review, and I presume they went through it and might have made some modifications \u2014I do not know \u2014but you did not send it to Dr. Wakefield who is on the other side ofthe issue. Why? Ms. S TOIBER . When we select a review panel \u2014and there are 15 reviewers to this report \u2014we try to select people from all sides of an issue, those who believe there are connections and those whobelieve there may not be connections. I think in fact there are threereviewers that were specifically selected because they have the con-fidence and have been engaged in the research that would in factbe supported by the advocates of this connection. We take into account all of the reviews carefully. The reviewer 's comments are blinded. We do not know who they are when we re-ceive them. And no reviewer ever has the power to change a wordin our report. Mr. B URTON . Were any of these people presenters at the con- ference? Ms. S TOIBER . Yes, two of the people were. Mr. B URTON . Who were they? Ms. S TOIBER . Dr. Fombonne and Dr. Miller. Mr. B URTON . Did Dr. Halsey or Katz, either one, present? Ms. S TOIBER . They did not. Mr. B URTON . They did not? Ms. S TOIBER . No. Mr. B URTON . Halsey and Katz have financial interests in phar- maceutical companies. Fombonne and Miller did present? Ms. S TOIBER . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . And they did not agree with the thesis \u2014\u2014 Ms. S TOIBER . I am sorry. Dr. Miller did not present. It was Dr. Volkmar, Ward, and Fombonne. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Fombonne was one of the people who reviewed it and he was a presenter on the other side of the issue, as I recall.He believed the MMR vaccine was not in any way associated withthe autism. Ms. S TOIBER . He reported the results of his study, which showed no association. Mr. B URTON . And Dr. Wakefield was on the other side of the issue. He was a presenter, as well, but he was not given a copy ofthis to review. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 The reviewers, sir, were not selected because they were presenters, but were selected because they represented a widespectrum of views on the subject. The fact that two of them alsopresented was totally coincidental and they were selected for theirability to provide a broad assessment of the evidence. Again, we tried to balance, always, the reviewers selected so that those who have opposing views are equally and well representedamong the reviewers. Mr. B URTON . Do you know if any of the people that reviewed it \u2014 other than the ones I mentioned \u2014had financial interests or connec- tions with any pharmaceutical companies that produced the MMRvaccine? Ms. S TOIBER . To the best of our knowledge, they do not. In fact, we do not do the same kind of extensive review of the financialholdings of reviewers that we do of committee members. But to thebest of our knowledge, aside from the fact that they may own mu-tual funds that hold pharmaceutical stocks, there is no reason tobelieve there are any financial ties. Mr. B URTON . In the past, we have subpoenaed from the health agencies \u2014and we are still going through them \u2014the financial dis- closure forms of people in the decisionmaking process who makedecisions on these vaccines. So therefore I would like to know \u2014and we would like for the Institute of Medicine to contact the people onthe review committee and ask them to submit to us any holdingsthey have in pharmaceutical companies. If I have to, I will sub-poena that. Would you tell them? And any that are connected with an insti- tution that gets grants from the pharmaceutical companies. Ms. S TOIBER . I will first say, sir, that they are not in a decision- making process. Mr. B URTON . I understand. They were in the review process. Ms. S TOIBER . They solely reviewed. And after their reviews were received, the committee had the ability to assess whether or not toaccept any of that advice. Some was accepted and some was re-jected. Mr. B URTON . When it was accepted, did it involve any changes? Ms. S TOIBER . Very few. Mr. B URTON . Were any changes made after \u2014\u2014 Ms. S TOIBER . Always changes are made in response to review be- cause reviewers point out weaknesses in the analysis, they pointout lack of clarity in the expression, but I can say to you that nocentral conclusions changed during the course of review. Mr. B URTON . We will take a look at that and I will make the de- cision on that after I review all this. But I want to know about thereviewers and what recommendations they made and changes. Iwould like to have that. I would also like to know whether or notthey had any interest or got any grants of any kind from any phar-maceutical companies. I would also like to have that informationfrom any of the people on the original report panel. According to our request, we wanted to make sure that these people are insulted who are working on this report from any influ-ence being exerted by any pharmaceutical company. I would like tofind out if any of the people who were on that panel who wrote the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb they have any financial interest or ties and whether they got any grants from any pharmaceutical companies. I wish you would take that request back to the agency and tell them that, if necessary, we will be glad to send them a subpoenato get this information. Ms. S TOIBER . I can assure you that no member of the committee has any financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. B URTON . How about grants? Ms. S TOIBER . Or grants. I do not have the authority to tell you that we can deliver the financial background of reviewers, but Iwill certainly take that back the Academy and assess it and getback to you. Mr. B URTON . You can tell them that I would like to have it and if they choose not to send it, I will send them a subpoena and Iwill get it. Ms. S TOIBER . I think we do not have the detailed financial state- ments of the reviewers. Mr. B URTON . Then how can you tell me right now that they do not have any financial interests? Ms. S TOIBER . Of the reviewers. Mr. B URTON . How about the people on the panel? Ms. S TOIBER . For those on the panel, we have extensive financial disclosure. Mr. B URTON . Then I want it. Ms. S TOIBER . What we do not have is the same kind of informa- tion for people who served as reviewers. Mr. B URTON . We want that and we want to know if they got any grants of any kind from any of the pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Weldon, sorry to take so much time.Mr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to intro- duce for the record a statement from the Middlebrook Family ofIndialantic, FL, in my congressional district, who have struggledwith autism. Mr. B URTON . Without objection, that prepared statement will ap- pear in the record. [The prepared statement of Mr. and Mrs. Middlebrook follows:] VerDate McCormick, you were quoted on CNN as say- ing that the MMR vaccine is as safe as a vaccine can get. Is thatcorrect? Dr. M CCORMICK . Yes. Mr. W ELDON . If you were to find that the data, that the epi- demiologic studies that have been quoted today \u2014which I assume you reviewed and that played a key role in your decisionmakingprocess \u2014correct me if I am wrong. Dr. M CCORMICK . We were not aware of Dr. Miller 's study at the time of the decision. Mr. W ELDON . How about the Taylor study? Dr. M CCORMICK . Taylor, yes. Mr. W ELDON . If you were to find that any of that data was defec- tive, would that affect your opinion on the safety of the MMR vac-cine? Dr. M CCORMICK . First, I think in terms of the statement that it is as safe as any vaccine can be, it is made with the understandingthat all vaccines carry some degree of risk and side effects. Mr. W ELDON . Right. Dr. M CCORMICK . We carefully looked over that epidemiologic data twice. Not only did we have a prepared review, but both Dr.Goodman and Dr. Gatsonis looked at that information again sepa-rately to look at the quality of that information. I think any single study can be critiqued. It was the fact that there were multiple studies with different kinds of designs, lookingat different populations, addressing different parts of the pie, andall the results came out the same way. It was the consistency ofcross-studies that was impressive, not that any single study couldnot have been critiqued as not having addressed all issues. Mr. W ELDON . Were you looking at their studies or their raw data? Dr. M CCORMICK . We were looking at the studies. Mr. W ELDON . Did you have access to the data? Dr. M CCORMICK . No. Mr. W ELDON . The committee has asked for the data and it has not been made available to us. Dr. M CCORMICK . We did not have the data. Mr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman, that is the only question I have. Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask one or two more questions. I have here a list of the people that were on the committee. The University of Washington School of Medicine, Christopher Wilson \u2014 he is a professor there. Does the University of Washington Schoolof Medicine get any grants from any pharmaceutical companies? Or how about Alfred Berg, University of Washington? Or Bennet Shaywitz, Yale University? Or Gerald Medoff, professor of medicineand microbiology at Washington University School of Medicine? OrColumbia? Or Michigan? Or George Washington? All those schools get grants from pharmaceutical companies, don't they? And don 't those people who work for those universities that get those grants know those grants are paying for a lot of theresearch they are doing? Ms. S TOIBER . Our bias and conflict of interest excludes only the personal situation of the individual serving on the committee, theirgrant support or grant support in their immediate labs. Clearly, it VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb difficult to compose a committee of experts if you ex- cluded every University in the country because they receive somegrant somewhere in the university from the pharmaceutical indus-try. Mr. B URTON . I understand that. But the problem is, if you are getting a large grant from a pharmaceutical company, and youknow that your laboratory at whatever facility you are working ator employed by is getting that grant, and you know that they havean interest in the decision being made, don 't you think that would wear a little bit on the processes on the people on the commission? Ms. S TOIBER . I genuinely do not. I think these individuals took this as the very highest level of responsibility to look at the scienceon its face and were not influenced by external factors of that na-ture. But clearly opinions could differ on that. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Mr. Waxman.Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. McCormick, a number of times during this hearing Mr. Burton has impugned the integrity of the Institute ofMedicine 's committee. As I understand it, the committee estab- lished strict criteria for committee membership. No one with anyties to vaccine manufacturers or their parent companies was al-lowed to be on the committee. No one who had ever served on avaccine advisory committee was allowed to be on the committee.Even people who had provided expert testimony or had publishedabout vaccine safety were excluded from the committee. Yet the chairman insists that the report is tainted by bias. He says that after the committee wrote the report the Institute sentit out to a panel of reviewers that contained individuals with con-flicts of interest and that those individuals have biased this report. My understanding is that reputable, published scientific findings need to go through a review process. Is that correct? Dr. M CCORMICK . I would defer to Ms. Stoiber, who has been an- swering these questions on institutional policy. Ms. S TOIBER . But I think he was asking about peer review gen- erally. Mr. W AXMAN . If you have a reputable, published scientific find- ing, doesn 't that need to go through a review process? Dr. M CCORMICK . Absolutely. Mr. W AXMAN . In fact, it would have been irresponsible not to have the report reviewed. Isn 't that correct? Dr. A MARAL . I think that is one of the safeguards of the Institute of Medicine, that there is such an extensive review of reports. Mr. W AXMAN . Was this review process any different from the process of publishing an article in a peer-reviewed journal? Dr. M CCORMICK . It is much more extensive. It is much more crit- ical. Mr. W AXMAN . The chairman also continues to say that the report changed after this review process. Is this true? Dr. M CCORMICK . There were changes of fact, there were some changes of wording to more appropriate wording. There was nochange in the overarching conclusions of the report. Mr. W AXMAN . Did the committee 's recommendation change after it received the reviewer 's comments? Dr. M CCORMICK . No. VerDate If a parent came to you with concerns about the safety of the MMR vaccine, after hearing all the evidence presentedto the panel and after hearing the deliberations of the panel, whatadvice would you give to that parent about whether to vaccinatetheir child? Dr. M CCORMICK . I would give the advice that the child should be vaccinated. The risks of measles far outweigh the risks for autism.We are talking about risks of death, risks of severe chronic demen-tia called SSPE. These risks are real and documented as a resultof wild-type virus. I think the risks of MMR and autism should continue to be ex- plored, but I do not think that MMR causes even the bulk of au-tism. The committee did not feel they had enough informationthemselves to make that kind of assessment, but that is my per-sonal view. The risks of wild-type measles are real. Mr. W AXMAN . I said in my opening statement that the committee concluded that there is ''no credible scientific evidence establishing a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. '' Is that a correct characterization of the committee 's conclusions? Dr. M CCORMICK . Yes. Mr. W AXMAN . In Chairman Burton 's opening statement, he stat- ed that ''the committee found that there was insufficient evidence to prove conclusively or disprove a connection between the MMRvaccine and acquired autism. '' That seems to me to be a gross mischaracterization of the com- mittee 's findings. The committee could have chosen to say that there was inadequate evidence, but you did not say that. You saidthat the evidence favors a rejection of a causal connection betweenthe MMR vaccine and autism. Why did the committee say that the evidence conflicts with the theory that the MMR vaccine causes autism? Dr. M CCORMICK . The theory really has not been substantiated with a full chain of evidence. As I mentioned earlier when you werenot present, Dr. Wakefield was unable to present his full data be-cause he was reluctant to present it in a public setting before itwas peer-reviewed. We left the door open that should such datacome in and look more solid and that there was a causal chain wewould clearly relook at the results. But it seemed to be a long wayaway before that kind of causal linkage was not only establishedbut replicated in other laboratories. Mr. W AXMAN . The Institute of Medicine report also states ''its conclusion does not exclude the possibility that MMR vaccine couldcontribute to ASD in a small number of children. '' Mr. Burton reads this and draws the conclusion that there is a lot of uncertainty about the safety of the MMR vaccine. Do youagree with this? Do you think the science raises serious questionsabout the safety of MMR? Dr. M CCORMICK . No. Mr. W AXMAN . When I read the report, I draw a different conclu- sion than the chairman. We all know that it is very hard to provea negative. My understanding is that the Institute is saying thatit could not prove a negative. Is that correct? Dr. M CCORMICK . That is correct. VerDate does not make MMR a likely cause of autism. It does not even make the MMR theory an untested hypothesis.Rather, the theory has been examined and all the epidemiologicalevidence points toward rejection. Is that correct? Dr. M CCORMICK . That is correct. Mr. W AXMAN . My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . But you cannot say categorically that the MMR vaccine does not cause, in any causes, autism, can you? Dr. M CCORMICK . No, that is what the statement says. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Let me just ask you two more questions.If it is true that autistic children do not get proper medical eval- uations to assess if they have gastrointestinal and immune systemdisregulation, as pointed out by Dr. Wakefield, how can the IOMcommittee conclude that the percentage of children with autismcaused by MMR is small? Dr. M CCORMICK . Because the bulk of the epidemiological evi- dence shows no causal connection on a population basis. In terms of the investigations Dr. Wakefield has recommended, we, too, like Dr. Gershon, really applauded Dr. Wakefield for ex-panding the notions of what the problems are that these childrenhave. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Weldon said to the people from England, why don't you just take a look at 50 or 100 or 500 kids that have autism and gastrointestinal problems and check to see if the thesis is cor-rect? Why not do that? Dr. M CCORMICK . We recommended continue attention to that and for duplication of the results in the report. That was one of therecommendations. Mr. B URTON . If that is one of the recommendations, that research is necessary, why would you put out a report that everybody in thecountry that was interested in this heard on television saying thatthere was no causal link, period. That is all we heard. I watchedevery channel and they all said the same thing, that there is nocausal link. Yet you just said that you cannot make a categorical statement like that. That confuses a lot of people and it raises uncertainty even to a higher level because people want to trust the Government and thiscreates doubt. I have one more question for you.Since there has been a published report of vaccine-strain measles causing encephalitis in a healthy child, why was it stated in theIOM report that no such data existed? Dr. M CCORMICK . We did cite it. It was found that after the pri- mary hospitalization these children were found to have a primaryimmune deficiency so that they were not previously healthy chil-dren. Mr. B URTON . Would you give me that one more time? Dr. M CCORMICK . After hospitalization, the patient that had this measles-strain encephalitis was found to have a primary immunedeficiency with a decreased CD -8 count and hypogammaglobulin. So the inflammation was thought to be due to immune deficiency. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb So if a child has an immune deficiency, then they are at risk for an adverse event? Dr. M CCORMICK . Children with immune deficiency are at risk of a wide variety of adverse effects. Mr. B URTON . From the MMR vaccine? Dr. M CCORMICK . Not necessarily. It depends on the nature of the immune deficiency. Mr. B URTON . Well, I want to thank you very much for being here. I do want to say, though, that because this is such an epidemic,I think our health agencies ought to look at every possible avenue,and follow every possible avenue, to find out if this is why we havethis fantastic increase. In Mr. Waxman 's district in California, every 3 hours there is a new case of autism. It used to be one in every 6 hours, as youheard earlier. Nobody seems to have any idea why. To rule out anything and then say at the end that in some cases it may not be conclusive when you do not have all the facts yet \u2014 you have not done a study on kid 's guts that have autism to see if that measles vaccine is in there. It seems to me that is givinginformation that is not completely factual and closing a door thatprobably should not yet be closed. Also, on the mercury vaccine \u2014which you do not have anything to do with \u2014\u2014 Dr. M CCORMICK . Oh, yes, we do. Mr. B URTON . You will be working on the thimerosal issue? Dr. M CCORMICK . That is our next report. Mr. B URTON . Well, I hope you will be very, very thorough and careful when you do that report because we will have you backhere again and ask you about that. It will be a very thorough hear-ing once again. And I have to tell you that in our own family \u2014and I know there are lot of people in this room who have autistic children and grand-children \u2014a normal child, nine shots in 1 day containing thimerosal and the MMR vaccine, and 10 days later he is gone. I just haveto tell you that is really bad and we have an epidemic. We haveto find the reason why. Mr. W AXMAN . Mr. Chairman, my observation is this: autism is an awful disease and we have to do everything we can to fight thisdisease. But when we are trying to figure out how to fight a battle,you only have a certain amount of resources. If we take those re-sources and continue to go over and over and over a line thatseems to me not very promising, we have an endless task of tryingto reevaluate this theory, to try to prove whether it is a negativeor a positive. It seems to me that we ought to make some decisionsabout whether we ought to be asking the scientists where weshould put the money to fight autism. Are we going to continue to reevaluate and have another commit- tee reevaluate Dr. Wakefield 's theory? I do not want to say that we should ignore it. I do not know the answer. I am not a scientist.I cannot give an answer. But I do not know that is the best placefor money to fight autism. And I would be interested in our committee trying to find out from scientists \u2014I do not think scientists who disagree with Dr. Wakefield should be treated as if they are our enemy. These are VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb the Institute of Medicine. They have devoted their lives to fighting disease. They are trying to fight autism. We ought to consult with them, not challenge them. We are doing more than challenging them, we are trying to impugn theirintegrity because they have not come to the same conclusion as Dr.Wakefield. We can keep putting money into Dr. Wakefield 's theory over and over and over again to where we could say, maybe it is true andmaybe it is not, instead of saying, maybe it is not but maybe it is. It seems to me at some point we ought to ask what the best use of money is. Should we be looking for a vaccine for autism? Shouldwe be looking for medicines that can cure it? Should we be doingsomething to help the parents? Should we be using the money forresearch in trying to find out the causes? Or do we know thecauses? It seems like we approach this issue as if we know the cause and there is somebody trying to keep us from keeping it open. I do notthink we know the cause and I would like us not to limit ourselvesin our thinking and our approach to this problem as if we knowthis cause and what we have is a grand conspiracy to keep thiscause from being public. I think you have done a real service, Mr. Chairman, by giving a focus on this disease and suggesting that we need to understandthat this a problem that is serious and seems to be on the increaseand we ought to fight it. But let us not get diverted in our fightto an endless discussion of a theory that I think is not a very prom-ising one, from everything I have heard in the hearings, we havehad\u2014and we have had many hearings on this one theory. So I hope we can work together to figure out some other con- structive ways to fight this disease because you and others have ex-pressed so strongly, emotionally, and well that it is our obligationto do that. Mr. B URTON . Let me just end by saying that you have a great deal of constraints on your time, Mr. Waxman, and we have hada number of hearings. Generally, you come in and make a state-ment and then you leave and do not hear all the testimony and youdo not have a chance to question all the witnesses. I understand that you have these constraints on your time. I just hope that in the future when we have these hearings that you willbe able to devote the time necessary to hear all the witnesses in-stead of just coming in and making a statement and leaving. I do not want to cause acrimony between the two of us, but that is one of the problems. And I know you have demands on yourtime. I want to say one other thing and then \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . I hope you will yield to me on that point. Mr. B URTON . I will yield to you. Mr. W AXMAN . I do have a conflict in the time because I do not get to set the agenda and we have other committees and other de-mands. But I do have staff. And I do have an opportunity to readthe testimony. And I do have a chance to evaluate what is said. Ithink in doing that I have a better picture of what the differentpeople are saying than if I sat here and heard every single personbut refused to believe those that disagreed with my theory. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb sit here for hour after hour and believe that those who say that I am right are telling the truth and those that say I amwrong are lying. That would be maybe a good use of time, but nota good use of process by which hearings ought to give us some con-clusions. Mr. B URTON . As I understand it, the way that you come to con- clusions is you look at a whole body of people, and you see if thereis a causal link. As I understand it, you look for the commonalityof things like autism. It seems that the vast majority of the peoplewho are becoming autistic now \u2014the one common link is that they all suffered in relatively close proximity to these vaccines, a hugepercentage of them. So there is a commonality there. So it is logical for many peo- ple\u2014myself included \u2014to conclude that a lot of these autistic kids are becoming autistic because of a combination of thimerosal, theMMR vaccine \u2014I do not know what \u2014but that is the commonality. That is the thing we see. And we have heard that week after week, month after month, with a whole host of people testifying from around the world. Be-cause of that, I think we need to take a very hard look and a verythorough look at these vaccines and the contents of vaccines andwhether or not maybe separate vaccines should be given. Instead of the MMR vaccine, maybe it should be a measles shot without preservatives in it. Maybe it should be a single mumpsshot. Maybe a single rubella shot. I know it would be a lot moretime-consuming and more costly. We ought to find out if we need to have mercury or thimerosal in vaccines. As I understand it, if you have single shots, you do notreally need that kind of preservative in there and you can give achild a shot that does not have a possible contaminant in it. So I hope that in your review of these vaccines containing things like thimerosal you will look very closely at that and give us a re-port that will be very, very thorough. Dr. McCormick, did you have a closing comment you would like to make? Dr. M CCORMICK . I do not think anyone sitting around our table is not concerned at our committee meetings about the safety of vac-cines. That is why we are there. But also millions of children getthese vaccines without developing the autistic symptoms. What weare looking at in the epidemiologic literature is the comparison ofthose with the vaccine and without to see to what extent we candraw the association with autism. So that information does not support the linkage. But I do not think there is anybody sitting around our committee table that isnot concerned about the safety of vaccines and is not coming to itfrom a neutral point of view that if they saw a risk they would notcall it. Mr. B URTON . I understand and I appreciate your comment. But I will tell you this: it used to be 1 in 10,000 and in Indiana it is 1 in 400, and in Oregon it is 1 in 190 kids that are autistic.There has to be a cause and it appears as though one of the con-tributing factors are some of these vaccines. With that, thank you very much for being here. We stand ad- journed. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 committee was adjourned to recon- vene at the call of the Chair.] [Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] VerDate UPDATE THURSDAY, APRIL 26, 2001 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Gilman, Morella, Waxman, and director of communications; S. Briggs, chief Ellen Rayner, mi-nority chief clerk; and Teresa Coufal, minority staff assistant. Mr. B URTON . Good morning. A quorum being present, the Com- mittee on Government Reform will come to order. The minority ranking member will be here shortly, as will some of the other panelists. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' opening and written statements be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits and extra- neous or tabular material be included in the record. And withoutobjection, so ordered. We're going to be hearing today from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and theFood and Drug Administration. Autism is a neurobiological dis-order. It locks a person inside himself or herself. This disorder,which leaves children like my grandson, Christian, unable to ex-press themselves or interact with others, is now at epidemic levelsin this country, and I mean epidemic. One in 400 children in Indiana, 1 in 190 children in Oregon, 1 in 150 children in Brink Township, NJ. How has the Departmentof Health and Human Services responded to this epidemic? Haveour health agencies recognized this dramatic rise and acted accord-ingly? If we generously estimate that NIH has focused $60 millionon autism, and that 's generous, autism research out of a $20 billion budget, that would mean that their investment is 0.003, threethousandths of 1 percent. Does that adequately address an epidemic that affects between 1 in 190 children in Oregon and 1 in 500 children nationwide? I 'm VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 the record a document taken from the NIH Web site this morning that shows research initiatives at the NIH and theirfunding for a 3-year period. We 'll give you all copies of this, we 'd like for you to take that back with you. According to this document, NIH estimates they will spend $45 million this year on autism. This is compared to $136 million onsleep disorders and $434 million on vaccine development, whichcould be part of the problem, especially if it 's got mercury in it. Two of the issues that were discussed at length yesterday were theconcerns that the dramatic rise in autism may be related to theMMR vaccine and mercury exposure through childhood vaccines.We do not yet have enough research evidence to make a conclusionone way or the other. Our health agencies need to fund clinical andlaboratory research that will get the answers. As we learned yesterday, epidemiological studies cannot answer these questions. Epidemiology is important for looking at incidenceand prevalence, but not in answering questions about causality. Ihave a short video showing the effects of mercury on the brain. Ithink that 's simply saying that we 're moving to get new vaccines on the market that have little or no mercury. It 's a step in the right direction, but I continue to be concerned on behalf of the8,000 children a day who may be exposed to mercury through theirchildhood vaccines until the current supply is used up. And why that isn 't being recalled by the health agencies of this country, the FDA, I cannot fathom. As we speak, kids are havingmercury shot into their arms, and we know it 's a toxic substance. We had toxicology experts here yesterday talking about it and whatit does to the brain. We 're going to show a video on what it does to the brain. And yet the people in the health agencies continue to allow that to be done. And I cannot figure out why. Yesterday we also heard about research that the NIH is funding at the University of Rochester regarding mercury in autistic chil-dren. We 'll hear today how research is to evaluate the level of mer- cury in the serum, the hair and the urine of children receiving thecurrently recommended childhood immunization schedule. I hope that the reports will include the hair and urine data as Dr. Haley, a leading mercury expert, suggested. Simply reportingthe blood data will be misleading. To only report the blood dataand not analyze and report the hair and urine samples would bean injustice. We need to look at it all. And I want to tell you something. We have 113 Members of Con- gress that have signed up for the Autism Caucus. We 're going to end up with about 270, 280. And we 're probably going to have over half the U.S. Senate in the caucus. And if you think this is goingto go away, you guys are blowing smoke. Because I 'm telling you, I'm going to make sure that everybody in the Congress knows the problems and knows what 's facing us. If the health agencies don 't deal with this and deal with it quickly, you 're going to have a big problem over there. I've also talked to Tommy Thompson, new head of the Health De- partment. He 's going to continue to talk to you, on a regular basis, if we don 't do something about this. It 's unconscionable that we have thousands and thousands of children being inoculated and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 vaccines that have toxic substances in them, and we see a horrible increase in the number of people that are autisticand we continue down the same path. I just don 't understand it. Last year the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention reported that they did not know why so manychildren in Brick Township, NJ, had autism. They conducted athorough evaluation of environmental toxins and numerous otherpotential factors, but chose not to include vaccine history as a partof their evaluation and report. Why is this? I believe vaccines are so important, but why they put three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine together at onetime, with mercury and other toxic chemicals in them into our kids,I just don 't understand. We have an epidemic on our hands, and we cannot ignore any potential path that may lead to ending theepidemic. With that, we have this brief video that we 'd like for you to see that shows the effects of mercury on the brain and I hope you 'll pay particular attention to this. [Video shown.]Mr. B URTON . That test was done in June 1999, almost 2 years ago. I don 't know if our health agencies are aware of it, but in your comments today, I hope you 'll address whether or not you 're famil- iar with that study, and whether or not our health agencies havedone like studies or taken an interest in that and can respond toit. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate an opening statement, Mr. Gilman? Mr. G ILMAN . I want to commend the chairman and our commit- tee for looking into this problem, one that 's long overdue, and I thank you for the opportunity to be here. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Gilman. I don 't know if you 're fa- miliar, but Congressman Chris Smith and Congressman Doylehave formed what 's known as the Autism Caucus. I don 't know if you're a member yet, but I hope you will join so we can make sure every member is aware of the problems with it. Let's start with Dr. Rennert. Do you have an opening statement? STATEMENTS OF OWEN M. RENNERT, M.D., SCIENTIFIC DIREC- TOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMANDEVELOPMENT, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH; KARENMIDTHUN, M.D., DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF VACCINE RESEARCH AND REVIEW, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ACCOM-PANIED BY SUSAN ELLENBERG, M.D., DIRECTOR, OFFICE OFVITAL STATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY; NORMAN BAYLOR,M.D., ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, REGULATORY POLICY, OFFICEOF VACCINES; AND DR. COLLEEN BOYLE, ACTING ASSOCI-ATE DIRECTOR, SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH, CENTER ONBIRTH DEFECTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, CEN-TERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Dr. R ENNERT . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I 'm Dr. Owen Rennert, Scientific Director of the National Institutes ofChild Health and Human Development at the NIH. I appreciatethe opportunity to provide information on behalf of the NIH AutismCoordinating Committee about ongoing and planned research ac-tivities at the NIH that are relevant to autism and pervasive devel-opmental disorders. Autism, as you know better than I, is a cruel disorder, not only as a result of the disability it causes, but also because it is an ill-ness that challenges the emotional bond between child and parent.In its most severe forms, it effectively isolates that child socially,cognitively, emotionally and linguistically, denying other familymembers even the opportunity to console and comfort. In light of these immense human costs and the significant public health burden that autism brings with it, the NIH is working tofocus the research community with ever-greater intensity on thisterrible disease. We appreciate the continued involvement that par-ents have given us in that effort. The Children 's Health Act of 2000 called for expansion, inten- sification and coordination of autism related scientific programs atNIH. I 'm pleased to report that significant progress is being made, including toward the establishment of a new network of centers ofexcellence in autism. The act directed the Secretary of Health andHuman Services to establish an interagency autism coordinatingcommittee, which will include NIH, the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention and other HHS agencies. Yesterday, Secretary Thompson delegated to NIH authority for establishing this coordinating committee. And we can assure you,it will have at least three members from the parent community ofchildren with autism. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 expansion and enhanced coordina- tion of autism research efforts at NIH. The amount of NIH supportautism related research grew from $22 million in fiscal year 1997to $52 million in fiscal year 2000. This demonstrates the commit-ment of Institute members to the broad intensification of autismresearch efforts. As you requested, Mr. Chairman, we have supplied for the record the 10-year funding history of NIH sponsored autism related re-search, the list of projects funded in fiscal year 2000. We will alsobe supplying the abstracts of those funded grants shortly. Effective this week also, NIH has released an RFA, request for applications, containing setaside funds for research support for thedevelopment of autism centers applications. This is part of an over-all plan to support a variety of investigative teams and whereverpossible, to recruit the participation of outstanding investigatorswho previously have not worked in autism research. These grantswould be funded in September 2001 if meritorious applications aresubmitted. A second RFA will be issued in fiscal year 2002 to solicit applica- tions for the centers of excellence with funding of the first of thesecenters targeted for early in fiscal year 2003. NIH anticipates apool of approximately $8 million per year, which will be availablefor the first 5 years of the funding of those programs. The Children 's Health Act of 2000 calls upon NIMH, the Insti- tute of Mental Health, to take the lead in providing a programunder which samples of tissues and genetic materials are donated,collected, preserved and made available for autism research. NIHpresently supports ongoing efforts by Harvard 's brain tissue re- source center, UCLA and the University of Miami 's tissue banks, and recently special supplements were awarded to target acquisi-tion of necessarily biological materials from individual with autismfor focused study. The network. In 1997 through an RFA, the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development with co-funding from theNational Institute of Deafness and Communicative Disorders, es-tablished the networks on the neural biology and genetics of au-tism, referred to as the collaborative programs of excellence in au-tism. Currently, we have enrolled nearly 2,300 patients with well diag- nosed autism in the network and are gathering data from theirfamilies. A major ongoing CPEA initiative, a part of this networkthat is co-funded by NICHD, NIDCD and the CDC is the autismregression vaccine study. A principal goal of this study is to assesstemporal association between measles, mumps, rubella vaccine andthe onset of autism and attempts to differentiate early and lateonset forms of the disorder. Another aim of this study is to try to replicate studies of persist- ent measles infection in children with autism versus those childrenwho are not affected. Stage one of the project, which got underwayin September 2000, includes 1,600 well diagnosed cases of autismand 1,250 healthy controls. Individual vaccination records as wellas records of the onset of autism, specifically looking at the age ofonset, the age of recognition and the age of the diagnosis, will beexamined in this study. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 this project will attempt to replicate previously re- ported findings regarding abnormal measles antibody titers andpersistent measles infection. In this phase, investigators will exam-ine 250 children with early onset autism, 250 children with the re-gressive form of autism, 250 healthy controls matched to earlyonset cases, as well as 250 controls matched to regressive autismcases. Neuroscience research, as you know, requires that we under- stand the pathogenesis and cause of autism, and is the most prom-ising approach to ultimately developing targeted effective treat-ments. Until the brain mechanisms responsible for the manifesta-tions of autism are understood, it will not be possible to developtruly targeted interventions. Treatment research also is currently focused on studying the effi- cacy and safety of promising treatment interventions which arecommonly used in the community without adequate testing or areaimed at specific impairing symptoms. These include both psycho-social and pharmacologic interventions. Last October, neuroscientists, including autism researchers, par- ents, advocates and NIH program staff, participated in a 1-daybrainstorming session on the role of the environment in autismwhich was organized by the National Institutes of EnvironmentalHealth Sciences. This group identified key priorities, large scaleepidemiologic studies to determine autism incidence and prevalencetrends, studies to describe the natural history of autism and toidentify meaningful subgroups that may be at increased risk fromenvironmental exposures in studies specifically to examine the pro-posed association between regressive autism and thimerosal in vac-cines. Mr. B URTON . I don 't know how much longer your opening state- ment is, but we 'd like to get to the questions as quickly as possible. Dr. R ENNERT . I'll abbreviate it. I simply would indicate to you that there are ongoing studies of several institutes amongst the ones you mentioned, the one at theUniversity of Rochester, which attempt to look at hair, urine,serum levels of children having received a thimerosal and mercuryderivatives, of children having received immunizations, those whohave had thimerosal containing vaccines and those who haven 't. Preliminary data, as you were told yesterday, shows no dif- ference in blood levels. I do not have at this point in time the com-plete analysis, because it hasn 't been completed. There are also studies at several centers that are looking at the pharmacokinetics, the metabolism, the disposition and the disposi-tion in tissues such as brain of mercury when administered as thi-merosal, mercurial mercury in monkeys. There are another set ofstudies that have been funded in November 2000 that are carryingout somewhat similar experiments in rats. These again look at thecellular distribution patterns of mercury in tissue, including thebrain, and also are attempting to evaluate the role of immune acti-vation in altering brain levels of mercury after exposure to thimer-osal. The last comment that I 'll make in a general way is that as you know, the Children 's Health Act authorized a longitudinal study to investigate basic mechanisms of environmental disorders and envi- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes. In the context of environment, one is talking about chemical, physical, social behavioral influences on children who have criticalwindows of vulnerability during development, during which timeenvironmental exposures could have a greater influence and dis-eases of increasing prevalence, such as autism and asthma, are twotargeted elements of this. Planning for this study, which will followabout 100,000 children across the United States from birth intoadulthood, is currently underway, with pilot studies scheduled tooccur in fiscal year 2002. The other comments I was going to make related exclusively to the efforts of the NIH to increase its dialog with the parents andthe public community with regard to what our priorities should be,how we conduct our research as it relates specifically to autism.The only thing to highlight there is as a consequence of those ef-forts, there is a list server presently available that provides up todate information about autism related research activities at theNIH, there is an NIH Web page which also allows you to identifyall the research that presently is funded by NIH and gives you in-formation about advocacy groups, the scientific literature, etc. In closing, we at NIH understand the passion of parents and families of those who have been affected by autism and related dis-orders and share your concerns for quickly unraveling the mysteryof autism. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dr. Rennert follows:] VerDate M IDTHUN . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I 'm Dr. Karen Midthun. I 'm the Director, Office of Vaccine Research and Review of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,FDA. With me today are Dr. Susan Ellenberg and Dr. NormanBaylor. Dr. Susan Ellenberg is Director of the Office of Vital Statis-tics and Epidemiology, and Dr. Norman Baylor is the Associate Di-rector for Regulatory Policy in the Office of Vaccines. Mr. Chairman, as a physician and a parent, I want to express to you, the members of this committee and to parents that I 'm aware of the devastating effects of autism on children and theirfamilies. I 'm here to assure you that we are working diligently to ensure that the vaccines we license for use in the United States areshown to be safe, pure and potent. I appreciate the opportunity toparticipate in this hearing on autism and to respond to the commit-tee's concerns regarding a potential link between vaccines and au- tism. The Office of Vaccines regulates the investigation and licensure of vaccines. FDA 's regulatory process for licensing vaccines has for decades served as a model for other countries. To date, the existingdata do not demonstrate a causal relationship between vaccinesand autism. However, I want to assure this committee, the publicand especially parents that FDA takes these concerns seriously. One concern that has been raised relates to the use of thimero- sal, a mercury compound as a preservative in some vaccines. FDArecognizes and supports the goal of reducing exposure to mercuryfrom all sources. Consistent with this goal, for several years, FDAhas encouraged manufacturers to develop new vaccines without thi-merosal as a preservative, and to remove or reduce the thimerosalcontent of existing licensed vaccines. Initial results of this effort were realized at least a year prior to the enactment of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, with the li-censure of new thimerosal-free vaccines. As required by Section 413of FDAMA, FDA conducted a review of the use of thimerosal inchildhood vaccines. A review revealed no evidence of harm causedby thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines except for localhypersensitivity reactions. Under the U.S. recommended childhood immunization schedule, the maximum cumulative exposure to mercury from thimerosal atthe time of this review in 1999 was within acceptable limits for themethyl mercury exposure set by FDA, the Agency for Toxic Sub-stances and Disease Registry and the World Health Organization.Of note, all these guidelines contain a safety margin and are meantas a starting point for evaluation of mercury exposure, not absolutelevels above which toxicity can be expected to occur. However, during the first 6 months of life, cumulative exposure to mercury in some cases could have exceeded the more conserv-ative limits of the EPA depending on the specific vaccine formula-tions used and weight of the infant. The clinical significance of ex-ceeding EPA 's limits is not currently known. Nevertheless, reduc- ing exposure to mercury from vaccines is warranted and achiev-able, in part because in the United States, it is possible to replacemulti-dose vials with single dose vials, which do not require pre-servative. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 pleased to be able to report substantial progress in the ef- forts to reduce thimerosal exposure from vaccines. At this time, allroutinely recommended licensed pediatric vaccines being manufac-tured for the U.S. market contain no thimerosal or contain onlytrace amounts in the final formulation. Prior to the recent initia-tives to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from childhood vaccines, themaximum cumulative exposure to mercury by routine childhoodimmunizations during the first 6 months of life was 187 and a halfmicrograms. With the newly formulated vaccines, the maximum cu-mulative exposure during the first 6 months of life will now be lessthan 3 micrograms of mercury, more than a 98 percent reduction. In an effort to better characterize any toxicity that could have ac- companied an exposure to thimerosal from vaccines, FDA is in theprocess of nominating thimerosal to the National Toxicology Pro-gram for further study. Reports of developmental delay following vaccination have been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System[VAERS]. Although VAERS reports by themselves usually cannotestablish a causal relationship between a vaccine and an adverseoutcome occurring after vaccination, further study of these reportscan sometimes provide important clues and suggest directions forfurther research. FDA takes these reports seriously and has begun a followup study of VAERS reports of autism. In addition, FDA is pursuing re-search involving the characterization and development of an ani-mal model for autism. While looking at ways to improve the safetyof vaccines, we must keep in mind that childhood vaccines havecontributed to a great reduction in vaccine preventable diseases, in-cluding polio, measles and whooping cough. Today, it is rare for American children to experience the dev- astating effects of vaccine preventable illness. However, vaccines,like all medical products, are not risk free, and FDA is committedto continuing its efforts to reduce these risks whenever possible. In conclusion, FDA continues to work diligently with manufac- turers to eliminate or reduce exposure to mercury from thimerosalin vaccines. As stated previously, at this time, all routinely rec-ommended licensed pediatric vaccines being manufactured for theU.S. market contain no thimerosal or contain only trace amountsin the final formulation. Although no causal relationship between vaccines and autism has been established, FDA, along with other Health and HumanService agencies, continues to pursue research activities to increaseour understanding of any potential relationship between vaccinesand neurodevelopmental disorders. Although the prevention of dis-ease through the use of vaccines is a tremendous public health ac-complishment, there is more work to be done. I assure you that theOffice of Vaccines at FDA will continue to make regulatory deci-sions or recommendations regarding vaccines based on the best sci-entific evidence to protect the public health. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the committee 's interest in this area, and look forward to continuing to work with you on this in the fu-ture. [The prepared statement of Dr. Boyle.Dr. B OYLE . Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I 'm Dr. Colleen Boyle, Acting Associate Director for Science and Public Health in the newly established Center on BirthDefects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention. I have with me today Dr. Roger Bernier, an epidemiologist and Associate Director of Science for the National Immunization Pro-gram at the CDC. Thank you for the opportunity to update you on CDC 's activities related to autism. One major change since last year is that CDChas established, at the direction of Congress, a new center, the Na-tional Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.This center will increase CDC 's efforts to discover causes and de- velop preventive strategies for birth defects and developmental dis-abilities, including autism. First, Mr. Chairman, I want to stress that CDC is committed to understanding the prevalence of autism, identifying its preventablecauses and establishing and evaluating prevention programs. We 've made considerable progress over the last year toward fulfilling thiscommitment. Last year, we mentioned that CDC and the Agencyfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry were about to report onan investigation on the prevalence of autism in Brick Township,NJ. The investigation found a rate in Brick that is high comparedto many previous studies. However, there are few very recent studies, none in the United States, that have reported rates in this range, which suggest thatthe rate of autism may be considerably higher than previouslythought. To increase our ability to monitor autism prevalence inthe United States, in September 2000, CDC competitively fundedhealth departments in Arizona, South Carolina, Maryland and NewJersey to establish monitoring programs for autism in their States. CDC is also completing the analysis of the first year of autism monitoring data gathered from its own metropolitan Atlanta devel-opmental disability surveillance program. Our report should becomplete later this year. This September, as directed by Congress, CDC will competitively fund up to four centers of excellence in autism epidemiology to con-duct collaborative epidemiologic studies. The research objectives ofthese studies will be determined by an independent oversight com-mittee, and representatives from parent and consumer groups willbe invited to provide input to the oversight committee in planningthe epidemiologic study. CDC has also developed a wide range of activities that are re- sponsive to the needs of parents of children with autism and healthcare professionals working with these children. For example, CDCfunds a program at Marshall University in West Virginia of an in-tensive community support program for families with young chil- dren with autism. As part of the centers for excellence in autismand epidemiology, we expect to fund projects of model interventionprograms for children with autism, of the economic and social costsof autism, and of studies to look at the natural history of autism. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb have expressed concern about the potential link between autism and vaccines. Although the weight of the scientificevidence does not support such a link, CDC is committed stronglyto assuring vaccine safety. The concerns raised regarding autismand vaccines have focused primarily on thimerosal, a preservativein some vaccines, and on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.Today, all manufacturers are producing for immunization only vac-cines that are free of thimerosal or have only trace elements of thi-merosal. As shown in figure one of my testimony, the thimerosal content of pediatric vaccines purchased by States through CDC 's contract has dramatically decreased since 1998. CDC is actively investigat-ing whether there have been any adverse effects related to thimero-sal in vaccines. Preliminary analyses of the vaccine safety data linkhave not supported a link between thimerosal containing vaccinesand autism. It has been suggested that vaccination, particularly with the MMR vaccine, may be related to the development of autism. Sub-stantial scientific review does not support this suggestion. First,the American Academy of Pediatrics executive committee stated inMarch 2001 that there is a considerable body of evidence that doesnot support a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and au-tism or inflammatory bowel disease. Second, the IOM stated justthis week that existing evidence does not favor a causal relation-ship between the MMR vaccine and autism. In addition, Dales et al. recently reviewed changes over time in the MMR coverage and autism diagnoses in California. There wasa 373 percent relative increase, in the prevalence rate of autism be-tween 1980 and 1994 while the MMR immunization coverage wasrelatively flat over that same period. To date, the weight of the scientific evidence does not support a causal relationship between vaccines and autism. Nevertheless, be-cause of the continuing concern of parents, we are committed toconducting research to evaluate this matter. At present, we areconducting a study in Atlanta, another in Denmark, and we arecollaborating with NIH, with their centers and programs of excel-lence in autism to further examine the relationship between vac-cines and autism. While we must remain vigilant to assure the safety of vaccines, we must also remember that vaccines benefit the individual childand the public by protecting persons from the consequences of in-fectious diseases. While we 've made great progress to reduce the number of cases of vaccine preventable diseases, threats posed byvaccine preventable diseases are known and are real. We want to assure you that CDC knows how important it is to find the causes of autism and prevent this disorders. We are com-mitted to conducting research that will lead to these answers. Withthe support of Congress, we have made a good beginning by fund-ing autism monitoring programs with several States and the Cen- ters of Excellence in Autism Epidemiology to look at causes of au-tism. CDC 's efforts will continue until we have found the answers that will enable us to prevent this serious condition that affects somany American children. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for the opportunity to testify before you today. Dr. Bernier and I wouldbe happy to answer any questions that you may have. [The prepared statement of Dr. Boyle follows:] VerDate I neglected to have you sworn. Would you all please stand? [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Dr. Boyle, why is it that there 's a reduction in thi- merosal in vaccines that are being produced today? Did not ourhealth agencies request that thimerosal be removed from vaccinesas the newly produced vaccines? Dr. B OYLE . I think we 've made considerable progress in reducing the thimerosal content. Mr. B URTON . So you 've asked that thimerosal be reduced in vac- cines, have you not? Mr. B ERNIER . I think the answer is that this was done as a pre- cautionary measure. Mr. B URTON . Why? Mr. B ERNIER . Because it was feasible to do, and there are sources of exposure to mercury that we cannot control, such as that fromfood. So \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I'm talking about the vaccine. Why is it that you have started at our health agencies to reduce the amount of thi-merosal in vaccines, as a precautionary measure? Mr. B ERNIER . As a precautionary measure. Mr. B URTON . OK, as a precautionary measure. That would lead one to believe that you 're not really sure whether or not thimerosal causes some problems. Otherwise, why wouldn 't you just leave it in there and say, hey, we 've run all these tests, there 's no causal link whatsoever? So why even move to take it out of there? Mr. B ERNIER . There is a theoretical risk. Mr. B URTON . OK, so there 's a theoretical risk. Then why have we not recalled the vaccines that have thimerosal in them right now,while you 're testing this? If there 's any question whatsoever about what we 're putting into our kids ' arms, and their bodies, and if you're reducing thimerosal because you think there may be a caus- al link, as a precautionary measure, why don 't you recall the thi- merosal that 's in doctors ' offices that are being injected into kids as we speak until you 're sure? Because obviously you 're not sure or you wouldn 't be taking it out anyway. Why don 't you recall it? Mr. B ERNIER . I can give you my comments. The FDA may wish to weigh in on this issue of recall. But as succinctly as I can putit, Mr. Chairman, being safe means being safe from disease as wellas being safe from the side effects of vaccine. Mr. B URTON . Let me ask you this question, then. Can you create a measles vaccine and do we have a measles vaccine that does nothave thimerosal in it? Mr. B ERNIER . Yes, that 's correct. Mr. B URTON . Can we create a mumps vaccine that does not have thimerosal in it? Mr. B ERNIER . That 's correct. Mr. B URTON . Then why are you putting thimerosal in it? Mr. B ERNIER . At the present time, as Dr. Midthun and Dr. Boyle mentioned, we have made very good progress, and I can say to youwe are not putting in thimerosal any longer in the vaccines thatare being produced. Mr. B URTON . So if you 're not, if you 're not, as a precautionary measure, then why are you leaving vaccines on doctors ' shelves and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb around this country that are being used in facilities where they supply them, are being used, if you 're not putting them in new vaccines, as a precautionary measure? Why don 't you recall the supply that you have out there until you are absolutely sure,beyond any doubt, that thimerosal has no causal link to autism?Why don 't you recall it? Dr. Midthun.Dr. M IDTHUN . Under the Public Health Service Act, in order to make a mandatory recall of vaccine, there has to be an imminentor substantial hazard to the public health. As the weight of the evi-dence does not support a causal link between thimerosal \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Then why are you taking it out of the new ones? Dr. M IDTHUN . As Dr. Bernier said, it 's a precautionary measure. It's recognized that mercury in large doses is toxic and any way that we have of reducing the exposure to mercury over which wehave control is something that is desirable to do. Mr. B URTON . Let me tell you, my grandson was very healthy and very normal and spoke and ran around like every other child. Hegot nine vaccines in 1 day. He got 41 times what 's the allowable amount of mercury through thimerosal in 1 day. And 10 days later,we lost him. Now, we 're trying to get him back. Now, there 's a lot of parents out there that are getting all these shots when their children 's immune systems are depressed, they 've got colds, and they 're getting these shots, several of them at a time, with thimerosal in them. As a precautionary measure, if you thinkthere may be a causal link, don 't you have any latitude whatsoever to recall those and say, we 're not going to destroy this, but we 're going to hold these supplies in abeyance until we know for sure,until all the tests have been done? Dr. M IDTHUN . Not under the Public Health Service Act. That 's not what would allow us to make a mandatory recall. Mr. B URTON . But you are taking thimerosal out of vaccines, as a precautionary measure? Dr. M IDTHUN . That 's correct. Mr. B URTON . How long are these studies going to take, Dr. Rennert? Dr. R ENNERT . We hope to have answers of various phases within the next 2 to 3 years. Mr. B URTON . Oh. Do you know how many kids are going to be vaccinated today? Do you know that in California, it used to be onechild every 6 hours was becoming autistic. It 's now one every 3 hours. In the United States, 1 out of 400 to 500 kids are autistic.And in some parts of the country, it 's under 200. And boys have a four times more prevalence of getting autism than girls. So if you go to Oregon, 1 out of 190 kids are autistic, that means 1 out of 50 boys being born are going to be autistic. And you 're tell- ing me these studies are going to take 2 to 3 years, and at thesame time the studies are going to take 2 to 3 years, you 're going to keep mercury in vaccines that you just saw from that Calgary,Canada study what mercury does to brain cells? I mean, come on. If there 's any doubt whatsoever, and you say it's a precautionary measure you 're taking, then why in the heck don't you get that stuff off the market until you 've tested it thor- oughly? And if it 's going to take 3 years, put it some place for 3 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb a storage box, and if the tests don 't prove out, you 've still got it, and the pharmaceutical companies can still get their money. Now, on these tests that you 're doing, you said you 're testing the blood for mercury. Are you testing hair and urine samples? Dr. R ENNERT . Yes. In the studies that were done by Navy and the University of Rochester, there are samples that have been ob-tained for study of hair and urine concentrations as well. Mr. B URTON . Have you had any results from that yet? Dr. R ENNERT . No, sir. The study as far as I know has just been completed and the analysis is occurring. I don 't have the data. Mr. B URTON . How long will it take to get that analysis? Dr. R ENNERT . I would imagine \u2014to be honest, sir, I don 't know. I don 't think it will be long, but I will attempt to find out and give you an answer. Mr. B URTON . We would like to have copies of the analysis as quickly as you get them. We 'd like to have any records that you have whatsoever about the analyzing of blood, hair, urine, what-ever it is, regarding mercury and thimerosal in these kids. You know, you were talking about how vaccines have reduced measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, all these other things. Andthat is great. And we really appreciate what vaccines and pharma-ceutical companies have done for this country. Because they 've saved a lot of lives. And what you 've done has been very laudable. But when you have a child who is autistic, from the time he be- comes autistic until he dies, they estimate that the cost to our soci-ety is $5 million, for each child. Now, if we have 1 in 400, and thecases are rising at a very rapid rate, do you have any idea whatthat's going to do to our economy? Not now, but 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now. And so every precaution that should be taken must betaken and must be taken now. Because this is not only a healthissue, it 's an economic issue that 's not going to go away. I mean, we 're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars if we don't find an answer. If you 've got substances, aluminum, formalde- hyde, mercury, in these vaccines, and you have this huge rise andyou're not absolutely sure that mercury 's not causing it, you ought to get it out of there. You ought to recall this stuff. Because thedoctor just said, Dr. Bernier just said that they are producing andcan produce vaccines without mercury in them, without thimerosal. Now, granted, you might not be able to put three or four dif- ferent vaccines in one vial. Because as I understand it, you put themercury in there to keep everything pure so they can be used, andwon't be tainted. But if you go to single vials with single vaccines, sure, the parents would have to have more shots. But if it 's going to be safer, then why not do it? And why wait 3 years for studiesif you think that there may, even the most remote possibility, bea causal link. If you look at some of these studies, like we 've seen, and I am not a scientist, I 'm not a doctor, I 'm just a grandfather who has an autistic kid, and I didn 't even know what autism was until a couple of years ago. But when you see the huge number of people that arecontacting us through e-mail and through conferences, there 's one going on right here, you 've got to take the proper precautions. You can't say, let 's wait 3 years and let this go on. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb I said earlier, and I 'm going to yield to my colleagues here, as I said earlier, we have 113 members in the Autism Caucus.They will be supplied with every bit of information we get, not onlyfrom you folks, but from Calgary, Canada, and from around theworld and from the experts we have here. And I will be taking spe-cial orders on the floor of the House. I 'll be going down there on a regular basis, reading into the record and talking to the Amer-ican people, about the problems that we have. So the pressure that you 're feeling, if any, now, I don 't know if you are or not, but the pressure you 're feeling right now is going to be magnified as many times as I can make it, until our healthagencies either come to some conclusion that 's scientifically prov- able, or they get that stuff out of there, in particular thimerosal.And I don 't know why, if you 're coming up with vaccines that don 't have these toxic substances in them, as I believe they are, I don 't understand why you don 't recall that stuff. Get it off the market. FDA, can you do a voluntary recall for manufacturers the same as the rotavirus recall? Dr. M IDTHUN . That was not a voluntary recall. The manufacturer on their own initiative withdrew their product from the market. Mr. B URTON . Can you contact the people that manufacture thi- merosal, and I know who it is, can you ask them to recall it tempo-rarily? Dr. M IDTHUN . That would be something that would be voluntary on their basis. Mr. B URTON . You can 't write them a letter and say that because of the concern of thousands and thousands of parents and becausewe're in the process of doing research on this, we think it would be prudent to recall thimerosal products until we run all of ourtests, which may take as much as 3 years? Dr. M IDTHUN . I'm sure that the companies are well aware also of these concerns over autism \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . But you can 't even write them a letter? Dr. M IDTHUN . It's their choice to make a voluntary recall, and they know that they have that choice, sir. Mr. B URTON . So you 're not going to do anything? Dr. M IDTHUN . Under the PHS Act, we can make a mandatory re- call for the reasons that I indicated. And the company, of course,on its own volition, can do anything it would like in terms of mak-ing product available or deciding not to distribute it any longer. Mr. B URTON . I found out yesterday that there 's a lawsuits pend- ing, I believe in, I think it 's Mississippi, regarding mercury toxicity and how it 's affected children. And if that lawsuit is successful by the people who are bringing the suit, it will probably involve agreat deal of money to the pharmaceutical company that producesthis product, and other pharmaceutical companies that use it intheir vaccines. I wonder, I just wonder if perhaps one of the reasons why FDA is not pounding these pharmaceutical companies to get this off of the market, especially when you look at this Calgary study aboutmercury and the toxicity of it, maybe there 's not pressure being ex- erted by pharmaceutical companies on our health agencies becausethey're afraid of what might happen in that lawsuit if they do with- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 from the market. Is there any validity to that kind of thinking? Dr. M IDTHUN . I really couldn 't say. I do not know, sir. Mr. B URTON . OK, Mr. Gilman. Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for raising these issues. Permit me to request that my opening statement be made part of the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection. [The prepared statement of Hon. Benjamin follows:] VerDate And I do have several questions. I think what Chairman Burton is raising I think is quite pertinent. I 'm sur- prised to hear that, Dr. Midthun, you 're reluctant to issue any let- ter to the manufacturers if there is some concern. You say thereis some mandate in the legislation that permits you to make someof these corrections? Dr. M IDTHUN . Under the PHS Act, the FDA can make a manda- tory recall if there is an imminent or substantial hazard to thepublic health. And as I noted before, the preponderance of the evi-dence does not suggest that there was a causal relationship be-tween thimerosal containing vaccines and autism. Thus, there is nosubstantial or imminent hazard that would authorize us to makea mandatory recall, sir. Mr. G ILMAN . And yet, you are making a request that the thimer- osal not be included in the future production of vaccines becauseof some concern? Is that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . As Dr. Bernier noted, wherever it is possible to re- duce exposure to mercury, that is a goal that we would like toachieve. Because there are many aspects of exposure that we don 't have control over. For example, environmental food intake andthus, it 's considered a precautionary measure that we can take. It 's achievable, we can move from multi-dose vials that require a pre-servative to single dose vials. That 's what we have been doing, and actually have made a substantial achievement toward reaching, asI noted before, currently all vaccines being manufactured for pedi-atric use under the routine childhood immunization schedule, ei-ther contain no thimerosal or only trace amounts. Mr. G ILMAN . And that 's based on your recommendations? Dr. M IDTHUN . That 's based on working collaboratively together with the other public health service agencies and also the manufac-turers, that it was agreed that this would be an achievable goal,and it would be good to reduce the exposure to mercury wheneverpossible. Mr. G ILMAN . So there is a consensus in the thinking of the medi- cal world that it would be preferable to eliminate that possibilityin providing vaccines for children, is that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . It's recognized that mercury in larger amounts is a toxin. And thus, it is good to be able to reduce exposure. You cannever eliminate exposure. But it is good, where you can, to be ableto reduce it. Mr. G ILMAN . I will yield. Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask, is mercury a cumulative thing in the body? Dr. M IDTHUN . I'm not a toxicologist. Mr. B URTON . We had one yesterday. And the toxicologist, Mr. Gilman, said that if you get a shot with mercury in it and then youget another one and another one, there 's a cumulative effect. And our children are getting 26 shots by the time they go to school. I might add, did you get a flu shot? Mr. G ILMAN . Yes, I did. Mr. B URTON . You got thimerosal. You got mercury in your body from that shot, and Dr. Eisel, our admiral, I called him about it,and he didn 't even know it was in there. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb That raises another good question. You have taken some precautionary measures. What have you done with the publicso that they 're aware of these problems? What is your educational process, what have you done in the educational process to the con-suming public with regard to these concerns that you have in themedical community? Dr. M IDTHUN . Our labeling for products indicates what is in the product. In the case where there is a preservative, it is so stated.And\u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . I'm not asking just labeling. I 'm asking you, have you undertaken educational initiatives for the consuming public sothey'd be aware of these problems? Dr. M IDTHUN . We believe that the vaccines are safe and effective, including those vaccines that were licensed with thimerosal as apreservative, sir. Mr. B ERNIER . Mr. Gilman, if I might add something, because we've discussed this at CDC in anticipation that we might have this question. I think one of the things that CDC has done, at least,is we generally try to work with the provider community to try toprovide information about these matters. So in the last 22 months,during the time when this episode has been ongoing, there havebeen repeated publications, for example, in the morbidity and mor-tality weekly report at CDC, there have been joint statements be-tween the Government agencies and the American Academy of Pe-diatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. So we have worked to put information in the hands of the provid- ers, so that they could address the concerns of the parents. Also,we have had on our Web site information about these matters. Wehave a hot line where parents can obtain information. So I wouldn 't want to leave the impression that we haven 't been proactive, if you will, about putting information out there. Because I think we havebeen. Mr. G ILMAN . Well, you 're saying you 're putting it in the hands of the providers. What about the consuming public? What are youdoing? You 're a government agency. What are you doing about edu- cating the public about these dangers? What has been done by youragency or any of the panelists who are here representing our gov-ernment agencies? What 's been done to make the consuming public aware of these mercury problems? Mr. B ERNIER . Well, like I said, at least speaking for CDC, tradi- tionally we make, we work through the providers to address theconcerns of the parents to make sure \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . You don 't go beyond the provider? If the provider fails to make the information available, you 're satisfied? Mr. B ERNIER . Well, we have also the vaccine information state- ments that parents are given prior to vaccination, and that 's one direct connection that we have with the parents at the time of vac-cination. Mr. G ILMAN . Are these statements that your agency makes to the parent? Mr. B ERNIER . Are they what, sir? Mr. G ILMAN . Are these statements that you make available to the parent? Mr. B ERNIER . Yes. VerDate distributed? Mr. B ERNIER . These are widely available, they 're required by law to be made available to all the parents when children are immu-nized, before every immunization \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . If the gentleman would yield. Mr. G ILMAN . I'd be pleased to yield. Mr. B URTON . And then we 'll get to Dr. Weldon. Mr. Gilman, do you ever use a nasal spray?Mr. G ILMAN . No. Mr. B URTON . Does your wife, or any of their friends? Mr. G ILMAN . My wife does. Mr. B URTON . Do you know that most nasal sprays have thimero- sal in them? Mr. G ILMAN . I didn 't know that. Mr. B URTON . Yes. There 's mercury in a great many products that we use as adults. And there 's a tremendous rise in the number of cases of Alzheimer 's. And mercury has a debilitating impact on the brain, as you saw, you probably didn 't see it, in that Calgary study. So it 's not only the children that are being affected by this, in my opinion. And I 'm not a scientist. It 's all of us. Because we 're getting mercury through the environment, but we're getting it in nasal sprays, and the health agencies, not too long ago, took mercury out of all topical dressings, because theysaid it would leach into the skin and cause problems. And yet, it 's in nasal sprays, it 's in a lot of products we use as adults, and it 's in our vaccinations, like the flu shot that you received. Mr. G ILMAN . Mr. Chairman, if I might reclaim my time. It would seem to me there 's a responsibility by our agencies, whether it be NIH, whether it be CDC, whatever agency is involved in regulatingour vaccines, that we make more information available to the pub-lic of the dangers of mercury, and make it available not only justto potential users of the vaccine, but to the entire public. So I'm urging those panelists who are here today to address that problem, since it is a problem that can affect millions and millionsof our population. Just one other question, Mr. Chairman. Parents are becoming concerned about the vaccines that are already on the market thathave not been recalled, but many are unaware what 's being done to make some recall or are unaware of your preventive actions oryour concerns, because you have directed the manufacturers totake some steps to remove this product. But what have you done with the product that 's still on the shelves around the country? Dr. M IDTHUN . It remains on the shelves, sir. Mr. G ILMAN . And could be used? Dr. M IDTHUN . And could be used, that 's correct. Mr. G ILMAN . Shouldn 't you have some responsibility to remove that, if you are concerned about its use? Dr. M IDTHUN . Again, as I mentioned, there are certain conditions that allow us to make a mandatory recall. And that is not one ofthem. You have to have an imminent or substantial hazard to thepublic health in order to make a recall. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb Are you concerned that if some of these products are used, they could cause some problems in the health of youngpeople? Dr. M IDTHUN . The evidence does not show that there is a causal relationship between thimerosal as used in vaccines and autism. Mr. G ILMAN . And yet you recommended that it not be used in fu- ture manufacturing, is that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . That 's correct, because if we can decrease exposure to mercury in ways that are available to \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . If you 're concerned about the increase in exposure, then why not take these products off the shelves and prevent theirdistribution? If you really are sincerely concerned about the use ofthese products, it would seem to me there 's an absence of respon- sibility here by your agency. Dr. M IDTHUN . We have to follow the regulations as they are writ- ten, sir. Mr. B ERNIER . Mr. Gilman, could I add, I want to, I think, try to correct an impression that I think is being generated here. That isthat the vaccine is not being recalled then nothing 's happening. I think nothing could be further from the truth. Please allow me tojust take a minute to explain what has changed between, in thelast 22 months and today. And a lot has changed. I think the impression is, well, if we don 't accomplish a recall that somehow this problem is not being addressed. And I thinkthere are two or three things I 'd like to point out. Mr. G ILMAN . Doctor, if I might interrupt, when we have faulty tires on vehicles, we demand that they be recalled. If we have amedication that 's on the shelf that could create some problem, it would seem to me there 's enough evidence, even though it 's not fully explored, that there 's enough evidence available that these products should not be allowed to go out to the consuming public. Mr. B ERNIER . Mr. Gilman, we have no faulty vaccines on the shelves. Mr. G ILMAN . You 've already testified before us, at least Dr. Midthun has testified that as a preventive measure, they 're rec- ommending to the producer not to use this product. It would seemto me that 's enough evidence to take the rest of the product off the shelf. Dr. M IDTHUN . We 've not recommended that a product not be used. We have worked with manufacturers to reduce the use of thi-merosal as a preservative in vaccines. Mr. G ILMAN . And you 've done that because you have a concern about the future health of young people, isn 't that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . We have concerns about overall exposure to mer- cury from all sources in the environment. And this happens to bea source that we can control by switching to single dose vials inlarge part. Mr. G ILMAN . And these other products that are still on the shelf could contribute to their poor state of health, is that right? Dr. M IDTHUN . We do not believe that the products out there, we believe that they are safe products, sir. Mr. G ILMAN . No further questions. Mr. B URTON Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all the witnesses for testifying. I certainly thank your efforts in trying toanswer and address the issues and concerns we have. Dr. Rennert, you testified, I believe, that the total spending at NIH will be $52 million on autism related research? Correct me ifI'm wrong, that is including a lot of autism related research, but the actual figure on autism specific research is smaller than that,is that correct? Dr. R ENNERT . I can 't tell you that for sure. I will tell you that the list we submitted is correct. We will go back and review it andprovide you with the information. Dr. W ELDON . Yes, I would like you to personally provide that to me, because I have had people come to me and say the net was castpretty wide to come up with a figure that high, and that the figurefor autism specific research is actually about a third or less of that. And the reason I bring that up is, I had my staff pull a Congres- sional Research Study on AIDS. The figures that were provided tome from CRS is that there 's 300,000 Americans currently suffering with AIDS, and 115,000 living with HIV. Now, I realize some peo-ple estimate that those figures are quite a bit higher, and thatthere 's a substantial cohort in the population who have exposure to HIV, they 're carrying HIV and they don 't know it. But if we use those figures and those figures have appeared in the media, that 's about 415,000 people. The Federal expenditures on research and treatment and the various care for those patientswith AIDS is $10.9 billion. Now, if we just look at the researchnumber, I have a figure of $3.1 billion in the year 2000. I could notget the 2001 figure. Now, I 'm told we have about a similar number of kids with au- tism. That 's also very debatable, if you look at autism spectrum disorder, you get a much larger number. When I do the math, itcomes out to, for research, about $7,000 per person with AIDS andabout $140 for each child with autism. Another way to look at thatfigure is for every $7 we spend on AIDS related research, we 're spending 14 cents on autism related research. Do you, and I would ask any of the panelists to comment on this, do you feel that, and I feel the ultimate responsibility for this restswith the Congress, not with you, OK? So I 'm not trying to make you feel bad. I think we have a responsibility to make sure thatour money is spent, or the public 's money, the taxpayer money, is spent appropriately. Do you think this is an appropriate level offunding, a relatively appropriate level of funding? Dr. R ENNERT . You 've evoked my bias as a pediatrician. I believe our future is with our children. What I can tell you is that we willspend more money on autism research. The numbers that I 've pre- sented, regardless for the moment of the magnitude, represent anincrease in funding at least in recent times, for this area. And Icertainly subscribe to the notion that this is an area that shouldbe an area of focus and emphasis for us. Dr. W ELDON . Well, does anybody else want to comment? Dr. B OYLE . Sure, I 'd be happy to. Dr. W ELDON . Are there adequate levels of funding for the types of research studies that need to be done on this? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 We direct money at CDC as directed by Congress. But I can tell you that in the last year, we have gotten a substan-tial increase in our funding for autism. And that 's really allowed us to develop the State surveillance, State monitoring programsthat I referred to in my testimony. It 's allowing us to develop the infrastructure to actually be doing a very large study of the epide-miology of autism. So I feel that we have made substantial progress. But we have a lot further to go. Mr. G ILMAN . Would the gentleman yield? Dr. W ELDON . I'd be happy to yield. Mr. G ILMAN . Have any of you made a request for additional mon- eys that have not been allocated for your autism research? Haveany of your agencies made a request for additional sums in thebudget that were not allocated to you? Or were you all satisfiedwith the way the funds were being allocated? Dr. W ELDON . If I could ask it a different way, were all of your requests granted to you by your superiors within the agencies youwork in? Dr. M IDTHUN . May I just say that FDA, and the Office of vac- cines, we don 't have the ability to ask for funding for studying au- tism per se. Our mission is to regulate vaccines. Dr. W ELDON . What about CDC and NIH? Dr. R ENNERT . The answer for NIH is no. Dr. W ELDON . We 'll make sure your future is secure in the year ahead. Dr. Boyle, I 've got to ask you a question related to what you 're doing. We had a physician testify yesterday about this increasingincidence issue. And I think you came into my office once and wetalked about this, and the change in the diagnostic manual. Hemade a very good point. Where are all the adults? If the prevalenceisn't increasing, if the incidence isn 't increasing, then where are all the adults? In all of these studies, you 're looking at prevalence and incidence. Are you looking at prevalence in adults to try to makea determination to answer that question, is the rate increasing? Dr. B OYLE . Our studies have been directed at children. We pri- marily look at school age children, children age 3 to 10. That is avery good question. And as may have come up yesterday, the prev-alence, we call it prevalence only because we think most of it hasto do with sort of prenatal etiology, so that someone is either bornwith the condition or with the specific genetic predisposition for thecondition. So we thought we 'd refer to prevalence. Dr. W ELDON . Well, I would recommend you look at that issue, looking at the disease prevalence throughout all age groups in thepopulation. Because I think that 's a very, very critical question, if we are going to try to get \u2014\u2014 Dr. B OYLE . I think Dr. Amaral testified yesterday about efforts in California to address the issues of sort of changes in diagnosis,as many researchers have suggested, as well as the greater aware- ness of the condition and the impact that has had on the increasein the number of cases seen in California. Actually, I think that 's going to be a very interesting study. It 's really going to be able to shed some light on what 's happening. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb come back to you, Dr. Weldon? Mr. Wax- man is here and he wants to ask a few questions, then we 'll come right back to you. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Bernier, the CDC has explained that it is opposed to recall- ing thimerosal-containing vaccines because it 's concerned about shortages. In fact, I understand there is a concern about a shortageof DTaP vaccines. At the hearing yesterday, one of the witnessessuggested that stocks of non-thimerosal vaccines are adequate andthat there was no need to keep thimerosal-containing vaccines onthe shelves. Can you explain your concerns about shortages? For instance, if the DTaP vaccine containing thimerosal were recalled, what pos-sible effect would that have on our children? Mr. B ERNIER . Yes, Mr. Waxman, it is correct that at the present time, for DTaP, there is a very tight supply situation. We have twoadditional manufacturers that have left the market in the recentpast, and we are now left with only two manufacturers. And thereare back orders at the present time that cannot be filled becausethe amount of available vaccine is not adequate to fill those backorders. So if in fact there was to be issued a strong preference for thi- merosal free DTaP, or if there were to be a sudden recall of theexisting DTaP vaccine with thimerosal, this would produce spotshortages which would create, we think, delays in children beingimmunized, which could lead to disease very quickly. In 1999 alone, there were 15 deaths from pertussis in the United States. This year already we 've had five deaths from pertussis. So the need to continue the coverage with DTaP is very real. Theseare not hypothetical or theoretical risks. We know that creatingshortages will produce coverage problems, will increase the risk ofchildren to these diseases. Mr. W AXMAN . Last year, CDC testified that they were actively monitoring possible adverse effects of thimerosal, the mercury-con-taining preservative that 's being phased out of vaccines. CDC found no link between thimerosal and developmental delays. Have youcontinued to monitor for any of these effects, and what has yoursurveillance shown? Mr. B ERNIER . Well, we have continued at least in the look at the autism question. In the original results from the vaccine safetydata link, there was no evidence of a link between thimerosal expo-sure and autism. In the last year, an additional number of caseshas accumulated. I believe somewhere in the vicinity of an addi-tional 40 cases. When we add those cases to the ones that welooked at before, we reached the same conclusion. It has not alteredthe original conclusion, which was that there was no link betweenexposure to thimerosal and autism. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you. Dr. Midthun, at the hearing yesterday Dr. Haley testified about the toxicity of thimerosal-containing vac-cines. He suggested that the thimerosal in vaccines was harmful tochildren. In the pre-licensure phase, is the vaccine tested for toxicity?Dr. M IDTHUN . Yes, it is. The vaccines are usually evaluated in a very large number of infants, if that 's the target population for VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb 're intended. They are tested with regard to the entire formulation. And thus, if there were to be any acute toxicity, thatwould be noted in the clinical trials that are done in support of thelicense application. Mr. W AXMAN . Does this mean that the entire vaccine, including all of its component parts, is tested for toxicity? Dr. M IDTHUN . That 's correct. The vaccine in entirety is tested. Mr. W AXMAN . So if a vaccine were toxic, this should be revealed in the prelicensure phase, is that correct? Dr. M IDTHUN . Yes, that 's correct. Mr. W AXMAN . What did the toxicity testing of vaccines with thi- merosal reveal? Did this testing indicate that the thimerosal islikely to pose health dangers for children? Dr. M IDTHUN . The clinical studies did not suggest that, sir. Mr. W AXMAN . So why did the FDA move quickly to remove thi- merosal from vaccines? Dr. M IDTHUN . Because we felt it was an achievable goal. It was a way where we could reduce the overall exposure to mercuryamong children, and it was something that was achievable, becausewe could switch from multi-dose to single dose vials. In the UnitedStates that was something that was feasible. Mr. W AXMAN . Dr. Boyle, Dr. Wakefield testified at yesterday 's hearing that we need active surveillance of vaccine adverse events.Can you explain what CDC does to actively monitor potential prob-lems associated with vaccines? Mr. B ERNIER . CDC is actively looking at vaccine safety events through the VAERS system. We are monitoring events and whenevents occur that create cause for concern, we have the resourcerepresented by the vaccine safety data link population, which is away of, provides us an easier means of testing hypotheses that mayarise from adverse events that are detected. So we have this detection arm and then we have a testing arm where we can test hypotheses. For example, this was one of theways in which it worked recently with rotavirus andintussusception, where both arms of the vaccine safety mechanismswere put into play in order to address that concern. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Let me just followup on what Mr. Waxman said. I know he has to leave and he 's probably not going to hear the re- sponse, but did you folks test the rotavirus vaccine before you putit out on the market? Dr. M IDTHUN . I've not been involved with the rotavirus vaccine trials. Mr. B URTON . It was tested by FDA, wasn 't it? Dr. M IDTHUN . It was tested by FDA. Mr. B URTON . And in 9 months it was recalled, wasn 't it? Dr. M IDTHUN . Maybe I could ask Dr. Baylor. I wasn 't there at the time. Mr. B URTON . You don 't have to ask him. It was recalled, because one child died, there were several serious problems, intestinal prob-lems where there was surgery involved. And it was recalled. Dr. M IDTHUN . I just spoke with Dr. Baylor. It wasn 't actually a recall, either a mandatory or a voluntary recall. The company de-cided to withdraw it from the market, sir. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb Well, because one child died, and a whole host of them were injured. I mean, you know, you can cut it either wayyou want to. The fact is, they took it off the market, and it hadbeen tested. So you folks are not infallible. Now, the DPAT shot, are they still manufacturing that with thi- merosal in it? Mr. B ERNIER . No, Mr. Chairman, they are not. Mr. B URTON . They 're not. But you say that they 're not producing enough of the single shot vaccines to take care of the needs of thecountry at the present time? Mr. B ERNIER . At the present time, there is a shortage in the sup- ply, correct. They are back ordered, and the new vaccine that theyare producing is not adequate to meet the demand at the presenttime. Mr. B URTON . How long will it take for that to be adequate? Mr. B ERNIER . I think the FDA could have a better idea of that. My impression is that it 's, well, I mean, relatively short, and I 'm thinking of a few months. But I don 't have the information. Mr. B URTON . So in a few months, they could have the supply up. Now \u2014\u2014 Mr. B ERNIER . Could we just get FDA, because I don 't want that to be on the record, if that 's true or not. Mr. B URTON . How long will it take for them to get the single shot vials, doses up to safe level? Dr. M IDTHUN . I can 't give you the exact time line. But I do know that there are two more lots potentially containing thimerosal thatthe company intends to release. But after that, they will then bereleasing only the thimerosal reduced versions. Mr. B URTON . How many shots are in a lot? Dr. M IDTHUN . That 's proprietary information, sir. Mr. B URTON . Do you want me to subpoena it? Dr. M IDTHUN . I would be happy \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . You get it for me, or I 'll subpoena it. I want it. Dr. M IDTHUN . I would be happy to respond to the chairman 's let- ter on that. Mr. B URTON . Because what we 're talking about, there 's thou- sands and thousands of shots of DPAT that you 're going to put into the system and kids are going to get those shots because of theshortage. Now, let me ask you, what 's the likelihood, let 's say it takes 6 months, let 's say it takes 6 months to get the single shots up to snuff to where you 've got a supply, let 's say it takes 6 months. How many kids do you think are going to die in 6 months because theydon't get that shot? Mr. B ERNIER . I can 't estimate, Mr. Chairman. I can tell you that as I mentioned earlier in my testimony, this is not hypothetical. In1999, there were 15 deaths associated with pertussis. And already,there have been five deaths this year. So if we created a situationwhere we abruptly said, you must use thimerosal free vaccine, thatwould create shortages which would lead to delays which wouldlead to what I 'm calling days of lost protection. Mr. B URTON . I understand. You 've made your point. Let me just say this. I want the names of the producers of the DPAT shot. AndI'm going to subpoena records from them to find out how much is VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb lot, how they have two more lots that they have to use, they have two more lots. I want to find out how long it would take forthem to produce the diphtheria, tetanus and the pertussis vaccinesindividually. I 'm going to find out how long it 's going to take. Because I suspect that those lots have a lot of shots in them and there 's a lot of money involved, a lot of money involved. And as a result, they want to sell those before they go ahead and get theirlots of individual shots up to snuff. And I think it 's money, I really believe that. I think that there is mercury in those vaccines, and during the time that you say two or three or four or five or six or seven chil-dren are going to possibly die, and we don 't want any child to die, according to my figures, there are 16 children a day that 's going to come down with autism. A day. That 's 17,520 children are going to be at risk for autism in the next 3 years while studies are goingon, if mercury has something to do with it, as many, many peoplebelieve. Scientists, toxicologists, it 's not just me. We had a whole litany of doctors from all over the world talking about this yesterday. Andwhat you 're saying is one thing. But what scientists and doctors and studies have already shown is that mercury does have a debili-tating impact on the brain. So you 're talking about children at risk. In 3 years that it 's going to take to go through these studies, 17,520 children are likely to become autistic. If you folks arewrong, how are you going to live with yourselves? The gentlelady is recognized.Ms. R OS-LEHTINEN . Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I regret that I have not been able to be here for the entire hearing due toan overbooked schedule. But I have the testimony and I look for-ward to reading it tonight. As I had said before, we have two goodfriends of our family, Charles and Patience Flick, who have twochildren who are afflicted with autism. I know what a terrible tollautism can take on a family. Everything that the Flick family doesis related and surrounded by Bonnie and Willis and their care andwhat will happen to them. And any steps the Flick 's take, Bonnie and Willis are at the foremost of their thoughts. Bonnie is a little more high functioning and was able to go to Disney World with us. Willis is unfortunately so overstimulated bythe environment that he can barely leave his house. Everything istoo much sight and sound for him. So I look forward to seeing thefruits of the pressure that Chairman Burton is bringing to bear onthis issue. We need to improve research dollars, and have more re-search going into the causes of autism, to help lead us to a cure.Because I know how devastating that affliction is, not just on thechildren who have it, but on their families. We look forward to getting more evidence about the relationship between vaccinations and the rise, dramatic rise in autism rates.I know that many are not in agreement with that, but I congratu-late Chairman Burton for his steadfast devotion and his bravery, in spite of all of the attempts of the scientific and health commu-nity trying to make this seem like there 's no tie-in whatsoever. I don't think that we should leave any stone unturned. If mercury is a factor, we should give serious consideration to revamping our VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb and looking at other possible factors involved in the dramatic rates in autism across the country. So I thank you, Chairman Burton, on behalf of the many Flick families throughout the United States. Thank you, Dan. Mr. B URTON . I thank the gentlelady. Mrs. Morella, do you have any comments or questions?Mrs. M ORELLA . Actually, I commend you for the ongoing series of hearings that you 've had on autism. We all care about it. I 'm really here to listen, to learn and then to do what I can to lead andI know you have medical experts before you, many of them who areinvolved in laboratories in my district, NIH and of course FDA, andI value CDC. I'm also interested in the kind of funding that you do have. Real- ly, we work very hard, just as an example, to double the fundingfor NIH for that 5 year plan we had, so that by 2003 we would re-alize it. We are well on our way, this is our 4th year. I 'm curious, with regard to autism, and I must say, a lot of the leadership onlooking into autism obviously has come from the chairman, al-though I do wear sometimes my little jigsaw puzzle ribbon whichis autism, the puzzle pieces, right, which we are trying to put to-gether. I understand from your testimony, and I guess this would be Dr. Rennert, that $1 million is being set aside to fund innovative treat-ment proposals, and that you have 30 applications. How do youwork with that? Are you kind of a magician? Dr. R ENNERT . No, I think one works with it by trying to fund as many grants as one can, and that the limit is the number of dol-lars. Mrs. M ORELLA . So how many do you think you can? Dr. R ENNERT . Well, I think again, the response I would make is that the amount of funding we could use is equivalent to the num-ber of meritorious proposals that there are. And it depends onwhere you set the bar. Mrs. M ORELLA . Sounds like a political answer to me. Dr. R ENNERT . No, I can 't give you a precise number. But the point is quite clearly, we could use more funding to fund more pro-posals and more research on autism. Mrs. M ORELLA . It just seems to me that of the 30 applications and obviously probably not all would meet the qualifications, thepeer review, what it goes through, but certainly $1 million isn 't going to fund more than a couple of them, probably. Dr. R ENNERT . Three to four is what that would fund. Mrs. M ORELLA . So it does say something about the need for us to begin to look more into that in terms of the adequate funding. Then I note also, looking at Dr. Boyle 's testimony, and I wasn 't here to hear you synopsize it for the committee, but you mentionedthat CDC, NIH and 10 NIH funded centers and programs of excel-lence in autism are collaborating on a case control study of develop-mental regression. Each of these centers was awarded fundsthrough the NIH competitive process. Can you give us like a time line on it, how that is going?Dr. B OYLE . Actually, I may let my colleague at NIH address that. Dr. R ENNERT . Again, the program was initiated in 1997. And at this point in time, as we mentioned in our testimony, there are ap- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb with well defined autism that are a part of the network and the study. The second part is with regard spe-cifically to the question of the temporal association between vac-cination and the onset of autism, as well as a study of the potentialeffects of mercurials in vaccines as preservatives. There are at the present time 1,600 cases that are being used for the study. And the phase one part of the study will look at 250cases of patients with early onset autism, 250 patients with regres-sive autism, and a corresponding number of controls for eachgroup. That work now is in the second phase where the analysiswill begin and the study of the biological specimens that were ob-tained. A third part, because you mentioned it in regard to funding, I forgot to point out though it was in my written testimony, that infact we will release in the coming year an RFA or request for appli-cations for the competitive renewal and the commitment to renewthese centers for another 5 years. Clearly, our hope will be thatover time, that we could add more centers to this. But specifically,the element of study that ought to be completed, as I was askedby Chairman Burton in the next 2 years or so, is that these studieslinking or attempting to establish whether there 's an association or what the association is between vaccination and thiomercurials willbe completed. Mrs. M ORELLA . Within 2 years, then, that 's what you 're saying, 2 to 3 years. Fine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Let me just say to the gentlelady, in 3 years is what we thought was going to be the study, but if we waited 3years to have a conclusion drawn, and we continue to use thesekinds of vaccines, we 're all for vaccinations, but not with some of these things like mercury in them, there would be 17,520 new chil-dren that would probably be autistic. That is if mercury did havesomething to do with it. I think we 're about to wrap this up. We have a number of ques- tions we 'd like to submit to you for the record. I don 't want to keep you here all day. Do we have any parents that have autistic chil-dren in the room? Would you raise your hands? How many of you believe that your children were adversely af- fected by something in the vaccines? Would you raise your hands?Is that everybody or almost everybody? About 80 percent; 8 out of12, maybe 9 out of 12. That 's what we 're getting in e-mails by the hundreds and thousands. Now, maybe you folks are right, maybe mercury doesn 't have anything to do with it. Maybe the thimerosal doesn 't. But they think it does. And there 's a growing body of these people. And they're getting organized all across the country, and so is the Con- gress of the United States. So I really hope that you 'll take a hard look at this. Because it isn 't going to go away. And as I said before, it's going to cost this country trillions of dollars. In any event, do you have any other questions? Mrs. M ORELLA . No, I don 't, but of course I hope on the basis of all of this that if you can expedite so that we can come to someconclusions, because I can recognize the passion, but also the desirefor patience that 's so difficult for the chairman. And I would agree VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:23 Feb if it 's been going on since 1997, we should have some re- sults. Thank you very much. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Congresswoman Morella. We will submit these for the record.There are documents that we 'll be requesting. If there 's a prob- lem with you giving those because of confidentiality of any kind, ifyou would let us know and we 'll be happy to legally send a sub- poena to get that information, because we want to make sure wehave as much research material as possible. We'd also like to know who are the manufacturers of the DPAT shot. Dr. M IDTHUN . I believe Ms. Clay has that. Mr. B URTON . OK. We 'll be contacting them to get records on the supply that they have and how long it will take to go to single shotvials. With that, thank you for being here. We stand adjourned.[Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the committee was adjourned, to re- convene at the call of the Chair.] \u00c6 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
