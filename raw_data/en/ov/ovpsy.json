The practitioner typically inserts small, solid needles into various points of the body, stimulating nerves and muscles. In some instances, the acupuncturist uses forms of stimulation other than needles, such as heat, pressure, and friction. In traditional Chinese practice, acupuncture helps re-balance the body's energy, known as qi (chi), and provides a better quality of life. It is the disruption of this energy that practitioners believe cause the disease. Acupuncture serves as a method to regain energy balance and improve the flow of your body's qi. Acupuncture serves as an excellent supportive therapy for those seeking additional pain relief. This procedure can help reduce pain in those suffering from a variety of conditions, such as: Acupuncture demonstrates improvement in some disease states.

You should refrain from acupuncture if you have a bleeding disorder, are pregnant, or have a pacemaker. Additionally, the needles used must be sterile to prevent infection. Thankfully, the US Food and Drug Administration regulates acupuncture needles, which mandates they must be solid steel, clean, and non-toxic. Needles are for one-time use and disposed of following a procedure. The team at Docere Integrated Medicine examines your unique condition. Your condition helps determine the specific areas of your body that will best respond to an acupuncture treatment. They will also review your medical history to ensure you're a good candidate. Each needle requires careful insertion into place, where it can remain for up to 20 minutes. You may feel a small prick followed by tingling, which is normal and expected; most patients feel nothing during insertion. The entire procedure takes less than an hour.
