Interest on the Bonds is not treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code for purposes of the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. However, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, interest on the Bonds may be subject to certain other taxes affecting corporate holders of the Bonds. In addition, under existing statutes, interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal and corporate income taxes imposed by The State of Delaware.

C-1 [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK ] OFFICIAL STATEMENT of THE STATE OF DELAWARE $225,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, Series 2017 INTRODUCTION This Official Statement (includ ing the cover page and the appe ndices, the \"Official Statement\") has been prepared by The State of Delaware (the \"State\" or \"Delaware\") a nd provides certain information about the State and its $225,000,000 General Obli gation Bonds, Series 2017 (the \"2017 Bonds\" the \"B onds\"). The Bonds are issued as tax-exempt obligations of the State under the Interna l Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). Brief descriptions of the State, the authorizing Resolution (a s defined below) of the State's Issuing Officers (as defined below), and the Bonds are included in this Official Statement. Such descriptions do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive. All references here in to the Resolution and the Bonds are qualified in their entirety by reference to such documents. All such descriptions are further qualified in their entirety by reference to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforc ement of creditors' rights and general principles of equity. Copies of such documents are available for inspection at the offices of the Secretary of Finance of the State. DESCRIPTION OF THE BONDS General Information The Bonds are general obligations of the State to be issued pu rsuant to a resolution adopted on February 23, 2017 (the \"Resolution\") by the Governor, the Secre tary of Finance, the Secretary of State and the State Treasurer (the \"Issuing Officers\"). The Bonds will conta in a pledge of the State's full faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Bonds are dated and bear interest from their date of delivery payable commencing September 1, 2017, and thereafter semi-annually on each March 1 and September 1 (each an \"Interest Payment Date\") at the rate or ra tes per annum and shall mature, all as set forth on the inside cover page of this Official Statement. The Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds in denominations of $1,000 and int egral multiples thereof. Interest on the 2017 Bonds will be paid on each Interest Payme nt Date by the State by check or draft mailed to the holders of the 2017 Bonds on the Record Date (as described below) in respect of such Interest Payment Date to the registered addresses of such holders, as sh own in the bond register, maintained by the State. The Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Da te for the 2017 Bonds is the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month preceding such Interest Payment Date. Principal on the 2017 Bonds will be payable upon presentation and surrender of such 2017 Bonds by the holders of the 2017 Bonds at the office of the State Treasurer, in Dover, Delaware, at maturity. -2-Redemption Optional Redemption The Bonds maturing on or after M arch 1, 2028 are subject to red emption at the option of the State on or after March 1, 2027, and prior to maturity, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in any order of maturity and interest rate selected by the State (and within a maturity and interest rate by lot), at 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed, plus interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date. Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption will be mailed to registered owners of th e Bonds not less than 20 days nor more than 60 days prior to any optional redemption date in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution. The State, so long as a book-entry system is used for determining ownership of such Bonds, will send the notice of redemption to The Depository Tru st Company (\"DTC\"). Any failure of DTC to mail such notice to any DTC participant will not affect the validity of the redemption of the Bonds. If at the time of mailing of a notice of redemption, the State shall not have deposited with the bank or depositary acting as refunding escrow agent money sufficient to redeem all Bonds called for redemption, the notice of redemption may state that it is conditional, i.e., that it is s ubject to the deposit of sufficient redemption money with a refunding escrow agent not later than the redempti on date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such money is so deposited. Authorization and Purpose The Bonds are issued pursuant to the State Constitution, statu tes of the State, in cluding acts of the General Assembly (the \"General Assembly\") authorizing the issua nce of the Bonds (the \"Authorization Acts\") and the Resolution. The proceeds of the Bonds will be applied to pay for various capital facilities of the State and to provide financing for othe r capital projec ts, as authori zed by the Autho rization Acts. The State will allocate the debt service with respect to the B onds to various capital facilities. All of such Bonds are authorized t o be sold as twenty- year bonds and all of the Bonds will be sold as twenty-year bonds. The State Constitution provides that any money borrowed by the State shall be used exclusively for the purpose for which it is borrowed, but that if any borrowed mone y remains after a project has been completed or abandoned, such money may be expended according to law. The De laware Code provides that any funds borrowed pursuant to an Authorization Act and not expended for the purposes set forth therein shall be deposited in a special fund and applied with the approval of the Issuing Officers to the remaining costs of any project authorized by any prio r Authorization Act. Any premium from bonds or revenue notes, including the Bonds, shall, at the discretion of the Director of the Office of Management a nd Budget, Controller General and the Secretary of Finance: (1) Be deposited in a special fund of the State and applied fo r the purposes for which such bonds or notes were issued or as other wise provided by law; or (2) Be deposited in any escrow fund to redeem, refund or defea se debt service on existing bonds or notes of the State, or debt servi ce on any debt or other obliga tion of an instrumentality of the State. In the event that a deposit is made pursuant to paragraph (1) above, bond authorization shall be reduced by a corresponding amount. -3-SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS The sources and uses of funds to accomplish the purposes of th e Bonds are expected to be as follows: SOURCES : 2017 Bonds Par Amount: $225,000,000.00 Net Original Total Uses: $249,108,187.50 SECURITY FOR BONDS The Bonds are direct obligations of the State to which the ful l faith and credit of the State will be pledged. The payment of principal of and interest on debt obli gations of the State is made pursuant to appropriations by the General Assembly of the State. Historica lly, the State has appr opriated funds for and paid the principal of and interest on its debt obligations as t hey have come due. If the State fails to make sufficient provision to pay the pri ncipal of and interest on the Bonds, or, at the time such amount is payable, sufficient funds are unavailab le for such payment, a sufficient sum to pay such principal and interest is required by State law to be set apart by the State Treasurer from the first revenues thereafter received by the State. The State Treasurer may be required to set apart and apply such revenue to the payment of such pr incipal and interest at the su it of any holder of the Bonds. In the event the State fails to make timely payment of the pri ncipal of or interest on the Bonds, the owner of the Bond on which default in payment has occurred may also sue the State for breach of contract. In the opinion of the Attorney G eneral of the State, the State may not successfully invoke the defense of sovereign immunity in an acti on alleging breach of contract by the State, and in the further opinion of the Attorney General, the Bonds pertaining thereto are such contrac ts. Any judgment against the State obtained in such an action, however, must be paid solely from funds appropriated by the General Assembly for the purpose of such payment. [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.] -4-DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS The following table sets forth the debt service requirements o f general obligation bonds of the State, prior to and after giving effect to the issuance of the Bonds.

(2) Outstanding gross debt servi ce (excludes Federal Interest S ubsidy on Build America Bonds and Qualified School Construction Bonds). [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.] -5-BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE STATE Authorization of General Obligation Debt General obligation bonds and bon d anticipation notes of the St ate are issued and the proceeds thereof appropriated to various purposes pursuant to the Authorization Acts. Under the State Constitution, Authorization Acts become law upon the approval of three-quarters of all the elected members of eac h house of the General Assembly and the concurrence of the Governor. The Governor may veto a bill by returning the bill to the house of the General Assembly in which the bill originated within ten days of receipt, Sunday excepted. The General Assembly may override the Governor's veto by a three-fifths vot e of all members in each house. No bill becomes law after final adjournment of the General Assembly unl ess previously approved by the General Assembly and approved by the Governor within 30 days after such adjournment. The Governor has veto power over line item appropriations. Once an Authorization Act is enacted, the Issuing Officers are authorized by State law to issue bonds and bond anticipation notes thereunder. Bond anticipation note s may be issued for a term of one year and may be renewed, but all such renewal notes must mature not later than four years after the date of original issuance of such notes. No bond anticipation notes have been outstanding since fiscal 1978. All bonds are required to mature within 20 years from their date of issuance. Other than bonds issued in fiscal years 2010 through 2017, bonds may not provide for principal payments higher in later ye ars than earlier years (except for refunding bonds, capital appreciation bonds, qualified zone academy bonds and retail bonds) and may have such other terms as the Issuing Officers may determine, subject to the lim itations of the Authorization Acts and other provisions of law. The Qualified School Construction Bonds iss ued in fiscal year 2011 provided for a single maturity of $59.6 million in fiscal year 2030. The Issuing Officers are authorized to issue bonds to refund bonds in advance of maturity provided that the refunding results in a prese nt value savings to the State. The Issuing Officers may also issue revenue anticipation notes , in an amount they determine necessary, to meet a casual deficiency of revenue in the budgetary General Fund to pay budgetary General Fund obligations or to pay existing debts. Revenue anticipation notes may be is sued at any time and from time to time prior to June 25 in any State fiscal year. There has not been a State i ssue of revenue anticipation notes since fiscal 1977. If at any time during the fiscal year prior to June 15 there is a casual deficiency of revenue in the budgetary General Fund to pay budgetary General Fund obligations or to pa y existing debts, the State may draw upon available balances in the State' s budgetary Special Funds to pa y such obligations or debts. Such draws are required to be reimbursed to th e appropriate budgetary Special Funds as soon as sufficient budgetary General Fund monies become available, and in any case, the budgetary Ge neral Fund cannot evidence a negative balance after June 15 of such fiscal year. Debt Limits There is no State Constitutional debt limit; however, the State has statutory debt limits as discussed herein. In 1991, the State enacted legislation to replace the previous statutory debt limits with a three-part debt limit, effective July 1, 1991, as follows: First, the aggregate principal amount of new \"tax-supported obl igations of the State\" (hereinafter defined) which may be authorized in any one fiscal year (exclud ing refunding bonds) may not exceed 5% of estimated net budgetary General Fund revenue for that fiscal ye ar, as determined by a Joint Resolution approved by a majority of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly and signed by the -6-Governor in conjunction with the adoption of the annual Budget Appropriation Bill for that fiscal year (the \"5% Rule\"). The June 2016 estimate of net general fund revenue s for fiscal year 2017 was $4,048.4 million, thus a total of $202.4 million of new tax-supported general obl igation debt was permitted under the 5% rule and was authorized. The level of tax-supported debt permitted under the 5% Rule for the current and next four (4) fiscal years is set out in the following table. The fiscal year 2017 debt limit of $202.4 million is based on Senate Joint Resolution No. 15. However, the December 19, 2016 meetin g of the DEFAC reset the 2017 revenue estimates to 3,978.8 million. The revenue estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are estimates from the December 19, 2016 meeting of DEFAC. Estimates for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are based on growth rates established at the September 19, 2016 meeting. See \"STATE FINA NCIAL OPERATIONS \u2014 herein. DEFAC pro jections are dependent on a variety of economic factors affecting the State's projected revenues. See \"STATE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS - Revenue and Expenditure Forecasting.\" The 5% Rule (in millions) Estimated Net Budgetary Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 General Fund Revenue $ 3,978.8 $ 3,995.8 $ 4,063.3 $ 4,181.1 $ 4,306.6 Projected New Tax- Supported Debt Authorizations $ 202.4 $ 199.8 $ 203.2 $ 209.1 $ 215.3 Second, no \"tax-supported obligations of the State\" and no \"Transportation Trust Fund (\"Trust Fund\" or \"TTF\") debt obligations\" (each as hereinafter defined) of the Delaware Transportation Authority may be incurred if the aggregate maximum annual payments on all such outstanding obligations (plus certain lease obligations) exceed 15% of the estimated aggregate budget ary General Fund revenue, plus Trust Fund revenue for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such obligation is incurred (the \"15% Test\"). Any such debt incurred would ha ve to comply with this test, as illustrated in the following table: The 15% Test (in millions) Fiscal 2018(1) General Obligation Debt Service ............................... ................................. $ 259.6 Less: Excluded Debt Service (2) .................................................................

Tax-supported obligations do no t include a) obligations incurre d to acquire a like principal amount of full faith and credit obligations issued by a local school district to the extent such local school district obligations are not in default; b) any obligations of the Delaware Transportation A uthority; c) any tax or other revenue anticipation notes or bonds of the State; or d) obligations to the extent th at the debt service with respect thereto is reasonably expected to be offset (as determined by the Secretary of Financ e) by lease payments, user fees, federal grants or other payments from a non-budg etary General Fund source. \"Transportation Trust Fund debt obligations\" include all debt obligations of the Dela ware Transportation Authority, including all obliga tions extending beyond one year with respect to the lease, occupancy or acquisition of property which are incurred in connection with debt financing transactions (for example, certificates of participation), and which in any case are payab le from the Trust Fund. Trust Fund debt obligations do not include any obl igations to the extent that t he debt service with respect thereto is reasonably expected to be offset (as determined by the Secretary of Financ e) by lease payments, user fees, federal grants or other payments from a non-State source. Third, no general obligation debt (with certain exclusions) may be incurred if the maximum annual debt service payable in any fiscal year on all such outstanding obli gations will exceed the estimated cumulative cash balances (including all reserves) for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such obligation is incurred (the \"Cash Balances Test\"), as estimated by the Secretary of Fi nance.

General Obligation Debt As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding general obligation debt o f the State, a portion of which is supported by budgetary General Fund revenue and a portion of which is sup ported by budgetary Special Funds, is expected to be as follows: -8-Outstanding General Obligation Debt (in millions) General Obligation Debt Supporte d by Budgetary General Fund Rev enue State Facilities .............................................. .................... $ ....................................................................... $ 1,385.5(1) General Obligation Debt Supporte d by Budgetary Special Funds School Facilities (Local Share) ............................... .......... $ 517.4 Subtotal ....................................................................... $ Debt Outstanding ..................... $ 1,902.9(1) _____________ (1) Totals may not add due to rounding. The State pays between 60% and 80% of the cost of capital impr ovements for public school districts upon approval of such cost by the State Board of Education. Th e public school districts pay the remaining percentage. In conjunction with aggregate construction spendin g of capital improvement projects, the State issues bonds for 100% of the cost of approved school district p rojects pursuant to Authorization Acts. Simultaneously, the school distri cts issue their own bonds (the \"School District Bonds\") to the State for their 20% to 40% share of capital costs at an interest rate not excee ding 1/4 of 1% above the interest rate on the corresponding State bonds. As debt service payments on the Sta te's bonds become due, school districts are required to pay debt service on the School District Bonds from their tax receipts into the State's budgetary Special Fund, and the State pays t he total debt service from bo th the budgetary General Fund and Special Fund appropriations. This policy allows the local school districts to borrow capital funds at very competitive rates and to lessen the associated costs of issuance and market access. No public school district has ever defaulted on any such oblig ation to the State. Authorized but Unissued General Obligation Debt After issuance of the Bonds, st atutory authorization continues to exist for the issuance of additional general obligation debt of the State in the principal amount of $179.9 million. General Obligation Note Debt There are no outstanding State general obligation notes or any notes of any authority or agency for whose debt the State has a contingent liability as of the date of this Official Statement. Future Financings From time to time, the State enters the capital markets to finance various capital projects that have been authorized by the Authorization Acts. Historically, the State has financed its ongoing capital needs by issuing, when needed, general obligation bonds. At this time, the State does not anticipate entering the capital markets for new money needs until after calendar year 2017. The timing may change as the State updates its assessment of its capital program. -9-Debt Burden Comparisons The State's general obligation debt outstanding was $1,902.9 m illion as of June 30, 2016 with approximately 70% scheduled to mature within ten years. The fo llowing chart further demonstrates the State's commitment to the rapid retiremen t of its general obligation de bt. Delaware's debt burden reflects the centralized role of the Sta te government in financing capital projects that are typically funded by local governments in other states, such as schools and correctional facilities. In the U.S. Census Bureau's Public Education Finances survey of 2014 i ssued in June 2016, Delaware ranked 13th in state spending per pupil in ele mentary - secondary public schoo ls. Of the $1,902.9 million of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016, $517.4 million or 27.2% was issued on beha lf of local school districts. This debt is fully supported by the property tax revenues of those districts. The State has instituted a number of measures designed to mana ge and reduce its indebtedness, as outlined below. Aggressive Retirement of General Obligation Debt : The State voluntarily retires its general obligation debt rapidly. Approximately 70.0% of current genera l obligation debt is scheduled to mature within ten years, as noted above. Strict Debt Limitations : In 1991, the State instituted new debt limits, one of which restricts new debt authorizations to 5% of budgetary General Fund revenue as projected for the next fiscal year. The debt limit also effectively eliminates the use of any \"off bala nce sheet\" financing instruments, such as certificates of participation. See \"Bonded Indebtedness of the State - Debt Limits\" for further information concerning the State's debt limits. -10- Significant \"Pay-As-You-Go\" Financing : Over the years, the State has appropriated surplus cash for \"pay-as-you-go\" financing. Revenue surpluses between fiscal years 1993 to 2001 allowed the State to appropriate cash on average at a rate of 52.6% of capital ex penditures. With more modest revenue growth, cash contributions in fiscal year s 2008 through 20 17 have avera ged 17% of all capital expenditures. Numerous Bond Refundings : The State has undertaken a ser ies of bond refundings which h ave lowered the overall debt service on outstanding State general o bligation debt. Since fiscal 2003, the State has refunded over $1,212.0 million of its general obligation bonds for a combined present value savings of $75.0 million. The State continues to monitor opportunities to refun d its outstanding bonds to lower future debt service requirements. T h e r e s u l t o f t h e s e i n i t i a t i v e s h a s b e e n t o r e d u c e t h e r a t e o f growth in Delaware's debt burden, as depicted on a fiscal year basis in the following three charts.

In calendar year s 2009 and 2010, the State issued $295,090,000 in aggregate principal amount of Build America Bon ds and elected to receive periodic payments from the United States Treasury on each interest payme nt date equal to 35% of the corresponding interest payable on such Build America Bonds (the \"BAB Subsidy Payments\"). \"Qualified School Construction Bonds\" are taxable general obli gation bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the State and could be issued to finance th e construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a facility was to be constructed. For calendar years 2009 and 2010, the State received Qualified Scho ol Construction Bond allocations of $29,784,000 and $29,797,000, respectively. The State carried f orward the entire $29,784,000 from 2009 and issued $59,580,000 in aggregate principal amount of Qualifi ed School Construction Bonds in 2010 and elected to receive periodic payments from the United States Treasury on each interest payment date equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of interest payable on t he such Bonds on such date; or (ii) the amount of interest that would have been payable on the such Bonds if t he interest were determined at the applicable tax credit rate pursu ant to Section 54A(b)( 3) of the Code publi shed by the United States Treasury on the sale date of such Bonds (the \"Q SCB Subsidy Payments\"). Subsequent acts of Congress have reduced direct-pay bond subsi dy payments by 6.9% in federal fiscal year 2017 and by rates that will be set from time to tim e through federal fiscal year 2024. Neither the BAB Subsidy Payments nor the QSCB Subsidy Payments were pledged to the payment of the Build America Bonds or the Qualified School Cons truction Bonds, respectively. Such subsidy payments are paid directly to the State and the holders of such Build America Bonds and Qualified School Construction B onds are not entitled to a tax c redit related thereto, and interest paid to holders of such bonds is subject to federal income tax. Sustainable Energy Utility, Inc. E nergy Efficiency Revenue Bond s In August, 2011, pursuant to the Delaware Energy Act, 29 Del. C. \u00a78059, Energy Utility, Inc. (the \"SEU\"), a Delaware nonprofit corporation created by and for the benefit of the State issued $67,435,000 of its Sustainable Energy Utility , Inc. Energy Efficiency Reven ue Bonds, Series 2011 (the \"SEU Bonds\"). The SEU has developed a program (the \"SEU Program\") to issue bo nds and utilize the proceeds to pay the costs of designing and implementing energy conservat ion measures (\"ECMs\") at the facilities of agencies (defined to include the State, municipalities, scho ol districts, and state and local governmental agencies and institutions of higher learning). The SEU Bonds w ere issued to finance the initial ECMs for several State agencies and departments participating in the SEU Program (the \"Agencies\" and each an \"Agency\"). Each Agency is obligated to make or cause to be made payments (the \"Installment Payments\") to the SEU for the ECMs under an Installment Payment Agreement in accordance with the Energy Performance Contracting Act, 29 Del. C. \u00a76971. Each Ins tallment Payment Agreement is the several obligation only of the applicable Agency under which In stallment Payments are payable by such Agency out of funds appropriated to such Agency by the State an d available for such purpose. The SEU Bonds are limited obligations of the SEU payable primar ily from the Installment Payments to be made by, or on behalf of, the Agencies. The Agencies' obligations to make Installment Payments are subject to appropriation by the State, and the State is not obligated to make any appropriation to an Agency. Neither the State nor any politica l subdivision thereof shall be obligated to -13-make payments on the SEU Bonds. Neither the faith and credit n or the taxing power of the State or of any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the SEU Bonds. The issuance of the SEU Bonds does not directly or indi rectly or contingently obligate the State or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any f orm of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for their payment. Qualified Zone Academy Bonds Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (\"QZAB\") are general obligation bo nds backed by the full faith and credit of the State for the repayment of principal, primarily t hrough the use of a sinking fund with a bullet maturity. QZABs are taxable bonds the proceeds of which are li mited to improving eligible public schools, such capital projects having been approved by the General Assem bly. In lieu of receiving periodic interest payments from the State, an eligible QZAB holder is generally a llowed annual federal income tax credits while the QZAB is outstanding. On December 8, 2006, the State issued $1,433,000 QZABs for the purpose of financing renovations of the following facilities in the Cape Henlopen School Distric t, Sussex County, Delaware: the Lewes School, Milton Elementary School, Rehoboth Elementary School and H.O. Brittingham Elementary School. In conjunction with such QZAB, the State executed a forward del ivery contract requiring that the State establish an escrow account to be funded with annual sinking fu nd deposits and which will be guaranteed interest at a rate of 2.72% per annum. In 2004, the State issued $908,000 QZABs and, in fiscal year 2 005, issued $224,177 QZABs to finance the renovations of the Charlton School in the Caesar Ro dney School District, Kent County, Delaware. In fiscal year 2003, the State issued $760,000 QZABs and, in fiscal year 2002, issued $649,000 QZABs. The fiscal year 2003 QZAB proceeds funded the renovation of the Charlton School in the Caesar Rodney School District, Kent County, Delaware. The fiscal year 2002 QZAB proceeds assisted in the renovation of Georgetown and Show ell elementary schools in the Indian River School District, Sussex County, Delaware. The 2002 QZAB bonds were fully paid off in D ecember 2016. State Revenue Debt There is currently no State revenue debt outstanding, nor any plans to authorize any State debt other than State general obligation debt. Lease Obligations The State has entered into various property and equipment leas es with terms in excess of one year. At June 30, 2016, aggregate remaining lease payments total approxi mately $182.5 million with $127.3 million payable through fiscal year 2021. Real estate rentals account for 86.4% of the aggregate payments and equipment rentals account for the remainder. In addition, the State has entered into long-term capital leases for energy and other equipment with terms in excess of one year and which aggregate remaining lease payments as of June 30, 2016 total approxim ately $33.0 million. All paymen ts are subject to annual ap propriation. The State may not be held contractually liable for the payments in the ev ent that such appropriations are not made. See \"Notes to the Financial Statements - #9, Loans and Notes Payabl e and #10, Lease Commitments\" in the State's Basic Financial Statements included in its Comprehensive Annual F i n a n c i a l R e p o r t ( t h e \" C A F R \" ) f o r t h e fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, a link to which is provided under \"INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\" herein. Lease obligations are subject to one of the State's debt limits , the 15% Test. See \"BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE STATE - Debt Limits\" for a further explanation. -14-INDEBTEDNESS OF AUTHORITIES, UNIVERSITIES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS Oversight responsibility for the issuance of debt by the State and authorities deemed to be part of the State's financial reporting entity is centralized under the Sec retary of Finance. The following section sets forth certain indebtedness of State authorities, Delaware State Unive rsity, the University of Delaware and political subdivisions of the State. The State is not directly or contin gently liable for debt service for any of the following indebtedness: Authorities Delaware Transportation Authority The Delaware Transportation Authority (the \"Authority\") is a b ody corporate and politic constituting an instrumentality of the State. T he Authority acts by resolution of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (the \"Department\"), the Director of Finance of t he Department and the Transportation Trust Fund Administrator. The Department has overall responsibility for c oordinating and developing comprehensive, multi-modal transporta tion planning and policy for the State. The Authority assists in the implementation of this policy and has the power to develop a unified system of air, wa ter, vehicular, public and specialized transportation in the State, subject to oversight by the Depart ment and the State as hereinafter described. To assist the Authority in fina ncing a unified transportation system, the State created the Transportation Trust Fund (the \"Trust Fund\" or \"TTF\") within the Authority in 1987 to receive revenue and receipts of the Authority. The primary sources of funding of the Trust Fund ar e motor fuel taxes, motor vehicle document fees, motor vehicle registration fees, and other transportation-related fees, all of which are imposed and collected by the State and transferred to the Trust Fund. The State has irr evocably pledged, assigned and continuously appropriated these taxes and fees to the Trust Fund. The other major source of funding for the Trust Fund is toll and concession revenue of the Delaware Turnpike and the Route 1 Toll Road. The Authority may apply Trust Fund revenue for transportation projects, subject to the approv al of the State, and may pl edge any or all of this revenue to secure financings for these projects. As of December 31, 2016, the Delaware Transpor tation Authority had outstanding $630.9 million in Transportation System Revenue B onds and $76.0 million in Grant Anticipation Revenue Bonds, or \"GARVEEs\", which were issued to finance a portion of the costs of completing the final design and right-of-way acquisition activitie s for a new U. S. 301. The Au thority may i ssue bonds to refund prior Authority obligations. In December 2015, the Authority issued its U.S. 301 Project Revenue Bonds, Series of 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of $212.535 million (the \"Sr. 301 Bo nds\") and its Subordinated U.S. 301 Project Revenue Bonds, TIFIA Series of 2015 in a principal amount up to $211.35 million (the \"TIFIA 301 Bond\"). Proceeds of the Sr. 301 Bonds and the TIFIA 301 Bond will be us ed to finance the costs of the construction and equipping of the new U.S. 301. Both the Sr. 301 Bonds and the TIFIA 301 Bond are secured by the revenues generated from the new U.S. 301 toll road as well as b y a subordinate lien on the pledged revenues of the TTF that secure the TTF's senior bonds and junior bonds. As of December 31, 2016, no draws have been made on the TIFIA 301 Bond. Additional bonds secured on pari ty with the TTF's senior bonds may be issued subject to the satisfaction of debt service coverage tests a nd certain other requirements. Under certain circumstances, additional revenue may be pledged by the Authority to secure its bonds, in which c ase such revenue may be taken into account in determining satisfaction of these debt service coverage tests. The Authority may also incur additional debt, which has a lien on revenue subordinate to the lien of other bo nds. See \"Notes to the Financial Statements - #8, -15-Revenue Bonds\" in the State's Basic Financial Statements includ ed in its CAFR for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, a link to which is provided under \"INDEPENDENT A UDITORS\" herein. In addition to debt service coverage tests and certain other re quirements, future debt issues of the Authority are subject to one of the debt limits of the State. The debt limit mandates tha t the aggregate maximum annual payments on the State's t ax-supported obligations and th e TTF debt obligations of the Authority (plus certain lease obligations) may not exceed 15% of total budgetar y General Fund revenue, plus Trust Fund revenue for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such deb t is issued. See \"BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE STATE - Debt Limits\" f or a further explanation. The bonds of the Authority do not constitute a debt of the State or a pledge of the general taxing power or the faith and credit of the State or any political subdivisi on, agency or instrumentality thereof other than the Authority. The State's pledge a nd assignment to the Authority of motor fuel tax revenue, motor vehicle document fees, motor vehicle regi stration fees and other revenu e pursuant to State law creates an obligation of the State, until there are no longer any Authority bonds remain ing outstanding, to continue to impose and collect these taxes and fees at least at the rates in effect on the dat e of issuance of the Authority bonds and to transfer this revenue to the Authority. The State, however, has no obli gation to increase these taxes or fees to provide sufficient revenue to meet payments of debt service on the Auth ority's bonds. Delaware State Housing Authority The Delaware State Housing Auth ority (\"DSHA\"), created in 1968 , had outstanding on December 31, 2016, $233.5 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds a nd $38.7 million of taxable revenue bonds. The total $272.2 million of the outstanding bonds were issued t o finance the purchase of single-family homes. The security for these bonds is mortgage loan repayments, reser ve funds, bond proceeds and other revenue. The taxable bonds have been issued primarily to finance second mort gages, providing down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. See \"Notes to the Fina ncial Statements - #8, Revenue Bonds\" in the State's Basic Financial Statements included in its CAFR for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, a link to which is provided under \"INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\" herein. Bonds issued by DSHA (\"DSHA Bonds\") do not constitute a debt o r liability of the State. The enabling legislation, however, provides t hat the General Assembly may, b ut is not obligated to, make appropriations to restore the DSHA's capital reserve fund if such fund is drawn u pon to meet debt service payments on certain of the DSHA Bonds. As of December 31, 2016, there were no DSHA Bonds outstanding which are entitled to the benefit of the capital reserve fund. To date, the General Asse mbly has not been requested to make any such \"moral obligation\" appropriations. The statutory debt limit of the DSHA is $350.0 million in bonds carrying the moral obligation of the State. Delaware Economic Development Authority The Delaware Economic Development Authority and its predecesso rs had outstanding approximately $751.7 million in economic development revenue bonds on June 30 , 2016, none of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the State. The following two Authorities a re not part of the State's fina ncial reporting entity. The State, however, exercises oversight regarding their debt activities. Delaware Solid Waste Authority The Delaware Solid Waste Author ity (the \"DSWA\") was created in 1975 and is the sole entity in the State responsible for the planni ng and administration of a comp rehensive statewide program for the -16-management, storage, collection, transportation, utilization, p rocessing (including resource recovery), and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge. On June 1, 2016, DS WA had $24.5 million outstanding solid waste revenue bonds. Delaware Health Facilities Authority The Delaware Health Facilities Authority (the \"Health Faciliti es Authority\"), established in 1973, is authorized to issue revenue bonds and notes to finance projects for health care facilities located in the State. As of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding $554.0 million of revenue bonds issued for the benefit of these facilities. The Health Facili ties Authority has no taxing powe r and no source of funds other than from the contractual obligations of partic ipating health care facilities . Universities Delaware State University There were outstanding on June 30, 2016, $118.5 million of rev enue bonds issued by Delaware State University. These bonds are secu red by the Delaware State Univ ersity's pledge of certain of its net operating revenue and net non-operating revenue, exclusive of gifts, gran ts, bequests, contributions and donations to the extent specifically restricted to a particular purpose inconsis tent with their use for the making of debt service payments and any funds a ppropriated by the State. University of Delaware There were outstanding on June 30, 2016, $478.8 million of rev enue bonds issued by the University of Delaware for housing, dining a nd other auxiliary facilities. T hese bonds are secured by revenue generated by the facilities. Political Subdivisions The approximate aggregate principal amount of general obligati on bond indebtedness of the three counties, the City of Wilmington, the other cities and towns an d the school districts of the State, as of June 30, 2016, is outlined i n the following table: General Obligation Debt of Political Subdivisions (in millions) New Castle County ............................................. ....... $ 517.4(3) Total ........................................................ ...... $1,626.6 Source : Chief fiscal officers of respective governmental entities. (1) Of this total, $3.4 million in principal is supported by paymen ts from the Diamond State Port Corporation, an instrumentality of the State. Excludes $13.5 m illion of Wilmington Parking Authority bonds guaranteed by the City of Wilmington. (2) Excludes revenue bonds and anticipation notes. (3) Represents local shares sold by the State on behalf of the school districts (as reporte d in the earlier chart entitled \"Outstanding General Obligation Debt\"). -17- Indebtedness of counties, towns, and cities, other than the Ci ty of Wilmington, has been incurred primarily for water and sewer pr ojects and general municipal pu rposes, subject to various debt limits. The State is not liable for any of this indebtedness. Unlike most other states, the State, rather tha n the local governments, is principally responsible for cap ital expenditures for schools an d correctional facilities. ECONOMIC BASE The State is located on the eas tern seaboard of the United Sta tes and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay, as well as by the states of New Jersey, P ennsylvania and Maryland. It has a land area of 1,955 square miles, ranking 49th in area in the United States. The State is 96 miles long and varies from 9 to 35 miles wide, with elevations ranging from sea level to 442 feet. As the first state to ratify the United States Constitution on Decembe r 7, 1787, Delaware i s known as \"The Fir st State.\" Recent History Since emerging from the Great Rec ession, Delaware's economic pe rformance has largely mirrored national trends in terms of empl oyment. Over this period, Dela ware has generally posted lower unemployment rates than the United States. More recently, Delaware's employment has expanded at a pace that exceeds regional and national averages and, while Delaware 's per capita personal income is 99% of the national average, cumulative growth since 2012 has exceeded tha t of the nation's growth. The State's recent performance is due, in part, to the changing composition of its economic base. The State's long-established manufacturing sectors, auto manufa cturing and fibers, for example, have suffered as a result of the worst economic downturn since World War II. In response to the shifts in the State's economic base, however, the State has made important st rides to reinvigorate and modernize its manufacturing base. The site of the former Chrysler plant was purchased by the University of Delaware to pursue science, technology and adva nced research. The \"STAR\" c ampus now houses a health sciences complex dedicated to advanced h ealthcare research, education an d delivery and 12 promising start-ups launched by ex-DuPonters, University of Delaware faculty and ot hers. Bloom Energy now produces solid oxide fuel cells, \"Bloom Boxes\", in a new, on-site manufacturin g facility, and through a project with NRG Energy Inc., all-electric vehicles give and take power from an electric power grid using technology invented at the University of Delaware. With a heavy concentration in financial services, the State's e conomy cannot avoid the effects of any cyclical disturbances. The State's major employers, however, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Capital One and M&T Bank, continue to maintain a major presence in the State and demonstrate the State's importance as a financial center. JPMorgan, especially, continues to make significant investments in Delaware. The Port of Wilmington boasts the nation's largest dockside ref rigerated complex and is the top importer of fresh fruit in North America. Renovations and a pl anned expansion will increase the capacity of the Port and dredging of the Del aware River will allow it to process cargo of larger ships. Diversifying the State's econom y has consistently ranked among State policymakers' highest priorities since the adoption of the Financial Center Developme nt Act in 1981. The State's economic development efforts have followe d a two-pronged approach. Broa dly speaking, the State has continually improved its business climate using a combination of (i) pruden t fiscal management, including judicious tax policy, and (ii) strategic investments in public education and infrastructure. When faced with specific challenges, alert and supportive policymakers have teamed with the business community to develop effective policy responses to a changing economic landscape. The recent activity at E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) is a prime example. -18-Late in December 2015, DuPont, a Delaware company, announced a m e r g e r w i t h D o w C h e m i c a l Co., Inc. (Dow) in conjunction with a global cost savings and r estructuring plan designed to reduce $700 million in costs compared with 201 5. Under the merger, Dow and DuPont would form DowDuPont, and then separate into three indepe ndent companies: (1) agricultur e and chemicals, (2) material sciences and (3) specialty products. Subsequently, on December 30, 2015, DuPont announced layoffs accounting for 28% of its current Delaware workforce, notifying DuPont's 6,100 Delawa re employees. Nearly 1,200 DuPont employees in Delaware were expected to be laid off in early 201 6, with the remainder to be released later. At the time of the merger announcement, DuPont announced that its specialty products business would remain in Delaware. With the passage of the Delaware Commitmen t to Innovation Act, which uncapped an R&D credit, made the credit ref undable and reinstated the New Economy Jobs Credit in March 2016, DowDuPont leaders opted to headquarter the agricultural and che micals business in Delaware as well. The material sciences business is to be headquartered in Midland, M ichigan. The merger is currently under review by the European Commission, the European Union's anti-tr ust regulatory authority. Chemours, a performance chemical company, was spun-off from DuP ont in July 2015. With facilities in 11 countries and thousands of employees around th e world, the decision to keep Chemours global headquarter in Wilmington, Delaware was, at least, partially ba sed on the Delaware Competes Act enacted in January 2016. The Delaware Comp etes Act re-apportioned Delawar e's corporate income tax to make Delaware more competitive with other states. To enhance its position in an increasingly competitive gaming m arket and to increase employment across the State, Delaware diversified its gaming portfolio to include sports betting and Keno at off-track retail venues, and in November 2013, introduced i-gaming to in- state consumers via the internet.

One notable exa mple is Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq: INCY) (\"Incyte\") . Since basing its headquarters in Delaware more than 11 years ago, Incyte has discovered, developed and commercialized Jakafi\u00ae (ruxolitinib), a medicine that was th e first drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a rare blood cancer and the first one in its class approved for any indication. Incyte is also developing J akafi\u00ae as a potential treatment for additional cancers and has a broad product pipeline that includes multiple compounds that address a number of unmet patient needs. Incyte relocated to a newly renovated 190,800 s quare foot campus on 16.7 acres in North Wilmington in 2015 and construction is currently underway to fu rther expand their footprint on that site. In January 2016, Incyte and AstraZeneca (Nasdaq: AZN) announced a new collaboration to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Incyte's Janus-associated kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor, INCB39110, in ptor (EGFR) inhibitor, (osimertinib). The combination will be a second-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have been with a first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and subsequently developed the T790M res istance mutation. There is increasing evidence that signaling through the JAK-STA T (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway could be a contributing factor in res istance to EGFR TKI treatment in patients with EGFR mutation NSCLC. Blocking both JAK and EGFR activity may t herefore offer an improved targeted treatment benefit in some patients. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca and Incyte will c ollaborate on a Phase 1/2 study, to be conducted by Incyte. The Phase 1 part of the trial is expected to establish a recommended dose regimen for the combination of INCB39110 and Tagrisso while the Phase 2 part of the study will assess the safety and efficacy profile. Results from the study will be used to deter mine whether further clinical development of this combination is warranted. In addition, Delaware's colleges and universities continue to d evelop and update curriculum in direct support of the life sciences.

Also in 2016 the Department of Energy selected the University of Delaware to lead a major s egment in its new Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment (RAPID) collaboration. Dela ware researchers will focus on catalysis and reactors, looking to discover new less expensive, more ener gy efficient ways to manufacture chemicals. A recent addition to the state is the University of Delaware's 272-acre Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus located at a former Chrysler si te. STAR Campus is growing into a center of innovation that blends cutting-edge research, top-notch academics and thriving businesses in one location. Future research and development at the STAR Campus is planned in the health science, cyber security, and alternative energy sectors. Nemours Biomedical Research, the nation's largest group medical practice devoted to pediatric care, education, and research and headquartered at the Nemours Alfred I. DuPont Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, has more than 40 different research programs and labo ratories to support the medical and surgical staff in restoring and improving the health of acutely and chro nically ill children. Based on dollars received from the National Institutes of Health, Nemours Biomedical Rese arch would rank 16th in overall awards to freestanding children's hospitals. According to the American H ospital Association Guide, there are about 250 such children's hospitals. Christiana Care Health System, headquartered in Wilmington, Del aware, is one of the country's largest health care providers, ranking 21st in the nation for hospital admissions. Christiana Care is a major teaching hospital with two cam puses and more than 250 Medical-D ental residents and fellows. Christiana Care provides research as a key element to providing quality he alth care in every medical specialty. There are hundreds of multicenter national, regional and locally base d studies in progress led by Christiana Care investigators on the hospital campuses and other patient care facilities, as well as at affiliates throughout the region. Many research trials are open for enrollment. The Delaware Technology Park (\"DTP \") is part of Delaware's comm itment to attracting both established businesses and promising high-tech companies. With a combination of government, academic and industry partners, it is now home to 54 high-tech companies , including the Delaware Biotechnology Institute. The mission behind DTP is to promote economic devel opment and innovation and, to that end, has developed an integrated system of technology focused facilities and services. Since its inception, DTP has housed more than 75 companies, including 25 companies that have matured and graduated from DTP. There has been $300 million invested in DTP and an additional $300 mi llion given to DTP organizations through research grants. In 2016, DTP ope ned their newest incubator fa cility on the University of Delaware's Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) campus. STAR c ampus is home to University of Delaware's College of Health Sciences as well as Bloom Energy's R&D and manufacturing facility of solid oxide fuel cells. The incubator facility is a 10,000 square foo t space that includes individual laboratories for entrepreneurs as well as shared space to foster collaboration. Biotechnology Delaware is one of only a few states with a specialization in a ll four bioscience subsections: (1) agriculture, feedstock and chemicals; (2) drugs and pharmaceuti cals; (3) medical devices and equipment; and (4) research and testing. With its roots in the research and development standards established by the original DuPont Company more than 200 years ago, Delaware is currently h ome to bioscience firms ranging from incubator start-ups to multinational giants with a supportive environment for creativity and innovation. -30- Delaware is uniquely positioned geographically and scientifica lly to maximize the biotechnology industry across all spectrums. Delaware's location at the center of the East Coast of the United States provides excellent access to world markets. Delaware lies in t he eastern megalopolis where approximately one-third of the United States' population resides. A 350-mile radius circle, drawn around the City of Wilmington, Delaware, encompasses every major population center from Boston, Massachusetts to Raleigh, North Carolina, and as far west as Cleveland, Ohio. Modern hig hways, railroads, airports, ports, and public transit systems facilitate the m ovement of produc ts and people. The Delaware Biotechnology Institute (\"DBI\"), located in Delawa re Technology Park, is an academic unit of the University of Delaware and a partnership a mong government, academia and industry to help establish Delaware as a center of excellence in biotechnol ogy and the life sciences. DBI's mission is to build a biotechnology network of people and facilities to enhan ce academic and private sector research, catalyze unique cross-disciplinary research and education initi atives and to foster the entrepreneurship that creates high quality jobs. DBI's 72,000 square foot research f acility is designed to house 140 faculty and student researchers and features 25 dedicated research laborato ries, 10 common research laboratories, six state-of-the-art research instrumentation centers, and several large and small conference areas. Some of the companies launched at DBI are: the Fraunhofer Center for Molecu InfoQuest Systems, iB io, Occam BioLabs and Quantum Leap Innovations. DBI contributes at all levels to Delaware's innova tion in Science, Technology, Eng ineering and Math (STEM) by leading the State's annual BioGENEius Challe nge, by collaborating with the national Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and by augmenting K-12 biotechnology educati on with programs for teachers as well as students throughout the school year. DBI led Delaware's effort to gain Experimental Program to Stimu late Competitive Research (\"EPSCoR\") status with the Nati onal Science Foundation's Experi mental Program Status Competitive Research. EPSCoR status provides Delaware and 30 other qualifying states and U.S. Territories with a better chance for federal funding dollars. Eight federal agencies, in cluding the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH\") and the National Scienc e Foundation (\"NSF\"), participat e in this program as co-funders in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR). Over the past five years, DBI h as successfully built a capabili ty in plant molecular biology to better understand the basic processes that control plant development o n the genetic level. Combined with the highly regarded genomics-based poultry disease research located at DBI, this newly developed capability has direct applications to serve Delaware's agricultural industry. Leading-edge interdisciplinary research is at the core of DBI's work. Successful partnerships are already underway involving biology, biochemistry, engineering, marine, materials science and computational biology. Encompassing 12 academic departments at the Universit y of Delaware alone, collaborations are also state-wide, national and in ternational, with the participa tion of scientists from Delaware State University, Delaware Technical C ommunity College (\"DTCC\"), and Wesley College. DBI-affiliated researchers are principal investigators in a growing portfolio of federal research grants from NSF, NIH, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") and numerous other gov ernment agencies and private foundations. In 2012, with support from the State, DBI launched The Bioscien ce Center for Advanced Technology (\"The Bioscience CAT\"), which synergizes efforts amo ng the academic and industrial community to address the technology innovation gap and promote economic development in Delaware. The Bioscience CAT links researchers in Delaware institutions with Delaware bioscience companies with the goal of investing in the bioscience community to ensure Delawar e competes on the world stage in biotechnology innovation. The Bioscience CAT has three key com ponents: a grant program funded by the State, a technology access program, and an annual symposium. T he Technology Access Program (\"TAP\") -31-provides Delaware bioscience businesses with access - at a redu ced fee - to high-end technology platforms available as part of the DBI ne twork. Many businesses routinely send samples to these facilities for analysis and pay a certain rate for this service. Under TAP, businesses will be able to continue to do their work, but receive a discounted rate that i s subsidized by The Bioscience CAT. Delaware's investments serve as seed funding for private invest ments, as found in the example of Fraunhofer Center for Molecular Biotechnology (\"CMB\"). Establi shed in July 2001 as a partnership between the Fraunhofer Society in Germany and the State, CMB conducts research in the area of plant biotechnology, developing cutting edge technologies to assist t he diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human and animal diseases. With the addition of CMB manufactur ing capability and the successful completion of two successful Phase I clinical trials, CMB's pla nt-based, protein production technology achieved several important developmental milestones. The advan cement of CMB's work, as measured by the U.S. Department of Defense, has evolved from Level 1- Basic technology research, through proof of feasibility, technology development and demonstration to level 8 - System and subsystem development, which has made CMB eligible for new funding from various govern ment departments including the NIH. This is a major accomplishment which both externally validates CMB's innovative technology and enables the organization to move closer to the goal of improving sustai nability. After several rounds of funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against malaria, CMB recently received funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to advance development of candidate vaccine components and technologies that accelerate the immune response for use following intentional release of Bacillus anthracis or in response to naturally occurring outbre aks. Another project, funded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, is designed to develop a cost-effective, high throughput, ex-vivo, lung tissue-based sys tem for evaluating vaccine safety and immunogenicity directly in human tissue. This three year contr act addresses one of the largest obstacles in the current system of evaluating vaccine safety and immunogenic ity - the lengthy testing in animal models that preceded clinical drug development. To ensure Delaware's continued voice in regional biotechnology industry opportunities, the Delaware BioScience Association (\"DBA\") was formed in 2006 and celebrated its 10-year anniversary last year. DBA is a non-profit trade association dedicated to promo ting and expanding Delaware's bioscience industry by establishing a unified voice in order to accelerate the growth of human, animal, plant, and industrial bioscience, advocating on behalf of the industry in support of public policies that advance bioscience in the State, suppor ting initiatives that help attra ct bioscience talent and enterprises to the State, as well as support their retention and growth, while developing an d implementing programs that build local, regional, national, and international recognition of and suppor t for Delaware's bioscience industry. The membership has grown to include over 120 members including seve ral global companies such as AstraZeneca, Endo Pharmaceuticals, QPS LLC, previously known as Quest Pharmaceutical Services, Siemens Healthcare, and Incyte Pharmaceuticals. Delaware State University (\"DSU \") is another proud contributor to Delaware's biotechnology research and technology transfer. In 2009, DSU launched the Ce nter for Integrated Biological and Environmental Research designed as a regional faculty network h ub that includes DSU, Wesley College, DTCC and the University of Delaware (\"UD\"). Major functions of the center include: (1) identifying funding opportunities and assisting in bringing together groups of researchers in order to secure grants; (2) communicating the availability of and training on the use of re search instrumentation and equipment across the network; (3) coordinating the use and maintenance of key co mmon research facilities at DSU; and (4) integrating research and outreach activities for partner institutions. All students on the Biotechnology track at DSU complete an independent research project for their Senior C apstone course. -32-DTCC offers Biotechnology as an Associate Degree as well as a C ertificate program with articulation agreements in place with UD and DSU, as well as ot her academic institutions. Delaware's Vocational High Schools offer Biotechnology as a Certificate pr ogram with co-op and internship opportunities for their students. Delaware Biotechnology Institute and Delaware BioScience Association have joined forces to launch the \"Women in Stem\" and \"Delaware Life Science Professionals\" that provide a robust forum for non-traditional scientists to network and exch ange ideas. These initiatives have gained broad acceptance among women and young scientists as well as th e companies that seek to recruit and retain the best and brightest within Del aware's scientific community. Through these combined efforts, the State has joined the Nation al Science Foundation in the goal to promote the progress of science and advance the national health , prosperity and welfare. \"We Work for Health\" reports that there are currently 133 active clinical tr ials in Delaware, resulting in 1,544 total participants, $10.4 million invested and $23.6 million in posit ive economic impact. Delaware is also home to a number of biotechnology facilities within each of the four bioscience subsections, including but not limited to: (1) Agriculture, Feedstock and Chemicals : Willard Agri-Service, MaryDel Ag Supply, AgroLabs that support Delaware's #1 ranking in the value of agricultural products sold per farm, according to the USDA * (2) Drugs and Pharmaceuticals : Incyte Pharmaceutical, Astra Zeneca, QPS (formerly known as Quest Pharmaceuticals) (3) Medical Devices and Equipment : Hologic, Agilent Technologies, Siemens Healthcare, B&W Tek and CD Diagnostics (4) Research & Testing : ( i ) C h r i s t i a n a C a r e ' s H e a l t h S ys t e m ' s H e l e n F .

Carson Center fo r Mortuary Affairs (the U.S. Department of Defense's largest joint-service mortuary facility and the only one located in the continental United States); (iii) the 436th Medical Group at Do ver Air Force Base; and (iv) A.I. DuPont Hospital for Children. Financial Services Industry Banks and other financial institu tions have been a major focus of Delaware's economic development activity since 1981. In that year, landmark legislation was pa ssed that opened Delaware to interstate banking, modernized the State's banking laws, and permitted the creation of new types of special purpose intermediaries. The 1981 Financial Center Development Act crea ted strong economic incentives for the banking industry in Delaware, including a favorable state tax s tructure and a market based approach to lending that eliminated restrictive usury caps. These laws con tinue to create a favorable economic environment for banking. The Sta te subsequently enacted additi onal legislation in order to sustain the State's competitive advantage in banking. In 1989, the Bank and Trust Company Insurance Powers Act was signed into law which allowed State-chartered banks and trust companie s to underwrite and sell various types of insurance. In response to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking a nd Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, the State enacted legislation in 199 5 to keep Delaware's banking co mmunity competitive and to maintain Delaware's role as a financial services center. In 1995, the S tate Bank Commissioner issued the \"Incidental Powers Regulation\", which is designed to keep Delaware competit ive by allowing State-chartered banks and trust companies to exercise add itional powers incident to a ban king corporation. The State tax structure was modernized in 2006 by allowing banks to elect an alternative sy stem based on a three-factor income tions, plus a location benef it tax reflecting the value of utilizing Delaware's banking laws and bank system. There are currently about 80 banks and trust companies in Delaw are, including full-service commercial banks, credit card ba nks, non-deposit and limited pu rpose trust companies, wholesale banks, and federal and state savings banks. Banking is one of the State's largest private industry sector employers, with over 27,900 employees as of December 2015, according to the Del aware Department of Labor. Credit cards are a major industry. Prominent credit card issuers in Delawar e include Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Discover Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware. Other m ajor bank employers include M&T Bank Corporation, PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Capital One, N.A., Citigroup and BNY Mellon. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, the bank franchise tax co ntributed $92.5 million, about 2% of the State's total revenues. Construction During 2015, Delaware's housing production totaled 4,624 units. The following table outlines total housing production in the State by county for 2011 through 2015 . Housing production includes single- family and multifamily housing, public and private. In 2015, s ingle-family housing (including condominiums) represented 85.2% of total production, and multif amily units represented 14.8%.

Incorporations As of December 2016, the total number of business entities regi stered with the Delaware Division of Corporations exceeded 1,238,000. More than 180,000 new busines s entities were formed in Delaware in 2016. The State continues to be the corporate home of over half of all publicly-traded firms in the United States. Delaware is the legal domicile of more than 66% of the companies listed in the \"Fortune 500\". Delaware leads the nation in per capita business entity filings and has ranked among the top five states in the nation for new business entity formations since 1989. The prin cipal driver of this growth over the long term has been the popularity of alternative business entities, such as Delaware limited liability companies. The Delaware General Corporation Law is widely regarded as the most modern and flexible corporate statute in the nation. In addition to the option of forming a Delaware corporation, the Delaware Code enables businesses to form as general partnerships, limite d partnerships, limited liability companies and statutory trusts. Businesses may also qualify as limited liabi lity partnerships or limited liability limited partnerships. Delaware's legal entity statutes, combined with a well-developed body of case law in important areas of corporate governance such as director liabil ity and takeovers; prompt resolution of commercial and corporate disputes by Delaware's Court of Chancery; and efficient service from the Delaware Division of Corporati ons have resulted in significant business formation activity. In order to sustain its competitive edge over other states and countries, Delaware continues to adopt statutes that respond to changing business conditions. Recent laws extend the corporate jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to include jurisdiction over commercial techn ology disputes and allows the Court to mediate many types of complex business disputes, providing a mo re cost-effective, confidential, and -34-consensual method for resolving litigable disputes. Another re cent law permits corporations to form as public benefit corporations, a new kind of socially-conscious, for-profit corporation whose affairs are to be conducted for the benefit of stockholders as well as certain sp ecific public benefits and those affected by the corporation's activities. Delawar e law provides incentives for businesses to locate headquarter services and captive insurance operations in Delaware. The State's legal en tity laws provide a simple method for domesticating an entity in Delaware and converting from one typ e of business entity to another type of entity. The Division of Corporations continues to enhance its services by offering 1-hour processing service and expanding Internet services to allow businesses to reserve corporate names, access general corporate information and file annual ta x returns. All of these enhancem ents provide further incentives for entrepreneurs, businesses and investors to make Delaware their legal home. Revised Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") took effect in most U.S. states in 2001 and provided that many UCC documents should be filed in th e debtor's state of incorporation. In July 2001, Delaware became one of the first states to allow for the filing of UCC information via the Internet. General Fund revenue from UCC tr ansactions totaled $19.3 million in fiscal year 2016. Agriculture Agriculture is a very significant industry in Delaware. In 20 15, there were 2,500 farms, and farm land totaled 500,000 acres, accounting for 40% of Delaware's to tal land area. Farm si ze averaged 200 acres. In 2015, the total market value of agricultural land and buildi ngs was $4.09 billion, and the average value per farm was $1.636 milli on. The average market value pe r acre of farmland and buildings in Delaware was $8,180, well over tw o times the national average o f $3,020. Only four states had a higher value per acre of farm real estate. The average value per acre was unchanged from 2014. In 2015, the value of agricultural sector production was $1.44 billion and the Delaware agricultural cash receipts total was $1.28 billion for all commodities, down 14% from 2014. The decline was primarily due to decreases in animal and animal products as well as crop commodities. Delaware's 2015 net farm income decreased 30% from the 2014 lev el of $583 million to $407 million. Crop and animal receipts were primarily responsible f or the decrease. In 2015, Delaware agricultural production value per farm was $574,542, the value per acre was $2,873 and cash receipts value was $2,565 per acre. -35- The cash receipts from Delaware farms as compared to the U.S. total in 2011-2015 are outlined in the table below.

The Port of Wilmington The Port of Wilmington (the \"Port\") is one of the largest importers of containerized bananas and other fruit in the world and is a significant east coast import er of: break bulk fruit, juice and produce, particularly winter Chilean fruit, citrus products from Morocco , juice concentrate and fruit from Argentina, liquid bulk juice concentrate from Brazil, and liquid petroleum products. Other notable items moving over the Port's piers include: steel, paper liner board, dry bulk, a nd scrap metal. The Port has also established a niche in handling specialized cargo such as large wind turbines , dismantled distillation and chemical plants, generators, rocket booster cores, concrete railroad ties, and l ivestock export. The Port continues to be a major point of consolidation and export of vehicles to the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South America. The Port has a central location on the east coast and excellent access to rail and highway transportation systems. Warehouse facilities include 250,000 s quare feet of dry and 750,000 square feet of modern temperature controlled refrigerated space. The combinat ion of relatively new facilities, operational experience, proximity to trans portation networks and a skilled labor force has made the Port among the most successful ports in the very competitive Mid-Atlantic and Northeast region. Founded in 1923, the Port is own ed and operated by the Diamond State Port Corporation (\"DSPC\"). In June 1995, the General Assemb ly authorized the creation of t he DSPC, a membership c orporation with the Department of State as the sole member, for the purpose of acqu iring and operating the Port. On September 1, 1995, DSPC acquire d substantially all of the Port's assets from the City of Wilmington. Under the terms of that agreement, DSPC agreed to make payments to the City of Wilmington equal to $39.9 million over a 30-year period and to pay amounts equal to total debt service on approximately $51.0 million of indebtedness previously incu rred by the City of Wilmington f or Port related assets. The Delaware Transportation Authority's Transportation Trust Fund has loaned funds to the DSPC to enable it to restructure certain of the DSPC's debt and to fund certain capi tal projects. The Delaware River and Bay Authority has participated with DSPC to fund a refrigerated war ehouse in 2006. DSPC's total long-term debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016 was $21.4 million. DSPC d oes not have the power to pledge the credit of the State. In fiscal year 2016, a total of 6.6 million tons of cargo passe d through the Port's facilities, the same total tonnage as in fiscal year 2015. Due to the changes in th e mix of cargo, operating revenue decreased by -36-5% from $40 million in fiscal year 2015 to $38.4 million in fis cal year 2016. In fiscal year 2016, containerized cargo was 2.3 million tons (+5%), liquid bulk cargo was 1.8 million tons (-10%) and dry bulk cargo was 2.0 million tons (+5%), as compared to fiscal year 2015. Over $225 million has been provided by the State through fiscal year 2016 for Port infrastructure impr ovements and debt restructuring. The Port is not required to repay these funds. The Port is part of the State's financial reporting entity and is considered an enterprise fund for the State's GAAP financial reporting purposes. See \"Notes to the F inancial Statements-#6, Revenue Bonds\" in the State's Basic Financial Statements included in its CAFR for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, a link to which is provided under \"INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\" herein. Dover Air Force Base The federal government maintains a major U.S. Air Force Base ( the \"Base\") in Dover, Delaware. The 3,900 acre Base, established in 1941, is the nation's busiest military cargo terminal and a key airlift center. It is home to the 436th Airlift Wing, known as the \"Eagle Wing\" and t he 512 th Airlift Wing, referred to as the \"Liberty Wing\". The 436th Airlift Wing provides command and su pport functions for assigned airlift operations, permitting worldwide movement of outsized cargo (in cluding the military's largest tanks and heaviest weapons and equipment) and personnel. The unit flies Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport planes, known as \"the free world's largest airlifter\" and C-17 Globemaster. Together with the 512th Airlift Wing, aircrews from Dover f l y a n a i r f l e e t t h a t c o m p r i s e s 25% of the nation's strategic a irlift capacity. In addition, the Base hosts the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs, the defense depa rtment's largest joint-service mortuary facility and the only one located in the continental U.S. There are approximately 6,400 military personnel - 3,900 active duty, 1,500 reservists, and 1,000 civilians - who work at the B ase. It is estimated that the economic impact of the Base on the lo cal economy is $466 million annually. STATE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS The State controls and records its financial transactions on a cash basis of accounting for its day-to- day operations in accordance with the various budgets and statu tes passed by the General Assembly and approved by the Governor. See \"FINANCIAL STRUCTURE Budgetary Control and Financial Management S y s t e m s \" . T h e S t a t e ' s a u d i t e d J une 30, 2016, Basic Financial S tatements included in its CAFR, were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally acc epted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") using both the modified accrual basis and full accrual basis of accounting. The following discussion of State finances relates to the budgetary General and budgetary Special Funds of the State, as more fully set out in the financial statements included under Appendix A hereto. Revenue and Expenditure Forecasting The Delaware Economic and Financ ial Advisory Council (\"DEFAC\"), created in 1977, is comprised currently of 33 members appointed by the Governor. Current mem bers of DEFAC include five cabinet-level officials, the State Treasurer, the Controller General, one oth er governmental official, three legislators, and 22 private citizens from the business, financial and academic c ommunities. DEFAC is mandated by executive or der to submit to the Governor and the General Assembly budgetary General Fund and Trans portation Trust Fund revenue fo recasts six times each fiscal year in September, December, March, April, May and June for the current fiscal year and the succeeding two fiscal years. A forecast for the current fiscal year and the succeedi ng four fiscal years is generated once each year, no later than October 1. Budgetary General Fund and Transportation Trust Fund expenditure forecasts are generated for the current fiscal year in December, March, April , May and June. The various DEFAC forecasts contained in this Official Statement were provided as of December 19, 2016. -37-These revenue and expenditure forecasts are used in the State b udget process to ensure compliance with the State's constitutional lim its on spending and statutor y debt limitations. See \"FINANCIAL STRUCTURE - Appropriation Limit\" and \"BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF TH E STATE - Debt Limits\". The subcommittees of DEFAC are the Expenditure and Revenue subcommittees, which may meet prior to the DEFAC meetings. DEFAC meetings are open to the public and provide a general forum for members of the private and public sectors to exchange views on matters of economic and fiscal concern for the State. DEFAC relies on projections of national economic trends by IHS Global Insight, Inc. (formerly DRI- WEFA), the Department of Finance's econometric model, projectio ns generated by the Department of Transportation, its members' know ledge of the State's particula r economic strengths , and its members' understanding of the structure of the State's revenue system. A comparison of DEFAC's forecasts of budgetary General Fund revenue with actual year-end revenue is reviewed in the following table. These forecasts were generated 18 months and 9 months prior to the en d of each fiscal year. DEFAC does not project the revenue impact of legislation until after its enact ment.

Budget for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2018 The Governor's proposed operating and capital budgets for the b udgetary General Fund and budgetary Special Funds, including the Transportation Trust Fund, are cur rently under consideration by the General Assembly. The budgets, as amended by the General Assembly, are expected to be passed prior to July 1, 2017 and signed by the Governor shortly thereafter. -50-TOBACCO SETTLEMENT A coalition of State Attorneys General negotiated an agreement to settle various states' lawsuits against tobacco manufacturers, in order to recover state funds expended on health care for smokers, consumer fraud and other claims. The Master Settlement Agreeme nt (the \"Agreement\") entered into by the State and participating tobacco manufacturers in late 1998 has resulted in significant payments to the State. According to the Agreement, payments are to continue in perpetu i t y , t h e s i z e o f w h i c h a r e s u b j e c t t o a number of possible offsets and adjustments outlined in the Agreement. Such offsets include, but are not limited to, the reduction in sales of products from participati ng manufacturers. The State created a special fund called the \"Delaware Health Fu nd\" into which proceeds received as a result of the Agreement are deposited. The General Assembly and the Governor may authorize expenditure of these monies to expand access to health care and health insu rance, make long-term investments in State- owned health care infrastructure, promote healthy lifestyles in cluding tobacco, alcohol, and drug prevention, and promote preventive health care for Delawareans. The fund r equires an annual appropriation by the General Assembly and is administered by the Secretary of Financ e. As of June 30, 2016, approximately $466.4 million has been received by the State from participating manufacturers. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE General The State budgets and controls its financial activities on the cash basis of accounting for its fiscal year (July 1 to June 30). In compliance with State law, the State r ecords its financial transactions in either of two major categories, the budgetary General Fund or budgetary Speci al Funds. References to these two funds in this document include the terms \"budge tary\" or \"budgetary basis\" to differentiate them from the GAAP funds of the same name which encompass different funding categories. The bu dgetary General Fund provides for the cost of the State's general operations a nd is credited with all tax and other revenue of the State not dedicated to budgetary Special Funds. All disbursements from the budgetary General Fund must be authorized by appropriations of the General Assembly. Budgetary Special Funds are desi gnated for specific purposes. The appropriate budgetary Special Fund is credited with the tax or other revenue allocated to such fun d and is charged with the related disbursements. Specific uses of the budgetary Special Funds include State park s operations and fees charged by the Public Service Commission and The Division of Professional Regulation. Federal payments and unemployment compensation are examples of non-appropriated budgetary Special Funds. Some budgetary Special Funds, such as the Delaware State Housing Authority and the State Pension O ffice, contain both appropriated funds for operations and non-appropriated f unds for specific programs, su ch as public housing and pension benefits. The Basic Financial Statements included in the State's CAFR ha ve been prepared to conform to the standards of financial reporting set forth by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (\"GASB\") in its various statements and interpretations. GAAP reporting standards allow the accurate assessment of financial condition and enable the State to present its total fiscal oper ation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U nited States of America. In GAAP reporting, operations of the primary government and co mponent units are recorded under three main fund types - Governmental, Proprietary and Fiduciary , as defined by GASB. The fund types and account groups are described in Note 1 of the GAAP Basic Financ ial Statements included in the State's CAFR. A reconciliation of budgetary General and Special Funds to GAAP is found in the Required Supplementary Information Section of the financial statements in the State's CAFR. -51- Capital assets are defined by the State as assets which have a cost of $15,000 or more at the date of acquisition and have an expected useful life of one or more yea rs. All land and buildings are capitalized regardless of cost. Purchased and constructed capital assets a re valued at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Donated fixed assets are r ecorded at their fair market v alue at the date of donation. The State has elected to use the \"modified approach\" to accoun t for certain infrastructure assets, as provided by GASB Statement No. 3 4. Under this process, the Sta te does not record depreciation expense nor are amounts capitalized in connection with improvements to these assets, unless the improvements expand the capacity or efficiency of an asset. Roads and bridges maintain ed by the Department of Transportation are accounted for using the modified approach. Budget Process As noted earlier, all disbursements from the budgetary General Fund and certain budgetary Special Funds must be authorized by appropriation of the General Assemb ly. In the fall of the fiscal year, each State agency submits to the Budget Office under the Office of Managem ent and Budget (\"OMB\") a request for operating and capital funds for the ensuing fiscal year. Publi c hearings on the requests are subsequently conducted. The Governor's pro posed operating and capital budgets for the budgetary General Fund and budgetary Special Funds, including the Transportation Trust Fun d, are then drafted and presented by the Governor to the General Assembly in January. The General Assem bly's Joint Finance and Bond Bill Committees hold hearings and mark up the Governor's proposed op erating and capital budgets, respectively. As amended, the budgets are expected to be passed prior to July 1 and signed by the Governor shortly thereafter. State agencies currently participate in a uniform budgeting pr ocess whereby each agency submits with its budget request a department mi ssion, key objectives, background and accomplishments, and activities and performance measures. This fully integrated budget submission provides much information to the public as well as to State decision-makers. Federal funds are not appropriated but are subject to the revi ew and approval of OMB and the Delaware State Clearinghouse Committee for Federal Aid Coordination. Th e Committee is comprised of 10 members, including the Secretary of Finance, Director of OMB, Director o f the Delaware Economic Development Office, the Controller General, and six legislators. Appropriation Limit The State Constitution limits annual appropriations by majority vote of both houses of the General Assembly to 98% of estimated budgetary General Fund revenue, pl us the unencumbered budgetary General Fund balance from the previous year. An appropriation exceedin g this limit may be made in the event of a declared emergency, with the approval of a three-fifths vote of the members of each house of the General Assembly, but no appropriation may be made exceeding 100% of es timated budgetary General Fund revenue plus the unencumbered budgetary General Fund balance from the p revious fiscal year. In June 2016, the General Assembly authorized appropriations of $4,142.6 million for fiscal year 2017, within the projected 98% appropriation limit. Budget Reserve Account The Budget Reserve Account (commonly referred to as the \"Rainy Day Fund\") is designed to provide a cushion against unanticipated re venue shortfalls. The State Co nstitution provides that the excess of any unencumbered budgetary General Funds at the end of a fiscal year must be placed in a reserve account (the \"Budget Reserve Account\") within 45 days following the end of t he fiscal year, provided that the amount of funds in the Budget Reserve Acco unt does not exceed 5% of the e stimated budgetary General Fund revenue used -52-to determine the appropriation limit for that fiscal year. Tra nsfers are made in August based on June revenue projections, with consideration given to year-end operating res ults of the previous fiscal year. To date, transfers of $221.1 million have been made which fully funded the Budget Reserve Account for fiscal year 2017. Money from the Budget Reserve Account may be appropriated only with t he approval of a three-fifths vote of the members of each house of the General Assembly and only to fund an unanticipated budgetary General Fund deficit or to provide funds required as a result of the enactme nt of legislation reducing revenue. No funds have been withdrawn from the Budget R eserve Account si nce its incept ion in 1980. Tax Limitations The State Constitution was amended in May 1980 to limit tax an d license fee increases or the imposition of any new taxes or fees. Any tax or license fee increase or t he imposition of any new tax or license fee must be passed by a three-fifths vote of each house of the General Asse mbly, rather than by a simple majority vote, except for tax increases to meet debt service on outstanding ob ligations of the State for which insufficient revenue is available when such debt service is due. The amendm ent requires the State t o appropriate, prior to each fiscal year of the State, sums sufficient to meet debt ser vice in the following fiscal year, a practice the State has always followed. Internal Control Structure The State has established and maintains an internal control str ucture designed to ensure that the assets of the State are protected from loss, theft, or misuse, and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a c ontrol should not exceed t he benefits likely to be derived and that evaluation of costs and benefits requires e stimates and judgments by State officials. Determination as to the adequacy of the internal control struct ure is made within the above framework. State officials believe the State's internal control structure adequa tely safeguards assets and provides reasonable assurance of proper recording of financial transactions. In th e beginning of fiscal year 2011, the State fully implemented and upgraded its financial systems to continue to s afeguard its assets and properly record its financial transactions. Disbursements from State funds are controlled by an encumbrance accounting system that is designed to provide information on the actual extent of the Sta te's obligations (as determined by purchase orders issued) and to guard against over-committing available funds. Disbursements are controlled through the encumbrance system in such a way that purchase orders issue d for goods and services cause a reduction in available appropriations. As a result, the amount of budget ary General Fund cash disbursements plus unliquidated encumbrances cannot exceed the amount appropriated by the General Assembly for any budget line. At fiscal year-end, cash is reserved to pay outstanding encumbr ances (orders for goods and services not yet received or for which payment has not been made). Budg etary General Fund encumbrances are carried over as encumbered appropriations and paid out and reco rded as disbursements in the succeeding fiscal year. All obligations created by purchase orders (encum bered amounts) are liquidated upon satisfactory receipt of goods and services. Budgetary General Fund appropriations, which have not been disbursed, continued or encumbered at fiscal year-end, lapse. Such lapsed appropriations are referred to as reversions in the State's financial reports. The State restricts commitments for budgetary General Fund expenditures by State agencies. Commitments to incur expenditures in excess of an appropriation (to be funded from unused funds appropriated to other agencies) must be approved by the Directo r of the OMB and the Controller General. -53-Although the majority of the State's financial transactions are processed through the accounting system, certain budgetary Special Funds have financial activity , such as investments, outside the system. For example, the Transportation Trust Fund, the Delaware State Housing Authority, the deferred compensation programs and Delaware State University all maintai n certain financial activity outside the system. This activity is governed in adherence to legislative regulations as well as guidelines established by their respective boards. In addition, these entities are audit ed annually and produce published financial reports. The Auditor of Accounts is required to make audits of all agenc ies collecting State revenue or expending State funds in excess of $500,000 each year, and, to the extent possible, to make annual audits of the financial transactions of all other State agencies. The Au ditor of Accounts also reviews certain records of the Secretary of Finance and State Treasurer on a quarterly bas is to reconcile the State's bank accounts to such records. Tax Collection Procedures Most of the State's taxes are collected under a self-assessing system. Taxpayers prepare the tax forms and pay the amounts they determine are due. When the State det ermines that a payment is less than the amount due, assessments may be made which can include applicable penalties and interest as allowed by law. The State has continually instituted procedures to identify no n-filers and increase compliance with its tax statutes. The procedures include comparing federal income tax records with State income tax records, comparing State records for various years, and cross-referencin g the license tax files to licensee lists from the State's various regulatory boards. Through the Attorney General's Office, the State employs legal procedures to effect payment of past due balances. These procedures include filing actions in the Justi ce of the Peace, Common Pleas and Superior Courts on bad checks received. Procedures have been instituted for the garnishment of wages and bank accounts and the sale of personal proper ty through the County Sheriffs. By statute, the State's accounts receivable may be removed fro m current active accounts only if the account is more than six years old and is determined to be unco llectible or if the potential recovery or administrative costs of collection would not warrant further co llection efforts. Recently enacted legislation allows the Division of Revenue t o write off the accounts of tho se who are deceased or bankrupt. Recently enacted legislation requires the Secretary of Finance to prepare, maintain and publish on the Division of Revenue's Internet Website two separate lists of th e top 100 business and personal taxpayers owing outstanding tax liabilities in excess of $1,000 in which a judg ment has been filed and who are not currently in bankruptcy or have not entered into and complied with the terms of an installment plan. Risk Management The State is exposed to various risks and losses related to em ployee health and accident, worker's compensation, environmental and a portion of property and casua lty claims. It is the policy of the State to self- insure its exposures when cost e ffective and commercially insur e on the exposures that are specialized. Cash Management Created by State law, the Cash Management Policy Board (the \"B oard\") establishes policies for the investment of all money belonging to the State or put on deposit with the State by its political subdivisions, except money in any State pension fund and money held for indiv iduals under the State deferred -54-compensation program. The investment of such money belonging t o the State is executed by the State Treasurer in accordance with and pursuant to the Board's investment policies. The Board is comprised of nine members, including the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, the Controller General (all serving ex officio), and five members from the pri vate sector appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate. T he current members of the Boar d are: John V. Flynn, Jr. (Chairman) . Managing Director, Healthcare Resource Solutions Richard J. Geisenberger Secretary of Finance Jeffrey W. Bullock Secretary of State Warren C. Engle Formerly Senio r Vice President, PNC Bank, ret ired Mike Karia Chief Executive Officer, MK Consulting I Inc. Lynda A. Messick Consultant, Bank Governance Advisors Michael L. Morton Controller General David F. Marvin Partner, Marvin & Palmer Associates, Inc. Kenneth A. Simpler State Treasurer The State has instituted a number of measures to augment its d ividend and interest earnings. Among these are the implementation of a commercial bank lockbox for c ollection of corporate franchise taxes, bank franchise taxes and insurance premium taxes. In addition, the State is also receiving tax payments electronically for the following taxes on a voluntary basis: employer withhol ding taxes, corporate franchise taxes and bank franchise taxes. The State's motor fuel/special fuels tax is c ollected electronically o n a mandatory basis. BUDGETARY GENERAL FUND SUMMARIES Principal Receipts by Category All revenue derived by the State, unless otherwise provided by law, is credited to the budgetary General Fund. The principal receipts not credited to the budgetary Gen eral Fund are unemployment insurance taxes, transportation-related taxes for the Transportation Trust Fund, certain taxes on insurance companies and property taxes levied by local school districts. Such taxes are deposit ed in budgetary Special Funds of the State. The State does not levy ad valorem taxes on real or pers onal property and does not impose a gener al sales or use tax. The taxes summarized below prod uce most of the budgetary Gener al Fund revenue. Personal Income Tax: Effective January 1, 2014, Delaware's rates on taxable income range from zero on the first $2,000 of net taxable income, to 6.60% on tax able income in excess of $60,000. Taxable income consists of federal adjust ed gross income, with certain modifications, less itemized deductions (or a standard deduction in lieu thereof). After the application of the rates to taxable income, a $110 non- refundable personal tax credit is subtracted for each taxpayer and dependent claimed, providing a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction in final tax liability. Since 1992, non-resident taxes have been computed as if the tax p a y e r w e r e a S t a t e r e s i d e n t , multiplied by the ratio of Delaware income to total income.

T h e t a x l e v y i s b a s e d o n e i t h e r t h e corporation's total number of authorized shares of capital stoc k or on its assumed par va lue. The basis yielding the lesser tax revenue is appli ed. Effective January 1, 2009, the maximum tax was increased from $165,000 to $180,000. Applying the authorized s hare basis, th e tax is levi ed according to the fol lowing rate schedule: 5,000 shares or 10,000 shares: $250.00 $75.00 for each additiona l 10,000 shares or portion thereof Maximum annual tax is $180,000.00 Applying the assumed par value basis, the tax is levied at a ra te of $350 for each $1.0 million or fractional part thereof of the corporation's taxable gross asse ts per the ratio of authorized to issued shares. The maximum annual franchise tax is $180,000.00 and the minimum tax is $175.00. Tax payments for any corporation whose annual franchise taxes exceed $5,000.00 are required to be made quarterly. Other companies pay once each year, on March 1. Corporation Income Tax: This tax is levied at the rate of 8.7% on net taxable income of both foreign and domestic corporations derived from sources within the State .

Fifty percent of the estimated tax for the taxpayer's current tax year and the balan ce due from the prior year is payable on the 1st day of the fourth month of the taxpayer's tax year, 20% of such est imated tax is payable on the 15th day of the sixth month, 20% on the 15th day of the ninth month and 10% on the 15 th day of the twelfth month. Corporations with total gross receipts of $20,000,000 or more in any of the last three years must pay 80% of their current year's estimated tax on a current basis. Beginning January 1, 2 017, small corporations (total gross receipts below $20,000,000 for two of three prior years) are beholden to the p ayment dates above, but make quarterly estimated payments equivalent to 25% of their estimated tax on each date. Additionally, Delaware will change the method employed to apportion net taxabl e income for multi-state corpor ations. In prior years, net taxable income was apportioned based on an equally w eighted average of Delaware's share of a firm's national payroll, property, and sales. Beginning January 1, 2017, Delaware will weight Delaware sales on a multi-state firm at 50% in 2017, 60% in 2018, 75% in 2019, an d 100% in 2020 and beyond. Business and Occupational Gross Receipts Tax: The State imposes license requirements and related taxes on most occupations and businesses. License fees and taxes consist of a basic annual fee of $75 (in some cases an additional $25 per establishment is levied) p lus a tax on gross receipts. Effective for tax periods ending after December 31, 2013, tax rates include 0.647 2% for contractors (with a monthly deduction from gross receipts of $100,000); 0.3983% for wholesalers (with a monthly deduction of $100,000); 0.1260% for manufacturers (with a monthly deduction of $1,250,000); 0.1991% for food processors (with a monthly deduc tion of $100,000); 0.0996% for commercial feed dealers and farm machinery retailers (with a mont hly deduction of $100,000); 0.7468% for general retailers (with a monthly deduction of $100,000); 0.6472% for restaurants (with a monthly deduction of $100,000); and 0.3983% of aggregate gross receipts on most occupational licenses (with a monthly deduction of $ 100,000). A use tax on leases of tangible personal property is levied on the lessee at the rate of 1.9914% of lease rentals and on the lessor at the rate of 0.2987% of rental payments received.

Inheritance and Estate Tax: Effective January 1, 1999, the inheritance tax was eliminated . Since the inheritance tax was eliminated, the State has continued to levy its estate tax. Delaware's estate tax, sometimes referred to as a \"pick up\" tax, a pplies only to those estates r equired to pay the federal estate tax. Changes in federal law effectively phased-out Delaware's estate tax in 200 5. Effective July 1, 2 009, however, the State chose to \"decouple\" from federal law effectively reinstating th e tax essentially as it exi sted in 2001 with rates from 0.8% to 16.0% of a decedent's tax base, less the federal e xemption. Realty Transfer Tax: Generally, the State levies a realty transfer tax at a rate o f 1.5% of the consideration paid for any real property transferred. (Local g overnments are permitted to levy an additional 1.5%.) A 1% tax is levied on the value of construction in exce ss of $10,000 where the underlying property was acquired by the owner less than 12 months prior to the commence ment of construction. Alcoholic Beverage Tax: The State imposes an excise tax on the distribution of alcoho lic beverages. Beer is taxed at the rate of $4.85 per barrel; wine at 97 cents per gallon; liquor containing 25% or less alcohol by volume at $2.50 per gallon; and l iquor containing more than 25% at $3.75 per gallon.

Effective for tax years begi nning after December 31, 2006, ban ks have the option of using an \"Alternative Franchise Tax\". The Alternative Franchise Tax has two parts: 1. A traditional income tax emp loying three-factor apportionment with a double-weighted receipts factor. The tax's regressive rates range from 7.0% on taxable income not in excess of $50 million to 0.5% on taxable income in excess of $1.3 billion. 2. A \"Location Benefits Tax\" based on assets. The location be nefit tax liability shall be $1.6 million, plus 0.012% of the value of the assets not in excess o f $5 billion; 0.008% of the value of the assets in excess of $5 billion but not in excess o f $20 billion; 0.004% of the value of the assets in excess of $20 billion but not in excess of $90 billion.

Additional Sources of Revenue Lottery Delaware's lottery actually includes multiple gaming options, w hich consumers may access via various platforms. -57- Traditional Lottery: The traditional lottery consists of daily drawings, lotto, instant tickets, Keno, and multi-state games such as Powerball and Megamillions. Traditional lottery products are sold via a State-operated networ k of linked lottery terminals l ocated in approximately 600 retail locations throughout the State. Casino Operations : Casino operations consist of a video lottery, sportsbooks, t able games and i-gaming. o Video Lottery - The video lottery is a State-operated network o f linked video lottery or slot machines restricted to three locations authorized by State law. In addition, Delaware participates in a multi-jurisdictional, progressive video lottery game (MegaHits) via a network operated under the auspices of the Mul ti-State Lottery Association (MUSL). This wide-a rea network currently consists of Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Isl and, and West Virginia. o Sportsbooks - The Sta te, in conjunction with the State's three casinos and approximately 100 retail establishments, operates a sports lottery, which con sists of parlay-style betting on National Football League (\"NFL\") games. o Table Games - Delaware's three casinos operate table games, suc h as blackjack, craps, roulette and poker. Table games were operational at the end of fiscal year 2010 and have enhanced the State's position in an increasingly competiti ve gaming market, increased employment and added re venue to the State's coffers. o I-gaming - Beginning in November 2013, Delaware's i-gaming was made available to in-state consumers. Among other offerings, consumers may access peer-to-peer poker, and virtual blackjack, video lottery and roulette via the inter net sites of the State's three casinos. In fiscal year 2014, Delaware and Nevada created the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement allowing for liquidity among online poker players from both States. In fiscal year 2015, mobile i-g aming was made available. DEFAC closely monitors an evolving regional gaming market and u pdates the State's revenue forecasts as conditions have evolved. By law, the lottery undertakes to provide an aggregate of at least 30.0% of the net revenue generated from traditional lottery pro ducts to the budgetary General Fund. The State retains 43.5% of video lottery profits (net of certain eq uipment costs) and 29.4% of the net proceeds from table games, whether wagered by traditional means or via t he internet. The State retains 50% of the net proceeds from the sports book a nd 90% of the net proceeds from sports lottery retailers. Abandoned Property Abandoned property represents any debt or obligation, including securities, which has gone unclaimed or undelivered for a period of dormancy defined by statute. For most property, the period of dormancy is five years; for securities, it is three years. Pursuant to U.S. Sup reme Court jurisprudence, such unclaimed property is reported to the State of Delaware if any of the following circu mstances are present: the last known address of the owner is located in the State of Delaware; the last known address of the owner is unknown, and the holder of the property is incorporated or formed under the laws of the State of Delaware; the last known address of the owner is not located in any state of the United States, or the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States, and the Holder is incorporated or formed under the laws of the State of Delaware; or the last known address of the owner is in a state that does not have an applicable statute for the type of property being re ported and the Holder is incor porated or formed under th e laws of the State of Delaware. -58- It is forecasted that abandoned property will generate revenue s of $554 million in fiscal year 2017. The fiscal year 2018 forecast indicates an $64 million decrease in abandoned property revenues, which reflects, in part, DEFAC's recognition that future revenues fro m abandoned property could be adversely affected by pending legal challenges. See \"LITIGATION\" herein for a further explanation of the legal challenge. In original actions that have been accepted for consideration by the United States Supreme Court, Delaware is litigating claims involving 29 states on the issue of whether a certain property type should have been escheated to Delaware or to the other states. Delaware is vigorously contending before the Supreme Court that the property type should properly escheat to the property holder's state of incorporation, which would, among other things, result in property previously eschea ted to Delaware remaining with Delaware. By the same token, possible resolution of the original actions could result both in payments of property by Delaware to other states and further payments by other states t o Delaware. Resolution of the actions is likely to be at least a year away. Delaware cannot estimate the poten tial liability, if any, that it may face if it were not to prevail in these actions. Budgetary General Fund Disbursements by Category of Expense The following table summarizes the budgetary General Fund disb ursements of the State for fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 th rough 2016. See \"STATE FINANCIAL O PERATIONS - Expenditure Summary - Fiscal Year 2013-Fiscal Year 2016E\" for a detailed explanation of the expenditure figures. Budgetary General Fund Disbursements (in millions) Fiscal 2012Fiscal 2013Fiscal 2014 Fiscal Fund Disbursements by Purpose The State assumes substantial financial responsibility for a n umber of programs often funded by local units of government in other states, including public and higher education, social service programs and the correctional system. In addition, the State builds and mai ntains all roads and highways within the State except certain local streets within a municipality's corporate boundaries and certain private streets. See \"INDEBTEDNESS OF AUTHORITIES, UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE AND POLITI CAL SUBDIVISIONS - Authorities - Dela ware Transportation Authority\" for additional information. The major State programs are described in more detail below. Public Education Delaware is one of only four s tates in the country which has no t undergone a constitu tional challenge to its public education fundi ng. The State finances its public school operations from a combination of State, federal and local funds. In fiscal year 2015, the State provide d 59.0%, the federal government 10.0% and -59-localities 31.0% of the cost for current operations and debt se rvice. For 2012-2013, the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Educational Statistics, Institute for Education Sciences reported that Delaware was exceeded by nine other states and Puerto Rico in t erms of the percentage of public school revenues financed by the State. Public education base salary s cales are set by State law, but the base salary may be supplemented by local funds. The local supplements vary in each school district in the State, depending on each district's cont ractual obligations with its employees and the district's ability and willingness to tax its constituents. For the 2016-2017 school y ear, the average State-local funded classroom teacher's salary was $61,384, of which $41,432 was paid from State funds and the balance paid from federal or local funds. The State share of public education costs is a llocated to the school districts, subject to a number of formulae based primarily on enrollment. The State fu nds between 60% and 80% of school construction costs, based on an index of an individual district 's ability to generate local share funding. The State also funds fringe benefits for school personnel in approx imate proportion to the budgetary General Fund contribution to salaries, with the exception of health ins urance which is 100% State funded for the basic plan. School districts rei mburse the State for fringe ben efit costs for personnel hired and paid under federally-funded programs and for the proportion of salary paid from local funds. Budgetary General Fund expenditures for public education in fis cal year 2016 totaled $1,305.1 million. Appropriations of $1,379.6 million have been made for fiscal year 2017. The following table sets forth publ ic school enrollment (elementary and secondary), in September of the years indicated. Public School Enrollment(1) Enrollment Change (%) 2005 ........................................ 120,482 1.7 2006 1.7 ........................................ 135,517 0.8 2016 ........................................ 136,706 0.9 (1) Excludes children of military personnel li ving on Dover Air Force Base who attend Base schoo ls and whose education is federally-funded. Higher Education The State's higher education system consists of eight instituti ons, which enrolled 59,010 students in the 2016-2017 academic school year based upon Fall 2016 student headcount (45,628 on a full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") basis). The three State-supported instituti ons are Delaware Technical and Community College which enrolled 13,471 st udents (7,668 FTE); Delaware St ate University, a land grant college located in the City of Dover which enrolled approximately 4,560 student s (4,197 FTE); and the University of Delaware, a land grant college located in the City of Newark, w hich enrolled 23,009 students (20,760 FTE). The five privately supported i nstitutions of higher education i n the State enrolled an additional 17,970 students in 2015-2016 (13,003 FTE). -60-Budgetary General Fund expenditures for higher education in fis cal year 2016 were $230.0 million. The State provides approximately 12.0% of the operating budget of the University of D elaware, 40.0% of the budget of Delaware Technical and Community College, and 29.1% o f the budget of Delaware State University. Appropriations of $234.4 million have been made fo r fiscal year 2017, including $120.6 million for the University of Delaware (this includes $1.9 million in f unding for Delaware Geological Survey), $78.7 million for Delaware Technical a nd Community College and $35.1 million for Delaware State University. Social Services The principal social service programs administered by the State are: (1) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (\"TANF\"); (2) General Assistance (\"GA\") to low-income single individuals who do not qualify for Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") or TANF paymen ts; (3) service programs for qualified individuals including child care, employment & training service s; and (4) direct medical assistance to qualifying individuals (\"Medicaid\" & \"CHIP\"). Delaware's TANF program is funded by a federal capped block gra nt and State budgetary General Funds. The State is required under federal law to maintain a p rescribed level of historic State expenditures for benefits and services to individuals eligible for TANF. Cu rrently, the TANF caseload is gradually declining. The State provides health care, child care assistan ce and help finding work for participants in the State's TANF program and provides health care and subsidized ch ildcare to income eligible individuals or those who have left the welfare rolls and continue to be eligib le for that coverage. GA program grants are entirely funded by the State. As of Octo ber 2016, the payment standard for the GA program is $81 a month per single-person family. Since January 1974, the SSI Program has been administered and f unded by the federal government. Beginning with fiscal 1975, the State elected to supplement federal SSI payments for individuals who received the State equivalent of SSI payments prior to January 1974. The Child Care program provides support for families with child ren to enable the caretaker to hold a job, obtain training or meet special needs of the parent or chi l d . T h e i n c o m e l i m i t f o r t h i s p r o g r a m i s currently set at 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Delaware's Medicaid program traditionally has been funded at th e minimum Federal financial participation (\"FFP\") rate of 50% . Each state's FFP is determi ned annually by a statutory formula designed to account for income variation across states. Delaware's rate has varied from a high of 64.38% (due to a provision of ARRA) to a low of 50% (the lowest rate) during the past five years. The current FFP for Delaware (beginning October 1, 2016) is 54.20%. The FFP rate e xpected to become effective on October 1, 2017 is 56.43%. The portion of the expenditures for the foregoing programs paid by the federal government is accounted for by the State through the non-appropriated budgeta ry Special Funds. The portion paid by the State is accounted for primarily through the budgetary General Fund.

The Management and Support S ervices unit provides support and educational services to the three divisions. Management servic es spent $19.7 million in fiscal year 2015, $20.0 million for fiscal year 2016, and has budgeted $21.0 million for fiscal year 2017. The Department served 21,862 clients in fiscal year 2016 some of which were sh ared by each of the three divisions. The Family Services division spent $51.0 million in fiscal year 201 5, $52.9 million in fiscal 2016, and has budgeted $52.8 million for fiscal year 2017. The Division of Y outh Rehabilitative Services (\"YRS\") handles delinquent youth in both pre- a nd post-adjudication through an array of alternative placements and State- owned secure facilities. The YRS division spent $40.1 million in fiscal year 2015, $40.1 million in fiscal 2016 and has budgeted $42.9 million for fiscal year 2017. The Division of Prevention and Behavioral Health Services (\"DPBHS\") provides mental health services for children and youth. The DPBHS spent $38.3 million in fiscal year 2015, $38 .7 million in fiscal 2016 and h as budgeted $42.3 million for fiscal year 2017. Corrections The Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") is the only government op erated correction agency in the State. Delaware operates under a unified corrections system. Delaware has no regional, county or municipal correction or jail system and no separate probation system. Of fenders immediately b ecome the responsibility of the State, including: pre-tria l and sentencing, misdemeanor and felony, jail and prison and all community based sanctions. Sentencing in the State has evolved with the passage of Sentencing Accountability (\"SENTAC\") legislation whereby all offenders are sentenced to o ne of five levels ranging from Level 1 (administrative supervision) to Level V (incarceration). This structure allows the State flexibility to match offenders with the most appropria te sentence. Total budgetary General Fund expenditures for DOC in fiscal year 2016 were $298.5 million. The budget for fiscal year 2017 is $295.4 million. As of December, 2016, the incarcerated population in the custody of the Department wa s approximately 6,584, of which about 5,516 are prisoners. BUDGETARY SPECIAL FUNDS SUMMARIES Each budgetary Special Fund is created by statute or administr ative action for a specific purpose. The appropriate Fund is credited with the specific revenue or recei pts allocated to such Fund. Disbursements from certain budgetary Special Funds require specific appropriation by the General Assembly. In general, money in budgetary Special Funds is not available for disbursement or encumbrance until funds are deposited therein with the result that disbursements plus outstanding encumbrances cannot exceed the available funds (except for federal funds and the Transportatio n Trust Fund). In the case of bond funds, total disbursements plus encumbrances cannot exceed authorizations. At fiscal year end, the available fund balance plus outstanding encumbrances are carried over into the succeed ing fiscal year. Local School Property Taxes and Assessed Valuation These taxes are levied by local school districts upon the asse ssed value of real estate in the district, as determined for county taxation purposes, for the local share of school operating costs and debt service on capital improvements. All tax receipts of a district are credited to t he appropriate budgetary Special Fund and operating expenses are disbursed from such Fund upon the presentation of warrants or drafts to the State Treasurer by the school board of the district. The State's share of operating a nd debt service costs are a ppropriated and disbursed from the budgetary General Fund. -63- The following table outlines the assessed and estimated full valuation of all taxable real property in the State as of July 1, 2016.

Unemployment Compensation Money deposited in the Unemployment Compensation Fund consists of employers' contributions and has at certain times in the past included advances from the federal government necessary to meet the excess of unemployment compensation benefits paid over the employers' con tributions. As of December 31, 2016, the Unemployment Compensation Fund reflected a net balance availabl e for the payment of benefits of $105.1 million. Federal Grants, Benefits and Reimbursements All grants and reimbursements of money received from the feder al government by the State are credited to budgetary Special Funds. The money is disbursed to the appropriate agency to be used for the purpose stated in the grant application without any further aut hority from the General Assembly. The Delaware State Clearinghouse Committee is the committee represe nting the legislative and executive branches of government. It is charged with reviewing all State agency applications for federal funds and no agency may expend federal funds without approval of this commit tee.

Employee pension contributions are als o recorded as budgetary Special Fund receipts and are disbursed together with the State's share of pension co sts. Pension costs paid by the federal government for employees paid under federal programs are also recorded as budgetary Special Fund receipts and disbursements. Social Security Fund Receipts All Social Security contributions by State departments and age ncies and political subdivisions are recorded as a receipt to the Social Security Fund and are remit ted on a semi-monthly basis.

The current members of the Pension Board are: Suzanne B. Grant, Chair ......... Former Senior Vice President, Salomon Smith Barney, Consulting Group Arturo F. Agra ......................... Vice President of Strategic Planning, Pepco Holdings Inc. Thomas S. Shaw ...................... Former Executive Vice Pres ident and Chief Operating Officer, PHI Nancy J. Shevock ....................

Director, Office of Manage ment & Budget Legislative authority for the Fund is contained in 29 Del. Code \u00a75541 which establishes a State Employees' Retirement Fund, manda tes that state appropriations and other employer contributions, and employee contributions be deposited and benefits paid. The sta tute dictates that the assets of the Fund are to be held in trust and not be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the employees and their beneficiaries. Section 5541 allows the acc umulated assets of the Fund to be commingled with the assets of local and other government entiti es. The custodian of the Fund's assets is Northern Trust Company, C hicago, Illinois. The Fund's assets are managed by professional investment management firms. The t otal return on the fund in fiscal year 2016 was (1.3%) on a market value basis compared to 4.0% for the Sta ndard & Poor's 500. However, due to the Fund's asset-smoothing technique which recognizes only a portio n of the gains and losses, the return on the actuarial asset value was 5.7%. Below is a table depicting one -year and five-year returns from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016, inclusive. Fiscal One Year Five Year Year RETURN RETURN 1996 20.0% 14.1% 1997 -67-The Fund provides retirement, disability and survivor benefits as detailed in Note 15 of the Basic Financial Statements included in the State's CAFR for the fisca l year ended June 30, 2016, a link to which is provided under \"INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\" herein.. In May 2011, th e Delaware Code was amended in order to reduce benefits for a nd increase the contribution of a ll State employees hired on and after January 1, 2012 (\"Post 2011 Employees\"). In general, recipients, other th an Post 2011 Employees, in the State Employees' Plan are entitled to receive a service pension at va rious times during their years of credited service, i.e.: (1) age 62 with 5 years of credit service; (2) age 60 with 15 years of credit service; (3) a reduced service pension at age 55 with 15 years of credited ser vice; (4) a reduced service pension at any age with 25 years of credited service; or (5) at any age with 30 ye ars of credited service. Employees hired before January 1, 2012 are \"fully vested\" in benefits after 5 years of service, and Post 2011 Employees are \"fully vested\" in benefits after 10 years of service. Post 2011 Emplo yees are entitled to receive a service pension if: (1) the employee has 10 years of credited service, and has attained age 65; (2) the employee has 20 years of credited service, and has attained age 60; or (3) the employ ee has 30 years of credited service. A Post 2011 Employee can receive a reduced service pension if: (1) th e employee has 15 years of credited service, and has attained age 55, or (2) the employee has 25 years credi ted service regardless of age. All Plan participants also participate in the Old Age Disability Securit y Income component of the Federal Social Security System. For members of the State Employees Plan, benefit payments are computed using the average monthly compensation for the 36 months of highest monthly compe nsation. Such compensation excludes overtime in the case of Post 2011 Employees. The average is then multiplied by 1.85% for each year of credited service after January 1, 1997 to determine the actual monthly benefit. Retirees with credited service before December 31, 1996 get a multiplier of 2.00 for service p rior to January 1, 1997. Post 2011 Employees contribute 5% of annual compensation above $6,000. All other State employees contribute 3% of annua l compensation above $6,000. Except for the Closed State Police Plan, the State's annual contribution to the Plans are equal to the sum of the normal cost of each year and the annual payment requ ired to amortize the unfunded accrued liability using an amortization period of 20 years. The State' s contribution must also include an amount to fund post retirement pension increases in accordance with a for mula contained in the Delaware Code. The Closed State Police Plan is funded on a pay-as you-go basis; al l other Plans are funded on an actuarially sound basis, as determined by the Pension Board, on the basis o f actuarial analyses undertaken by Cheiron, Inc. (\"Cheiron\") annually. The most recent valuation, as of June 30, 2016, determined the State Employees' Plan to have a funded ratio of 89.0% based on the actuarial val ue of the assets and 83.9% based on the market value of the assets. Each year the Pension Board certif ies the required State contribution rate as a percentage of covered payroll, based on the results of the actu arial valuations of the Plans. The State Employees' Plan has an unfunded accrued liability of $1,507 mil lion as of June 30, 2016 on market value. A Schedule of Funding Progress for the State Employees' Plans is shown below. See Schedule of Net Pension Liability in the Financial Section of the Delaware Public Emplo yees' Retirement System Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for fiscal year 2016 for the funding pr ogress of the New State Police Plan, the Judiciary Plan, the Closed State Police Plan and the Special Pl an. -68- HISTORICAL FUNDING PROGRESS ACTUARIAL VALUE STATE EMPLOYEES' PLAN (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended June 30 (1) Actuarial Value of Assets (2) Actuarial Accrued Liability (AAL)(3) Unfunded AAL (UAAL)(4) Funded Ratios(5) Annualized Covered Payroll (6) UAAL as a % of Covered Payroll 2016 of Pension Contribution Funding Policy Payment of each annual contribution is subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. In each year since fiscal 1971, the General Assembly has appropriated t he contribution amounts recommended by the Pension Board. The State has appropriated the amount based on the percentage of covered payroll which is determined by the Pension Board based on the actuarial report.

General Funding Practices Since 1993, the Pension Board has commissioned actuarial studie s annually. Cheiron of McLean, Virginia (\"Cheiron\") has served as the independent actuary sinc e 2006 and uses the assumptions described in the following table for the State Employees Plan: Actuarial Cost Method Entry Age Normal Amortization method Open, percentage of payroll Amortization period 20 years Asset Valuation Method 5-Year Smoothed Market Actuarial Assumption: Investment Rate of Return Salary Increases att ributable to inflation Salary Increases attributable to merit and productivity 7.2% 3.0% 0.5% to 8.5% -70- The actuarial assumptions used have been recommended by Cheiro n and adopted by the Pension Board based on the Fund's recent experience. The latest Experi ence Study was completed in June 2016. For the State Employees' Plan, the information in the following table provides a comparison of the actuarial value of assets to the market values, the ratio of th e AVA to market value, and the funded ratio based on AVA compared to funded ratio based on the market value of assets. Fiscal Year Ended June 30 Actuarial Value of Assets (000) Market Value of Assets (000)% of AVA to market valueFunded Ratio (actuarial value) Funded Ratio (market value) 2016 $ Plan Investment Policy and Practices The Investment Committee of the Pension Board seeks the followi ng investment objectives established by the Pension Board: Achieve a real return of 3% per year over long periods, Manage portfolio risk that limits downside price fluctuation, Maximize total investment retur ns, consistent with Pension Boar d objectives. While not governed by a mandated target asset allocation, inves tment decisions are shaped by the Pension Board's internal invest ment guidelines which provide that a minimum of 20% of the total assets of the Fund be invested in fixed income investments, such as bonds , cash equivalents and certain real estate investments. This guideline is monitored with the assistance of an independent investment advisor. The committee strives for appropriate investment diversification by allocating funds across a variety of asset classes and by selecting managers whose demonstrated performance reflects different management styles and asset class expertise. The performance of all investment manag ers is closely monitored, not only in relation to specific absolute objectives, but also in relation to other fund managers following the same or similar investment objectives. Litigation, Investigations and Labor Relations There has been no material litigation brought or any investigat ion initiated in connection with the pension plan or members of its governing body. Audits of the p ension plan's financial statements have been conducted annually by an independe nt auditor and that auditor h as expressed an unqualified opinion. Transfers of Investment Earnings Earnings generated over and above the investment rate of return are retained as part of the plan assets. -71-Pension Plan Reserves The State passed legislation whic h established a mechanism for funding ad hoc post-retirement increases granted by the General Assembly to members retired un der the State Employees' Plan, the New State Police Plan and the Judiciary Plan beginning in fiscal 19 94. The mechanism allows the State to appropriate actuarially determined employer contributions to a separate Post-Retirement Increase Fund (\"PRI\") managed by the Pension Board. The actuary uses the cur rent actuarial assumptions, methods and population data to calculate the estimated additional liability resulting from the potential benefit increases. When the Legislature grants an ad hoc post-retirement adjustmen t, funds are transferred from this PRI fund on a monthly basis based on a five-year actuarial funding sched ule to the appropriate pension plan from which the additional benefits are disbursed. For the fiscal ye ar ended June 30, 2016, $39.8 million was transferred to the appropriate plan. During the last five years there have been three post-retiremen t increases granted by the General Assembly in fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2015. As of June 30, 2016, these post-retirement increases have outstanding liabilities totaling $59.2 million, which will be f unded by the State and transferred to the appropriate plans over the rema ining amortization periods. The Pension Board adopts actuarially determined funding for the Post-Retirement Increase Fund. Funding for fiscal year 2014 was 1.51% of covered payroll. Fun ding for fiscal year 2015 was 1.66%. Funding for fiscal year 2016 was 2.07% of covered payroll. Fun ding for fiscal year 2017 is 1.56% of covered payroll. Pension Obligation Bonds No pension obligation bonds have been issued and the State does not anticipate issuing any pension obligation bonds in the future. Other Relevant Reports The Delaware Public Employees' Retirement System, a component u nit of the State, annually issues a comprehensive annual financial report. This report, along wi th the Cheiron's actuarial valuation, can be found state's website at: http://www.delawarepensions.com/FinancialReports/AnnualFinancia lReports.shtml http://www.delawarepe nsions.com/financials.shtml . The information included in this section relies on informati on produced by the State together with Cheiron, its independent actuary. Actu arial assessments are \"forward-looking\" and reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the Plans. Such ass essments are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may provide to be inaccurate or be changed in the future, and will change with the future experience of the Plans. OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The State provides post-employment health care to its employees and, in fiscal year 2008, began accounting for these benefits according to GASB Statement No. 4 5, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Bene fits Other Than Pensions (\"GAS B 45\"). The State's actuarially accrued liability, based on a study conducted by Cheiron using actual d ata as of July 1, 2016, has been determined to be about $7.46 billion using a di scount rate of 3.75%, having b een reduced from 4.25%. The State began pre-funding the obligation in 2002 and 2003 wit h lump sum payments and contributions based on a percentage of payroll. In fiscal year 2007, the amount contributed as a percentage of payroll was approximately $5 million and increased to approxima tely $10 million in fiscal years 2008 and -72-2009. In both fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the State contributed $10 million from abandoned property revenue and, in 2011, an additio nal $9.7 million was contribute d by the State primarily from Medicare Part D subsidies received. Fiscal year 2012 and 2013 contributions, b ased on a 0.9% of payroll, were about $16.8 million each and the fiscal 2013 Medicare Part D subsidy was $1 1.2 million. In addition, $3.6 million was received from fiscal 2013 abandoned property revenues. Fiscal 2014 payroll contributions totaled $16 million plus an additional $6.2 million in Medicare Part D subsidies brought total fiscal 2014 contributions to $22.2 million. Fiscal 2015 payroll contributions totaled $17.3 million. Fiscal 2016 payroll contributions totaled $17.5 million. Payroll contributions for fiscal 2017 are expected to be about $17.5 million. The State has established an irrevocable trust and, at June 30, 2016, has accumulated $310 million in assets resulting in a funding ratio of 4.1%. At a 3.75% discount rate, the State's fiscal year 2017 annual required contribution (\"ARC\") is $491.7 million, which is expec ted to be only partially met with cash contributions and paid benefits. P aid benefits are estimated t o be in the amount of $219.3 million. In 2011, the Governor signed legislation, which made significant modifications to employee's health care insurance and pension plan programs. The legislation establishes a fixed cost share in the State's health insurance programs for both active employees and retirees and i ncreases the time to vest for retiree health care benefits. Further reducing this liability was the State's participation, effective January 1, 2013, in an Employee Group Waiver Plan, or EGW P, which shifts the cost of r etiree pharmacy benefits to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS The State currently has 32,047 .9 full-time equivalent (\"FTE\") positions budgeted for fiscal year 2017, an increase of 162.3 FTEs from fiscal year 2016. This includes 14,567.5 FTEs in the public schools, 1,144.0 FTEs in institutions of higher learning (excluding empl oyees of the University of Delaware, which is not considered part of the State's financing reporting entity) and 16,336.4 FTE positions in all other departments. Since July 1966, State employees have had the right to organiz e for the purpose of collective bargaining. Bargaining unit inclusion was limited in 1990 by e xcluding \"confidential\" employees and in 1994 by excluding \"supervisory\" employees into specific units. Classification of bargaining units is determined by the Public Employee Relations Board (\"PERB\"). Co llective bargaining is conducted by OMB on behalf of departments and agencies. With respect to organiz ed non-merit system employees, such bargaining may include all terms and conditions of employment, including wages, hours and certain benefits. With respect to organized merit system employees, traditionally these bargaining units may not bargain wages, leave, healthcare and other related benefits, classifica tion or hiring practices. Effective August 2, 2007, Senate Bill 36 (\"SB36\") was enacted permitting merit syst em employees to organize into 12 larger (umbrella) coalitions units determined by classification. Once determined and certified, these SB 36 units may negotiate limited compensation, defined as payment of salaries and cash allowances, through the collective bargaining process. Position classification, health care and other benefit programs, workers compensation, disability programs and pension programs remain n on-negotiable. To date, five (5) SB 36 units have been certified. The funding of these agreements is subject to approval by the Governor and binding to the extent sufficient appropriations are made by the General Assembly. At present, approximately 6,400 of the State's merit system employees are organized into traditional bargaining units, including the SB 36 units and covered by coll ective bargaining agreements. Employees of institutions of highe r education, certified profe ssional employees of the State public school system (teachers) and certain public school support personnel have the right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining. Bargaining units representin g such employees negotiate with their -73-respective school districts regar ding all matters relating to s alaries, employee benefits and certain working conditions. Virtually all of these school employees are covere d by collective bargaining agreements. State employees in Delaware do not have the legal right to str ike. Few work stoppages have occurred. Currently only two-thirds of employees eligible for union representation are covered by collective bargaining agreements. All payment contracts reached under suc h agreements are subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, except for the locally funded portion of school district employees' salaries and benefits. In 1982, a State law was enacted establishing the PERB to over see the conduct of labor negotiations between public school teachers and their boards of education. There are provisions for mediation and binding arbitration of collective bargaining disputes. Strikes, slow-downs and walkouts are prohibited; but, if they occur, school boards are required to seek injunctive re lief. In 1986, legislation was enacted which extended the PERB's jurisdiction to police officers and firefig hters. The PERB's jurisdiction was further expanded in 1994 to include all public employees in the State. In the same year, a State law was enacted establishing the Merit Employee Relations Board to address grievances and related issues of merit system employees. GOVERNANCE The chief executive officer of the State is the Governor, who is elected for a term of four years. The State Constitution limits any Gove rnor to two terms, whether or not consecutive. The Governor appoints all members of the State judiciary, t he cabinet, and the boards and councils. The Governor reports to the General Assembly at the start of each annual session in January on the \"State of the State,\" recommends changes in legislation, and follows this re port with an annual budget mess age and financial accounting of the State. In addition to the Executive Office of the Governor (which includes the Offices of Management and Budget and Economic Development), there are fourteen cabinet de partments, as reflected in the table which f o l l o w s . T h e y i n c l u d e t h e f o l l o w i n g : ( i ) t h e D e p a r t m e n t o f S t ate, which administers the Division of Corporations and the Division of Cultural and Historical Affair s; (ii) the Department of Finance, which performs financing, accounting, bond finance, revenue collection, fiscal policy functions and administers the State lottery; (iii) the Department of Technology and Information; (iv) the De partment of Health and Social Services; (v) the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families; (vi) the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control; (vii) the Department of Labor; (viii) th e Department of Transportation, which oversees the Division of Motor Vehicles; (ix) the Department of Safety a nd Homeland Security, which oversees the state police; (x) the Department of Co rrection; (xi) the Department o f Agriculture; (xii) the Department of Education; (xiii) Delaware State Housing Authority; and (xiv) the Delaware National Guard. Delaware is unusual in that the State government (as opposed to county or municipal governm ents) funds and administers substantially all correctional, public health, welf are, and trans portation servic es for its residents. Other elected officers include the Lieutenant Governor who presides over the Senate and the Board of Pardons; the State Treasurer, w ho is one of four Issuing Office rs, signs all state checks and oversees the management of the State's bank accounts; the Auditor of Account s who audits all State agencies' financial transactions; the Insurance Commissioner; and the Attorney Gene ral who is the chief legal officer of the State. All of the elected officers serve terms of four years. The State's General Assembly is bicameral and consists of a 21 -member Senate and a 41-member House of Representatives. The entire House stands for re-election ev ery two years, while Senators are elected to four year staggered terms. Regular sessions of the General Assembly convene in January and adjourn by June 30th. Between regular sessions, the Gov ernor or the presiding officer s of either house may call special sessions. Proposed legislation is usually assigned to a standing committe e for review. It may then receive consideration on the floor of both houses. -74- The judicial branch of the government includes a Supreme Court , which acts primarily as an appeals court, and the Court of Chancery, an equity court which has jur isdiction over corporate matters, trusts, estates, and other matters involving equitable jurisdiction. The Superi or Court has jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases, except equity cases. The Family Court administers justi ce in cases involving domestic relations or dependent juveniles. The Court of Common Pleas is a court of l imited jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters which the Superior Court would otherwise handle. The J ustice of the Peace Courts handle criminal matters and civil cases where the amount in controversy is less than $5,000.

Jennifer Cohan LITIGATION The State recognized $1.7 million in governmental activities as probable litigation expenses as of June 30, 2016. Additionally, the State is a defendant in various suits involving contract/construction claims, ta x refunds claims, allegations o f wrongful discharge and/or other employment-related claims, use of excessive force, civil rights violations, automobile accident claims and abandoned property claims as further described below . Although the State believes it has valid defenses to these actions, the State has identified a potential aggregate exposure, which could exceed $224.8 million, as of February 2, 2017. In addition to the types of cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph, there are several matters pending related to abandon ed property. In original act ions that have been accepted for consideration by the United States Supreme Court, Delaware is l itigating claims involving 29 states -75-on the issue whether a certain property type should have been e scheated to Delaware or to the other states. Delaware is vigorously c ontending before the Supreme Co urt that the property type should properly escheat to the property holder's state of incorporatio n, which would, among other things, result in property previously escheated to Delaware remaining with Delaware. Possible resolution of the original actions could re sult both in payments of proper ty by Delaware to other states and further payments by other states to Delaware. Resolution of th e actions is likely to be at least a year away. Two matters are ongoing in the Third Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. In both cases, the U.S. District Court dismissed plaintiffs' assertions of fed eral constitutional violations by the State, and the plaintiffs have now appealed those dismissals. There is one case pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in which the plaint iff raises similar issues. A motion to dismiss is pending in that matter. Finally, litigation is pend ing in the Court of Chancery and before the Tax Appeal Board alleging that an inadequate payment was ma de by the State for escheated securities that greatly appreciated following the State's recei pt and disposition. If the Court rules against the State in any of these matters, there may be a futur e decrease in abandoned property revenues as a result. DEFAC has accounted for the prospective cumulative effect of th e unclaimed property litigation by adopting the lower revenue estimates discussed ab ove. See \"BUDGETARY GENERAL FUND SUMMARIES - Additional Sources of Revenues - Aband oned Property\" above. THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), New York, NY, will act a s securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such othe r name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity and interest rate of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity and interest rate, and will be deposited with DTC. DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited-p urpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization\" within the m eaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \"clearing agency\" registered pur suant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides as set servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt i ssues, and money market instruments from over 100 countries that DTC's participants (\"Direct Participant s\") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales an d other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of se curities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidi a r y o f T h e D e p o s i t o r y T r u s t & C l e a r i n g Corporation (\"DTCC\"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, Nat ional Securities Clearing Corporation, and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registe red clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC sys tem is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers a nd dealers, banks, trust compa nies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Part icipant, either directly or indirectly (\"Indirect Participants\"). DTC has Standard & Poor's rating of: AA+. Th e DTC Rules applicable to its Participants -76-are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (\"Beneficial Owner\") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DT C of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing de tails of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Parti cipant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Tra nsfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownersh ip interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfe rs, all Bonds d eposited by Dir ect Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such o ther name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DT C and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not affect any change i n beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC's r ecords reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose ac counts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain respo nsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direc t Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any sta tutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. B eneficial Owners of Bonds may wi sh to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with resp ect to the Bonds, such as redemptions and defaults. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notic es to Beneficial Owners. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity and interest rate are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed. N e i t h e r D T C n o r C e d e & C o . ( n o r a n y o t h e r D T C n o m i n e e ) w i l l c o nsent or vote with respect to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance w ith DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the State as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.' s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). Redemption proceeds on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., o r such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practi ce is to credit Direct Participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and c orresponding detail information from the State, on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's record s. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \" street name\", and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor its nominee or the State, s ubject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the State, -77-disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficia l Owners will be the responsibili ty of Direct and Indirect Participants. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to the State. Under such circumstance s, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered. The State may decide to discontinue use of the system of book- entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certific ates will be printed and delivered. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book- entry system has been obtained from sources that the State believes to be reliable, but the St ate and the Underwriters take no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. APPROVAL OF LEGAL MATTERS Certain legal matters incident to the authorization and issuan ce of the Bonds are subject to the approval of Saul Ewing LLP, Wilmington, Delaware, Bond Counsel, whose ap proving legal opinion, substantially in the form set forth in APPENDIX C, will be available at the time of the delivery of the Bonds. Bond Counsel has not verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statemen ts contained in the Official Statement nor will it express an opinion as to the accuracy, completeness, or fairnes s of the statements contained in the Official Statement. TAX MATTERS Tax Exemption-Opinion of Bond Counsel The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") con tains provisions relating to the tax- exempt status of interest on obligations issued by governmental entities which apply to the Bonds. These provisions include, but are not l imited to, requirements relating to the use and investment of the proceeds of the Bonds and the rebate of certain investment earnings derived fro m such proceeds to the United States Treasury Department on a periodic basis. These and other requirements o f the Code must be met by the State subsequent to the issuance and delivery of the Bonds in order for interest thereon to be and remain excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. The State has made covenants to comply with such requirements. In the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is not i ncludable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation under ex isting statutes, regulations, r ulings and court decisions. The opinion of Bond Counsel is subject to the condition that the State comply with all applicable federal income tax law requirements that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds i n o r d e r t h a t i n t e r e s t t h e r e o n c o n t i n u e s t o b e excluded from gross income. Failure to comply with certain of such requirements could cause the interest on the B o n d s t o b e s o i n c l u d a b l e i n g r o s s i n c o m e r e t r o a c t i v e t o t h e d a te of issuance of the Bonds. The State has covenanted to comply with all such requirements. Interest on t he Bonds is not treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code for purposes of the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes; however, under the Code, to the extent that interest on the Bonds is a component of a corporate holder's \"adjusted current earnings,\" a portion of that interes t may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding other federal tax consequences relating to the Bonds or the receipt of interest thereon. See discussion of \"A lternative Minimum and Railroad Retirement Benefits\", \"Deduction for Interest Paid by Financial Institutions to Purch ase or Carry Tax-Exempt Obligations\", \"Property or Casualty Insurance a of Amo rtizable Bond Premium\" below. -78-Alternative Minimum Tax With respect to the Bonds, the Code includes, for purposes of the corporate alternative minimum tax, a preference item consisting of, generally, seventy-five percent of the excess of a corporation's \"adjusted current earnings\" over its \"alternative minimum taxable income\" (computed without regard to this particular preference item and the alternative tax net operating loss dedu ction). Thus, to the extent that tax-exempt interest (including interest on the Bonds) is a component of a corporate holder's \"adjusted current earnings,\" a portion of that interest may be subject to the alternative mi nimum tax. Branch Profits Tax Under the Code, foreign corporations engaged in a trade or bus iness in the United States will be subject to a \"branch profits tax\" equal to thirty percent (30%) of the corporation's \"dividend equivalent amount\" for the taxable year. The term \"divide nd equivalent amount\" includes i nterest on tax-exempt obligations. S Corporations with Passive Investment Income Section 1375 of the Code imposes a tax on the income of certain small business corporations for which an S Corporation election is in effect, and that have \"passive investment income\". For purposes of Section 1375 of the Code, the term \"passive investment income\" includes inte r e s t o n t h e B o n d s . T h i s t a x a p p l i e s t o a n S Corporation for a taxable year if the S Corporation has Subchap ter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year and has gross receipts, more than twenty-five perc ent (25%) of which are \"passive investment income\". Thus, interest on the Bonds may be subject to federal income taxation under Section 1375 of the Code if the requirements of t hat provision are met. Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits Under Section 86 of the Code, certain Social Security and Rail road Retirement benefits (the \"benefits\") may be includable in gross income. The Code provides that inte rest on tax-exempt obligations (including interest on the Bonds) is included in the calculation of \"modif ied adjusted gross income\" in determining whether a portion of the benefits receive d are to be includable in gros s income of individuals. Deduction for Interest Paid by Financial Institutions to Purcha se or Carry Tax-Exempt Obligations The Code, subject to limited exceptions not applicable to the Bonds, denies the interest deduction for indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry tax-exe mpt obligations, such as the Bonds. With respect to banks, thrift institutions and other financial institutions, the denial to such institutions is one hundred percent (100%) for interest paid on funds allocable to the Bonds and an y other tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7, 1986. Property or Casualty Insurance Company The Code also provides that a property or casualty insurance c ompany may also incur a reduction, by a specified portion of its tax-exempt interest income, of its ded uction for losses incurred. -79-Accounting Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Amortizable Bond Premium The Bonds maturing on March 1 in the years 2031 through 2033, inclusive, and 2035 through 2037, inclusive, are herein referred to as the \"Discount Bonds.\" In the opinion of Bond Counsel, the difference between the initial public offering price of the Discount Bonds set forth on the cover page and the stated redemption price at maturity of each such Bonds constitutes \"or iginal issue discount,\" all or a portion of which will, on the disposition or payme nt of such Bonds, be treated a s tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes. Original issue discount will be apportioned to an ow ner of the Discount Bonds under a \"constant interest method,\" which utilizes a periodic compounding of accr ued interest. If an owner of a Discount Bond who purchases it in the original offering at the initial public offering price owns that Discount Bond to maturity, that Bondholder will not realize taxable gain for federal incom e tax purposes upon payment of the Discount Bond at maturity. An owner of a Discount Bond who purchases it in the original offering at the initial public offering price and who later disposes of the Discount Bond prio r to maturity will be deemed to have accrued tax- exempt income in a manner described above; amounts realized in excess of the sum of the original offering price of such Discount Bond and the am ount of accrued original issue discount will be taxable gain. Purchasers of Discount Bonds should consider possible state an d local income, excise or franchise tax consequences arising from original issue discount on the Discount Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the Discount Bonds should consult th eir tax advisors regarding the Delaware tax treatment of original issue discount. The Bonds maturing on March 1 in the years 2018 through 2030, inclusive, and 2034 are hereinafter referred to collectively as the \" Premium Bonds.\" An amount equ al to the excess of the initial public offering price of a Premium Bond set forth on the inside cover page over its stated redemption price at maturity constitutes premium on such Premium Bond. A purchaser of a Pre mium Bond must amortize any premium over such Premium Bond's term using constant yield principles, based on the purchaser's yield to maturity. As premium is amortized, the purchaser's basis in such Premium Bon d is reduced by a corresponding amount, resulting in an increase in the gain (or decrease in the loss) to be recognized for federal income tax purposes upon a sale or disposition of such Premium Bond prior to its ma turity. Even though the purchaser's basis is reduced, no federa l income tax deduction is allowed. Purchasers of Premium Bonds, whether at the time of initial is suance or subsequent thereto, should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the determinatio n and treatment of premium for federal income tax purposes and with respect to state and local tax consequences o f owning such Premium Bonds. Delaware State Tax Opinion In the opinion of Bond Counsel under existing statutes interes t on the Bonds is exempt from personal and corporate income tax imposed by the State. CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAX LAW From time to time, there are presidential proposals, proposals by various federal committees and legislative proposals in Congress that, if enacted, could alter or amend the tax matters referred to herein or adversely affect the marketabil ity or market value of the Bonds or otherwise prevent holders of the Bonds from realizing the full benefit of the tax exemption of interes t on the Bonds. Further, such proposals may impact the marketability or market value of the Bonds simply by being proposed. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such proposals may be enacted or wh ether if enacted such proposals would apply to bonds issued prior to enactment. In addition, regulat ory actions are from time to time announced or proposed and litigation is threatened or commenced which, if implemented or concluded in a particular manner, could adversely affect the market value, marketability or tax status of the Bonds. It cannot be predicted whether any such regulatory action will be implemente d, how any particular litigation or judicial action will be resolved, or whether the Bonds would be impacted thereby. -80-Purchasers of the Bonds should c onsult their tax advisors regar ding any pending or proposed legislation, regulatory initiatives or litigation. The opinion s expressed by Bond Counsel are based upon existing legislation and regulati ons as interpreted by relevant judicial and regulatory authorities as of the date of issuance and delivery of the Bonds, and Bond Counsel ha s expressed no opinion as of any date subsequent thereto or with respect to any proposed or pending l egislation, regulatory initiatives or litigation.

T H E S T A T E O F D E L A W A R E B y : ___________________________________ S e c r e t a r y of Finance [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK ] APPENDIX C FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK ] C-1[FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL] M a r c h 9, 2017 OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL RE: The State of Delaware $225,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, Series 2017 TO THE PURCHASERS OF THE ABOVE-CAPTIONED BONDS: We have acted as bond counsel in connection with the issuance of $225,000,000 General Obligation Bonds, Series 2017 Bonds (the \"2017 Bonds\" or the \"B onds\") by The State of Delaware (the \"State\") on the date hereof. The Bonds are issued as fully reg istered Bonds as provided in the Bonds and in a resolution of the Issuing Officers of the State adopted on February 23, 2017 (the \"Resolution\"). The Bonds are issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the State including Chapter 74, Title 29, Delaware Code, as am ended, and the Resolution. As Bond Counsel, we have examined a certified copy of the Reso lution and the form of Bonds. We have examined originals (or copies certified or otherwise id entified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments, certificates and documents as we have deemed neces sary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion rendered below. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. We have relied on a certificate of the State as to the due exe cution and delivery of, and payment for, the Bonds. As to any facts material to our opinion we hav e, when such facts were not independently established, relied upon the aforesaid instruments, certificate s and documents including the State's Federal Tax Certificate dated the date of issuance of the Bonds, and th e statement of reasonable expectations of future events set forth in such certificate. We have not verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information set forth in any offering statement or other similar documents of the State deli vered to the purchasers or prospective purchasers of the Bonds, and we take no responsibility therefor . Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date h ereof and under existing law that: 1. The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered and constitute legal and valid general obligations of the State. 2. The State has pledged its faith and credit for the payment of t he principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Constitution of the State does not contain a ny limitation upon the rate or amount of taxes which may be levied by the State for the payment of princ ipal of and interest on the Bonds with the exception that any law which shall have the effect of increasin g the rates of taxation on personal income C-2for any year or part thereof prior to the date of the enactment thereof, or for any year or years prior to the year in which the law is enacted, would be void. 3. Interest on the Bonds is not includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation under existing statutes , regulations, rulings and cour t decisions. The opinion set forth in the preceding sentence is subject to the condition that the State c omply with all applicable federal income tax law requirements that must be satisfied subsequent to the issua nce of the Bonds in order that interest thereon continues to be excluded from gross income. Failure to comply with certain of such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds to be so includable in gross in come retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. The State has covenanted to comply with all such requir ements. Interest on the Bonds is not treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Internal R evenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") for purposes of the individual and corporate alternativ e minimum taxes; however, under the Code, to the extent that interest on the Bonds is a component o f a corporate holder's \"adjusted current earnings,\" a portion of that interest may be subject to the cor porate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other federa l tax consequences relating to the Bonds or the receipt of interest thereon. 4. Under existing statutes, interest on the Bonds is exempt from p ersonal and corporate income taxes imposed by th e State of Delaware. It is to be understood that the rights of the holders of the B onds and the enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, morat orium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights heretofore or hereafter enacted to the extent constitutionally applicable and that their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of judicial dis cretion in appropriate cases. This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may her eafter come to our attention, or any changes in law that may hereafter occur.
