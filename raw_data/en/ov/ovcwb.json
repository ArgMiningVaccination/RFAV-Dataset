APPENDIX: FORMS AND POLICIES .............................................................................................................................................. 87 5 I. GENERAL INFORMATION A. College of Medicine Mission and Vision Statements MISSION The Florida State University College of Medicine will educate and develop exemplary physicians who practice patient- centered healthcare , discover and advance knowledge and who are responsive to community needs especially through service to elder, rural, minority, and underserved populations. VISION The FSU College of Medicine w ill lead the nation in preparing compassionate physicians to deliver the highest quality, 21st Century, patient- centered medicine to communities of greatest need. B. History of the College of Medicine The Florida State University College of Medicine (FSU COM) was created in June 2000 by a legislative act, to train physicians with a focus on serving medically underserved populations in rural and inner-city areas, and the growing geriatric population in the state. The College of Medicine was built on the foundation of the successful Program in Medical Sciences (PIMS), which was founded in 1971 as an expansion program of the University of Florida College o f Medicine. Funded by a National Institutes of Healt h grant, PIMS provided the first year of medical education for 30 students a year for 30 years. The PIMS program produced approximately 900 graduates. The Florida Legislature created the FSU College of Medicine with clear legislative mandates concerning the structure, mission, and service to the State of Florida. In May of 2001, the inaugural class of 30 students was admitted. Following the initial provisional accreditation in October of 2002, the FSU COM was granted full accreditation by the Liaison Com mittee on Medical Education (LCME) in February 2005. FSU COM became the first new allopathic medical school established in the United States in over twenty years. In July of 2003, the inaugural class began clerkship rotations in the regional campuses located in Orlando, Pensacola, and Tallahassee. The Sarasota Regional Campus was added in July 2005, along with a Rural Medical Education Program in Marianna, Florida. In July 2006, the Tallahassee Regional Campus expanded to include training for a limited number of third year students in Thomasville, Georgia. In July 2007, the COM's last two regional campuses located in Daytona Beach and Ft. Pierce accepted their first group of third y ear students. In addition, the FSU-Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus opened in Immokalee, Florida, offering some clerkships for third and fourth year students. The FSU COM received its first reaccreditation by the LCME in October 2011. Enrollment at the FSU COM grew to 480 in 2010. The first class to reach the maximum of 120 students entered in 2007 . C. Career Advising and Faculty Advising Career Advising Career Advising at the Florida State University College of Medicine is delivered in various formats that consist of required workshops, curricular/co-curricular programs, small group activities, and one-on-one sessions that include: Year 1 -- Self-Exploration & Year 2 - Experiential/Explore Options AAMC Careers in Medicine required workshops Faculty Advising sessions Preceptorship Fall/Spring Experience Summer Clinical Practicum Summer Research & Clinical Opportunities workshop Student Specialty Interest Group events Pre-Clerkship Bootcamp Career Advising/Careers in Medicine workshop Student Affairs Consultation (Counseling and Academic Services, Associate Dean, Assistant Dean) Year 3 - Individual Career Plan Development & Year 4 - Career Plan Implementation 6 Campus Dean Consultations to discuss: o Career Options o Specialty Interests o Career Goals/Specialty Interest and Academic Plans AAMC Careers in Medicine required Doctoring 3 session M4 Orientation introduction to externships Educational Directors Consultation Clerkship Directors/Faculty Advisor Meetings Clerkshi p Faculty/Alumni Doctoring 3 Special Events Regional Campus Student Support Coordinator Meetings FSU COM Sponsored Residency Program Directors presentations Pre-residency bootcamp Resident Panels Alumni Consultation Faculty Advising The FSU College of Medicine has a faculty advising program in which medical students are assigned to faculty advisors beginning in the first year of medical school. Faculty advisors mentor and assist students throughout their medical school experience. 1. Year 1 & 2 Faculty Advising Program: First and second year advisors assist students in the following ways: transition to medical school decision -making medical career exploration self-assessment of the student's progress, achievements, and professionalism accessing resources for educational, personal and professional development developing learning portfolios preparation for USMLE Step 1 M1/M2 Students are required to meet with their assigned faculty advisor at least once a semester. M1/M2 students should respond to advisor's communication (email/phone call) within 24 hours of receiving the communication. 2. Year 3 & 4 Faculty Advising Program: Students relocate to the regional campuses in the third and fourth year and are assigned an advisor at the regional campus. The third and fourth year advisors assist students with the following: transition to the clinical training years decision -making medical career selection fourth-year program of study self-assessment of th e student's progress, achievements, and professionalism accessing resources for educational, personal and professional development networking with physicians in the student's chosen field of medical practice developing the student's portfolio for residency application preparation for the USMLE Step 2 identifying individuals who are able to write appropriate letters of recommendation for residency application 3. Policy on Development of the MEDICAL STUDENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (MSPE) Description: The M SPE is a comprehensive summary of the student's academic record from matriculation through the beginning of the Year 4 Curriculum. This document is a letter of evaluation that is intended to provide residency program directors an honest and objective summ ary of a student's salient experiences, attributes, and academic performance. It is not a letter of recommendation. The document is a key part of the residency application packet. 7 Procedure: The MSPE is prepared for all senior students by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (pre -clerkship years) and the Regional Campus Deans (clerkship years). Students have the opportunity to contribute to the \"Noteworthy Characteristics\" section of the MSPE letter and to review the MSPE for factual accuracy. The A ssociate Dean for Student Affairs edits the final letter for accuracy and format. If, for any reason, a student believes that the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or their regional campus dean cannot prepare the letter in an unbiased manner, he or she m ay request that the letter be completed by another member of the Dean's Office . Timeline (Year 4) : Students are required to submit information for the Noteworthy Characteristics section between June 1 and July 15. The Regional Campus Deans will complete their work on the MSPEs in early to mid- August and submit them to the Associate Dean for Student Aff airs. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will upload a draft of the completed letters by early September for the students' review. Students will have two weeks after the draft letters are uploaded in September to review their MSPE and recommend edits to correct factual errors. Finalized MSPEs are uploaded by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs no later than September 30. Reques ts for an alternative MSPE author should be submitted to the Dean's Office no later than June 30 of the year in which the letter is to be written. MSPE Release date: The FSU COM releases the MSPEs on October 1 of the student's final year in the medical education program. 4. Careers in Medicine Program: The AAMC Careers in Medicine program (CiM), a four -phase program designed to assist students in understanding their options for choosing a specialty and applying to a residency program, is a primary resource for the Advising Program. The four phases of this web- based program include personal career assessment, career exploration, decision- making, and implementation. The program is designed to help students develop a clear vision of their future options a nd is an evolutionary process. CiM offers a structured, organized process which provides students an opportunity to think systematically about their options. Students use their AMCAS login information to access the CiM Website. 8 II. MEDICAL EDUCATION PRO GRAM A. Education Program Leading to the M.D. Degree The College of Medicine is dedicated to the goals of preparing students in the art and science of medical care. The College of Medicine curriculum focuses on the needs of patients and their families, develops a common framework of knowledge, utilizes approaches for acquiring and assessing information, and teaches the basic principles and skills necessary for exemplary medical care providers. As physicians in training, students start a lifelong process that only begins with what wil l be learned in medical school. In the process of caring for patients, physicians have a unique ---and pri vileged ---window on the full range of human emotions and conditions, and through the community- based medical education model at the FSU College of Medicine, students will learn to appreciate the privilege of providing healthcare to diverse populations. To earn the M.D. degree, a student must successfully complete all required coursework and clerkships in years 1 -4, including a minimum of 16 weeks of electives in Year 4; pass the USMLE Step 1 , Step 2 CK and Step 2 CS; complete all required procedures directed by the curriculum within 6 years ; and finish in good a cademic standing . B. The Curriculum 1. Educational Program Objectives The educational program objectives for the FSU COM are synonymous with the 8 domains of the AAMC Physicians Competency Reference Set, which are consistent with the 6 general competencies of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. A 9 th domain addresses the FSU COM Mission. Competency domains organize and define what a physician should actually be able to do. These competency domains are described on the FSU COM website at https://med.fsu.edu/medicalEducation/educational-program-objectives 2. Description of Curriculum The curriculum is a 4 year continuum with two major components: a Preclerkship Phase in which students acquire foundational knowledge and skills in basic, behavioral and clinical sciences, physical exam, interviewing, and clinical reasoning , and a Clerkshi p Phase in which students develop their clinical skills and clinical reasoning through direct patient care experiences in 8 major practice areas and specialty electives, with increasing responsibility for patient care in preparation for residency training. The Pre -Clerkship Phase The pre- clerkship phase (years 1 and 2) takes place on the Florida State University College of Medicine central campus. The first 18 months of the preclerkship phase is comprised of 11 fully integrated system- based courses that cluster into 3 conceptual groups: Foundations of Medicine, Human Systems in Health and Disease, and Preparation for Clinical Medicine . These courses cover the traditional basic science disciplines (anatomy, biochemistry, cell 9 biology and histology, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, and neuroscience), clinical sciences and clinical skills, relevant medical humanities and social sciences content. Included are community -based healthcare experiences in preceptorships and a 3 week immersion exper ience. Following preparation and taking of USMLE Step 1, students complete this phase in the Pre -clerkship Preparation Boot Camp. Short courses allow better flexibility for remediation; a student who fails a block in the first year would be able to remediate the course over the summer and remain with their class cohort. Year 1 and 2 Curriculum Map: https://med.fsu.edu/medicalEducation/curriculum- map Academic Calendar and Pre-clerkship Curriculum: https://med.fsu.edu/medicalEducation/academic- calendar The Clerkship Phase The third and fourth years are devoted to required clerkships and elective clinical rotations of 2-6 weeks duration, most of which take place at one of the College of Medicine regional campuses. P hysician's offices, community clinics, public health units, nursing homes, hospitals, residency programs, and other healthcare facilities are used as training sites in which students actively participate in the clinical setting. Up to 24 weeks (minimum 16 weeks) in the fourth year will be devoted to student electives in which students will be able to choose among select rotations including subspecialty rotations. Twelve weeks must be spent in FSU COM sponsored electives at any of the College of Medicine sites. The remaining 16 or more weeks can be spent in elective stud ies at any accredited medical school or approved clinical setting in the United States. In select cases, consideration may be given to limited international electives with prior approval. This flexibility permits students to pursue individual in terests. These experiences are designed to prepare students for the transition to residency training. Students, with the help and approval of their advisors, will plan their individual fourth-year program. The Regional Campus Dean will approve each student 's plan and submit the plans to the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs for final approval. Students will meet with the Campus Dean or Student Support Coordinator at the end of the third year to prepare for application to the National Residency Match Program. T he clerkship phase includes 2 Flex Time blocks in year 3 and a Residency Preparation phase following Match Day that includes a Boot Camp. Academic Calendar and Clerkship Rotation Calendar: https://med.fsu.edu/ medicalEducation/academic -calendar The Clerkship Phase of the curriculum includes six \"core\" clerkships that must be completed prior to beginning AY4 : Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Surgery. Advanced clinical experiences (Emergency Medicine, Primary Care Geriatrics, and a Sub -Internship in either Internal Medicine or Family Medicine) are completed during AY4 as are most of the required 16 weeks of electives. Scheduling during AY4 is flexible enough to allow stude nts to complete multiple interviews for their residency applications.

BCC 7180 Emergency Medicine Clerkship (4 credit hours) - One of the principal goals of this clerkship is to introduce students to the role that Emergency Medici ne plays in the management of acute disease. In the Emergency Department, there will be exposure to a broad base of undifferentiated patients with a wide variety of personal, social, and cultural issues that influence patient care. This environment places a premium on physical exam skills and diagnostic reasoning, emphasizing the ability to recognize life -threatening situations and initiate resuscitation in a wide range of diseases with varying degrees of urgency. BCC 7201 Residency Preparation Boot Camp (4 credits) - This course provides didactic and hands-on activities that reinforce and demonstrate the graduating medical student's competency and preparedness to perform the core patient -care activities of an intern. Year 4 Electives A listing of Fourth Year electives is provided in the electronic Electives Catalog: https://apps.med.fsu.edu/schedulingStudentAccess/Search/Courses Year 4 International Electi ves During the fourth year of medical school, students may be allowed to take an International Medic ine Elective. This program allows students to participate in an appropriate medical education experience in another country and may include topics such as tropical medicine, Spanish language skills, and medical humanitarian or medical mission work. Upon approval of their Campus Dean and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs, students work closely with the International Medic ine Elective course director developing an appropriate ed ucational plan and making travel and housing arrangements. All costs are the responsibility of the student. To apply, students must complete all the International Medical Elective Form s (Appendix F). 14 III. OUR COMPACT WITH STUDENTS A. The Compact Between Teachers and Learners A document previously created by the AAMC titled \"Compact Between Teachers and Learners of Medicine\" addresses the standards of conduct FSU COM faculty and students are expected to exhibit. It was adopted by the faculty of the College of Medicine in April 2002, and remains in effect today. AAMC COMPACT BETWEEN TEACHERS AND LEARNERS OF MEDICINE The AAMC \"Compact Between Teachers and Learners of Medicine\" addresses the standards of conduct FSU COM faculty and students are expected to exhibit. It was adopted by the faculty of the College of Medicine in April 2002. A copy of this document follows. The following standard, \"Compact Between Teachers and Learners of Medicine\" is provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges. COMPACT BETWEEN TEACHERS AND LEARNERS OF MEDICINE Preparation for a career in medicine demands the acquisition of a large fund of knowledge and a host of special skills. It also demands the strengthening of those virtues that undergird the doctor/patient relationship and that sustain the profession of me dicine as a moral enterprise. This Compact serves both as a pledge and as a reminder to teachers and learners that their conduct in fulfilling their mutual obligations is the medium through which the profession inculcates its ethical values. Guiding Principles Duty Medical educators have a duty, not only to convey the knowledge and skills required for delivering the profession's contemporary standard of care, but also to inculcate the values and attitudes required for preserving the medical profession's social contract across generations. Integrity The learning environments conducive to conveying professional values must be suffused with integrity. Students learn enduring lessons of professionalism by observing and emulating role models who epitomize authentic professional values and attitudes. Respect Fundamental to the ethic of medicine is respect for every individual. Mutual respect between learners, as novice members of the medical profession, and their teachers, as experienced and esteemed professionals, is essential for nurturing that ethic. Given the inherently hierarchical nature of the teacher/learner relationship, teachers have a special obligation to ensure th at students and residents are always treated respectfully. Commitments of Facu lty We pledge our utmost effort to ensure that all components of the educational program for students are of high quality. 15 As mentors for our student colleagues, we maintain high professional standards in all of our interactions with patients, colleagues, and staff. We respect all students as individuals, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion, or sexual or ientation; we will not tolerate anyone who manifests disrespect or who expresses biased attitudes towards any student or resident. We pledge that students will have sufficient time to fulfill personal and family obligations, to enjoy recreational activities, and to obtain adequate rest; we monitor and, when necessary, reduce the time required to fulfill educational objectives, including time required for \"call\" on clinical rotations, to ensure students' wellbeing. In nurturing both the intellectual and th e personal development of students, we celebrate expressions of professional attitudes and behaviors, as well as achievement of academic excellence. We do not tolerate any abuse or exploitation of students. We encourage any student who experiences mistreatment or who witnesses unprofessional behavior to report the facts immediately to appropriate faculty or staff; we treat all such reports as confidential and do not tolerate reprisals or retaliations of any kind. Commitments of Students We pledge our utmost effort to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors required to fulfill all educational objectives established by the faculty. We cherish the professional virtues of honesty, compassion, integrity, fidelity, and dependability. We pledg e to respect all faculty members and all students as individuals, without regard to gender, race, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation. As physicians in training, we embrace the highest standards of the medical profession and pledge to conduct ourselves accordingly in all of our interactions with patients, colleagues, and staff. In fulfilling our own obligations as professionals, we pledge to assist our fellow students in meeting their professional obligations, as well. B. Standards of Conduct Statement in the Appropriate Treatment of Medical Students in the Educational Setting The Florida State University publishes two separately bound documents, the General Bulletin, Graduate Edition and the Student Handbook, that outline policies with regard to: 1. Equal Employment Opportunity and Non- Discrimination 2. Persons with Disabilities 3. HIV/AIDS Policy 4. Sexual Harassment Policy 5. Values and Moral Standards The \"Equal Opportunity and Non- Discrimination Statement\" reads, in part: Florida State University (the University) is an equal employment opportunity employer and educational provider committed to a policy of non-discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran or marit al status, or any other protected group status. This policy applies to faculty, staff, students, visitors, applicants, and contractors in a manner consistent with applicable federal and state laws, regulations, ordinances, orders and rules, and the Univers ity's policies, procedures and processes. 16 In pursuing its mission of excellence as a comprehensive, graduate- research university with a liberal -arts base, the University strives to create and maintain a harmonious, high-performance work and educational environment. It is the expectation that all members of our community are provided equitable opportunities to succeed and enrich the strength, skill, and character of the University. It is also expected that all members of our community will help create a work and educational environment that promotes fairness, respect, trust, and is free from discrimination or harassment. Behavior that may be considered offensive, demeaning, or degrading to persons or groups will not be tolerated. The University will continue to reinforce its commitment of non- discrimination to all groups protected by state and federal law. We will continue to monitor our methods of recruitment, retention and advancement of qualified faculty, staff and students and annually examine our affirmative action plan, as prescribed by federal guidelines, to measure whether our campus is reflective of the community we serve. The University further recognizes that forms of discriminatory or harassing behavior may create an unwelcomed or hostile environment and lead to an uncomfortable situation. As a result, the University has established internal complaint procedures available to all who believe their experience on any of our campuses has been less than appropriate. (Florida State University B ulletin, Gr aduate Edition) https://report.fsu.edu/ . The Florida State University College of Medicine is committed to maintaining an academic environment in which faculty and students can work together freely to educate and develop exemplary physicians who provide the highest level of patient- centered healthcare , discover and advance knowledge, and are responsive to community needs especially through service to elder, rural, minority, and underserved populations. The College of Medicine recognizes that each member of the medical school community should be accepted as an autonomous individual and treated in a civil and humane manner without regard to his or her race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin, age, disability or any other factor irrelevant to participation in the activities of the College of Medicine. Diversity in background, outlook and interest among faculty, students and patients inherent in the practice of medicine, and an appreciation and understanding of such diversity is an important aspect of medical training. The development and nurturing of professional and collegial attitudes for effective caring and compassionate healthcare requires mutual respect among members of the College of Medicine community (faculty, staff, and students) and between these members and patients and their families. Certain behaviors are inherently destructive to the teacher- learner relationship. Behaviors such as violence, sexual harassment, or inappropriate discrimination based on personal characteristics must never be tolerated. Other behavior can also be inappropriate if the effect interferes with professional development. Behavior patterns such as making habitual demeaning or derogatory remarks, belittling comments, or destructive criticism fall into this category. On the behavioral level, abuse may be operationally defined as behavior by medical school faculty, staff, or students consensually disapproved of by society and by the academic community as either exploitative or punishing. The Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire defines student mistreatment as follows: \"Mistreatment arises when behavior shows disrespect for the dignity of others and unreasonably interferes with the learning process. It can take the form of physical punishment, sexual harassment, psychological cruelty, and discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, sex, age or sexual orientation.\" The AAMC identifies eight general areas of mis treatment: Public belittlement or humiliation Threats of physical harm or actual physical punishment Requirements to perform personal services, such as shopping Being subjected to unwanted sexual advances Being asked for sexual favors in exchange for grades Being denied opportunities for training because of gender, race/ethnicity or sexual orientation Being subjected to offensive remarks/names directed at you based on gender, race/ethnicity or sexual orientation Receiving lower grades or evaluation based on gender, race/ethnicity or sexual orientation Physical punishment or physical threats Sexual harassment Discrimination based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin, age, d isability Repeated episodes of psychological punishment of a student by a particular superior (e.g. public humiliation, threats and intimidation, removal of privileges) 17 Grading used to punish a student rather than to evaluate objective performance Assignin g tasks for punishment rather than to evaluate objective performance Requiring the performance of personal services Taking credit for another individual's work Intentional neglect or intentional lack of communication. In an effort to prevent the occurrence of such behavior by individuals charged with teaching College of Medicine students, hiring appropriate faculty and providing appropriate faculty development activities is considered of prime importance. The faculty recruited by the College of Medicine embodies the values on which the College is based. These values include mutual respect and a student -centered educational environment. The leadership reinforces these values through formal faculty workshops and meetings and through informal day- to-day interac tions with administration and faculty leaders. In compliance with FSU policy, each faculty member, staff and student is provided access to the University's policy regarding sexual harassment. Copies of this policy are available at The Florida State Unive rsity in hard copy (policy brochures, student handbooks, the General and Graduate Bulletins , etc.), electronic format ( https://report.fsu.edu/ .) and will be made available in alternative format upon request. To further ensure the environment of mutual respect at all levels of student interaction with faculty and staff, if a student feels he/she is being mistreated, the student should report this concern to the Division of Student Affairs (Student Support Coordinator, Assistant or Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Regional Campus Dean). The College of Medicine provides scheduled programs for students and faculty relating to the prevention of student mistreatment. The objective is to educate all members of the College of Medicine community about the policies and procedures of the College of Medicine and its commitment to maintain an atmosphere of mutual respect in an effective learning environment. These programs include 1) a review of federal laws p rohibiting discrimination, essential elements of related case law (i.e., how the federal laws are interpreted with respect to gender and race in particular), and 2) how the College of Medicine expects individuals to relate to one another including a review of policies on sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and medical student treatment. In addition, the Compact Between Learners and Teachers of Medicine, developed by the AAMC, has been adopted and emphasizes an educational climate that values students and faculty and is reviewed with both groups. For students, there will be an introduction at orientation followed by workshops on sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and medical student mistreatment during the first two years. These issues will be repeated as part of the orientation to the clinical years and will include how to handle abusive/inappropriate patients, faculty and staff. New faculty members receive information and instruction on the topics of sexual harassment, discrimination, medical student mistreatment and boundary issues as part of the new faculty orientation process. This information and instruction will be available as an on -line module comprised of a video or slide presentation to be accessed by all faculty including those at each regional campus and the Rural Medical Education Program. Florida State University has adopted a values and moral standards policy that establishes the philosophy guiding the culture of the learning environment at FSU. See https://report.fsu.edu/ , The College of Medicine uses this document as a guide in addressing the issue of student treatment. C. Reporting Harassment and/or Abusive Treatment Students who believe they have been subject to abusive treatment may report the allegations to the Student Support Coordinator at their respective location, Assistant Director Student Support Services , the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, Assistant Dean for Student Affairs and Diversity, Regional Campus Dean, the Council on Diversity and Inclusion or any faculty or staff member in the College of Medicine. If the student contacts a College of Medicine staff or faculty member, that individual should report the incident to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs reviews the circumstances as reported , reviews relevant documentation and conducts an investigation of the complaint. The De an of the College of Medicine may be informed of the findings of the investigation and may further act on them accordingly. 18 Any student, staff or faculty member who witnesses mistreatment of a COM student, or any student who experiences mistreatment, shou ld report the event using the Report of Mistreatment of a Student form at https://intranet.med.fsu.edu/sites/academicaffairs/Pages/Mistreatment.aspx The report can b e made anonymously if desired. Students that would like support for reporting discrimination, b ias, or related incidents can contact the FSU COM Council on Diversity and Inclusion (CODI) Subcommittee , https://med.fsu.edu/councildiversityinclusion/reporting to address concerns of discri mination or bias. In addition to the Report of Mistreatment of a Student form, students can visit report.fsu.edu to review other mechanism s to report important incidents or concerning behavior happening in the FSU community, and for obtaining guidance and advice. If the claim involves sexual harassment, the University's policies regarding reporting are followed as outlined at http://hr.fsu.edu/?page=eoc/eoc_sexual_harassment . 19 IV. STUDENT RESOURCES A. Student Learning Communities The FSU College of Medicine strives to foster a student -centered environment. One of the most evident ways in which this goal is accomplished is through the student Learning Community (LC). This space is available 24 hours a day to the students and serves as the setting for group as well as individual study. Faculty, staff, and students are able to foster relationships with each other creating a culture of teamwork and cooperation. The Learning Community is critical to maintaining a cooperative learning environment and active student learning in the integrated curriculum model adopted by the College of Medicine. The Assistant Director for Academic and Student Services and Student Support Coordinator are available to assist the students in all four years of medical education in areas of personal, professional, and academic need. The Learning Communities include: Small Group rooms for instruction and study Kitchen Lounge area Restrooms Shower facilities Student lockers IT and A-V equipment Printer/copy machine (see policy under IV. D. below) Additional resources, information and announcements regarding issues affecting FSU COM students The Student Learning Communities are not just physical spaces. Rather, they are physical evidence of the student -centered culture of the College of Medicine. They foster a sense of community and encourage group learning, eliminating the atmosphere of competition that often exists among m edical students. The student learning communities create a learning environment that contributes to FSU College of Medicine students' personal and academic success throughout medical school. B. Clinical Learning Center (CLC) and Charlotte E. Maguire an d Tallahassee Memorial Health Care Center for Clinical Simulation a. Clinical Learning Center The Clinical Learning Center is a teaching and assessment center that provides opportunities for medical students to learn clinical skills in a simulated clinical setting, using standardized patients. b. Charlotte E. Maguire and Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Center for Clinical Simulation The Charlotte E. Maguire and Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Center for Clinical Simulation is a teaching and assessment center that provides opportunities for medical students to learn clinical skills in a simulated clinical setting, using a variety of patient simulators and models . C. Computers Each College of Medicine student will receive a laptop computer for use within their medical or physician assistant curriculum. Other equipment may be provided for students on a case by case basis as needs arise. As this equipment is an essential part of the instructional program, only College approved programs may be installed. If there is software that you would like to have installed on your computing equipment, please submit a request to the Information Technology help desk (644-3664; help.desk@med.fsu.edu ). Once a request is received, the software will be evaluated for its addition into the educational curriculum or research needs by IT and/or Academic Affairs leadership. Should a device be lost or damage d, the student will be assessed a fee for replacement. Any malfunction or difficulties should be reported immediately to the IT help desk or the IT coordinator at the Regional Campus. See section VI, subsection L below on E-mail Content and Signature Policy. 20 D. Printing/Copying Policy on Student Printing The College of Medicine recognizes students' need to print and photocopy educational materials associated with the curriculum. E ach student learning community has a printer and photocopier capable of creating black and white documents. Students may only print and photocopy on devices located in student learning communities unless otherwise directed by faculty or staff for specific academic activities. For example, it may be necessary for students to print to printers in the the Clinical Learning Center during organized instructional activities. Use of the college's color laser printers and color copiers is not permitted by students unless the use of these machines is authorized by faculty for instructional purposes. In an effo rt to ensure continued acce ss to printers and photocopiers, it is important that students limit printing and photocopying to educational activities. Students are encouraged to minimize the use of photocopying as much as possible and to attempt paper saving measures such as double sided printing when they can. Students in Year 3 and 4 are limited to 1000 copies per academic year. Unnecessary and excessive use of the resources could negatively impact the college's ability to provide resources in the future. E. Charlotte Edwards Maguire Medical Library The Charlotte Edwards Maguire Medical Library was the first academic medical library created after the invention of the World Wide Web , making widespread delivery of electronic resources viable. As such, it is a 21st century library with the majority of its resources accessible electronically, with limited print holdings providing supplementary materials. F. Study Space At the central campus, there are multiple areas for quiet study. These identified areas are located in the library , in individual study rooms on the 4th floor and the study lounge on the lower level of the Thrasher building. Students also have access to group study areas in their individual Learning Communities. In the 3rd and 4th year, each of the regional campuses has study areas located in different areas of the campus buildings as well as in the student's Learning Community. There are established policies for the use of student study space and etiquette for the central campus - See Appendix J. G. Central Campus Wellness Center Each s tudent's wellbeing is a high priority and is essential to the success of the C ollege of M edicine. The Wellness C enter was added to the central campus on the 4th floor in 2011. This area contains exercise equipment and space for wellness activities for only students, staff and faculty at the College of M edicine. The wellness center is open 24/7. The use of this facility is contingent upon following the COM Wellness Center's established policies - See Appendix H. The Wellness Center waiver and release online form must be complete to gain access: https://intranet.med.fsu.edu/sites/General/Security/Pages/Wellness.aspx H. The FSUCard One of the first stops on campus during orientation week is the FSUCard Center located in the Parking Garage complex next to the FSU Bookstore. The FSUCard is the official student identification, and since it is required to conduct most transactions on campus, it is best to keep it with you at all times. The FSUCard is more than just an ID! It is the key to a wealth of services that make a medical student's life easier. It is a library card, a debit card and a door key. The FSUCar d provides access to several comp uter labs on the FSU campus (Carothers, Oglesby Union and Strozier Basement), StarMetro City Bus, the health center, and the recreation facilities. It allows a student to check out materials and use resources at all five libraries on the FSU campus, is used for all campus events, and for meals at Seminole Dining facilities including the Doctor's Inn. A range of features designed for FSU students are available by dialing 1 -888- FSU-CARD. In addition, there are full -service banking options that may be utilized with the FSUCard. Finally, the Magnetic Digital Stripe on the back of the FSUCard allows you to store cash value on your card at cash- to-card machines located around campus; then the card can be used in vending machines, copiers, laser printers, laundry facilities, and to purchase some merchandise on and off campus. 21 The FSUCard is a vital part of everyday life and provides access to all College of Medicine Student Learning Communities, the anatomy laboratory, library and wellness center . Remember , the FSUCard Center is located in the FSU book store on Woodward Avenue an d can be reached by phone at (850) 644-7777. When obtaining the card, be sure to bring photo identification. Business hours are 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Cashier hours are 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday. I. Parking on Campus Finding parking on the FSU campus is quite a challenge! This is how it works. All Students, including year 3 and 4 students are assessed a per credit hour fee paid wi th their tuition to cover their parking and transportation needs. Students with vehicles may obtain their virtual parking permit online at https://transportation.fsu.edu/parking/parking- permits . The virtual permit entitles students to park in \"W\" lots (those with white- striped parking spaces), which are designated student lots, up until 4:30 PM. After 4:30 PM, students may also park in the \" R\" lots (those with red -striped parking spaces), which are designated for faculty and staff between the hours of 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday. In addition, as a convenience for students traveling to and from preceptorships, parking is avai lable across Stadium Drive in the parking lot of the Church of the Latter D ay Saints from 8am - 6pm, M -F, by permit. Students should check out from and return these permits to the security desk in the COM atrium , as needed. Although third and fourth year students are at Regional Campus sites, they are responsible for obtaining a valid FSU Parking Permit for use when participating in activities held on the FSU main campus in Tallahassee. J. Bus Services Bus Service Information can be accessed by calling 850 -644-5278, or visit the website at https://transportation.fsu.edu/bus- service . The Office of Parking and Transportation Services is located at 5460 University Center, Building C. K. Child Care All university child care centers are operated by Childcare & Early Learning Programs . All child care centers were established to assist student parents in the care and education of their children so that they could attend classes as well as to provide hands on experience and training for various academic departments on campus. Programs are administered by University Housing. http://www.childcare.fsu.edu . Information on the FSU Childcare & Early Learning Programs and points of contact can be found here: http://www.childcare.fsu.edu/programs 22 V. REGIONAL CAMPUSES AND RURAL MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM The FSU COM has six regional campuses (Pensacola, Tallahassee, Orlando, Sarasota, Daytona Beach and Ft. Pierce), where students may complete the third and fourth year of their medical education. In addition, the FSU COM has rural training sites in Marianna and Immokalee, where a limited number of students will complete their third year of medical education (Marianna) as well as some required clerkships in Years 3 and 4 (Immokalee). The College of Medicine has also established an extension of the Tallahassee Regional Campus in Thomasville, Georgia where a limited number of students will complete their third and fourth year of medical education. The regional campus sites have facilities which house administrative offices, instructional spaces, and student ar eas. Each of the campus facilities is centrally located near the clinical teaching facilities in Pensacola, Tallahassee, Orlando, Sarasota, Daytona Beach, and Ft. Pierce. The Rural Programs in Marianna and Immokalee also have instructional and student space. Affiliation agreements are in place with all major healthcare providers in each of the communities where the campuses are located. These providers, along with clerkship and elective faculty practices, serve as third and fourth- year training sites for the College of Medicine. A. Regional Campus Student Assignment Procedures Purpose: To assign medical students to the regional campuses and to the rural program for Years 3 and 4 in a manner that maximizes the utilization of regional campus and the rural program resources in the FSU COM. Background Information: The COM reserves the right to make student assignments to additi onal training sites as they become available. The number of available slots at each training site is determined by the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs in consultation with Regional Deans based on educational resources avai lable at each campus. Students will apply for regional campus selections and the Rural Program during the Summer semester of their first year . Students are given information about each regional campus on the FSU COM website and informational sessions . Regional Campus Assignment Procedure: 1. Information regarding each of the COM training sites is available on the COM's website. 2. Students are invited to tour the training sites at their own expense and outside of regular class sessions. These tours should be arranged by contacting the Student Support Coordinator at the regional campus or the Rural Health Program Coordinator and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. 3. In the Summer s emester of the 1 st year , students will fill out the Regional Campus Selection Form, which will be available on the college MEDNet intranet site. The form will include preferences for all 6 regional campuses, the rural program in Marianna and the Thomasville site. 4. Students will rank order all eight possible sites (the six regional campuses, the rural program in Marianna and Thomasville) and provide up to a page of written justification about their location preference. 5. Students will have approximately one week to complete the forms. 6. The forms will be reviewed by the Regional Campus Assignment Committee composed of the Associate and Assistant Deans of Student Affairs, the Assistant Director of Student Support and the Director of the Rural Medical Education Program. They will make the assignments based on maximizing the students' preference for location, taking into account the provided justifications. 7. Once final regional campus assignments are completed, a student may request to switch a site assignment with another student, with the approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs . Such requests must be in writing and signed by both students making the request and must be turned in to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs within three months prior to the students transition to the regional campuses to allow time for credentialing at the regional campus . 8. Final assignments will be distributed to the class approximately one week after submission of the forms. 9. Campus assignments are considered final once approved and can only be changed with the approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. 10. Students who must repeat a Year 2 course or remediate USMLE Step 1 will proceed to their assigned campus as soon as satisfactory remediation is completed. 23 11. In the event that a campus assignment becomes available after the regional campus selection process is completed, students who are seeking a change in the selection of their campus may be assigned to a new campus at the discretion if the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and/or the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. 12. Students who are required to repeat Year 1/2 of the curriculum may be required to be reassigned to a different regional campus than they were originally selected for based on campus capacity. Questions regarding the Regional Campus Assignment process should be addressed to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. B. Housing The Florida State University College of Medicine will assist the student in locating affordable housing at the regional campu ses. Housing is available for students completing rotations in the Rural Medical Education Program in Marianna, Florida, the Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus in Immokalee and the Tallahassee Regional Campus site in Thomasville, GA. C. Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus in Immokalee The FSU COM has established training programs at the Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus in Immokalee and with FSU COM faculty members in Immokalee, Florida. The campus is the home base for the FSUCOM Programs in C ross- cultural Medicine and Immigrant Health, The FSU Center for Child Stress & Health and the FSU Medical Interpreters Certificate Program. Students assigned to a regional campus in the FSU COM may choose to participate in required and elective third and fourth year clerkship rotations at the Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus. Students will indicate at time of schedule developments that they are interested in completing a rotation in Immokalee. These assignments will be determined based on availability with consultation of the s tudent's regional campus dean and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. Participation in D3 Sessions will occur on the Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus. Longitudinal Rotation experiences will be arranged with consultation of the Doctoring 3 Course Director and the student's regional campus dean . Housing and mileage is available for stud ents completing rotations at the Isabel Collier Read Medical Campus in Immokalee. D. Policy and Procedure for Students Rotating Between Regional Campuses Policy: With the exception of M4 Sub-Internships in FSU- sponsored or affiliated residency programs, or approved sites affiliated with the Rural Medical Education Program, students are not allowed to take required third and fourth year clerkships away from their home campus. However, students are allowed to participate in fourth year internal and external elective rotations at any FSU COM regional campus. To ensure that the FSU COM maintains contact with students taking rotations between its training sites, it is the FSU COM 's policy that when a student is participating in any rotation (required, internal elective, external elective) in or adjacent to the city of a FSU COM regional campus different from her/his home campus, s/he is to contact the Student Support Coordinator at that campus via e -mail prior to the first morning of her/his rotation to provide her/his local contact information. To maintain the Student Learning Community concept of the FSU COM as much as possible, students are allowed to have access to the regional campus where they are participating in clerkships. The student should email a copy of his/her FSUCard or provide it to the Student Support Coordinator when he/she arrives at the regional campus so he/she may be provided access to the regional campus buil ding for access to the library and study areas. Procedure: The procedure for making sure the FSU COM maintains contact with students rotating between regional campuses is: 1. For Required and Internal Elective Clerkships: 24 a. It is the student's responsibil ity to arrange for housing. b. During the week before a rotation starts, the student should inform the Student Support Coordinator at the regional campus where he/she will be taking an away required or internal elective rotation via phone or e- mail of his/her upcoming arrival the following week. c. At least six weeks prior to the beginning of the rotation, the Student Support Coordinator will obtain from the student all information required to participate at the regional campus, including but not limited to, the student's FSU ID Card number to obtain building access and all contact information (home phone, cell phone, alternate e- mail addresses, clerkship faculty contact numbers). d. At least four weeks prior to the beginning of the rotation, the Student Support C oordinator will provide the student with contact information and other rotation details, including but not limited to, any necessary materials for the rotation (binders, handouts, maps), parking passes, hospital ID information and requirements, and information about the area. e. Prior to the start of the rotation, the Clinical Coordinator of the rotation site sends faculty contact information to the student by email. f. The Informational Technology Coordinator will be available to assist the student with configuring the laptop to set up appropriate access to printers, hardware and software problems, etc. g. The Campus Dean, Student Support Coordinator an d Clinical Coordinator at that campus will assume responsibility for any student- related issues the student may have during his/her time at the campus. h. If at any time a student has questions or unexpected changes occur regarding the rotation, the student must notify the Student Support or Clinical Coordinator at the campus she/he is visiting as well as her/his home campus. i. Once the away rotation is over, the staff at the regional campus will coordinate reversing access to the building and updating security lists. 2. For FSU External Electives - If the student will be rotating in or adjacent to the city of an FSU COM regional campus and/or if the student intends to have access to the resources of the regional campus: a. During the week before a rotation starts, the Student Support Coordinator at the home campus should inform the Student Support Coordinator at the receiving regional campus where the student will be taking an external elective via call or e-mail of the student's pending arrival the following week. b. At least six weeks prior to the beginning of the rotation, the Student Support Coordinator will obtain from the student all information required to participate at the regional campus, including but not limited to, the student's FSU ID Card number to arrange building acces s and all contact information (home phone, cell phone, alternate e- mail addresses, clerkship faculty contact numbers). c. The Informational Technology Coordinator will be available to assist the student with configuring the laptop to set up appropriate access to printers, hardware and software problems, etc. d. The Clinical Coordinator at that campus will notify the campus dean of the student's upcoming rotation for informational purposes. e. The student's home Campus Dean, Clinical Coordinator and Student Support Coordinator will retain responsibility for all other student -related requirements, including but not limited to, notifying elective faculty of the student's arrival, ensuring that all required information is provided to hospitals and other facilities, and student evaluation. E. Hospital Policy for Students The following is the Hospital Policy for FSU College of Medicine Students. Students as well as the Medical Staff Officer at each hospital are provided a copy during year 3 orientation week. Each hospital also provides the students with specific information regarding the services and polici es by which they will need to abide while working at their facility. If at any time students have questions regarding what they can and cannot do, they should discuss this with their clerkship faculty member and/or clerkship director. Students may access the medical records of assigned patients. (Students are bound by the same \"rules\" of patient confidentiality as are the physicians practicing in the specific hospital facility). Student may write progress notes, histories, physicals, and other notes docume nting care/services provided in the medical records of assigned patients. For Medicare billing purposes, student notes can be used only as 25 documentation of the review of systems and past, family, and social histories. Countersignature by the supervising physician is required to occur in a timely manner according to the hospital policy. Students may enter orders on assigned patients after consulting the supervising physician. These orders must be confirmed via verbal confirmation or countersignature of th e supervising physician prior to being acted upon by hospital employees. Students may visit, interview and examine assigned patients even in the absence of the supervising physician - except where specifically prohibited (gynecological exams). As physicians in training, students may access all appropriate hospital facilities - (for example - physician lounges, locker rooms, libraries, medical record areas, sleeping areas, cafeterias and parking areas) - - in order for the student to function in his/her prof essional role. Students must be under the direct supervision of a licensed physician/care provider who is privileged in the given procedure in the specific facility when performing technical procedures on assigned patients. In emergency situations, students may temporarily assist hospital employees or other physicians in the care of unassigned patients. Students will attend orientation sessions at the hospital facilities and wear the appropriate identification badge at all times. F. Policy on Visiting Students Because of the structure of the FSU COM's distributed model for undergraduate and graduate medical education, the FSU COM does not accept visiting students for elective rotations with our contracted faculty members. Medical stude nts from other institutions who desire externships at one of FSU COM's sponsored or affiliated residency programs must apply directly to the residency program. In addition, students desiring residency at one of FSU COM's sponsored residency programs must apply through the National Resident Matching Program via ERAS. G. Policy on Sharing Faculty at an Instructional Site FSU COM students are assigned directly to physicians who have faculty appointments with the FSU COM in a one-on-one apprentice model for their clerkship training, as opposed to being assigned to a hospital service. Faculty members are oriented to, and have the syllabus for, our educational program. The student follows the faculty member wherever he or she goes for patient care activities, including the faculty member's hospital practice. Access to patients is via the individual faculty member's private practice. Campus deans, education directors and clerkship directors work closely with our residency program partners to ensure that electives at our sponsored and affiliated residency programs are available to our students. The campus deans and clerkship directors monitor faculty resources closely to ensure that any potential competition for those resources is addressed proactively by r ecruiting additional faculty members to ensure that the activity of students from other medical schools does not interfere with our students' education. Students from other institutions participating on rotations at our affiliated community hospitals are under the direction and supervision of those hospitals and their medical staffs. Any of our regional campus sites that have another LCME- accredited medical school will have a Memorandum of Collaboration with that school ensuring that each medical school has appropriate access to needed resources to support its medical education program (per LCME's June 2014 White Paper titled \"Principles for LCME -Accredited Medical Schools Sharing Faculty at an Instructional Site\"). 26 VI. ACADEMIC POLICIES The Florida State University College of Medicine Student Handbook and the Florida State University Bulletin (https://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/graduate/ ) outline the academic policies for medical students. A. Registratio n All registration procedures are managed by the College of Medicine Enrollment Services Coordinator (Registrar). Students are responsible for insuring that there are no registration holds on their records and that their immunization records are up- to-date p rior to the registration window. Students should check their account status at MyFSU (https://cas.fsu.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.my.fsu.edu%2Fc%2Fportal%2Flogin ) two weeks prior to the registration window to make sure there are no registration holds . Outstanding accounts, including delinquent current semester tuition, will prevent a student from being registered until all delinquent fees are paid. Diplomas and official transcripts will not be issued when any amount is owed the University. Delinquent accounts are referred to a collection agency if fees are not paid in full. B. Academic Honor Code The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students' academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to \". . . be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University.\" (Florida State University Academic Honor Policy, found at http://fda.fsu.edu/Academics/Academic- Honor-Policy/ . The Florida State University College of Medicine expect s students to be honest in all of their class work. In addition to academic honesty, we expect a high standard of personal and professional conduct in the physicians we aspire to train. There is an Academic Honor Code that all College o f Medicine students are expected to follow with respect to their moral and ethical behavior. Each student signs a pledge that s/he has read the College of Medicine Academic Honor Code and will adhere to the tenets of that code. Violation of this code will result in disciplinary action that may include dismissal from the College of Medicine. When a block director or education director believes a student has violated the Academic Honor Code based on direct observation or reporting by students, faculty or staff, that instructor should report the matter to either th e Associate or Assistant Dean for Student Af fairs, the Regional Campus Dean or the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs and discuss the matter with the student. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and/or Regional Campus Dean will conduct an appropriate investigation into the alleged breach of the honor code. In the event of a breach of the honor code, the Chair of the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee will be notified of the breach and may remand the violation back to the instructor for resolution or it may b e brought before the full Evaluation and Promotion Committee . A student whose performance in relation to the Academic Honor Code is deemed unsatisfactory for any reason will receive written notification from the Chair of the Student Evaluation and Promoti on Committee of the Committee's recommendations. C. FSU COM Attendance Policy Students will be accountable and personally responsible for attending all educational activities which are indicated as mandatory in the calendar or by the block/education director. These include all clinical experiences, small groups, team activities , labs, assessments and any lecture when outside speakers or patients are present. If a student has an emergency that prevents her/him from attending a scheduled activity, s/he is to call and notify the Division of Student Affairs (Year 1/2) or the Region al Campus Dean / Student Support Coordinator (Year 3/4) and request that they inform the supervisors/professors/clerkship faculty/education director for that activity. If at all possible, the student should also call and at a minimum, leave a message with one of the course /block /clerkship directors. It is important that students realize that their absence or tardiness negatively impacts a number of other people. Attendance, including 27 tardiness, is part of the student's evaluation for professionalism. Negative evaluations may result in decreased grades and in severe cases, referral to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Procedure for Request of Absence in Year 1/2 The online \"Request for Absence\" ( https://apps.med.fsu.edu/StudentAcademics/Absence/Student ) process should be used for all absences, including post -illness absences, regardless of whether the student is requesting an absence from one or more classes or the entire day. If the student knows in advance of an upcoming legitimate absence for a time that is considered a mandatory attendance educational activity, the online \" Advance Request for Absence from Educational Activities \" process should be followed as outlined below. The implications for the absence (e.g., remediation, course grade adjustment, make- up exam, etc.) will be given to the student by the course /block director and final decisions regarding these actions shall rest with the cou rse/block director. If the absence occurs due to an unforeseen emergency, the student should contact the course /block director and the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs immediately to report the absence including the reason for the absence, and as soon as possible complete the Request for Absence form as outlined below. Here is how it works. Student completes online form: https://apps.med.fsu.edu/absence Students must include all the sessions/activit ies they plan to miss on the requested day of absence (lecture, small groups, quiz, exam, CLC session, preceptorship, OSCE, etc.) It is the students responsibility to ensure the form is filled out completely with all the sessions/activities they will miss for that particular day. The form is routed once submitted to Student A ffairs for approval. The Assistant or Associate Dean for Student Affairs will evaluate and determine if the reason for the absence meets the criteria for an excused absence. If the ab sence is excused, the student and the appropriate course /block director and support staff will be notified of the excused absence. The course /block directors and staff are not given the reasons for the absence to protect potential confidential student inf ormation. If the absence is determined not to be an excused absence by the Assistant or Associate Dean for Student Affairs, then the student and the appropriate course directors will receive notification of the denial. Students can check on the status of the progress of the request by clicking on the \"Pending requests\" link. Students are encouraged to keep in proactive and continued contact with their course /block directors in regards to their absences and to ensure that they have a clear plan for any make up an activity that they might be required to perform per the course /block director's guidance. Procedure for Request of Absence from Year 3/4 Required Clerkships If the student requests an absence in advance, the student should first discuss the request with the Regional Campus Dean. The online \"Request for Absence\" (https://apps.med.fsu.edu/StudentAcademics/Absence/Student ) process for the Year 3/4 should be used for all absences, including post-illness, absences, regardless of the reason or duration of the absence. Requests for excused absences from a required clerkship should be rare and made only in situations that cannot be rescheduled to occur during a scheduled time off or during an elective. An excused absence from a required clerkship may be allowed when it is determined by the Regional Campus Dean that the student has no alternative (additional information for 4thyear students can be found in the Fourth Year Scheduling Poli cies). Note: The Request for Absence is not approved until it is reviewed and approved by the Regional Campus Dean. The student may be required to make up any time missed. 28 The Regional Campus Dean, often after consulting with the Education Director a nd/or the Clerkship Director, will make the final decision regarding the student's request. The Regional Campus Dean or the Clerkship Director will give the student the implications for the absence (e.g., remediation, course grade adjustment, make-up exam, etc.). Final decisions regarding implications for the student's grade shall rest with the Education Director. The student will receive a response to the request automatically through the online system. Procedure for Request of Absence from Year 4 Electives If the student requests an absence in advance, the student should first discuss the request with the Regional Campus Dean. The online \"Request for Absence\" ( https://apps.med.fsu.edu/absence ) process for the Year 3/4 should be used for all absences, including post-illness, absences, regardless of the reason or duration of the absence. The \"Advance Request for Absence from Educational Activities\" process should be followed as outlined above under Year 3/4 Required Clerkships. The Regional Campus Dean, often after consultation with the Electives Director and/or the Clerkship Director, will make the final decision regarding the student's request. The Regional Campus Dean or the Clerkship Director will give the student the implications for the absence (e.g., remediation, course grade adjustment, make-up exam, etc.). Final decisions regarding implications for the student's grade shall rest with the Regional Campus Dean, who will notify the Electives Director of the decision. Here is how the online Request for Absence process works: Student discusses request with regional campus dean. Student completes online form: https://apps.med.fsu.edu/absence Students must include all the courses/activities they plan to miss on the requested day of absence (rotation, lecture, small groups, quiz, exam, OSCE, etc.) It is the student's responsibility to ensure the form is filled out completely. Once submitted, the form is routed to the Regional Campus Dean. The Regional Campus Dean will evaluate and determine if the reason for the absence meets the criteria for an excused absence. If necessary, the Regional Campus Dean will get input from the Clerkship Director or Education Director. If the absence is approved, the student and the appropriate faculty and support staff will be notified via e-mail. The faculty and staff are not given the reasons for the absence to protect potential confidential student information. If the ab sence is determined not to be an excused absence by the Regional Campus Dean, the student and the appropriate faculty and support staff will receive notification of the denial. Students can check on the status of the request by clicking on the \"Pending requests\" link at any time. D. Grading System FSU COM uses a P ass/Fail grading system which is used in the curriculum for the first and sec ond years. An Honors/Pass/Fail grading system is used for Years 3 and 4 required courses/clerkships and a uniform policy governing the assignment of grades is based on student performance on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject (shelf) examinations, internal exams, clerkship faculty assessments, and clerkship specific papers or projects. Definition of Grades Grade Definition Description Honors Exemplary The student consistently performs well above expectations. Competency proficiency is at a level worthy of a model student. 29 Pass Good Fail Failure The student performs below the minimal level of competency. The student must remediate or repeat the course. I Incomplete The student is unable to complete the block /clerkship requirements because of extenuating circumstances. The student will arrange with the block /education director to complete the requirements of the course. All incomplete coursework/clerkships must be c ompleted as directed by the block /education director and/or the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC). If an incomplete grade is not satisfactorily cleared, the grade will become a \"Fail\", placing the student on probation and in jeopardy of di smissal as explained in the section of this handbook entitled \"Academic Performance and Student Conduct.\" IR Incomplete for remediation The student fails to meet the level of competency required in the block /clerkship and must fulfill remediation requirements as established by the block /clerkship syllabus. The student must satisfactorily meet the competency level of the block or clerkship as established in the syllabus in the time frame established by the block /education director or the SEPC. If a student receives more than two (2) IR grades in the COM, the student is subject to dismissal. E. Grading Policy for First- and Second -Year Courses The FSU COM has adopted a pass/fail grading system, which is used in the curriculum for the first and second years. In addition, all first - and second- year courses use specifications grading to define satisfactory criteria for all course activities in addition to examinations. To achieve a grade of Pass in a course in the first or second year, a student must earn a minimum number of points as described in the specifications grading table in the course syllabus. In addition, a stude nt must meet all of the following requirements: A final average > 70% on all examinations and graded quizzes. An average below 70% will receive a grade of fail which will require remediation or repetition of the course, as determined by decision of the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. A student whose performance is <70% on any exam i s required to contact the course director in regards to meeting with them, to identify factors impeding performance, identify remediable items and finally to formul ate a plan to prevent future poor performance Attendance and satisfactory participation in all required sessions, as determined by the Block Director. Unexcused absence from an activity for which attendance is required (for example, Small Group session) may be considered as an issue of professionalism and require completion of the Performance Improvement Program. Satisfactory completion of all assignments, as determined by the Block Director. Demonstration of the attitudes and behaviors of Medical Professionalism in all aspects of the course /block. Issues of professionalism may require completion of the Performance Improvement Program. F. Grading Policy for Required Third Year and Fourth Year Required Clerkships GRADING COMPONENTS Assessment of Student by Clerkship Faculty Clerkship Faculty observe the student in the clinical setting and complete a summary assessment of the student's observed performance at the end of the clerkship. Clerkship Director's Summary 30 The Clerkship Director observes the student at regular meetin gs and discusses the student with the Clerkship Faculty, then completes a summary assessment of the student's performance at the end of the clerkship. Education Director's Summary The Education Director reviews the assessments by Clerkship Faculty and Clerkship Directors, reviews other materials used in grading and determines final clerkship grade. End of Clerkship Examination At the end of the clerkship, each student takes the respective NBME Clinical Subject Examination or the COM Geriatrics exam. T he NBME Clinical Subject Examination Norms for Examinee Performance tables available at the beginning of the academic year will be used throughout the entire academic year. All NBME percentile scores are determined and reported by the Office of Medical Education. The quartile used to calculate the percentile is determined by the total number of weeks the student has completed in all clerkships. Assessment of Course/Clerkship Specific Requirements The Clerkship Director is responsible for monitoring and r eporting, and the Education Director is responsible for confirming that each student completes all documentation requirements (i.e., patient encounters and educational activities entered into the Encounter Tracking System) for the clerkship. The syllabus will clearly identify: 1) all required projects and activities to be completed during the clerkship, and instructions for completion; and 2) deadlines for completion of projects and activities. In addition, guidance about how the projects or activities w ill be evaluated and how that evaluation will be used in calculating the student's grade will be available in the syllabus. The student will follow instructions in the syllabus regarding assignment submission and due dates. Some of the due dates may be early in the clerkship; some may be by the end of the clerkship. All assignments will be submitted through Student Academics. Students may also be required to submit assignments to the Education Director, the Clerkship Director and/or the Clinical Faculty. For assignments due by the end of the clerkship, the student will submit these by 5 p.m. on the last day of the Clerkship. At that time, all submissions are final. If the syllabus allows for feedback and revision of assignments, it must be done according to instructions in the syllabus and prior to uploading. If Student Academics is \"down\": The student may send an email to the Education Director with assignments attached as a \"back -up\" method in case of electronic upload issues. The student is still req uired to upload to Student Academics when the system is available, and assignments will not be accepted for credit until this has been accomplished. The version that is sent to the Education Director must be the same version that is submitted to Student Ac ademics, and must be sent by 5 p.m. on the last day of the Clerkship. Demonstration of Clerkship -Specific Competencies The clerkship syllabus will clearly identify: 1) the clerkship -specific competencies that students are expected to demonstrate; and, 2) who will determine whether the student has achieved the expected competency. CLERKSHIP AND COURSE GRADING CRITERIA FSU COM has established that students will receive a final grade of \"honors\" \"pass\" or \"fail\" for their performance on clerkships and courses and has adopted the following criteria for assigning grades. Note: When the term, \"end of the clerkship\" appears bel ow, that connotes 5:00 PM, local time, on the final day of the clerkship. Honors Criteria: A student will receive a grade of \"Honors\" if the Education Director determines that each of the following has been achieved during the clerkship: 31 1. Consistently demonstrates professional behavior throughout the clerkship; AND 2. Consistently demonstrates to the Clerkship Faculty exemplary clinical skills and content knowledge during the clerkship, OR, makes a substantial improvement to achieve exemplary clinical skills and content knowledge AND 3. Consistently demonstrates to the Clerkship Director exemplary c linical skills and content knowledge during the clerkship, OR, makes a substantial improvement to achieve exemplary clinical skills and content knowledge AND 4. Completes and submits all required clerkship projects and activities by the stated deadline, and achieves the performance expectations for \"honors\" stated in the syllabus; AND 5. Demonstrates all required clerkship -specific competencies; AND 6. Satisfactorily completes patient log expectations by the end of the clerkship; AND 7. Receives satisfactory patien t and staff evaluations; AND 8. Scores at or above the 75th percentile for NBME clinical subject exam reference scores obtained by students completing clerkships at a similar time in their clinical training; OR scores at 86% on the COM Geriatrics exam. Pass Criteria: A student will receive a grade of \"Pass\" if the Education Director determines that each of the following has been achieved during the clerkship: 1. Consistently demonstrates professional behavior throughout the clerkship; AND 2. Consistently demonstrates an acceptable level of clinical skills during the clerkship, OR , makes a substantial improvement in clinical skills to achieve an acceptable level during the clerkship; AND 3. Consistently demonstrates an acceptable level of content knowledge in the discipline during the clerkship, OR, makes a substantial improvement in content knowledge in the discipline to achieve an acceptable level during the clerkship; AND 4. Completes and submits all required clerkship projects and activities by the stated deadline, and achieves the performance expectations for \"pass\" stated in the syllabus; AND 5. Demonstrates all required clerkship -specific competencies; AND satisfactorily completes patient log expectations by the end of the clerkship; AND 6. Receiv es satisfactory patient and staff evaluations; AND 7. Scores at or above the 10th percentile for NBME clinical subject exam reference scores obtained by students completing clerkships at a similar time in their clinical training; OR scores at or above a 70% on the COM Geriatrics exam. Fail Criteria: A student is at risk to receive a grade of \"Fail\" if the Education Director determines that they: 1. Demonstrates a pattern of unprofessional behavior during the clerkship; OR 2. Demonstrates an unacceptable level (or fails to improve clinical skills to an acceptable level) of clinical skills by the end of the clerkship; OR 3. Demonstrates an unacceptable lev el (or fails to improve to a satisfactory level) of content knowledge by the end of the clerkship; OR 4. Fails to complete and submit all required clerkship projects and activities by the stated deadline OR demonstrates an unacceptable level of project performance; OR 5. Fails to achieve required clerkship -specific competencies; OR 6. Fails to complete patient log expectations by the end of the clerkship; OR 7. Receives unsatisfactory patient and staff evaluations; OR 8. Scores below the 10th percentile for NBME clin ical subject examination retake using reference scores obtained by students completing clerkships at a similar time in their clinical training; OR scores below 70% on retake of the COM Geriatrics exam. Students have the right to appeal a grade \"...when the student can show that the grade awarded represents a gross violation of the course/education director's own specified evaluation (grading) standards.\" Details on grade appeals are located in the 32 Student Handbook. Student behavior that is judged to be egregious or extremely unprofessional (examples: lying, cheating, repeated unexcused absences or tardiness, etc.) may result in the immediate dismissal of the student from the clerkship by the Education Director or Regional Campus Dean. Students dismissed fro m a clerkship will be referred to the Student Evaluation and Promotions Committee. Criteria for a Temporary Grade of \"IR\" 1. Failure of End of Clerkship Exam A student who fails the initial attempt at the NBME Clinical Subject Examination (CSE) or the COM Geriatrics Exam, but performs at the \"pass\" level in all other aspects of the clerkship, will receive an initial clerkship grade of \"IR\" (\"IR\"=Incomplete, pending Remediation). An \"IR\" grade may be assigned to students taking the CSE/clerkship for the first time or for students who are re-taking the clerkship because of a previous clerkship failure. Exam retakes should occur within 90 days from the last day of the clerkship. The regional campus dean may extend the retake of the exam an additional 30 days based on extenuating circumstances. If the exam retake is not completed by 120 days from the last day of the clerkship, the IR grade is changed to a \"fail,\" unless an extension is approved by the Student Evaluation and Promotions Committee prior to the end of the 120 day window. The student will be given one opportunity to retake the CSE to achieve a passing score. The exact date of the retake is determined by the student and the Regional Campus Dean, after determining that the resources needed to administer the CSE exam are available. If a passing score is achieved on the retake examination (or alternative, such as an oral exam), the initial \"IR\" grade will be changed to a grade of \"Pass.\" A student who fails the initial exam cannot achieve an \"Honors\" grade regardless of the score on the retake exam. If a student does not pass the retake examination, the original \"IR\" grade will be changed to a grade of \"Fail.\" 2. Failure to Successfully Complete Clerkship Requirements by the End of the Clerkship Students are expected to achieve all clerkship objectives and competencies by the end of the clerkship. The Clerkship Director and the Education Director will monitor and affirm that clerkship objectives and clerkship competencies have been achieved. In certain situations, a student may achieve most, but not all of the expected objectives and competencies. If, in the opinion of the Education Director, the student performa nce in all other areas of the clerkship has been satisfactory and the student may reasonably be able to complete the remaining objectives/competencies soon after the end of the clerkship, the Education Director may assign an initial clerkship grade of \"IR\" to the student in lieu of assigning a grade of \"Fail.\" Examples of these situations include, but are not limited to: 1) A student who is unable to satisfactorily complete and turn in a required assignment by the deadline as outlined in the syllabus; 2) A student who does not complete patient log expectations by the end of the clerkship; or 3) A student with a recognized clinical deficit that can be quickly remediated. Students who receive an initial clerkship grade of \"IR\" for these non- exam performance reasons should be notified immediately by the Education Director, who will also report this action to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC). The Education Director will determine what is necessary to satisfactorily complete clerkship obje ctives and competencies, and the timeframe for completing them, usually, within one week. The Education Director will work with the Clerkship Director and the Regional Campus Dean to implement this remediation. Remediation of this \"IR\" grade must be completed by an agreed-upon date, usually within one week. The initial \"IR\" grade will be changed to a grade of \"Pass\" if successful remediation occurs by the agreed -upon date. A student who receives an initial \"IR\" grade cannot achieve an \"Honors\" grade regar dless of their NBME clinical subject examination scores or clinical evaluation from the Clerkship Faculty. The original \"IR\" grade will be changed to a grade of \"Fail\" if a student does not successfully remediate the clerkship objectives/competencies by the agreed upon date. 33 Grades in Situations Due to Circumstances beyond Student Control Students who do not complete all clerkship objectives/competencies due to an inability to participate in clerkship activities because of illness, injury, family emergencies, natural disasters, etc., will be given an initial grade of \"I.\" When clerkship deficiencies have been resolved and all clerkship objectives/competencies completed, this initial \"I\" grade may be changed to an \"Honors,\" \"Pass,\" or \"Fail\" grade. In order to comply with LCME standards for grade reporting, students must be assigned a clerkship grade within 6 weeks from the end of the clerkship. On rare occasion, a key assessment of student performance (Clerkship Faculty assessment of student, NBME clinical subject exam result, etc.) may not be available by the 6 week deadline. In that situation, the student will be given an initial grade of \"I.\" When all key assessments are available, this initial \"I\" grade may be changed to an \"Honors,\" \"Pass,\" or \"Fail\" grade. Additional Designation of \"Pass with Clinical Excellence\" A student who does not achieve an \"Honors\" grade on any M3 core clerkship, but scores between the 30th and the 74th percentile on the initial NBME clinical subject exam while meeting all other grading criteria for \"Honors\" consideration, AND is judged by the Clerkship Faculty and Clerkship Director to demonstrate a consistently exemplar level of clinical skills performance may, at the discretion of the Education Director, be awarded the additional designation of \"Pass with Clinical Excellence.\" G. Grading Policy for Year 3 and 4 Electives : ELECTIVE COURSES Year 4 elective courses will be graded as Honors/Pass/Fail. Year 3 flextime elective courses will be graded Pass/Fail. Students taking elective courses will be evaluated using the \"Elective Faculty of Student\" form. All grades for elective courses during the third and fourth year will be assigned by the Regional Campus Dean applying these guidelines: Honors Criteria The student will receive a grade of \"Honors\" when: 1. The student is rated at the 3 level in both Knowledge AND Professionalism; AND 2. The student receives more ratings of 3 than 2; AND 3. The student receives no rating less than 2. Pass Criteria The student will receive a grade of \"Pass\" when the ratings fall in between the guidelines for \"Honors\" and \"Fail.\" For external electives and externships, the \"Externship Elective of Student\" form or the form from the away institution will be used. The same grading guidelines will be applied for either document. The Regional Campus Dean will also take the evaluator's narrative comments into consideration when assigning the final grade. If compelling, these comments can move a grade up or down one level. Fail Criteria The student will receive a grad of \"Fail\" when: 1. The student receives a rating of 1 in Professionalism; OR 2. The student receives a rating of 1 in more than two categories. H. Remediation Policy for Excused Absences from Examinations, Quizzes, Small Group Sessions, Laboratory Sessions, Clinical Learning Center Sessions, Preceptor Visits, and Clerkship Call The remediation policies for absences from examinations, quizzes, small group sessions, and clerkship call are: 1. POLICY ON MISSED EXAMINATIONS: 34 Students are required to take major in -term and final examinations. Based on Curriculum Committee policy, a student can only be excused from an examination by a block/education director decision based on the approva l of an excused absence. The Office of Medical Education and/or the block /Education Director will determine the time of the exam make-up session. In accord ance with the FSU COM honor code, the student will be given the same examination given to the other students. 2. POLICY ON MISSED QUIZZES: Students are required to take scheduled and unscheduled quizzes in the blocks /clerkships. A student can only be excused fr om a required quiz by a Block /Education Director decision based on the attainment of an excused absence. The student must make arrangements with the Block /Education Director to make up a missed quiz. In accordance with the FSU COM honor code, the student will be given the same quiz given to the other students. 3. POLICY ON MISSED SMALL GROUP SESSIONS, PRECEPTOR VISITS, AND CLERKSHIP CALL: The student should contact the Block Director, small group leader, Clerkship Director or Education Director for instructions on remediation of the missed session and material covered. Students are responsible for the material covered but may not have the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the missed activity. I. Unexcused Absences It is the responsibility of the block /education directors to clearly state in their respective block /clerkship syllabi the implications for having an un -excused absence from a scheduled educational or examination activity in a block or clerkship. J. Recording of Educational Materials and Copyright Notice Portions of the curriculum, at the discretion of the individual faculty member, may be recorded . Such lecture recordings will be maintained and distributed through MEDnet . Because of patient confidentiality and copyright issues, there will be times when recording is not allowed. The recordings and their distribution must be in accordance with U.S. Copyright laws, i.e., the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, including the TEACH Act. Students are responsible for understanding and complying with ethic al and legal restrictions on downloading and sending copyrighted information. Students should familiarize themselves with the following information for any digitally recorded or distributed material including recorded lectures: \"Copyright Notice: This co urse website may contain copyrighted materials that are used in compliance with U.S. Copyright Law, which provides that copyrighted materials may not be retained, saved to your computer, revised, copied, or distributed without permission.

For more information, see the FSU Copyright Guidelines located at http://igs.fsu.edu/Copyright-Information/Guidelines and http://guides.lib.fsu.edu/content.php?pid=73946&sid=625250 .\" K. P olicies and Guidelines for Pharmaceutical/ Vendor Interactions Purpose of Policy The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines to ensure that patient care and medical education are not influenced by considerations other than what is in the best interests of patients and/or trainees. Statement of Policy 35 It is the policy of the FSU COM that pharmaceutical/industry access to students, faculty, and residents, is prohibited on FSU COM property, including regional campuses. However, discussion with representatives for the purpose of obtaining unrestricted educational grants is al lowed. This policy applies to all FSU COM full -time faculty and part -time faculty (clerkship directors, clerkship faculty, elective faculty) when performing their duties on FSU COM property. Scope of Policy 1. Accepting Offers Gifts Individuals subject to this policy (faculty, residents, students, and staff) may not solicit or accept any gifts from pharmaceutical company/industry representatives. Additionally, the use of any vendor's material with the vendor's name or logo is strongly discouraged in publ ic or patient care areas. Food The direct provision of any meals, desserts, etc. by pharmaceutical/industry representatives on FSU COM property is prohibited. This includes the provision of meals during any organized, scheduled educational activity (e.g., grand rounds, journal club, fac ulty development, etc.) or reception. Industry representatives who wish to provide support to the FSU COM may, however, do so in the form of an unrestricted educational grant to the FSU COM. Such grants are expended for food solely at the discretion of COM departments/divisions/regional campuses/residency programs. Entertainment Faculty members, residents, students, or employees of the FSU COM participating in social events, including meals, funded directly by pharmaceutical company/industry may not use their official status as FSU employees or students. Moreover, faculty and employees of the FSU COM may not accept the use of supplier/vendor property, airplane transportation, travel packages, or similar favors from industry as FSU employees. Compensat ion Full time faculty or employees may not accept gifts or compensation for listening to a sales talk by an industry representative, including the defraying of costs for simply attending a CME or other activity or conference. Honoraria provided directly b y pharmaceutical/other industry are not allowed if faculty or employment status with the FSU COM is acknowledged. 2. Site Access Pharmaceutical/Industry Representatives are not allowed access to faculty, students, residents or staff on FSU COM property, including its regional campuses, except for the purpose of discussing/providing unrestricted educational grants. 3. Educational Fund s Industry representatives may provide support for medical educational purposes in the form of unrestricted educational grants. Initial contact with industry representatives for the purpose of discussing or obtaining unrestricted educational grants is pe rmitted. 4. Scholarships / Educational Grants No educational grant, financial award, donation, or expense reimbursement may be given directly to a resident or medical student by an industry representative. Any educational grant must be provided to the College of Medicine. Faculty and staff who are invited to present or lead conferences or meetings funded directly by pharmaceutical/other industry may not acknowledge their faculty status as part of the program. Note: These provisions do not apply to meetings of professional societies that may receive partial industry support, i. e., meetings governed by ACCME Standards. 36 5. Disclosure of Relationships with Industry All College, Program and Sponsoring Institution -sponsored medical education events must include full and appropriate disclosure of sponsorship and financial interests above and beyond those already governed by the Standards for Commercial Support promulgated by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Educati on. Department Chairs, Program Directors and Faculty should disclose any financial relationships with Industry, including but not limited to ownership of practice and hospital sites at the time of appointment to these positions, annually through the FSU COM Personnel Office, and as actual, potential, or the appearance of Conflicts of Interest arise. Faculty with supervisory responsibilities for students, residents and/or staff should ensure that the faculty's conflict or potential conflict of interest does not affect or appear to affect his or her supervision of the student, resident or staff member. Individuals having a direct role making institutional decisions on equipment or drug procurement must disclose to the FSU COM Administration / Personnel Office, prior to making any such decision, any financial interest they or their immediate family have in companies that might substantially benefit from the decision. Such financial interests could include equity ownership, compensated positions on advisory boards, a paid consultancy, or other forms of compensated relationship. They must also disclose any research or educational interest they or their department have that might substantially benefit from the decision. The administration will decide whether the individual must remove him/herself from the purchasing decision. Note: This provision excludes indirect ownership, such as stock held through mutual funds. 6. Training/Communication Regarding Potential Conflicts of Interest All faculty, attendings, residents, students and applicable staff shall be provided with information regarding potential conflicts of interest in interac tions with industry to include: a. A copy of these gui delines on vendor interactions. b. Copies of the e thics st atements of pertinent medical specialt y societies and how to apply those guidelines to practice. c. Seminars and/or faculty d evelopment sessions describing: How activities can influence judgment in prescribing decisions and research activities. How to manage encounters with Industry representatives. How to handle patient requests for medication, particularly regarding direct -to-consumer advertising of drugs. The purpose, development, and application of drug formularies and clinical guidelines and discussing such issues as branding, generic drugs, off -label use, and use of free samples. 7. Procedure, Monitoring, and Responsibility We want to ensure patients, students and residents know we are focusing on their welfare, not on any commercial interest and eli minate the appearance of industry's inappropriate influence over the medical community. Therefore, all FSU COM faculty, students, residents and staff will be given a copy of this Policy and Guidelines document. The Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC) must ensure that the Sponsoring Institution monitors vendor interactions with residents and GME programs. FSU COM administration, department heads, division heads, campus deans, program directors, etc. are re sponsible for compliance with this policy and for ensuring the personnel under their supervision understand and comply with this policy. If FSU COM faculty and/or staff have any questions concerning the interpretation of this policy and guidelines, or its applicability to a particular circumstance, they should first consult with their supervisor. If their supervisor is unable to answer the question or provide appropriate guidance, or if, because of the circumstances, it would be inappropriate to discuss the matter with the supervisor, then the personnel and/or staff member should contact the FSU COM Sr. Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affair's office. If any FSU COM personnel and/or staff member is aware of any violation or threatened or po tential violation of this policy, or suspects that a violation of this policy has occurred, they must also refer to the FSU COM Sr. Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affair's office. 37 8. Exceptions a. This policy does not apply to part- time fa culty (clerkship directors and clerkship faculty) engaged in their roles at venues other than FSU COM property; i.e., private offices, hospitals or other sites. b. This policy does not include faculty research and related activities, which are included in the Florida State University Faculty Policies and Procedures for Dealing with Misconduct in Research and Creative Activity (http://facultyhandbook.fsu.edu/Handbook- Sections/Section -6-Policies -and-Procedures). Individuals should contact the FSU COM Office of Research (http://med.fsu.edu/?page=researchDivision.home ) with regard to publishing articles under their name and FSU COM title, in disclosing their related financial interests e tc. 9. Pertinent Definitions Attending: The faculty member with primary responsibility for the care of a patient and/or the education of a student or resident in a particular case. Conflicts of Interest: Any situation in which an individual is in a position to exploit his/her professional or official capacity in some way for personal benefit. Faculty: Physicians/Professors who possess the requisite expertise, documented educational and administrative abilities, and experience to teach residents and students. Meetings: Any gathering on FSU COM property involving FSU COM personnel. Such gatherings would include but not be limited to faculty development meetings, resident or student meetings, grand rounds, departmental, divisional or regional campus meetings. Personnel: Faculty, staff, residents, and medical students of the FSU COM. Representative: Includes any individual who is employed by or who represents any entity defined under 'Vendor/Industry'. Sponsorship: Vendor/Supplier funding Unrestricted E ducational Grants: It is recommended that industry representatives provide financial support for FSU COM events directly to the COM in the form of an unrestricted educational grant to then be spent by the COM departments/divisions/regional campuses/residen cy programs for educational activities at their discretion. Appropriate recognition of the industry representative's contribution should be given by the department/division/regional campus/residency program. Educational grants must not be made, conditioned , or related in any way to pre-existing or future business relationships with Industry. Vendors should separate their grant making functions from their sales and marketing functions. Accordingly, if vendor or patient- service representatives or other corporate representatives wish to discuss a corporate contribution of cash, equipment, supplies, or services, the employee should immediately notify the Dean or the Sr. Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. This individual, or a designee, should then become the principal point of contact with the vendor. Vendor/Industry: Includes those businesses, corporations, or entities that supply or wish to supply equipment, goods, services, or other medical related products to physicians, administrators, students, residents, staff or hospitals. L. E- mail Content and Signature Pol icy Purpose This document provides guidelines for email usage for students, faculty and staff at the College of Medicine. One should be aware that one's email account is for university and College of Medicine purposes. The two important things to remember are that email should not be used for personal purposes, and because we are a publi c institution, all emails are public record. Official FSU Email Policy FSU has a policy, http://policies.vpfa.fsu.edu/policies-and-procedures/technology/electronic- mail-policy , concerning email and other electronic communications. The College of Medicine is bound by all of these rules and regulations. The policy describes a number of activities, such as using email for advertisements for personal gain and political campaign messages that should be avoided. Sending Emails 38 Email is a way to communicate with another person or persons. One should first consider whether this is the best way of communicating. Sometimes a text or phone call is much more appropriate. At other times use of social media, a calendar notice, a blog, a wiki, Skype or simply a face- to-face discussion may be more appropriate. Choose carefully. If one chooses to us e email, then remember that communications that are short and to the point are much more effective. Signature Block It helps to include a signature block contain ing information about who you are and how you can be contacted. The block should be short, concise and easy to read. Considering many e- mails within our environment are public records, users are strongly encouraged to use the following statement as a footer: \"Please note: Florida has very broad public records laws. Most written communications t o or from state/university employees and students are public records and available to the public and media upon request. Your e- mail communications may therefore be subject to public disclosure.\" Distribution Lists The College of Medicine (CoM) maintains over 400 distribution lists (DL) to make communication easier for students, faculty and staff. Many of the DLs have wide audience scope and reach, so care should be exercised before using a DL. None of us enjoy being inundated with emails that are not germane to our business solely because we are a member of a DL that was included on the To or CC line. Confidential Information Remember that emails should not be used to discuss confidential information. First, such discussions may be explicitl y prohibited by HIPPA (patient rights) or FERPA (student rights). Second, all emails are public record. Replying - Reply All or Reply? Be careful to Reply All only when everyone needs to know your response. This is particularly true for listserv inquiries and an announcement to a DL group. If the answer or response is to just one person, then reply to that individual only. This prevents a ll the other members of the group from, for example, receiving congratulations for that person's award. Never Provide Account, Password or Other Confidential Information A typical spam that one may receive might indicate that the recipient will have her /his rights or privileges revoked unless she/he responds immediately by giving the sender account, password or other confidential information. Do not respond to any such request. Instead, please open a new email message window, 'drag and drop' the offensive email message into the new message (so it creates an attachment) and send to abuse@fsu.edu . Block Spam and Junk Email Most spam and junk email is caught by the university's filters. If, however, you are receiving emails from someone that you would rather block individually, use the Blacklist, Quarantine and Whitelist subfolders in the Spam folder in your Mailbox. Suspicious emails should be attached to a new message and sent to abuse@fsu.edu . 39 VII. ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND STUDENT CONDUCT A. Standards of Academic Performance All admitted students are subjected to review procedures by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) of the Florida State University C ollege of Medicine. The Student Evaluation & Promotion Committee makes recommendations regarding the standards and procedures for student evaluation, advancement, graduation, and disciplinary action. Upon approval by the Dean, the standards and procedures are included in the student handbook. This committee verifies individuals in each class for promotion and graduation by review of each student's academic performance. The Committee has regularly scheduled meetings at the end of each grading period and monthly meetings as needed. Each student is reviewed individually by the Committee. A student in the College of Medicine will be placed on Academic Probation for one of the following academic situations: A final grade other than honors or pass in any block or clerkship. Displaying behavior that is unacceptable or unprofessional, and fails to meet the level of professionalism reasonably expected of medical students and future physicians, provided that some behaviors may be so egregious as to justify immediate dismissal of a medical student. While on probation, the student must carry a normal course load and must pass all blocks /clerkships each semester. The SEPC may, at its discretion, require an adjustment of academic load, repetition, dismissal or other change of status for any of the following academic situations: Failure to pass all blocks /clerkships while on probation. Two or more failures in required blocks /clerkships. Two or more IR's in the COM's curriculum. Displaying behavior that is unacceptable or unprofessional, and fails to meet the level of professionalism reasonably expected of medical students and future physicians. B. Grade Appeals The purpose of the grade appeals system is t o afford an opportunity for a medical student to appeal a final block/clerkship grade under certain circumstances. Faculty judgment of students' academic performance is inherent in the grading process and hence should not be overturned except when the student can show that the grade awarded represents a gross violation of the block/clerkship director's own specified evaluation (grading) standards. The system is not a basis for appeal of the block/education director's grading standards, nor does it cover situations in which the judgment of the course /clerkship director is questioned as to a borderline grade decision. The evaluation (grading) standards utilized during the grade appea ls process is the one contained in the course/block/education director's syl labus at the beginning of the semester. Procedure: To appeal a final grade that the student believes was inequitably awarded on the basis of the course/block/education director's own specified grading standards, a student must observe the following pro cedures: Step 1: Within 5 calendar days following the date that final grades are made available to students, the student must do both of the following: a. contact the course/ block/education director in question to discuss the grade and attempt to resolve any differences (If the fifth calendar day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or university holiday, the student may utilize the next non- weekend or non- holiday week day to comply with this time f rame) . b. submit a written appeal to the course/ block/education director within the prescribed five days which must contain the facts and circumstances on which the student's claim is based. The student should document any attempts to contact the course/ block/education director in order to establish that the appeal was begun within the 5-day period. 40 In the event that the course/ block/education director is not available, the student should provide that documentation to the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. It is expected that the student will first attempt to resolve the grade dispute with the course /block/education director; however, both the student and the course/block/education director may consult with other appropriate i ndividuals during this process. Step 2 - If no resolution is reached with the course/block/education director within the 5 -day period in Step 1, after the student's documented attempt, the student has an additional 5 calendar days to: 1. Submit a written statement of appeal to the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. This statement must include an account of attempts to resolve the issue, as well as the evidence that forms the basis for the appeal. 2. Within 5 ca lendar days after receipt of the appeals statement by the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs, she/he will select and arrange for a meeting of a grade appeals board. This board is composed of three faculty members and two stude nts. The purpose of this board is to determine whether or not to uphold the final grade assigned by the course/block/education director. The board will consider only the evidence provided by the student and the course/block/education director in making the determination. Both the student and the course/block/education director may attend the meeting. 3. The grade will be upheld unless the evidence shows that the grade was inequitably awarded as a result of a gross violation of the course/block/education direc tor's own specified grading standards. 4. If the original grade is not upheld, based on a majority decision by the board, the board will recommend that an alternative grade be assigned by the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. Step 3 - At the conclusion of its meeting, the grade appeal board shall furnish a written report of its decision to the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. Step 4 - The Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs will make a final decision based on the information provided by the grade appeal board in Step 4 and will send written documentation of the decision to the student, the course/block/education director, the grade appeal board and the Dean of the College of Medicine. Administration of the Grade Appeals Process a. Student members of a grade appeal board will be appointed by the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs from nominees selected by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. b. The Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs will designate a chairperson of each grade appeals board. c. The Senior Associate Dean for Medical Educatio n and Academic Affairs' office will furnish notice to the student and to the course/block/education director of the appointment of a grade appeal board. d. The Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs' office will arrange a meeting tim e and place and furnish notice to both parties. e. Both parties may appear at the beginning upon request to be heard. Copies of material furnished to a board by either the student or the course/block/education director should, whenever practical, be furnishe d to the other party. The Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affair's office will provide staff assistance to the Board. If the student has evidence that this grade appeals process has deviated substantially from these established procedures, resulting in a biased decision, the student may consult with the Dean of the College of Medicine. C. Academic Probation Probation signifies unsatisfactory progress through the academic program and may be a precursor to dismissal. Probation is intended to serve as an official notification to the student so that adjustments, intervention, or remediation can take place to ensure the student's success in medical school. At the discretion of the SEPC, students on probation may be excluded from holding office or attending conferences as part of a student group. 41 Students, upon the recommendation of the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee, may be allowed to repeat an academic year once. Any student who is repeating a portion of an academic year will remain on probation until that part of the curriculum is successfully remediated at the discretion of the SEPC. Any student repeating an entire academic year will remain on probation for the entire duration o f that academic year. Each student is expected to continue the positive emotional growth, motivation, personal attributes, interpersonal relations, and professionalism that are so important to the art of medical practice. Serious emotional, personal or l egal problems that occur after the student has been selected and which affect eventual licensure and physician practice also fall under the purview of the SEPC. A report of any of these behaviors will be investigated by the SEPC, and if there is evidence to warrant further action, dependent upon the nature and consequences of the behavior, the SEPC may take action that can include, but not be limited to, issuing a letter of concern to the student, placing the student on terms of probation, referring the stu dent for professional counseling, or dismissing the student. Expectations of student professionalism include the following: 1. Demonstrate knowledge of the Honor Code and Code of Conduct as outlined in the Student Handbook. 2. Demonstrate the ability to conduct oneself in accordance with the standards of the College of Medicine, including: a. appropriate interaction with faculty, staff, physicians, students and patients encountered while performing responsibilities, and b. compliance with expectations for completing ta sks in a timely manner. 3. Demonstrate professional identity and investment in professional development, including: a. demonstration of the understanding and acceptance of the roles and responsibilities of being a medical student b. demonstrating the ability to acc urately assess and monitor one's professional functioning c. showing initiative in pursuing training experiences that will expand or enhance one's professional development d. formulation of appropriate professional goals for oneself e. demonstrating receptivity to learning in one's supervisory and training experiences Any student may be denied permission to continue in the College of Medicine if, in the majority opinion of the SEPC, the student's character or mental fitness cast grave doubts upon his/her potential capabilities as a physician. D. Promotion and Graduation Requirements At the end of each academic year , the SEPC will review each student for promotion. Promotion to Second Year Promotion to the second year at t he Florida State University College of Medicine depends on successful completion of the Year 1 curriculum and the student's remaining in good academic standing. Promotion to Third Year Promotion to the third year depends on the successful completion with passing grade s in all courses of the Year 2 curriculum, receiving a passing score on the USMLE Step 1 Exam and the student's remaining in good academic standing. Students with unusual circumstances that prevent them from taking USMLE Step 1 by Pre-Clerkship Bootcamp, as soon as possible, petition in writing to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the S enior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs will review the request and make a determination. If the decision is made not to allow the student to delay taking the exam, the student may appeal that decision to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Promotion to Fourth Year Promotion to the fourth year depends on the successful completion (pass or above) of all clerkship rotations and the student's remaining in good academic standing. Graduation The SEPC will review the academic record of all fourth year students in the spring of the fourth year. Students who have successfully completed all required coursework and clerkships in years 1 -4, including a minimum of 16 weeks 42 of electives in Year 4; passed the USMLE Step 1, Step 2 CK and Step 2 CS; passed the OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) at the end of the third year clerkship rotations (graduation OSCE); completed all required procedures directed by the curriculum; completed all required surveys and who are students in good standing will be recommended as candidates for the MD degree. The Executive Committee certifies graduates for the MD degree. E. Policy on the United States Medical Licensing Exams (USMLE) Policy: In order to graduate from the FSU College of Medicine, students must pass the USMLE Step 1 , USMLE Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) and USMLE Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills) exams. 1. USMLE Step 1 Requireme nts: Students must be enrolled in the FSU COM in order to register for and take the USMLE Step 1. All FSU COM students are required to PASS USMLE Step 1 to be approved for graduation. Students are required to take and pass USMLE Step 1 prior to beginning their third year clerkships. Registration Deadlines and Testing Dates for USMLE Step 1 Second year students are required to complete applications for USMLE Step 1 in sufficient time to request test dates before Pre -Clerkship Bootcamp (specific final date to be set by the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs at the beginning of students' second year) in order to maximize the ava ilability of scores before or as soon after the beginning of third year clinical clerkships, based on NBME's (National Board of Medical Examiners) score release date. Students with unusual circumstances that prevent them from taking USMLE Step 1 before Pre -Clerkship Bootcamp must, as soon as possible, petition in writing to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs will review the request and make a determination. If the decision is made not to allow the student to delay taking the exam, the student may appeal that decision to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Students who do not adhere to this registration deadline requirement are at risk of jeopardizing their status as a student in good standing and may delay the start of their 3 rd year clerkships. USMLE Step 1 Delay Pol icy In an attempt to determine which students might be at risk for failing the USMLE Step 1 exam, data will be gathered and tracked by the Office of Medical Education. This data consists of elements of admission information, course performance and previously taken standardize d exams such as the MCAT, block customized NBME tests and CBSE and Firecracker half Step 1 exam data. This data will be reviewed on a continual basis to identify students as early as possible. In the middle and near the end of the first academic year, the Director of Clinical Foundations and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs will meet to review all students and identify students who might be at risk based on predictive variables and marginal performances. These students will be met with and directed early to academic support services with the intention of addressing academic weaknesses and starting Step 1 preparation planning early. Students identified will be advised to seek academic counseling from the various academic support services available as well as commercial courses available. Students may be further identified in the second year. At the beginning of the Spring semester of the second year, the identified at -risk students will be contacted to ensure that they are appropriately planning and 43 preparing for Step 1. At -risk students will be expected to submit all scores of practice exams and question bank data to the Director of Clinical Foundations. In the mid- point of the student's independent study, each identified student will meet with th e Director of Clinical Foundations and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs to determine their progress and decide if a delay in taking the Step 1 is needed. 2. USMLE Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) Requirements : Students must be en rolled in the FSU College of Medicine and have been promoted to the 4th year in order to register for and take USMLE Step 2 CK . All FSU COM students are required to pass USMLE Step 2 CK to be approved for graduation. Registration Deadlines and Testing Dates for USMLE Step 2 CK Students are required to complete applications for USMLE Step 2 CK in sufficient time to request test dates on or before Dec. 31st of the M4 year or the year prior to graduation. This allows those who do not pass on the first attempt to retake USMLE Step 2 CK and receive results before graduation. Students with unusual circumstances that prevent them from taking USMLE Step 2 CK by December 31st of the M4 year or the year prior to graduation must, as soon as possible, petition in writing to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs will review the request and make a determination. If the decision is made not to allow the student to delay taking the exam, the student may appeal that decision to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Failure to adhere to this deadline may result in a student's (1) inability to apply for and/or be successful in the National Resident Matching Program (the \"Match\"), (2) inability to graduate on time or (3) risking cancellation of a residency contract. In addition, a student's failure to take USMLE Step 2 CK before Dec. 31st may negatively impact a student's status of good standing in the COM. 3. USMLE Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills) Requirements Students must be enrolled in the FSU College of Medicine and have been promoted to the 4th year and have passed the COM end -of-third -year OSCE in order to register for and take USMLE Step 2 CS. All FSU COM students are required to pass USMLE Step 2 CS to be approved for graduation. Registration Deadlines and Testing Dates for USMLE Step 2 CS Students are requir ed to complete applications for USMLE Step 2 CS in sufficient time to request test dates on or before October 31 st of the M4 year the planned year of graduation. This allows those who do not pass on the first attempt to retake USMLE Step 2 CS before gradua tion. Because of the timing of reporting of USMLE Step 2 CS scores by the NBME, students who do not pass the exam on the first attempt are at risk of not having scores reported in time for on- time graduation. Students with unusual circumstances that prev ent them from taking the USMLE Step 2 CS by October 31 st must, as soon as possible, petition in writing to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. The Associate Dean for Student Affa irs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs will review the request and make a determination. If the decision is made not to allow the student to delay taking the exam, the student may appeal that decision to the Student E valuation and Promotion Committee. 44 Failure to adhere to this deadline may result in a student's (1) inability to be successful in the National Resident Matching Program (the \"Match\"), (2) inability to graduate on time or (3) risking cancellation of a residency contract. In addition, a student's failure to take USMLE Step 2 CS before October 31 st may negatively impact a student's status of good standing in the COM. 4. Off Cycle Registration Deadlines and Testing Dates for Students in Academic Difficulty or Unsuccessful on first attempts of USMLE Step 1 , USMLE Step 2 CK or USMLE Step 2 CS Exceptions to the implementation timelines in this policy mu st be addressed in writing to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. Students must meet with the Senior Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Regional Campus Dean to discuss adjustin g test dates. The Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee may prescribe changes in the schedule of any student in academic difficulty. Academic performance of students unsuccessful in passing USMLE Step 1 , USMLE Step 2 CK or USMLE Step 2 CS will be reviewed by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Based upon this review, the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee may prescribe changes in the schedule o f any student failing the USMLE Step 1, Step 2 CK, or Step 2 CS exams, including, but not limited to: individualized courses/electives that address areas of academic weakness; close supervision by assigned basic science/clerkship faculty and counselors; and board review sessions and/or commercial programs. In addition, the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee may recommend other appropriate action, which may include, but not be limited to: Probation, Leave of Absence until a passing grade is achieved or Dismissal from the College of Medicine. However, students must complete the COM curriculum within a maximum enrollment of six years. F. Standards of Conduct Students enjoy the rights and privileges that accrue to membe rship in a university community and are subject to the responsibilities that accompany that membership. In order to have a system of effective campus governance, it is incumbent upon all members of the campus community to notify appropriate officials of any violations of regulations and to assist in their enforcement. All conduct regulations of the university are printed and made available to all students. Students are subject to the rules and regulations published in the Florida State University Student Conduct Code, the Graduate Bulletin (https://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/graduate/information/integrity/ ) and in the College of Medicine Student Handbook. G. Appeals of the Actions of the Student Evaluation and Promotions Committee (SEPC): A committee recommendation for repetition of a full academic year, probation or dismissal action is subject to appeal. Other recommendations, including but not limited to, repetition of course work, course alteration or for special required work are not subject to appeal. Any medical student who is dissatisfied with a decision of repetition of a full academic year, probation or dismissal from the College of Medicine may appeal that decision in the following sequence: a. Appeal in writing and/or in person to the Dean of the College of Medicine. Written intent to appeal to the Dean must be submitted to the Dean and copied to the Chai r of the SEPC and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs within one working week after receiving written notification of the SEPC's decision. b. Within one working week of receiving an appeal notification to hear the student's appeal, the Dean will appoint a Special Committee consisting of three College of Medicine faculty members who have not previously been involved in the dismissal process for that student. The purpose of the Special Committee is to ensure that the student's due process rights have not been violated and that the decision of the SEPC is consistent with the policies and procedures of the College of Medicine. c. The Special Committee must meet and make a recommendation to the Dean within one working week upon receiving the charge from the Dean to consider the appeal. The Dean then makes the final decision to grant or deny the appeal based upon the recommendation of the Special Committee. 45 d. The decision of the Dean in all appeals is final unless the President of the University or the President's desi gnee agrees to hear a further appeal. The student must notify the Dean and submit the appeal to the President's Office within one working week after receiving notification of denial of appeal from the Dean of the College of Medicine. The student whose status is under appeal will be allowed to remain enrolled until the appeals process is exhausted. The student's coursework or ability to participate in clinical activities may be altered pending the appeals process. H. Leave -of-Absence Students may request or may be placed on a leave-of- absence. The three types of leave-of- absence are personal, educational/research and the USMLE leave- of-absence. In all cases, the leave-of- absence is for less than one year. A personal leave -of-ab sence may be requested for personal, academic, or health- related issues or as a short -term intervention to allow time to manage an issue of concern. A student requesting a personal leave-of- absence must submit a letter outlining the reasons for the request to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and to the chair of the SEPC. A personal leave-of- absence may be required by the SEPC without prompt by the student request. An educational/research leave-of- absence may be granted upon the recommendation of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs. The student must obtain a letter recommending the student for educational/research leave from the student's advisor in years 1 or 2 or from the Regional Campus Dean in years 3 or 4 and submit this letter along with the student's letter of request for an educational/research leave of absence. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Regional Campus D eans will monitor the student's time spent in the educational/research activities and notify the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee when the student will return to registered student status with the College of Medicine. Students who do not pass the USMLE Step 1 examination may be placed on a Directed Independent Study (DIS) or leave- of-absence by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. Students will be reinstated upon successful completion of the exam ination. Total time spent as a non -registered student on leave-of- absence may not exceed one year. Students who are not registered are prohibited from taking part in the College of Medicine's formal educational programs, including classroom, laboratory, and clinical work. A student wishing to extend a leave-of-absence beyond the one-year limit must appeal to the Evaluation and Promotion Committee in writing outlining the reasons for requesting the extension and presenting a time- line for ending the leave -of- absence. I. Withdrawal Students who are unable to complete required courses, blocks or clerksh ips due to illness, hardship, or special circumstances must contact the Offices of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs and Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The student requesting a temporary withdrawal must submit a let ter outlining the reasons for the request to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs if the withdrawal will be for less than six weeks. If the withdrawal will be for a longer period of time, the student must request a leave-of- absence from the SEPC. The College of Medicine uses the University policy and schedule for refunds. If a student voluntarily withdraws from the College of Medicine, the student must make application to the Admissions Committee as a new student to be considered for readmission. J. Ch emical Dependency The College of Medicine has adopted the following policy regarding chemical dependency in medical schools: Definition: For medical students, impairment is defined as recurring problems associ ated with alcohol or drug abuse. The problems may occur in any of several domains, including interpersonal (family or other relationships), 46 educational, legal, financial, or medical. Examples include the range of behaviors from absences from class, clini cal clerkships, or electives; repeated lateness in the initiation or completion of assigned responsibilities; binge drinking; violence while under the influence of chemicals; traffic accidents and arrests for drinking under the influence; receipt of critic ism about alcohol and/or drug use from fellow students, faculty members, medical residents, and other clinical supervisors; and, most especially, the student's continued drinking and/or drug use in spite of being informed of adverse consequences. Substan ce abuse is characterized as insidious, progressive, chronic, malignant, primary, family -centered and treatable. The medical consequences resulting from impairment from substance abuse range from a mild hangover to death due to bleeding, infection, or tra uma. The Florida State University College of Medicine recognizes that chemical dependency represents a problem of national proportions and medical students may be at increased risk. The Florida State University College of Medicine recognizes that chemica lly dependent students may potentially bring harm to themselves or the public they serve and that chemical dependency can impair a student's academic progress. Furthermore, the Florida State University College of Medicine recognizes that chemical dependen cy (including alcoholism) is a treatable disease. The College of Medicine is therefore committed to providing wellness education through professional education and prevention programs concerning chemical dependency and alcohol use, to identifying and ass isting students who may be chemically dependent, and to providing access for medical students to confidential chemical dependency treatment programs that will not jeopardize their professional career goals. In addition, the College of Medicine has an affi liation with the Professionals Resource Network (PRN ), to which medical students with a chemical dependency or a mental or physical health condition that interferes with their ability to participate in the medical education program or subsequently to practice as a physician may be referred. The College of Medicine recognizes students' rights to privacy and confidentiality related to any discovery or disclosure of chemical dependency. Our policy on Chemical Dependency and Professional Resource Network (PRN) Involvement is as follows: If a substance use issue is suspected to be impacting a student's ability to participate in their medical educati onal program, the student will be reported to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (Years 1 and 2) or the regional campus dean (Years 3 and 4). The referral can come from the student, a faculty member, a staff member or an academic advisor. After meeting with the student, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the regional campus dean may refer the student to the Director of Student Counseling Services (DSCS) and/or to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. The student will be asked to undergo a formal evaluation and may be required to undergo mandatory drug testing, be referred to the (PRN ) or have additional requirements imposed by the Student Evaluation & Promotion Committee. If after an initial formal evaluation it is determined that the student is impaired by either the effects of a chemical dependency to the degree that his/her untreated disorder(s) has the potential of interfering with their ability to participate in the medical education program, or potential to practice as a physician, then a referral to PRN will be made. The DSCS /PRN Liaison will oversee the process of formally contacting PRN and coordinating services. Because this would represent significant impairment that could impact a student's academic progress, the Regional Campus Dean and/or Associate Dean for Student Affairs will have a need to know about the student's situation if they have not been previously involved in the referral proces s. In situations where treatment has been mandated by the SEPC and/or PRN, and the student does not comply with treatment, the student will be asked to grant consent for the DSCS to discuss with the treatment provider his/her assessment of the student's need for on- going treatment. If there are sufficient concerns about the student's ability to continue in his/her educational program, the student will be referred to the SEPC for further review. The PRN process is described in Section IX , subsection F below: 47 VIII. STUDENT AFFAIRS A. Technical Standards for Admission to and Graduation from the College of Medicine* Candidates for the M.D. degree must be able to fully and promptly perform the essential functions in each of the following categories: Observation, Communication, Motor, Intellectual, and Behavioral/Social. However, it is recognized that degrees of ability vary widely between individuals. Individuals are encouraged to discuss their disabilities with the College of Medicine's Director of Student Counseling Services and the FSU Student Disability Resource Center to determine whether they might be eligible to receive accommodations needed in order to train and function effectively as a physician. The Florida State Univers ity College of Medicine is committed to enabling its students by any reasonable means or accommodations to complete the course of study leading to the medical degree. Observation . The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals, anatomic dissections and gross pathologic abnormalities in humans, radiologic imaging studies, evaluation of microbiologic cultures, and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. The candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients.

B. Accepted Students Accepted applicants to the first- year class are required to sign an Acceptance Letter, Technical Standards Acknowledgement, and FSU Residency Classification Form to reserve a position in the class. The deadline for applicants to make a final choice of which medical school to attend is April 30. 48 Immunization records for both the FSU COM and University Health Services are required prior to matriculation to the College of Medicine. Students are not fully registered and cannot participate in required clinical experienc es until these reports are on file with the College of Medicine. Immunization records are monitored and must be updated annually. Several curricular activities require the student to travel to sites away from the central and regional campuses. Students are responsible for having their own means of transportation to and from these sites. C. Students With Disabilities The Florida State University adheres to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which was revised in 2008 (ADAA) in prohibiting discrimination against any qualified person with a disability. Students with specific questions regarding the FSU policies governing students with disabilities may contact the Student Disability Resource Center. D. Insurance Requirements 1. Health Insurance As a benefit of student fees, all students have access to the Florida State University Health and Wellness Center, which provides basic outpatient care. All students in the College of Medicine are required to have health insurance at all times during enrollment . Verification of insurance may occur at any time during the academic year. There are several coverage optio ns, but the coverage must include hospitalization insurance. The student may be covered through a parent or spouses' policy; an individual policy; or through a low- cost healthcare policy provided through the University. The student is financially respons ible for the premium. 2. Workers' Compensation Because students are not employees of the FSU COM nor its affiliated partners, they are not eligible for Worker's Compensation coverage. Therefore, any coverage for illness or injuries incurred as a medical student will be the responsibility of the student via his/her private health insurance plan. 3. Disability Insurance Because of the nature of and the expense of training for a career in medicine, students are also required to subscribe to the group disability insurance policy provided through the College of Medicine. This requirement is for the student's protection should a disability occur that would not allow the student to complete medical school and practice medicine. Students must pay the required fee at the time of matriculation and annually thereafter. 4. Liability Insurance The Florida State University College of Medicine Self -Insurance Program (FSUSIP) provides ge neral and professional liability coverage of FSU COM students while participating in approved education and training programs, and when not subject to the immunity as described in Florida Statute 768.28. Coverage is $1,000,000 per occurrence with no limiting annual aggregate. Students are covered for: All clinical rotations and electives that are pre -approved as part of the student's curriculum, External educational activities that are part of an approved course of study or required by their degree program, and Extracurricular training programs and activities (non- practicum) pre -approved by the Dean of FSU COM. 5. Compliance with Student Insurance Policies 49 Noncompliance with the requirement to hold a hospitalization policy may lead to the student not being allowed to participate in clinical training activities, extracurricular clinical experiences, and international medical projects as determined by the Seni or Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs or designee. A medical student's failure to meet the health insurance requirements is considered a matter of professionalism. Continued noncompliance issues may result in the referral of the s tudent to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee for review. Action taken by the Committee may impact the student's status as a student in good standing. 6. Needlestick Insurance Students should be aware of the risk of needle stick injuries. Students may need care and treatment for post injury care. Students are responsible for having health insurance that covers care and treatment for needle stick injuries and follow up care for t hese injuries. It is the student's responsibility to review their insurance coverage for needle stick injuries and if they do not have needle stick coverage with their current insurance, students should purchase a supplemental needle stick injury insurance. E. New Student Orientation Prior to matriculation, all selected students are required to participate in a New Student Orientation. During Orientation, students are provided with necessary information about their matriculation into Florida State University College of Medicine, including policies, financial information and student resources. Attendance is required at all scheduled events throughout Orientation. F. Financial I nformation 1. Fees and Expenses Students in the College of Medicine are individually responsible for tuition, fees, medical equipment, and living expenses. The fee structure for College of Medicine students is based on an annual \"flat- rate\" for tuition and fees as approved by the FSU Board of Trustees. 2. Estimated Budget The following table s reflect the estimated budget for the academic year: Estimated MD1 Budget In -State Item Summer Fall Spring Total Tuition and Fees $9,291 $9,848 $28,987 Books and Utilities) MD2 Budget In -State Item Summer Fall Spring Total Tuition and Fees 0 $14,899 $14,899 $29,798 Books and Supplies 0 $1,000 (Rent and Utilities) 0 $3,528 Board (Food and 0 $25,561 $24,951 $50,512 Estimated MD3 Budget In -State Item Summer Spring Total Tuition and Fees $8,872 $9,828 $28,528 Books and $23,648 $64,313 Estimated MD4 Budget In -State Item Spring Total Tuition and Fees $9,271 $9,828 $28,927 Books and Out -of-State Spring Total Tuition and Fees $22,886 $22,867 $68,619 Books and Out -of-State Item Summer Fall Spring Total Tuition and Fees 0 $34,580 $34,580 $69,160 Books and Supplies 0 $1,000 (Rent and Utilities) 0 $3,528 Board (Food and 0 $45,242 $44,632 $89,874 Estimated MD3 Budget Out -of-State Item Summer Spring Total Tuition and Fees $22,886 $23,137 $69,159 Books and $36,956 $104, 942 Estimated MD4 Budget Out-of-State Item Spring Total Tuition and Fees $22,886 $23,136 $69,158 Books and 3. Financial Aid It is imperative that all students anticipating the need for financial assistance at any time during their medical education undertake early long- term planning. Loans and a limited number of scholarships are available to assist students with their medical education and, if university sources have been exhausted, every effort is made to help students find funds els ewhere. With few exceptions, scholarship awards are made on the basis of need. Awards are made without regard to race, color, religion, gender , sexual orientation, disability, age, or veteran status. Applicants to the first-year class who have been interviewed should apply for aid as soon as possible after January 1, but no later than March 1. Interviewed applicants with financial need should not wait for acceptance before applying for financial aid. Applicants accepted after March 1 who may qualify fo r financial assistance, should make application as soon as possible. 52 a) Determining Financial Need Federal, state, private, and institutional aid programs assume that the family (student, spouse, and parents) has primary responsibility for financing your e ducation, and that the family should contribute amounts in accordance with its income and assets before financial aid can be expected. The process of determining the amount of money that can be contributed to your educational support (called the Expected Family Contribution or EFC) is called \"needs analysis.\" Needs analysis is accomplished through one of two mechanisms, depending upon the requirements of the specific aid program: those that require the analysis of parental financial data, and those that do not. b) Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA ) The FAFSA is a needs analysis form provided by the Federal Government to collect financial data and for which students cannot be charged a fee for processing. As a professional student, you are considered independent by the Federal Government regardless o f your age, tax status or living arrangements for most Federal Programs; financial information on the FAFSA therefore is only required from you and your spouse if you are married. You must complete a FAFSA every year as early as October 1 st to be considered for any of the following programs: The Direct Loan Program (DLP) Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Perkins Loan Graduate PLUS Loan Florida State Univers ity Grant - institutional funds U S Department of Education (DOE) Funds The FAFSA will also collect parents' financial data for the purpose of determining a parental contribution. Many financial aid programs require an assessment of both parents' (even i f they are divorced) ability to contribute to your education in order to determine level of eligibility. The FAFSA does not award financial aid. It only analyzes the information provided by the student and his/her family to calculate an EFC and forwards the results to the designated financial aid office(s). The analysis is performed in accordance with the federally established methodology referred to as \"Federal Needs Analysis Methodology.\" At the individual schools, the EFC is subtracted from the estimated cost of attendance at that institution, which produces an amount referred to as your \"verified financial need.\" This is the amount of financial aid you are eligible to receive. Federal regulations state that a graduate student or professional stud ent is considered an independent student when determining financial need for the DLP. If you provided parent's information on the FAFSA to apply for any of the programs that require an assessment of both parent's ability to contribute, the parent's EFC will not be used to determine eligibility for programs that do not require parental information. c) Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for Receipt of Title IV Student Aid Federal law and regulations require that all students receiving financial assis tance from federal Title IV funds maintain satisfactory academic progress. Title IV funds include Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Perkins Student Loans, and Federal Work-Study. The standards adopted by The Florida State University College of Medicine, which apply to all students receiving financial aid, are on file in the Office of Financial Aid . d) Loans Information about federal programs is subject to change based upon changes in federal legislation. As mentioned previously, there are 3 types of DLP loans: Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, and Direct PLUS loan. 53 The Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan is available to all students regardless of income. The government does not subsidize this loan and the individual is responsible for all interest that accrues while in school, in deferment, or during the grace period. You may choose to make interest payments while in school or may defer (and accumulate) the interest until repayment. The Perkins Loan is based on financial need that is determined by a federal formula. This loan is borrowed through the university and is a subsidized loan. While you are enrolled in school at least part time (6 credit hours) . During the six- month grace period after you stop attending school at least half -time. During periods of authorized deferment . The Direct PLUS loan is an unsubsidized loan that may be made up to the student's cost of attendance minus other estimated financial assistance. Interest accrues while the student is in school Payment deferred until 30 days after student falls below ha lf time enrollment 4. Scholarships Available to FSU COM Students 1.

Report to the FSU COM Security Staff at the emergency assembly point. Remain at the emergency assembly point and follow instructions. Report missing persons to the FSU COM Security Staff. Do not return for missing persons. Do not return to the building for personal effects or work until authorized by the incident commander of the fire department. This authorization will be relayed through FSU COM Security Staff. Fire Drills The Department of Environmental Health and Safety conducts fire drills annually. Additionally, periodic tests of the fire alarm system are conducted. All instances of the fire alarm being activated are to be treated as an actual fire event, and the building evacuated until the all clear has been authorized by the incident commander. In the event of a test of the fire alarm system, email notification of all faculty, staff, and students will be noti fied in advance of the test, as well as the need to evacuate the buildings. Fire Alarms and Protection Systems: Pull Boxes (Red) - If a fire or emergency is observed, pull the handle to activate the warning system. 60 Locator Boxes (Yellow) - If a person is unable to evacuate using the stairs, pull the handle on the yellow locator box to notify Emergency Services of their location to assist in evacuation. Automatic Sprinkler System - Heat from a fire will cause the sprinkler system to discharge water in the area where the fire is located. Fire Extinguishers (A,B & C) - These fire extinguishers are suitable for wood and paper fires, flammable liquid fires, and electrical fires. Leave the area if fire is not extinguished in one minute. Suggestions for use of a fire extinguisher - PASS Pull the pin. Aim the extinguisher at the base of the flame. Squeeze the trigger. Sweep from side to side at the base or source of the fire, and approach the fire slowly, keeping an exit behind your back. Fire extinguishers must be held in a vertical position. Fire Exits: Illuminated fire exit signs are located throughout each floor of the College. Follow this to find a path to safety. All corridors and fire exits must be kept clear and unobstructed at all times! 2. Emergency Operations Plan The purpose of the emergency operations plan is to adequately prepare for and respond to emergency and disaster situations that may impact the FSU College of Medicine central campus in Tallahassee and the regional campuses. The FSU President and Provost have authority to close campuses. However, in the case of the College of Medicine that authority has been delegated to the Dean and Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and A cademic Affairs. Regional Campus Deans, in consultation with the Dean or Sr. Associate Dean, decide the timeline for closing and reopening a regional campus. All regional campuses and the central campus should be prepared at all times for the relocation of students if a regional campus is closed for an extended period of time. No regional campus building is designated as an official hurricane shelter. Pre-planning Emergency Contact Information: Students much enter emergency contact information online at orientation and update their contact information at the beginning of every school year. Disaster Relocation Information: Student must inform student support coordinators of their temporary relocation information if a natural disaster requires them to leave their regional campus location. Student Education: Students should be award of procedures for their campus which include, but not limited to, rules of communication, updating contact information and notification of whereabouts during a disaster. Students will receive their information on the current situation of rotations from the regional campus staff. Hospital Education: Students should educate themselves on the policies and procedures of how each institution handles disasters and be prepared to follow those procedures. Incident Commander: The Dean and Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and A cademic Affairs serve as the Incident Commanders for Central Campus. The Campus Dean is the incident commander at the regional level backed up by the Campus Administrator. 61 Central Point-of-Contact: This central campus point- of-contact will communicate with the rest of the College of Medicine and the FSU communications team to provide updated information for the FSU emergency website and phone number. The current central campus point of contact is: Doug Carlson Senior Associate Dean for Medical Educatio n and Academic Affairs (alternate) The Campus Dean will determine when staff and students can return to normal daily procedures at a regional campus following an unanticipated emergency situation, which in Florida is most likely to be a tornado, flooding, fire, or unusually strong storms. Disaster Evacuation and Housing for Students A program through which medical students from schools in one geographic area of Florida can provide temporary housing to students from schools located in other areas of the state in the event of an evacuation in preparation for or after a hurricane. The w eb-based application, hosted by the Florida State University College of Medicine entitled \"Florida Medical Student Disaster Housing\" ( https://fmsdisasterhousing.com/ ) incorporates an electronic form that ca n be completed by students desiring to participate in the program. Students can be matched to housing in the event of a storm, with coordination at an individual medical school level. 62 IX. STUDENT HEALTH AND WELFARE In the event of an unexpected illness or personal difficulty, it is important that you are aware of the services available to you as an FSU student. A.

Additional Healthcare Services in the Tallahassee Area Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, 1300 Miccosukee Rd, (850) 431-1155 Capital Regional Medical Center 2626 Capital Medical Blvd. (850) 325-5000 There are also a number of urgent care facilities in the Tallahassee area. Information can be obtained from the Student Support Coordinators at the central campus. C. Health Care at Regional Campuses To establish continuit y of care during student transition to regional campuses, students are encouraged to make arrangements for health services noting the following information: 63 1. Students are strongly encouraged to establish care with a primary care provider and transfer all necessary health care 3 months prior to transitioning to their regional campus. 2. Students are strongly encouraged to have medications refilled before transitioning to their regional campuses. It is recommended that students transfer with a 3 - to 6-month supply of medication on hand. This should avoid the unfortunate circumstance of a lack of medication. 3. Students will have access to a list of primary care providers and behavioral health specialists for each regional campus. Information regarding other specialists can be provided by regional campuses as needed. 4. Students who are currently receiving psychiatric, or other mental health services in Tallahassee that cannot be continued via telehealth at their regional campuses are strongly encouraged to transfer ca re by 3 months prior to transitioning to the regional campus. 5. A physician who is teaching and assigning a grade to a student cannot serve as their provider. Students requiring assistance with this statement should consult the regional campus dean. The FSU COM Office of Student Counseling Services offers after hours telepsychology services for students at the regional campuses. To schedule an appointment, please contact Dr. Kristen Schmidt at 850-264-2485 or visit the website at https://intranet.med.fsu.edu/sites/StudentAffairs/counseling/Pages/TS.aspx . Telepsychiatry services are provided through a private practitioner and coordinated through the Office of Student Counseling Services. More information may be obtained by contacting their office at 850-645-6475. Students have access to this information directly from their respective campuses and through the Wellness Committee and Office of Student Counseling MedNet pages. Specific information regarding local health services may be obtained from the Regional Campus Student Support Coordinator. It is the students' responsibility to obtain and maintain information from their health insurance provider regarding the availability of services from covered physicians in the geographical area or the regional campus. D. Behavioral Health Services During the transition to medical school and throughout medical school, students will inevitably encounter personal challenges. Because the pressures facing medical students can be especially intense, it is important that they are aware of the support services available. The College of Medicine offers on -site academic and mental health counseling through the Office of Student Counseling Services. This office has no involvement in the academic evaluation or promotion of students. The psychologists in this office are available to work with individuals and small groups of students with concerns related to academic improvement and personal issues. Students wishing to enhance their current academic performance as well as those experiencing academic difficulty are encouraged to consult w ith the office of student counseling services. This office is available to evaluate, diagnose, and plan interventions for learning disorders and attention difficulties. Academic improvement frequently addresses the following concerns: increasing academic performance, study skills efficiency and effectiveness, time management, scheduling and prioritizing, and organization and planning. Students experiencing issues of a personal or psychological nature that might be interfering currently or have the potent ial to interfere with academic progress or overall well -being are also encouraged to consult with this office . Some possible counseling needs that can be assessed and/or addressed on - site include: stress/anxiety reduction test or performance anxiety red uction adjustment depression grief anger management sexual identity issues substance abuse family or relationship issues eating disorders trauma, abuse or assault 64 crisis intervention Confidentiality of student concerns is maintained at all times with the exception of those instances when information must be legally and ethically reported. The on -site psychologists are available for appointments and may be reached through the Office of Student Counseling Services. In case of a mental health emergency after office hours , the student should call 911 or go directly to the nearest hospital emergency room. The College of Medicine contracts with a local psychiatrist to provide psychiatric care to medical students, should they choose this option. This psychiatrist is not otherwise affiliated with the College of Medicine. Referrals to the psychiatrist's office are made/coordinated through the Office of Student Counseling Services. Students m ay also utilize psychiatric services through the University Health Services. The Student Affairs staff and the Office of Student Counseling Services maintain a listing of additional university counseling services should students need or desire off -site or specialized help. Additional resources can be provided should students prefer contact with non- university counselors. Mental health counseling is available on the Florida State University campus through the University Counseling Center and with community providers if requested. 1. University Counseling Center (UCC) is a student service agency within the FSU Division of Student Affairs. The major goal is to provide support services that help each student grow and develop emotionally, interpersonally, and intellectually. The University Counseling Center offers various counseling methods to meet the needs of students. The University Counseling Center will make referrals for on-going treatment in the Tallaha ssee community if necessary, but treatment outside the center will be at the student's expense The Counseling Center's records of visits are strictly confidential and are not included in the student's University records. Information concerning use of the center will not be released to anyone without written permission from the student involved, unless there appears to be a clear and present danger to the student or others. http://counseling.fsu.edu/ Services o ffered at the UCC include: Crisis intervention Psychiatric consultation Short term individual counseling Referrals Alcohol and drug counseling Outreach presentations Couples counseling Consultation Group counseling Peer advisor training & consul tation To make an appointment, call (850) 644-2003 between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM. If a student finds the pressures of life are unmanageable or unbearable, the staff at the University Counseling Center should be contacted. In case of a psych ological emergency , the student should go directly to the nearest hospital emergency room. 2. Psychology Clinic is a mental health service, training, and research center operated by the Department of Psychology. Services are provided by doctoral level student therapists in the Clinical Psychology PhD Program under the close supervision of faculty members. It is ac credited by the American Psychological Association. The Psychology Clinic offers affordable outpatient mental health services while providing experience for graduate students in the Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology. The clinic provides confidential and personalized services that are sensitive to issues of diversity, and specialize s in therapies that are supported by research (empirically - supported therapies). http://www.psy.fsu.edu/community/c linic 3. Family Institute is a multidisciplinary unit established to bring together faculty, students, government, and community resources to provide a centralized source of information, services, research, and critical thinking rel ated to families. http://www.chs.fsu.edu/fi 4. Center for Couple and Family Therapy is a non -profit clinic serving individuals, couples, families and children for therapeutic counseling needs. Operated by the College of Human Sciences, Interdivisional Program for Marriage 65 and the Family, the clinic is an advanced graduate training facility. Doctoral students work in a professional setting, under direct faculty supervision, and are trained as highly accredited the rapists, researchers, and teachers. http://www.chs.fsu.edu/Centers- Institutes/C enter -For-Couple- Family -Therapy 5. Information regarding additional counseling resources at the regional campuses can be obtained from the Student Support Coordinators at the regional campuses or from the Office of Student Counseling Services. E. Policy on Provision of Psychological Couns eling and Medical Care to Medical Students Because of the community -based clinical training and integrated curricular model at the Florida State U niversity College of Medicine, it is possible that a student may seek psychological counseling or medical care on a service or in a practice in which a faculty member is employed. It is our policy that health professionals who provide psychiatric/psychological counseling or other sensitive healthcare services to medical students must have no involvement in the academic evaluation or promotion of students receiving those services. T herefore, faculty members of the FSU COM who have an evaluative relationship with a student cannot provide psychological counseling or medical care to that student. A student who has received psychological counseling or medical care from a faculty member prior to entering an evaluative relationship may request to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Regional Campus Dean to receive reassignment. F. Mental/Physical Health Referrals and PRN Involvement 1. For students in Years One and Two a. If a mental or physical health issue is suspected to be impacting a student's ability to participate in their medical education or may pose a problem for future practice, the student will be initially assessed by the PRN Liaiso n . The referral can come from the student, a faculty member, or an academic advisor. The PRN Liaison will inform the student of the reasons for completing a n assessment as well as the possible involvement of PRN . b. If the PRN Liaison believes that treatment is possible without PRN involvement, he/she will recommend this and make referrals to appropriate professionals, if desired. If after an initial assessment by the PRN Liaison it is determined that the student is impaired by either the effects of a mental disorder or a physical health condition to the degree that his/her untreated disorder(s) has the potential of interfering with his/her ability to participate in the medical education program, or potential to practice as a physician, then a referral to PRN will be made. The PRN Liaison will oversee the process of formally contacting PRN and coordinating services. Because this would represent significant impairment that could impact a student's academic progress, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs will have a need to know about the student's situation if they have not been previously involved in the referral process. In situations where treatment has been mandated by PRN, and the student does not comply with treatment, the E&P Committee will be involved in the review of the student's situation and progress. 2. For Students in Years Three and Four a. If a mental or physical health issue is suspected to be impacting a student's ability to participate in their medical education, or may pose a problem for future practice, the student will be referred to the regional campus dean (Note: The Chair of the Department of Family Medicine and Rural Health will serve in this role for students in Rural Medical Education Program). The referral can come from the student, faculty member, or academic advisor. The regional campus dean will confer with the PRN Liaison who will provide an initial assessment to determine whether a referral to PRN is appropriate. 66 b. The P RN Liaison will discuss with the student the reasons for completing the assessment as well possible involvement of PRN . c. If the PRN Liaison believes that treatment is possible without PRN involvement, the PRN Liaison will recommend this and make referrals to appropriate professionals, if desired. d. If after an initial assessment by the PRN Liai son, it is determined that the student is impaired by either the effects of a mental disorder or a physical health condition to the degree that his/her untreated disorder(s) has the potential of interfering with his/her ability to participate in the medica l education program, or potential to practice as a physician, then a referral to PRN will be made. The PRN Liaison will contact P RN and coordinate the referral with them . Because this would represent significant impairment that could impact a student's academic progress, the Regional Campus Dean and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs will have a need to know about the student's situation if they have not been previously involved in the referral process. e. In situations where treatment has been mandated by PRN, and the student does not comply with treatment, the E&P Committee will be involved in the review of the student's situation and prog ress. 3. Th e PRN process is as follows: a. The PRN Liaison will contact the identified student to explain the process. b. The student will be assessed . If PRN involvement is warranted, the COM's PRN L iaison will contact PRN to begin the referral process. The notification letter to PRN will include the reason for referral. c. Upon referral, PRN will then refer the student for an evaluation from one of their providers. d. After receiving the results of the ev aluation, PRN will send a copy of the PRN monitoring contract to the provider as well as to the COM's Designated PRN School Contact. e. The Designated PRN School Contact will receive a regularly scheduled compliance report from PRN based on the referred student's individual contract. Noncompliance will result in possible E&P involvement. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Regional C ampus D ean will provide the Designated PRN School Contact with regularly scheduled progress reports relevant to the student's academic and/or clinical performance. f. PRN will receive a regularly scheduled progress report from the Designated PRN School Contact relevant to the student's academic and/or clinica l performance . g. PRN will discuss the progress reports with the student's treatment providers to ensure collaboration in working towards the student's success in medical school and the PRN program. The student will be asked to sign a Release of Information allowing PRN to communicate with the COM's Designated PRN School Contact upon initial referral in order to facilitate this process. G. Students with Disabilities at Florida State University College of Medicine The Florida State University adheres to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (This was revised, effective January 2009 and is now the ADAAA) in prohibiting discrimination against any qualified person with a disability. Students with specified questions regarding the FSU policies governing students with disabilities may contact the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC). Confidentiality of information is maintained at all times with the exce ption of those instances when information must be legally and ethically reported. Students who warrant accommodations based upon the functional effects of a disability should adhere to the following procedure: 1. The student should contact and meet with a r epresentative of the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC), provide documentation of a disability and request accommodations. A definitive diagnosis of a disability must be identified in the documentation. The SDRC will determine eligibility as well a s appropriate accommodations based on the functional limitations of the disability. Details regarding the required documentation as well as all other procedures can be found at the SDRC website: https://dos.fsu.edu/sdrc . 67 2. Entering students are strongly advised to initiate contact with the SDRC, schedule a meeting, and complete the determination of eligibility process prior to the beginning of classes. For all other students, this process must be completed according t o SDRC policies and timelines. 3. After meeting with the SDRC, if the student is determined eligible to receive accommodations, they will be given a Faculty Letter as a record of the initial meeting, eligibility, and accommodation request. A copy of this le tter should be given to the Office of Student Counseling Services, as the ADA coordinator for the CoM, and the Office of Medical Education, who administers exams at the COM. If the student has been found eligible for classroom and/or clinical accommodation s, the form should also be given to the Block Directors for the course. Each copy of the letter will be kept in a confidential place and not made part of the academic record of the student. 3. These accommodations will be provided for the duration of the student's medical education at FSU COM or while they continue to be eligible, unless the student requests otherwise. Since NBME examinations will be administered electronically at each regional campus, accommodations will be provided at that location. If a student receives clinical and/or classroom accommodations while at a regional campus, those will be provided at the respective location. 4. For those students attending the regional campuses, the above procedures would be followed in order to be approved for accommodations. However, the Regional Campus Dean will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the accommodations in collaboration with the Office of Medical Education and the Office of Student Counseling Services. 5. Students who qualify for examination accommodations will be bound by the FSU and College of Medicine Honor Code Rules. H. Immunizations The FSU College of Medicine takes seriously its responsibility to maximally protect students, staff, and patients from all potential health threats including infections. Based on this need to protect, the College has implemented programs to educate students concerning ways in which they can help protect themselves as current and future healthcare workers. In addition, the College maintains a number of requirements in regard to immunization and event reporting practices. Although exceptions to these requirements are occasionally necessary, the College retains the right to seek independent verification of the need for exceptions, and to require students to follow guidelines for immunization and generally established health practices when there is potential risk to the students, faculty staff, and/ or patients. The following immunizations are required as outlin ed below . These must be kept up-to-date in order for students to participate in any clinical activities, including Year 1 and Y ear 2 preceptorships. Proof of the following disease protections: o Measles (Rubeola) (2 vaccine doses or laboratory evidence of immunity ) o Mumps (2 vaccine doses or laboratory evidence of immunity ) o Rubella (2 vaccine doses or laboratory evidence of immunity ) o Polio (4 doses of childhood vaccine, OR 3 doses is vaccinated as an adult or OPV given) o Varicella (chickenpox) - Medical s tudents must have evidence of immunity prior to matriculation which includes ANY of the following: Written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of varicella vaccine given at least 28 days apart, Laboratory evidence of varicella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, Diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella disease by a health- care provider, or Diagnosis or verification of a history of Herpes Zoster (shingles) by a health -care provider. o Additional varicella considerations Students who have no serologic proof of immunity, prior vaccination, or diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella or herpes zoster (shingles) by a healthcare provider, should receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine, 4 weeks apart, given by subcutaneous injection. Routine testing for varicella immunity after 2 doses of vaccine is not recommended. Documented receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine supersedes results of subsequent serologic testing. o Tetanus-Diphtheria- Pertussus (Tdap vaccine) 68 All student s should have received the Tdap vaccine regardless of previous tetanus vaccine status and their most recent date of tetanus (Td) vaccination and regardless of age,. Those who have not been vaccinated with T dap by the time of matriculation should receive t he vaccine as soon as feasible. o Hepatitis B A complete 3 vaccine series is required. If not already completed, the student will be responsible for vaccination with this series within the first 6 months of start of classes. Students matriculating with partial completion of the series must complete the series beginning w ith the next vaccine dose that is due. After the 3 -vaccine series is completed, the student will be responsible for having his/her blood tested for immunity to hepatitis B. This post -vaccination serologic testing should be performed 1- 2 months after the a dministration of the last dose of the vaccine series. Specifically the Hepatitis B Surface Antibody Quantitative lab test or a test that allows detection of the protective concentration of Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (10 mIU/mL) must be ordered. If the value is 10 mIU/mL on the lab report then immunity is confirmed andno further hepatitis B immunization s or testing is required. If the lab result is less than 10 mIU/mL, then the student should be revaccinated with the same 3 -vaccine series, after which the same post -vaccination blood testing must be repeated . Students who fail to attain a protective result of 10 mIU/mL after the repeat vaccination series must then have Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti -HBc) blood tests performed. If the HBsAg and anti -HBc tests are negative, the student is considered to be uninfected and declared a vaccine \"nonresponder\" and thus susceptible to hepatitis B. Vaccine nonresponders should be counseled concerning HBV infection prev ention and the need for hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) post -exposure prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to HBsAg- positive blood. Conversely, i f a student is determined to be positive for anti-HBc and is positive for HBsAg, then that student is considered infected with hepatitis B. Hepatitis B infected students are required to discuss their situations and its implications with their physician or a physician at the University Health and Wellness Center. HBsAg positive students will be allowed to enter clinical training according to the policy in this handbook for hepatitis B infected students.. o Influenza Proof of influenza vaccination is required in the fall of each year during which students are enrolled in the College of Medicine. Without specific vaccine contradictions, the College of Medicine has no preferred influenza vaccine. This should be discussed by the student with the healthcare provider administering the vaccine. However, ACIP/HICPAC has recommended that health -care personnel who r eceive live - attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) should avoid providing care for severely immunosuppressed patients requiring a protected environmen t for 7 days after vaccination. o Tuberculosis Proof of Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) screening and/or other tube rculosis testing is required for all medical students. The FSU COM follows CDC guidelines regarding tuberculosis testing using TST or the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) blood tests. CDC recommendations are that (QFT -G, QFT -GIT, and T -Spot) should be used as aids in diagnosing infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These tests may be used for surveillance purposes or to identify persons likely to benefit from treatment, includ ing persons who are or will be at increased risk for M. tuberculosis infection . An IGRA or a TST may be used without preference for periodic screening of persons who might have occupational exposur e to M. tuberculosis (e.g., surveillance programs for health -care workers) .\" Medical students are classified as health -care workers. Students may opt for TST screening or the IGRA blood test by discussing this option with student health or their physician . (See section g, below). Students should be informed that the blood tests are significantly more expensive than the TST method. FSU COM recommends that the TST be used as a first choice for tuberculosis screening beginning with baseline testing by the \"tw o-step procedure for persons without a TST result in the past 12 months to minimize the likelihood of confusing reactivity from an old infection (boosting) with reactivity from a recent infection (conversion). The following is the FSU COM policy for M. tuberculosis screening using all methods: 69 a. Two-step TST testing . The two -step TST method is defined as at least 2 intradermal Mantoux skin tests (TSTs), with the second test administered ideally within 1 -3 weeks after the first test or less ideally within 365 days of the first test. A two- step TST is required prior to or during Year 1 orientation unless the student has proof of having a current two-step TST result or a documented history of a positive TST result prior to matriculation or if the student was rec ently tested by the IGRA blood test. If the student has had at least one TST result within 365 days prior to matriculation, or an IGRA blood test result, then an additional single test (TST or IGRA) test at orientation will be sufficient to meet the two -step skin test requirement. b. N egative two -step TST test result . Once the two -step TST test is done, students with negative reactions are required to have one TST test performed annually thereafter. The two -step test is generally a onetime process. c. P ositive two -step TST test result . Students with positive two- step TST results are required to complete the Tuberculosis Symptom Questionnaire Form (Appendix D) and to have a chest x-ray performed and placed on file in the Student Affairs office and an evaluation by the Thagard Health Center or their private physician for further recommendations. Decisions will be made on an individual basis for the student concerning indications for treatment for tuberculosis (active or latent) and as to ability of the stu dent to pursue coursework and/or clinical rotations. d. S tudent with previously negative TST converting to positive. All students who convert to a positive TST result on required annual testing must have a chest x -ray performed, complete the Tuberculosis Symp tom Questionnaire Form (Appendix D), and be evaluated by the Thagard Health Center or their private physician or an appropriate Regional Campus healthcare resource to provide further recommendations. Decisions will be made on an individual basis for the student concerning indications for treatment for tuberculosis (active or latent) and as to ability of the student to pursue coursework and/or clinical rotations. e. S tudent with past history of positive TST . Students with a history of a positive TST prior to m atriculation must provide documentation to Student Affairs of the reaction (including date administered and size of skin test induration in millimeters) and are required to provide information as to any preventative (prophylactic) therapy taken for their TST conversion. Students with prior positive TST reactions must also provide a copy of the chest X -ray performed after the positive TST test. If a chest x-ray was not done, then a chest x- ray is required at the time of matriculation before or during Year 1 orientation and the results filed in Student Affairs. Students with abnormal chest x -rays will be referred for evaluation to the Thagard Health Center or their private physician to provide further recommendations. f. Student with history of BCG vaccination. In 2010 the CDC recommended that IGRA blood testing is the preferred method for persons who have received Bacille Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) as a vaccine or as cancer treatment. FSU College of medicine highly recommends IGRA testing for students previously vaccinated with BCG. The result of the IGRA test has the same implications as TST testing. Regarding the use TST in individuals who have received BCG, t he CDC has stated: \"The tuberculin skin test (TST) and blood tests to detect TB infection are not contraindicated for persons who have been vaccinated with BCG (Nov 2008).\" Therefore students who have had prior BCG vaccination who refuse IGRA blood testing or when IG RA blood testing is unavailable may be skin-tested using the standard TST two-step method, unless a previously significant reaction to TST can be documented. BCG vaccinated students with documented significant reactions who cannot be tested by the IGRA may be treated as students with a history of a positive TST (Section e, above). In such cases a chest X -ray is required for these individuals just as it is for other TST positive students. The BCG vaccinated student who is exposed to a person or patient with active (contagious) tuberculosis should be tested preferably by IGRA regardless of BCG -induced TST test result status. Students with a history of BCG vaccination and with negative TST tests may be treated in the same fashion as other students with negative TST results and be tested with either IGRA or TST annually. g. Summary information on IGRA blood tests. In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first blood assay for M. tuberculosis , Quantiferon Gold (QFT- G) (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie , Victoria, Australia) . The FDA subsequently approved two additional assays for the same purpose, t he QuantiFERON-TB Gold In- Tube test (QFT- GIT) (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) and the T-SPOT.TB test (T-Spot) (Oxford Immunotec Limited, Abingdon, United Kingdom). FSU COM has adopted the following policies regarding these blood tests: An IGRA may be used in place of TST for M. tuberculosis screening and exposure testing. 70 An IGRA is required for students refusing TST. An IGRA is the preferred method for testing all persons who have received BCG An IGRA may be used at the recommendation of a health- care provider to evaluate students with equivocal or discordant M. tuberculosis test results. Students undergoing IGRA testing in place of TST will be responsible for any additional costs of the due to the blood test not covered by student health or their health insurance plans. h. Student with positive TST: Implications for subsequent TB testing . All students with positive TST reactions whether recent or remote in time or presumed to be secondary to BCG vaccination are exempted from future TST testing, but are required to complete the Tuberculosis Symptom Questionnaire Form (Appendix D) on an annual basis. Completed forms will be filed with Student Affairs or in the office of the Student Support Coordinator at Regional Campuses. i. R ecommendations regarding r epeat chest x -rays. Repeated chest x- rays (annual or otherwise) have not been found to be of value in persons with a positive TST or positive IGRA after an initial negative chest film. Students with positive TST or IGRA results, whether or not they complete preventive treatment, do not need repeat chest x -rays unless they have or subsequently develop pulmonary symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis or based on the required annual Tuberculosis Symptom Questionnaire Form (Appendix D). I. Health Updates To satisfy FSU Enrollment requirements, students must com plete the University Health and Wellness Center 's Student Health History Form. Students must be sure to read the form carefully. The form must carry the signature of a physician or an authorized designee and the license # or office stamp with address. Signatures are required on the back of the form. The form MUST be complet ed PRIOR to registration for classes and must be returned to University Health and Wellness Center . Immunization records and PPD test results must be turned in to the Division of Student Affairs in the College of Medicine. For the protection of the students' health, updates on health status may be required from time to time. In the event of a possible exposure to an infectious agent, the COM may require (with student consent) the assessment of infection risk through clinical evaluation, blood tests, e tc. (see below). J. Occupational Exposure to Infectious Materials or Environmental Hazards Policy The Florida State University College of Medicine has adopted the following policy regarding the exposure to infectious materials and environmental hazards. The policy has been developed using the most contemporary knowledge available regarding these issues and is based on established principles of epidemiology, disease prevention, and infection control. The policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff of The Florida State University College of Medicine. Definitions: \"Student\" refers to an individual enrolled in medical school classes at the College of Medicine. \"Faculty and staff\" refers to an individual employed by the College of Medicine or one of its departments. \"Bloodborne Pathogen\" means an infectious disease transmitted by b lood including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C (HBV), or any disease primarily transmitted in the blood. \"Body Substance Precautions\" means a method of infection control where potentially in fectious materials are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens and to take measures to prevent exposure to these. \"Blood\" means human blood, including its components and products. \"Occupational Exposure Incident\" means a specific eye, mouth, non -intact skin inoculation; or injection contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials; or exposure to an environmental hazard that results from an activity related to education or employment. 71 \"Other P otentially Infectious Materials\" means semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, sputum, urine, feces, concentrated HIV and HBV viruses, aerosolized particles, and saliva. \"Airborne Pathogen\" means an infectious disease transmitted via aerosolized particles including tuberculosis, chicken pox (Varicella), measles, meningococcus, influenza, and serious respiratory pathogens, such as SARS and MERS vriuses. \"Environmental Hazard\" means any exposure, which may have health repercussions, such as chemical spills or radiation. \"Personal Protective Equipment\" is specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee or student for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g. uniforms, pants, shirts, or blouses) and personal prescription eyewear are not intended to function as protections against a hazard are not considered to be personal protective equipment. Policy: The College of Medicine strives to safeguard the health and well -being of its students, faculty, residents, staff, and patients. It is the policy of the College of Medicine to treat in a sensitive and compassionate manner any individual infected with any bloodborne or airborne pathogen, including HIV. The College of Medicine does not discriminate against any individual with such an infection and complies with all applicable federal and state laws. K. Universal Precautions Education and Training One of the prime objectives of this policy is to encourage those in the medical school community to educate themselves about HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and other infectious materials and environmental hazards. Education is the best protection against fear, prejudice, and infection. Students are given several educational sessions on universal precautions. These occur in orientation, during the Doctoring 1 and 2 courses as well as during their orientation for 3 rd year at their regional campuses. Students are also given universal precaution information cards that they maintain with their identification during their 3rd and 4th year s. These information cards contain a summary of policies a s well as contact information. L. Body Substance Precautions Students are required to follow appropriate infection control procedures including body substance precautions, where there is a risk of paren teral, mucous membrane, or cutaneous exposure to blood, body fluids, or aerosolized secretions from any patient, irrespective of the perceived risk of a bloodborne or airborne pathogen. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as appropriate to the situa tion is mandatory. Current epidemiological data indicate that individuals infected with HIV and other bloodborne pathogens present no risk of transmitting infection when participating in educational activities or in the patient care environment when stand ard infection control practices are used. Individuals infected with tuberculosis, measles, chicken pox, and other airborne pathogens only pose a risk during the infectious stage of these diseases. M. Students with Active Hepatitis B Infections Medical students with active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (i.e. those who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive) who do not perform exposure-prone procedures but who practice non- or minimally invasive procedures (Category II, see box below) will not be subject to any restrictions of their activities or study. These students do not need to achieve low or undetectable levels of circulating HBV DNA, hepatitis e-antigen negativity, or have a review and oversight by an expert review panel. Students w ith active HBV vaccinations may have limitations on any Category I procedures as determined by 72 the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education, a panel of experts appointed by the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and/or a designee of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education. Policy Regarding Hepatitis B Infected Medical Students Based on current national guidelines, h epatitis B infected students in each year of the curriculum should be allowed to pursue medical education in the same manner as all other students with minimal modifications as outlined below. Effort must be made to respect the student's confidentiality to the greatest extent possible. The Division of Student Affairs will encourage students to seek and maintain appropria te medical care for their personal medical conditions. The student should have specific instructions on the following items: o Education about the absolute need for precautions to prevention of exposure of the student's blood and bodily fluids to patients ( double gloving, regular glove changes, use of blunt surgical needles, procedures restrictions \u2014see next section) o Specific instructions as to what constitutes high risk procedures for transmission of infection from the student to patients. o The student will be prohibited from participation in high risk procedures during clinical training. (Category 1 procedures as identified in the Centers for Disease Control recommendations - see Box) o Specific instructions as to the student's responsibility to report all po ssible exposures of the student's blood or body fluid to a patient (such as a needlestick or other sharps injury suffered by the student during medical care of a patient) o Career counseling will be provided concerning career choices and future practice set tings. The Division for Student Affairs is responsible for the student under this policy in the pre -regional campus years and will notify the student's Regional Campus Dean of the student's status for the regional campus years. The Regional Campus Dean is central to the ongoing education, compliance, and monitoring processes in these situations during the clinical training months at the regional campus. The Campus Dean will provide the preventative education to the student even if such was provided prior to the student's arrival at the regional campus. The Regional Campus Dean will maintain communication with Division for Student Affairs regarding the student's status regarding participation in the educational program under this policy. The Campus Dean will be the liaison on all related matters between the College of Medicine, the department for Student Affairs, the Clerkship Directors, and the faculty and institutions for purposes of student teaching assignments and the related compliance issues and institu tional policies. The Clerkship Director should not assume the intermediary role in these oversight assignments and institutional relationships, since these tasks must be coordinated by the Campus Dean and communicated by the Dean to the Clerkship Director. This information will also be shared with supervising faculty physicians only when and where there is a possibility of performing Category 1 procedures (as determined by the Campus Dean and/or Clerkship Director), most especially on the Surgery and OB/Gyn Clerkships or any clerkship where surgical, obstetrical, gynecological, or any other Category 1 procedure may be performed (see Box). The appropriate Clerkship Director will be apprised of the student's issues based, since the Clerkship Director must dir ect and monitor the student in the clinical realm on a weekly and even daily basis. In conjunction with the Clerkship Director, the Regional Campus Dean should assign the student, to the extent that is possible, to a single faculty for the entire general surgery assignment, a single faculty for the surgical clerkship subspecialty selective assignment, and a single faculty for OB/Gyn assignments in order to reasonably protect the student's privacy and to facilitate monitoring of the student's clinical exper iences. The student must not actively participate in Category 1 procedures (see Box), but may observe them without restrictions. Institutions where the student will be assigned may need to know specific information about the student's health status inclu ding laboratory reports according to specific policies they may have in place. The Regional Campus 73 Dean should determine what these requirements are for the institution(s) to which the student will rotate. It would be ideal for the student to rotate at ins titution(s) that follow CDC recommendations as stated in Updated CDC Recommendations for the Management of Hepatitis B Virus -Infected Health -Care Providers and Students MMWR 61(3):1-12, 2012. Institutions that ask for immunization and titer results should receive the student's test results. The 2012 CDC recommendations (MMWR 61(3):1 -12, 2012) state that institutional monitoring of student laboratory status with respect to the infection is unnecessary if the student, institution, and school are following the recommendations to prevent student -to-patient transmission. Chronic H epatitis B infection has been ruled by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to be disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that requires reasonable accommodations based o n the 2012 CDC recommendations for students infected with Hepatitis B. Failure to do so is considered discrimination by the DOJ under the ADA. Some institutions may have older policies that do not conform to the specific CDC recommendations in any number of aspects. If the student is denied opportunity to rotate at those institutions, the College of Medicine should inform the institution about the CDC recommendations and DOJ ruling to assist the institution in the revision of its policies. The student's n on-participation in restricted procedures must not be held against the student for grading and evaluation purposes. Education Director for the affected clerkships will be informed of the student's status and its procedure prohibitions. The student's observation of prohibited procedures (see Box) will serve as credit for that clerkship competency.

Statement issued on March 5, 2013 by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding H epatitis B discrimination (http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/March/13- crt-271.ht ml ). 74 N. Standard Universal Precautions When providing patient care, regardless of the real or perceived communicable disease status of the patient, all students and staff should follow standard universal precautions: Wash hands before and after patient contact, according to hospital policy, even if gloves are used. Wear gloves when exposure to blood, body fluids, excretions or secretions is likely. Use gloves appropriately according to aseptic and/or sterile techniques, and change gloves between patients. Wear impervious gowns/aprons when soiling of clothing with blood or body fluids is likely. Wear masks, face shields and eye protection when aerosolization of blood or body fluids may occur. Dispose of sharps in designated rigid sharp containers. Never recap a needle by hand. Dispose of waste saturated with blood or body fluids in designated red-bag biohazard trash containers. The student must be aware of infection control policy and use of PPE requirements at the institution to which the student is assigned. O. Bloodborne and Airborne Infections Acquisition of infections from patients and staff particularly due to respiratory pathogens is an all too frequent and avoidable event. To help protect students from this risk of nosocomially- acquired infection, the FSU College of Medicine has implemented a broad, multi -level educational program on respiratory pathogens. This program is based on the CDC/NIOSH curriculum on respiratory protection, with presentations given by physicians and nurses trained in current guidelines on prevention of respiratory infections. Students are taught about blood-borne and respiratory pathogens and protection guidelines during their first week of orientation. A second presentation on bloodborne and respiratory pathogens and guidelines for prevention is given at the end of the 2 nd year and refreshed during the orientation preceding the beginning of clinical rotations in the 3rd year. At this time further instruction on the importance of and the techniques of using personal protective equipment including appropriate fitting and testing of masks will be taught. Students infected with bloodborne or other pathogens shall not, solely because of such infection, be excluded from participation in any phase of medical school life, including educational opportunities, employment, and extracurricular activities, except as otherwise required by applicable federal, state, or local law or unless their healthcare condition presents a direct threat to the health and safety of themselves or others. Students infected with airborne pathogens may be excluded from participation in such activities during the infectious stage of their disease. In som e cases, students may be unable to participate fully in medical school life or meet the Technical Standards of the College of Medicine because of their disease. In these cases, the individual should contact the FSU Student Disability Resource Center to discuss the existence and nature of the disability and whether reasonable accommodations are available. Students who know or who have reasonable basis for believing that they are infected with bloodborne or airborne pathogens are expected to seek expert advice regarding their health circumstances to have a clear understanding of the medical issues presented by these infections. Supportive, confidential, and individualized counseling is available through the Unive rsity Health and Wellness Center and through affiliated facilities at the regional campuses. Students who are at high risk of infection from patients or other personnel because of their immune status or any other reason are encouraged to discuss their work responsibilities and educational activities with their personal healthcare provider. If the healthcare provider believes that there are certain assignments the individual should not accept for personal health reasons, this should be discussed with the appropriate administrator or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Accommodations may be available under the Technical Standards. P. Environmental Hazards Students working in circumstances where exposure to environmental hazards is possible will follow all regulations and protocols established by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), affiliated healthcare partners, and the Florida State University Use Protocol, including the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment. 75 Q. Occupational Exposure Incidents Students must immediately report any occupational exposure incident to their clerkship faculty member or immediate supervisor who will assist them in contacting the appropriate entities to follow the established protocol of that facility regarding occupational exposure incidents. In some circumstances, the costs incurred in dealing with occupational exposure incidents (such as testing) will be covered by the healthcare facility at which the exposure occurred. In some circumstances, the healthcare facility may refuse to bear financ ial responsibility for the exposure. In these cases, affected students will be liable for costs incurred. Students, who in the course of their education spend time at affiliated hospitals, should check t heir health insurance policies to determine if incidents of this type are covered. I f it is not covered, student must purchase a supplemental Blood and Body Fluid Exposure/Needles tick insurance policy on their own. Students should also be aware that if, in the course of the testing required by occupational exposure incident protocols, they test positive for potentially infectious agents such as AIDS, HIV, or TB, the Occupational Safety and Health Officer is required by law to report this information to the County Health Department. R. Confidentiality and Testing The College of Medicine shall respect the confidentiality of individuals with bloodborne or airborne pathogens to the extent permitted by state and federal law. Students and personnel will not be tested for HIV without their knowledge or consent, except that in certain circumstances testing may be a condition of employment or may be required by occupational exposure incident protocols. In cases of non- occupational exposure, confidential testing is available through University Health and Wellness Center or the local County Health Department. S. Student Exposure Control Plan At the time of matriculation, during orientation, in the Clinical Learning Center , at regional campus, and clinical affiliate orientation workshops, students are presented with the protocols and procedures for care and treatment should exposure to infectious agents occur. In the workshops, the exposure protocol and procedure is presented and reviewed. Students are provided a card which outlines these procedures after the matriculation orientation. The following is a summary of the protocol students are instructed to follow should exposure occur: The student must report any exposure to potentially infectious material (such as blood, open wounds, etc.) to their clinical instructor, immediate super visor or appropriate agency personnel immediately. The student's clinical instructor or immediate supervisor and the student will notify the College of Medicine (the Division of Student Affairs or the Office of Academic Affairs) of the exposure using the biohazard exposure incident report from form (Appendix G) and have the student report to their primary healthcare provider, student health services, or triage at the nearest hospital emergency department for evaluation and/or treatment as deemed necessary. The Division of Student Affairs should be notified of the exposure occurrence by the COM office that receives th e initial report. The incident, including the names of all contact points, is monitored by the Division for Student Affairs and maintained in the Enrollment Services Coordinator's Office. Upon exposure to blood and body fluid, the student assumes the responsibility for all charges associated with diagnosis and treatment. T. Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan If a student's exposure results in the contraction of a disease or disability, the student will be allowed to continue in the education program with as little disruption as safely possible. Accommodations approved by the FSU Student Disability Resource Center will be made as appropriate. Each student's circumstances will be evaluated on a case-by- case basis and recommendations regarding the student's progress through medical school will be submitted to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee for consideration. 76 As with any bloodborne exposure, appropriate documentation is necessary. The clinical site facility/office and the College of Medicine require that a formal report of the exposure incident or unusual occurrence be filed wi th the COM Division of Student Affairs. Protocols relating to screening and follow -up, for H epatitis -B vaccination, and HIV testing, should it be determined that exposure to Hep- B or HIV has occurred, are as follows: IMMEDIATELY following a needlestick, laceration, or skin exposure to blood/body fluid, wash the site with soap and water. DO NOT squeeze the affected area. For mucous membrane exposures, rinse the affected area with copious amounts of water (if exposure to eyes, remove contact lenses). Repor t the incident to the instructor/preceptor or appropriate agency QUICKLY!!!* The clerkship faculty or immediate supervisor will direct the student to triage at the nearest hospital and will notify the Division of Student Affairs or the Office of Academic A ffairs at the College of Medicine. For students at regional campuses, additional information and guidance can be obtained from regional campus Student Support Coordinators. The clerkship faculty or immediate supervisor must report, in writing, the incident to the Division of Student Affairs or the Office of Academic Affairs at the College of Medicine by way of the regional campus Student Support Coordinator by completing a Biohazard Incident Report form (Student Handbook, appendix G) as soon as the assessment procedures are completed. The Division of Student Affairs will receive a copy of the report. For students at the FSU COM main campus in Tallahassee, the Division of Student Affairs will coordinate with the University Health and Wellness Center to collect and assess, with the assistance of a physician who is mutually acceptable to the student and the College of Medicine, all of the information obtained about the incident to determine the risk of transmission, prophyl axis recommendations, and indicated follow -up. Should the incident occur at the one of the Regional Campus Sites, the Campus Dean will identify a physician mutually acceptable to the student and the College of Medicine, to collect and assess the informatio n obtained and to determine the risk of transmission, prophylaxis recommendations, and indicated follow -up. If post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is warranted, the most current regimen of prescription antiretroviral medications, as recommended by the CDC, wil l be started as soon as possible after the exposure. (Note: Counseling and consent are required prior to testing and treatment and is provided by certified counselors at the University Health and Wellness Center for t hose incidents that occur within the Tallahassee region. At the other Regional Campuses, consent and counseling through the contracted partners as available if needed prior to testing.). This will minimize the risk of HIV transmission from a KNOWN POSITIV E source.** If the student decides to take the medications, he/she will be followed closely by the University Health and Wellness Center and/or the student's physician to monitor physical and emotional health status up until time of graduation. Follow -up HIV tests are recommended at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure to monitor HIV status after exposure. It takes most newly in fected people 2 to 12 weeks (the \"window period\") after exposure to make enough antibodies to test positive. A negative HIV antibody test result means one of two things: (1) the individual is not infected with HIV or (2) the individual is in the \"window pe riod\" and can infect other people. Extended testing at 12 months after exposure is recommended for any student who contracts hepatitis C after the incident. Prophylaxis for hepatitis B may be indicated following a significant exposure, depending on the st atus of the exposed student, and the source patient. (College of Medicine students are required to have their immune status to hepatitis B on file .) If an exposed student is known to be immune to hepatitis B, neither prophylaxis of the student nor testing of the source patient is necessary. If an exposed student is unsure of his/her immune status, laboratory tests can be performed to determine his/her immune status as well as the h epatitis B status of the source patient. If the exposed student is not immune and the source patient is positive for hepatitis B, then immune globulin as well as initiation of the hepatitis B vaccine series would be indicated. Follow -up laboratory tests will be performed in 6 months to confirm that the student did not acquire hepat itis B as a result of the exposure. There is no post -exposure prophylaxis available for hepatitis C. Therefore, follow -up for this virus involves testing the source patient when available. The exposed student is also tested at the time of exposure and at i ntervals thereafter according to CDC guidelines. REMEMBER , THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH A BLOOD EXPOSURE ACCIDENT IS TO PREVENT ONE FROM OCCURRING!!! OBSERVE ALL PRECAUTIONS AT ALL TIMES!!! 77 HOWEVER, ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN AND YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!! REPORT THE OCCURANCE IMMEDIATELY!!! *Immediate notification will help to insure the timely implementation of post-exposure prophylaxis when indicated. PEP should be optimally be started immediately after an exposure risk when it is warranted. **If the source patient's HIV testing is unknown, PEP may or may not be recommended depending on the degree of exposure. U. Tobacco- Free FSU Effective January 1, 2014, all tobacco use, including simulated tobacco use (via e- cigarettes, e -hookah, vaporizers, etc.), is prohibited on property, interior and exterior, owned or managed by FSU. This policy applies to all FSU students, faculty, staff, consultants, contractors, visitors, and external individuals. Compliance is everybody's responsibility. Therefore, the success of this policy depends upon the goodwill of the College of Medicine community and the community at-large. Both tobacco users and non- users have a collective responsibility to ensure compliance. Any person found out of compliance with the policy should be informed about, and encouraged to enroll in, the campus Tobacco Cessation Program at University Health Services, the College of Medicine Tobacco Free Florida's (TFF) Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Tobacco Cessation Program, or other smoking cessation programs. Repeat offenders of this policy may be subject to receive further appropriate enforcement action. Visitors will be asked to comply or leave the premises. For more information about Tobacco- Free FSU, visit www.tobaccofree.fsu.edu . 78 X. COMMUNITY CLINICAL VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Students at Florida State University College of Medicine who participate in outside activities are acting as representatives of FSU COM and in doing so, MUST behave in a professional manner. It is expected that the student will dress appropriately and professionally. FSU COM identification must be worn by both students and faculty. Definition Students in the FSU COM are exposed to clinical experiences as part of the formal COM curriculum from the beginning of their training. However, the COM encoura ges students to volunteer in appropriate activities in the community outside the formal curriculum. These events include, but are not limited to community health fairs, free clinics, rural health screening s, high school athletic events, school physicals, etc. Students may not participate in clinical volunteer activities without the direct supervision of a physician faculty member, and these activities must receive prior approval from the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs in Years 1/2 or the regional campus dean in Years 3/4. These community clinical volunteer activities are generally, but not necessarily, sponsored by one of the COM's Student Interest Groups. Procedure for Student Participation To participate in these typ es of clinical volunteer activities, students must be in good academic standing and must be certified as such by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or regional campus dean. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs or regional campus dean will sign the \" Extracurricular Educational/Research/Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Approval\" form (Appendix C ) for each student wishing to participate in the activity. For students in years 1 and 2, the Appendix C sect ion is available through an electronic process that each student fills out at https://intranet.med.fsu.edu/sites/StudentAffairs/SAForms/SitePages/Home.aspx . If the activity is being done as a function of a student interest group, the leader of the Studen t Interest Group must complete a \"Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Pre-Event Request\" form (Appendix A for years 1 and 2, and Appendix B for years 3 and 4) for the group, including a list of names of all students wishing to participate, and obtain the signature of the faculty advisor and the physician supervisor/sponsor, if different. This fo rm, along with a completed copy of the \"Extracurricular Educational/Research/Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Approval\" form from each student wishing to participate (signed by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs) and any supporting documents (proposed contracts, etc.) should be provided to the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs to continue the process for obtaining final approval. For students in Years 3 and 4, these forms will be signed by the regional campus dean. This process should be completed at least three weeks prior to the date of the event. In the case of semester or year -long activities (sports team events, Neighborhood Health, etc.), one request form can be completed for the full period. Faculty Participation A physician faculty member must be present at any community healthcare event where COM students are participants. Should the official physician faculty advisor for the organization not be available, he/she is responsible for obtaining a substitute. If a physician supervisor/sponsor is not a faculty member, there must be e nough lead time for the application and appointment process, subject to approval of the applicant. A community clinical volunteer activity with a non-faculty physician supervisor/sponsor will not be approved. The FSU COM does not compensate for volunteer faculty participating in community clinical volunteer activities. Liability Coverage Students enrolled in the COM are covered by the State of Florida's sovereign immunity and the FSU COM's Self - Insurance Program when engaged in approved activities of the COM. Failure to obtain written approval in compliance with this policy will result in the student having no liability coverage for the community clinical volunteer activity. 79 Final Approval Once the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the regional campus dean have completed and signed the \"Extracurricular Educational/Research/Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Request and Approval\" forms, they will be given to the Student Support Coordinator, who will notify each student of his/her approval status. A copy of the form will be returned to the student. Use of CLC supplies for Community Events Certain equipment may be available on loan from the Clinical Learning Center (CLC) at the COM to students participating in an approved community clinical volunteer activity. A copy of the signed \"Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Pre - Event Request\" form and the student leader's \"Extracurricular Educational/Research/Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Reque st\" form must be presented to CLC staff along with a list of requested equipment. There will be a sign-out sheet for all equipment that includes date of return. The student is responsible for all equipment that is loaned from the CLC. Available equipment includes: blood pressure cuffs, glucometers with accompanying supplies, sharps containers, portable otoscope and ophthalmoscope, breast and prostate models. The final decision regarding l oan of any equipment from the CLC is at the discretion of the Director of the Clinical Learning Center . This decision may be based on a number of factors including equipment availability and the student's demonstrated skill in using the equipment. 80 XI. EXTRACURRICULAR EDUCATIONAL/RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Extracurricular Educational/Research Policy Definition : An extracurricular Educational/Research activity is an educational experience in a clinical setting that is not a part of the formal curriculum of the FSU COM, but may, at the discretion of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs or regional campus dean, be determined to provide so me educational benefit to the student. Academic credit will not generally be given for these experiences and they will not be a part of a student's official transcript. In some cases, research experiences may receive credit. Student participation To participate in these types of educational experiences, students must be in good academic standing and must be certified as such by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the regional campus dean. The student must complete \"Extracurric ular Educational/ Research/ Community Clinical Volunteer Request\" form (see appendix A and C) - available online for year 1 and year 2 students. Students must be approved to participate in these activities throu gh this process . If the student is in Year 3 or 4, the forms should be turned in to the Regional Campus Dean. If students are participating in the educational experience as part of an official COM student interest group, an officer of the organization m ay complete the \"Extracurricular Educational/Research Request\" form for the group, attach the names of all students wishing to participate, and obtain the signature of the physician/supervisor. This group form, along with a completed copy of the \"Extracu rricular Educational/Research/Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Approval\" form from each student wishing to participate should be provided to the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs (Year 1 or 2) or campus dean (Year 3 or 4) to continue the process for obtaining final approval. Research Activity Any M1 or M2 student interested in participating in a research activity is required to complete, and update as needed, a Research Notification Form (see appendix I ) before the activity can begin. Research activities include but are not limited to, human subjects research (chart reviews, surveys, focus groups) and research in basic science laboratories. This form applies to research activities conducted at the CoM as well as outs ide of the CoM by students, and must be submitted to the Assistant Dean for Graduate Programs and Medical Student Research . The Division of Research reviews and track M1 and M2 students' research. Your Research Proposal must be approved first before you be gin any research activity. Faculty Participation The physician/supervisor for these educational experiences must be a member of the FSU COM faculty. If a physician/supervisor is not a faculty member, there must be enough lead time for the application and appointment process, subject to approval of the applicant. An extracurricular educational/research activity with a non -faculty physician/supervisor will not be approved. The FSU COM does not compensate for volunteer faculty participating in extracurricular educational/research activities. Liability Coverage Students enrolled in the COM are covered by the State of Florida's sovereign immunity and the FSU COM's Self-Insurance Program when engaged in approved educational/research activities of the COM. Failure to obtain written approval in compliance with this policy will result in the student having no liability coverage for the extracurricular educational/resea rch experience. 81 Final Approval: Once the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education and Academic Affairs and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (or campus dean for Year 3 or 4) have completed and signed the \"Extracurricular Educational/Research/Community Clinical Volunt eer Activity Approval\" form, it will be given to the Student Support Coordinator, who will notify each student of his/her approval status. 82 XII. GUIDELINES FOR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES DURING BREAKS AND HOLIDAYS When participating in their role as FSU COM students and to be covered by the COM's liability insurance, students must complete the Community Clinical Volunteer Activity Pre-Event Request Form or the Extracurricular Educational/Research Request and Approval Forms as described in X and XI above. The supervising physician must be a COM faculty member for the activity to be approved. Students must be in good academic standing at the time of the activity. Students wil l be responsible for all costs associated with participation requirements (drug screens, background checks, etc.) . Students may not participate in extracurricular activities during scheduled required activities of the curriculum. If the above criteria ar e not met, the activity will not be approved and the student: 1. Must inform the physician that he/she is not enrolled as an active medical student and is doing this on his/her own. 2. Must not wear anything that identifies him/her as an FSUCOM student. 3. Must understand and inform the faculty member that he/she is not covered by FSUCOM liability insurance. 83 XIII. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS The student-run Medical Student Council coordinates College of Medicine student activities, working closely with student support coordinators, and serves as a funding board working with the FSU Student Government Association (SGA) and the Congress of Graduate Students (COGS) . Each College of Medicine student organization must be registered with the FSU Student Government Association. Medical students serve as senators to the SGA and as representatives on the COGS. Medical students may participate in any of the following FSU COM student organizations: a. Allopathic Integrative Medicine (AIM) b. American Medical Association / FL Medical Association c.

RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES While in medical school, it is very important to maintain balance in your life. FSU Campus Recreation offers several opportunities to keep your body as sharp as your mind and to help provide relief from the study demands of medical education. The following is a list of some of the best offerings for doing just that. A. FSU Campus Activities and Events The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce has an excellent array of activities on its website at http://www.visittallahassee.com/things -to-do/ . In addition, the following may be of interest: Arts Art Museums, the Museum of Fine Arts on campus and the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota. https://www.ringling.org/florida -state-university The Department of Dance has events in the Nancy Smith Fichte r Dance Theater in Montgomery Gym. http://dance.fsu.edu/Events Music Department has numerous concerts, recitals, and performance opportunities including choral ensembles, jazz bands, concert bands, chamber musi c, music theater, opera, and special ensembles. http://music.fsu.edu/Concerts -and-Events Seven Days of Opening Nights festival. https://openingnights.fsu.edu/ Sports and Recreation Campus Recreation Office is responsible for the Leach Center, Intramural Sports, Aquatics, FSU Reservation, Outdoor Pursuits, and Sports Clubs visit their website for detailed information. http://fsu.campusrec.com/ B. Exploring the World Beyond the FSU Campus When students feel the need to put the books aside and experience some \"down time\", Tallahassee and the surrounding area have a great deal t o offer. Beaches and Day Trips The little town of Sopchoppy, south of Tallahassee on Highway 319, offers kayaking and canoeing in the rivers that course the Apalachicola National Forest which are some of the most pristine rivers found anywhere. Go to the Backwoods Pizza in downtown Sopchoppy where river craft, guides, and pizza are available. St. George Island - St. George Island State Park is the closest \"real beach\" to Tallahassee. The St. George Island State Park is a quiet park consisting of untouched, pristine beaches and lapping surf. After a day in the sun, one can venture over the bridge to the towns of Apalachicola (pronounced Ap-a- lach-I-co-la) or Eastpoint and visit the quaint little shops and taste some of the best and freshest seafood in one of the local restaurants. Further west of Apalachicola on Highway 98, follow the signs to Cape San Blas, rated the number one beach in the United States. There are horseback rides on the beach, oyster bars, and a tour of St. Vincent Island where no motor vehicles are allowed. Panama City Beach, Seaside, Grayton Beach, Destin - These are the names of the beach towns located off Highway 98 heading west from Cape San Blas. Each has a unique feel and offers something for everyone - Panama City Beach's nightlife (especially during Spring Break), Seaside's architecture and quaint shops within an open air market, Grayton Beach's funky little shops, and Destin's outlet mall - make them all worth visiting. Wakulla Springs - Less than 30 minutes away is Wakulla Springs State Park, a beautiful place to cool off, picnic, and view several types of birds and reptiles in their natural North Florida habitat. The park surrounds a historic and rustic 85 hotel that houses a dining room, sitting area, and old- fashioned snack bar. Visitors can swim out to the raft in the crystal clear spring water, jump off the high dive, or take a \"Jungle Tour\" and witness an incredibly peaceful setting as well as real alligators, moor hens, and many other striking birds! Just a little bit of advice . . . swim before the boat ride, because alligator sightings up close, may make venturing into the cool spring waters a little questionable! Historic Havana - This little town is located approximately 30 minutes away north of Tallahassee off Route 27. Havana features antique stores, gift shops, restaurants, art galleries, and bed and breakfasts. Shopping There are two large malls in Tallahassee as well as some very unique independent shops and businesses. Some of the best include the Quarter M oon Import Shop on Lake Ella, The Museum Shop at Betton, Nomads on Gaines Street, Blue Abaco Trading Company off Capital Circle, Jane's Consignments and other small businesses in Market Square. More Tallahassee Activities and Attractions Tallahassee is home to some wonderful outdoor, recreational as well as indoor, mind-expanding spots. Some of the nicest places to walk and explore include: Maclay State Gardens, the Tallahassee Museum of History and Natural Science (also c alled the \"Jr. Museum\"), Tom Brown Park and Lake Ella. On a rainy or very hot day, venture downtown and enjoy the air -conditioned Mary Brogan Museum of Art & Science or the panoramic view from the 22 nd floor observatory. C. Regional Campus Activities A variety of recreational opportunities are available at each of the FSU COM Regional Campuses and Rural Programs. Information for each of the regional campuses and Rural Medical Education Program can be obtained from the FSU COM Regional Medi cal Campus Student Support Coordinator or the Rural Health Program Coordinator. 86 This Page Intentionally Left Blank 87 XVI.

Appendix I: Research Notification Form Appendix J: Student Study Space Policy FSU COM Study Space Policies Cell phones: In order to provide a quiet study atmosphere, students are asked to conduct phone conversations away from all study areas, including the hallways outside of the library, lower level space, and the 4 th floor individual study rooms. Students are also asked to turn off ringers while in the library and lower level space. Conversations: Students must respect the sound level designations of each study area. The library and the 4 th floor are for \"quiet studying\". If students would like to speak to a fellow classmate in the library, lower lever, or on the 4 th floor, they are asked to do so quietly and in a manner respectful of others who are studying. If they would like to hold a conversation, students are asked to first exit those study areas to maintain silence. Lost and Found: Lost and found items are to be taken to the front desk librarians if in the library, or to the Security Desk if found in any other location. If the items are found after hours and there is no one available to receive them, students may use their distribution lists to find the owner of the property via email or wait until the next day to turn the property in. Food and Beverages: Meals are not permitted in any of the shared study areas. Only beverages in closed containers will be permitted. Carrels and Study Rooms: In the College of Medicine, the carrels and individual study rooms are to be utilized on a first - come, first -served basis . Therefore, a student may not leave their belongings in a carrel or in an individual study room in an attempt to \"claim\" that area for a period of time. Students may leave their belongings in an area for up to 30 minutes should they need to leave a shared study area for any reason and must leave a note explaining their absence and anticipated re turn time . If a student is not back at said time, they should have an expectation for their space to be utilized by someone else and also that their study materials may or may not be moved to the 4 th floor conference room. You may not leave your study materials in any location to claim that location while you are in class. The 4 th floor study rooms are designed to hold 2 people. If you want single person access please consider using the Library. Reserved Space Use for Study Space: Certain rooms such as the Medical Student Council and Student Government conference room located on the 4 th floor are specified for business activities of these entities. Students have been allowed to use this space for study rooms when there are no official activities of these organizations. If there is a need by one of these groups to use this room, these organizations have priority for the room's use. Study Space Access: The primary purpose of the shared study areas is to serve the needs of the students and faculty of the College of Medicine. The 4 th floor and lower level study rooms are only to be utilized by College of Medicine students and not by any undergraduate students. If there is an unrecognized person utilizing the study space, you may ask to see their student ID or consider notifying security to approach the individual. "}
