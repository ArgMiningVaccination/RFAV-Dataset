These needles can be further activated by the practitioner or through electrical stimulation. Acupuncture is one key modality of the ancient practice of Traditional Chinese medicine, which works by aiding the body in healing itself. Traditional Chinese medical theory describes the human body as having hundreds of Acupuncture points connected by pathways pr meridians. these pathways create an energy flow (Qi) through the body that is responsible for overall health. Discruption of that energy flow can cause an imbalance of the body's physiological activity, resulting in disease. By applying Acupuncture to certain points, it is thought to improve the flow of Qi, thereby improving health. Studies have shown that Acupuncture is an effective tool for a variety of conditions in every system of the body. some common conditions treated include musculoskeletal conditions, nausea, headaches, infertility, menstural disorders, anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. "}
