[Simon & Schuster](https://www.scribd.com/Simon_and_Schuster) Reviews for The Encyclopedia of Crystals, Herbs, and New Age Elements 0 ratings0 reviews Book preview The Encyclopedia of Crystals, Herbs, and New Age Elements - Adams Media Introduction New Age is a broad term that is used to describe an Eastern-influenced cultural movement that arose in the Western world in the 1970s. The New Age movement has many subcategories, including medicine, spirituality, and environmentalism, and it continues to thrive around the world today in countless constantly evolving forms. If you've ever browsed around a New Age gift shop or bookstore, you've probably encountered a seemingly disconnected array of stones and crystals, herbs and spices, candles and incense, and books on topics ranging from astrology to yoga. Though these items all belong to disparate cultural traditions from different parts of the world at various points throughout human history, they are all part of the big New Age picture. For thousands of years, stones, herbs, and other natural elements have been used in cultures across the globe to promote health and prosperity, provide protection, ease pain and suffering, and facilitate spiritual enlightenment. While modern advances in science and medicine have brought us invaluable medications, treatments, and therapies, many of the world's oldest remedies and practices are still widely used and considered highly effective. Long before hospitals and pharmacies, there were plants. The first humans were hunter-gatherers who relied on the environment for survival. They learned which plants were toxic and which were beneficial, and they developed remedies for illness and discomfort that were honed and adapted over time. The same process occurred with other natural elements, from stones to scents. In ancient Egypt, stones and crystals collected from the earth were worn to draw sickness from the body. In ancient China, herbs and roots were used to treat ailments ranging from headaches to indigestion. Remains of incense dating back thousands of years have been found all over the world. All of these practices have persisted through history and continue to be used regularly in our modern lives. In this book, New Age novices and aficionados alike will find some of the most treasured New Age elements and practices, organized into ten chapters: stones, herbs, flowers, scent, fire and light, sound, insight, symbols, movement, and touch. Each entry covers information on the origins and various uses of the item or practice being discussed, including physical, spiritual, and magical applications. Many of the remedies and practices in this book belong to the tradition of holistic healing, a diverse field of alternative medicine that treats the whole person, not just a single ailment or condition. Practitioners of holistic medicine believe that a person is made up of parts and if one part isn't working properly, it has a negative effect on the whole. Holistic healthcare practices covered in these pages include herbal medicine, acupuncture, and massage. Some of the items discussed in this book have feng shui uses. Feng shui is the ancient Chinese practice of arranging the objects in your environment in a way that facilitates a free flow of energy. The bagua, which means eight-sided figure or octagon, is your feng shui map. You may also see references to chakras throughout the book. In Hindu, yogic, and other traditions, the chakras are the energy centers in the body, arranged vertically along the spine. Each chakra governs a different kind of energy and connects to a different area of the physical body. The seven major chakras, from the top down, are: Crown chakra: Located at the top of the head, the crown chakra controls mental energy and is our connection to the divine. Third-eye chakra: This chakra, located between the eyes, is the seat of intuition. It governs our imagination, wisdom, and decision-making. Throat chakra: The throat chakra rules communication and expression, and is the source of personal truth. Heart chakra: This chakra is found in the middle of the chest and is all about love, joy, and inner peace. Solar plexus or navel chakra: This is the power chakra, the core self, located in the center of the abdomen. Sacral or base chakra: This is the pleasure center of the body, located in the lower abdomen, below the navel. It is the source of confidence and self-worth, and it also rules sexuality. Root chakra: Located at the base of the spine, this chakra is the foundation of the body and governs spiritual and physical grounding. Some of the items found in these pages will be very familiar\u2014you may already have them in your spice cabinet, garden, or backyard\u2014but you'll learn new ways to use and enjoy them. Others may be totally new to you, and you may soon find yourself with a new hobby! Feel free to cherry-pick through the book and look up the items that most interest you. Curious about the healing powers of crystals? Check out Chapter 1. Looking for an herbal remedy for an ailment? Chapter 2 has you covered. Perhaps you're interested in some of the more magical New Age practices such as numerology or tarot (see Chapter 7). And what on earth is Rolfing, anyway? (Chapter 10 has the answer.) Be sure to check the glossary for any unfamiliar terms you find along the way. Let this handy book be your go-to reference for all things New Age. As you read, remember that many of the items and practices in this book are very personal and the way they are experienced depends on the individual. What works for someone else will not necessarily work for you. Listen to your heart, body, and mind as you try out these New Age staples. Above all, enjoy the journey! 1 THE POWER OF STONES: Crystals and Gemstones Stones have been used for millennia to treat physical ailments and balance the energies of the body, as well as to facilitate mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. They work through resonance and vibration, and through the minerals and other substances they contain. For example, the high concentration of copper in malachite can help reduce the swelling and inflammation that cause joint and muscle pain, and an analgesic called succinic acid is released when amber is warmed by the skin, making it helpful for treating arthritis and toothaches. Stones can be found in two forms: raw and tumbled or polished. Raw stones are in their natural state, which means they may be sharp-edged or craggy and can be fragile. Tumbled or polished stones have been tumbled with fine sand or grit to smooth their edges. As a result of this process, tumbled stones are much more durable than raw stones and can be kept together (in a soft bag, for example), whereas raw stones should be kept separate to prevent scratching and breakage. There are two main approaches to choosing a crystal or gemstone: You may be looking to treat a specific ailment or issue, or you may be simply searching for a stone that resonates with you. If you are completely new to the world of stones, your birthstone might be a great place to start. Otherwise, you can choose a stone by visiting a local store and browsing through its offerings. If a stone catches your eye, pick it up, hold it in your hand, and see how it feels. Trust your intuition. A stone that attracts your attention and feels right is the stone for you. Agate ORIGINS Agate is a form of chalcedony, which is a variety of quartz. Agates form in cavities in volcanic rock. Water and carbon dioxide bubble out of the volcanic rock and rise to the surface, and over time the minerals crystalize in layers. This is why agates generally have a banded appearance, with layers of different colors. Agate is found all over the world but was named for the Achates River (now the Dirillo River) on the island of Sicily, Italy, where agates were first found. HISTORY/LORE The use of agate goes back to the Neolithic era, when it was favored for both healing and ornamentation. The ancient Greeks had many uses for agate. For example, moss agate, which does not have the classic layered appearance but instead has colors and patterns that resemble plant life or landscapes, was considered helpful in ensuring a plentiful harvest. Many cultures throughout history have believed that wearing agates protects against tragedy and evil. USES Healing Uses: There are many varieties of agate, and they have a wide range of healing uses. Blue lace agate, named for its lavender-blue color and lace-like pattern, is a calming stone that is used to soothe headaches, digestive discomfort, and skin issues, especially eczema. Fire agate, whose iridescent rainbow colors are reminiscent of a flame, can increase circulation and battle lethargy and depression. Because of agate's connection with the throat chakra, it is often worn around the neck to soothe coughs, sore throats, and even dental issues. Magical Uses: Agates exhibit both the strength of a stone and the fluidity of air and water, making them useful as balancing and grounding stones. They are excellent for stabilizing energy and combating negativity and bitterness. Agates are often used in ceremonies concerning love, healing, protection, and courage, and many believe that a person can tell only the truth when looking at an agate. Feng Shui Uses: Because agates have a soothing quality, it's helpful to place them in any area of your home that would benefit from a gentle, calming influence. Different varieties of agate can be used for different purposes around the home. A blue lace agate can be helpful in the Health/Well-Being and Wealth/Prosperity sectors of your home, while a fire agate can create energy in the Marriage/Relationships sector, such as the bedroom. Personal/Spiritual Growth: Agates raise consciousness and awareness of the self, encouraging contemplation that can lead to deep spiritual understanding and growth. They also enhance mental function and improve concentration and analytical abilities, which can be helpful for problem solving. Additionally, agates can be used to boost confidence and are specifically helpful with public speaking, stuttering, and related issues. Amber ORIGINS Contrary to its appearance, amber is neither a stone nor a crystal; it's actually fossilized tree resin. Trees secrete resin to heal wounds and protect themselves against disease, and over time the resin dries and hardens. Long after the tree is gone the resin remains, and over the course of millions of years it becomes amber. Amber deposits have been found in places all over the world, including Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and the coast of the Baltic Sea. Baltic amber is the most well-known variety. HISTORY/LORE Amber has long been used in jewelry and other types of ornamentation, and many cultures have believed it holds magical powers. The ancient Greeks used amber to promote good health and ward off evil. The Aztecs and the Maya burned it as incense. Today, in addition to its continued use in jewelry and other art objects, amber is also valuable in the field of science for the insects and plant life it often contains. USES Healing Uses: Amber contains an analgesic called succinic acid, which is released when it is warmed by the skin. For this reason, necklaces and bracelets of amber beads are worn to ease arthritis and joint pain, as well as to soothe teething pain in infants and young children. Amber is an ingredient in many ointments and creams for burns and insect bites, and it is also used in cosmetics to destroy free radicals associated with aging. Wearing amber opens the solar plexus chakra and balances the energy of the body. Magical Uses: Because amber is warm to the touch and yellow or orange in color, it is believed to hold the power of the sun, absorbed by the ancient trees that produced it. Use amber in meditation to tap into the wisdom of our ancestors and remember past lives, or to improve memory and boost confidence. Feng Shui Uses: Place a piece of amber in the Health/Well-Being sector of your home to support good health and create a feeling of balance and calm. In the northeastern area, amber encourages self-exploration and wisdom. Place amber in pairs in the southwestern area to strengthen relationships. Personal/Spiritual Growth: Amber helps you connect to your inner wisdom, bridging the gap between your everyday self and your spiritual core. It brings out your innate talents and abilities and enhances creativity so that you may more easily achieve your goals. It can also be used for psychic or physical protection. Amethyst ORIGINS Amethyst is a variety of crystalline quartz that ranges in color from violet to mauve. The color of the amethyst changes in response to heat; depending on the temperature, it can become a range of colors, from reddish brown to yellow and even colorless. The majority of the world's commercial citrine is actually heat-treated amethyst (see Citrine in this chapter). The most significant deposits of amethyst are found in southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Madagascar, and it is also found in parts of Germany and Russia. HISTORY/LORE According to legend, the Greek god of wine, Dionysus, once pursued a nymph named Amethyst, who wished to escape his advances. The nymph asked for the help of the goddess Diana, who transformed her into a clear crystal. When Dionysus saw what she had done, he threw wine angrily upon the crystal, giving it its purple color. The ancient Egyptians believed amethyst could assuage fear and guilt, and the Greeks and Romans used it for protection against overindulgence in food and alcohol. USES Healing Uses: Amethyst strengthens the immune system and supports oxygenation in the blood. For headaches, rub an amethyst crystal on your forehead. Placing amethyst under your pillow combats insomnia and brings pleasant dreams, and it may also help you remember your dreams upon waking. Amethyst is often incorporated in treatments for alcohol and drug addictions. Magical Uses: This purple crystal has calming effects, defending against stress and negative energy. Amethyst is connected to the third-eye chakra (located between the eyes), which is responsible for intuition, and the crown chakra (at the top of the head), which controls mental energy. Wear amethyst jewelry to heighten awareness and relieve mental tension. As a talisman, amethyst brings feelings of pure happiness and love. Feng Shui Uses: Amethyst is often used in purification rituals and can be helpful in calming household turbulence. It can also bring change when needed. Place it in the northeastern area of your home to foster wisdom. Personal/Spiritual Growth: Amethyst is the birthstone for the month of February. It facilitates spiritual awareness and forges a connection to the inner self. It also protects against psychic danger, especially during spiritual exploration. It is great for use in meditation practices because it helps ease the transition to a meditative state and encourages focus. Aquamarine ORIGINS Aquamarine is a blue-green, transparent variety of the mineral beryl, which is colorless in its pure form. The blue-green color of aquamarine is a result of the presence of iron in the crystal. The word aquamarine comes from the Latin aqua marina, meaning seawater. The stone is quite common, with major deposits occurring in Brazil, and it has also been found in other parts of the world, including the United States. HISTORY/LORE Greek sailors believed aquamarine was the treasure of mermaids, and carried it for good luck and protection as well as to prevent seasickness on sea voyages. The crystal was believed to be especially powerful when immersed in water. The Romans used aquamarine to cure throat, liver, and stomach ailments. Aquamarine has long been used to counteract the forces of evil and win the favor of the spirits. USES Healing Uses: This crystal strengthens the cleansing organs of the "}
