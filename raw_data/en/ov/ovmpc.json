GENERAL INFORMATION yVAERS (www.vaers.hhs.gov) is a national vaccine safety monitoring system that collects information about adverse events (possible reactions or problems) that occur during or after administration of vaccines licensed in the United States. yVAERS protects patient identity and keeps patient identifying information confidential. yThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule permits reporting of protected health information to public health authorities including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b)). yVAERS accepts all reports without judging the importance of the adverse event or whether a vaccine caused the adverse event. yAcceptance of a VAERS report by CDC and FDA does not constitute admission that the vaccine or healthcare personnel caused or contributed to the reported event. yThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The VICP is separate from the VAERS program and reporting an event to VAERS does not constitute filing a claim for compensation to the VICP (see www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html ). yKnowingly filing a false VAERS report with the intent to mislead the Department of Health and Human Services is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment. yOther (specify) (specify) yUnknown For "}
