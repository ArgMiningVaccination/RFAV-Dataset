Mar 01 2021 According to research conducted into vaccines aimed at inoculation against all kinds of diseases, the number one obstacle to efficacy is obesity. The excess weight that is being carried around exerts undue pressure on the immune system, meaning it must divert attention to handling the extra kilos and cannot process the vaccine as effectively. With that in mind, those in line for a coronavirus jab are advised to reassess their daily lifestyle and attempt to get in shape if necessary. Even a short-term change in the run-up to the vaccination can have a significant effect, according to leading experts in the field. This means cutting out the worst offenders which tax our bodies and concentrating on healthier ways of living. The worst foods for vaccine efficacy Thanks to [the wonders of modern food analysis](https://www.labmate-online.com/article/laboratory-products/3/international-labmate-ltd/food-analysis-has-never-been-so-challenging-or-exciting/2886), the following five types of food and drink have been identified as ones to be avoided if the vaccine is to be given the maximum opportunity to work its magic and fend off the deadly COVID-19: - Processed foods. This wide category of foodstuffs includes anything that has been significantly altered from its natural state to contain too many unhealthy ingredients. White bread, crisps, doughnuts and sugary cereals are among the worst offenders. - Fast food. Unsurprisingly, the high calorie, highly processed and low nutritional content of fast food is packed full of salts, sugars and fats. What's more, the actual ingredients (whether they be meat or vegetables) are often of very poor quality in order to cut costs. - Sugary drinks. Quite aside from [the potential presence of elemental contaminants](https://www.labmate-online.com/article/mass-spectrometry-and-spectroscopy/41/thermo-fisher-scientific/analysis-of-elemental-contaminants-in-beverages-using-the-thermo-scientific-icap-pro-x-duo-icp-oes/2769)in sugary drinks like cola or fruit juices, they carry virtually no nutritional benefits and can encourage the contraction of diabetes, heart disease and weight gain, among other complaints. - Energy drinks. Similarly, the stimulants and chemicals contained within artificial energy drinks make you dependent upon them to feel energetic, all the while overloading your system with sugars and preservatives that tax your immune system. - Alcohol. Those who consume alcohol on a regular basis have a higher chance of dying prematurely, so it's not a shock that doing so will have other unwanted side effects, as well. These include infertility, osteoporosis, liver damage and reduced vaccine efficacy. Other factors to consider As well as reducing or eliminating your intake of the above foods to follow a healthier diet, a recent study from Ohio State University also recommends increasing exercise and reducing stress in your daily life. That's due to the fact that both can be factors in determining whether a coronavirus vaccine is effective or not. \"The power to make improvements that give us the best chance for a healthy response to the coronavirus vaccine is almost completely in our control,\" [explained ](https://ilmt.co/PL/JOgB)the authors of the study. \"Managing stress through exercise and mindfulness meditation, getting enough sleep, quitting or curbing tobacco use - even in the short term, right around the time of vaccination - could influence how our bodies respond, the evidence suggests.\" Digital Edition [](/digital-editions/digital-edition/international-labmate-486-september-2023/2023/9/632) [International Labmate 48.6 - September 2023](/digital-editions/digital-edition/international-labmate-486-september-2023/2023/9/632) September 2023 In This Edition Chromatography Articles - Faster and automated analysis of aroma compounds in cosmetics Mass Spectrometry & Spectroscopy Articles - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) abou...
