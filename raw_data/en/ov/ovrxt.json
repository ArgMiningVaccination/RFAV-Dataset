Healthy Drink Choices Managing diabetes involves balancing what you eat and drink with physical activity and medicine, if needed. Food often takes center stage when it comes to diabetes, but beverages can also affect your weight and blood glucose. That's why the American Diabetes Association recommends drinks that have zero calories or are very low in calories. Water is one of the healthiest and easiest choices you can make. What Drinks Are Zero -Calorie or Very Low -Calorie? All of these drinks provide no or just very small amounts of calories and carbohydrate: Water (still or sparkling) Unsweetened or diet teas Coffee Diet soda Other zero- and low-calorie drinks and drink mixes What Drinks Should I Avoid? Regular soda, fruit punch, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweet tea and other sugary drinks are not healthy choices. These will raise blood glucose and may have several hundred calories in just one serving! See for yourself: One 12-ounce can of regular soda has about 150 calories and 40 grams of carbohydrate. This is the same amount of carbohydrate in 10 teaspoons of sugar! One cup of fruit punch has about 100 calories (or more) and 30 grams of carbohydrate. continued on next page 10 Zero - or No-Calorie Drinks 1 Water 2 Sparkling, seltzer, or mineral water 3 Unsweetened iced tea 4 Infused water (with crushed fresh mint, for example) 5 Unsweetened coffee 6 Water with a squeeze of lemon 7 Diet iced tea 8 Diet soda 9 Unsweetened hot tea 10 Zero- or no- calorie drink mixes continued from previous page What Can I Drink? Bored with Water? Here are some easy ways to jazz up plain water: Squeeze in some zing. A quick squeeze of lemon juice is delicious. Infuse it with flavor. Fill a pitcher with water and add sliced fruit or vegetables (oranges, berries, peaches, and cucumber are tasty), fresh herbs, or a combination of these fresh items to your water. Stick the pitcher in the refrigerator for a few hours so the flavors and aromas meld and you'll have a crisp, refreshing drink! Use no - or low-calorie drink mixes. Mix a single- serve packet with a bottle of water for an on -the-go option. Or, choose other no -calorie drinks: Opt for sparkling water for a change. Or try seltzer, club soda or mineral water. Add a squeeze of lime or no- calorie flavoring for extra zing. Try unsweetened tea and coffee. Both are very low in calories and carbohydrate. Have you heard that the caffeine in these drinks causes dehydration? This effect is mild, so you can count coffee and tea as part of your total daily fluid intake. What About Milk and Juice? Low-fat and fat-free (skim or nonfat) milk and 100% juice with no added sugar are also healthy drink options. These drinks have more calories and carbohydrate than zero- and no -calorie drinks, but they also have important vitamin s and minerals. In addition, milk provides protein. Just remember to control portion size, because the calories and carbohydrate can add up. Use a small glass instead of a large one to measure milk or juice. Some tips: Choose low-fat (1%) or fat -free (skim or nonfat) milk. Make sure that you count it in your meal plan. One cup of fat-free milk provides about 12 grams of carbohydrate, 80 calories, calcium and vitamin D. Try plain (unsweetened) fortified soy, rice or almond milk. These are great if you are lactose intolerant or don't like milk. If you drink juice, choose juices that are 100% juice with no sugar added on the label. Juice provides a lot of carbohydrate in a small portion, so count it in your meal plan and keep portions small. Just 4 ounces (1/2 cup) or less of juice contains 15 grams of carbohydrate and 60 calories. Try low-sodium vegetable juice. It has less carbohydrate than fruit juice, but plenty of vitamins. At just 50 calories and 10 grams carbohydrate for 1 cup, it's a healthy choice. Brought to you by SodaStream, a national supporter of Stop Diabetes\u00ae.

Myth #1: Fresh produce is superior to canned or frozen produce. Canned and frozen produce have nutrient contents comparable to that of even the freshest produce. But did you know that some \"fresh\" produce is picked long before it reaches the store? In this case, frozen may be fresher than fresh! Additionally, canned and frozen produce can be a helpful way to get more variety during winter, when fresh produce is either not available or too expensive. The bottom line : Any vegetable is better than no vegetable at all. Myth #2: Gluten is evil. If you cut it out, you will lose weight. The gluten- free diet is not a weight -loss diet. In fact, there is no evidence that gluten itself causes weight gain. On the other hand, a diet consisting of whole grains (both gluten- containing and gluten- free varieties), fresh produce and lean meats, and that is low in refined carbs will leave you feeling better and more energized, and help you lose weight since you will be fuller longer. The bottom line : The only people who need to avoid gluten are those who have a diagnosed autoimmune or digestive disorder such as celiac disease. Myth #3: Organic food is healthier than conventional food. Some studies comparing organic produce to conventional produce indicate that organic produce may have higher levels of vitamin C. However, these studies have not proven conclusively that organic produce is healthier than conventionally grown produce overall. There are a multitude of studies showing the benefits of conventional fruit and vegetable consumption. The bottom line : Your emphasis should be on meeting fruit and vegetable intake, whether organic or not. Myth #4: Sugar is bad; high-fructose corn syrup is of the devil. High-fructose corn syrup is a man- made sweetener found in many types of processed foods and sweetened beverages. Currently, there is no evidence to show that high- fructose corn syrup is any less healthy than other types of sweeteners. The bottom line : Too much added sugar, from any source, is not good for you. Myth #5: Alcohol is good for you. Recent studies have shown that alcohol may not be linked as strongly to disease prevention as previously thought, and that the adverse effects of alcohol consumption may outweigh the benefits. For instance, regular consumption of alcohol is directly associated with increased risk of developing several types of cancer, and the more alcohol you drink, the higher your risk. The bottom line : If you consume alcohol, do so in moderation. This means consumption of no more than one drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men. And, do not consume it for the health benefits. Myth #6: Taking a daily multivitamin promotes health. Unless you have a deficiency, nutrients are best absorbed from foods, which contain vitamins and minerals in addition to dietary fiber and other natural compounds. This combination of nutrients will have overall positive health benefits that you can't get from multivitamins. The bottom line : Routine supplementation in healthy individuals is not necessary. Myth #7: Eating protein builds muscle. Eating protein does not build muscle. Only exercise can build muscle! Regardless of whether you are an avid marathon runner or someone who enjoys regular physical activity, you will benefit from a balanced diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and fish. The bottom line : Cover just a quarter to a third of your plate with protein and your body will handle the rest! Myth #8: Milk is essential for bone health. Low calcium intake is linked to low bone mass and weakened bones. However, milk is not the on ly source of calcium in our diets. Non- dairy sources of calcium include leafy green vegetables such as collards and bok choy, plus soy products and baked beans. The bottom line : In addition to calcium, other bone- building nutrients include potassium, magne sium, vitamin K and vitamin D. Myth #9: Skinny is healthy. Weight is not a good indicator of health. Someone can be in the normal BMI range, but not be fit. Alternatively, if someone is above the normal BMI range and is fit, they have better health outcomes than someone of the same BMI who isn't fit. The bottom line : Instead of focusing on getting thin, focus on getting fit. Myth #10: Your body needs a \"cleanse\" \u2014 whether a juice cleanse or a colon cleanse \u2014 every once in a while. Our bodies already have a built -in detox system \u2014 our lungs, liver, kidneys and digestive tract all work together to eliminate toxins from our bodies. Detox diets set you up for even more weight gain when you go off of them, since they typically result in muscle loss. The bottom line : Long- term detoxing will deprive your body of the essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients it needs to function. Choose an eating pattern that promotes health.

Skipping Breakfast Can Be Hazardous Especially For Those With Diabetes More and more Americans on -the-go are skipping the \"most important meal of the day,\" not eating until lunch... This tendency to miss breakfast has already been linked to the growing epidemic of obesity and cardiovascular problems in the U.S. -- and it may put the health of diabetics at risk as well. Until now, very little has been known about the effect of skipping breakfast on type 2 diabetics. It was common that people thought that skipping breakfast would lower our blood sugars and reduce our calories and we would lose weight. Researchers, TAU's Prof. Daniela Jakubowicz and Prof. Julio Wainstein of the Wolfson Medical Center's Diabetes Unit, Prof. Oren Froy of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Prof. Bo Ahr\u00e9n of Lund University in Sweden. have found that, \"fasting\" until noon triggers major blood sugar spikes (postprandial hyperglycemia) and impairs the insulin responses of type-2 diabetics throughout the rest of the day. Prof. Jakubowicz, added that, \"It is quite remarkable that, for type 2 diabetic individuals, the omission of breakfast is associated with a significant increase in all-day blood sugar spikes and of HbA1C, which represents average blood glucose levels over the preceding three months.\" The clinical study was conducted on 22 type 2 diabetics who averaged 56.9 years old, with a mean Body Mass Index of 28.2 kg/m2. Over the course of two days, the participants consumed precisely the same number of calories and the same balanced meal -- milk, tuna, bread, and a chocolate breakfast bar -- for lunch and dinner. The only difference was that one day they ate breakfast and the second day they fasted until lunch. The researchers found that participants experienced extraordinary glucose peaks of 268 mg/dl after lunch and 298 mg/dl after dinner on days they skipped breakfast, versus only 192 mg/dl, and 215 mg/dl after eating an identical lunch and dinner on days they ate breakfast. \"This means that reducing the amount of carbohydrates in lunch and dinner will have no effect on reducing elevated glucose levels if diabetic individuals also skip breakfast,\" said Prof. Jakubowicz. According to the researchers, pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin, lose their \"memory\" due to the prolonged period between one evening's dinner and the next day's lunch. In other words, they \"forget\" their vital role. Therefore it takes additional time after lunch for the beta cells to recover, causing small and delayed insulin responses and resulting in an exaggerated elevation of blood glucose levels throughout the day. Another factor is that fasting until lunch increases the fatty acids in our blood, which renders insulin ineffective in reducing blood glucose levels. In conclusion, it is highly recommended that type 2 diabetics not skip breakfast, because it causes major damage to the beta cell function and leads to high sugar levels, even if they don't overeat at lunch and dinner,\" said Prof. Jakubowicz. The researchers are planning to conduct a similar study on type 1 diabetics, who require daily insulin treatment. Practice Pearls: Diabetics who skip breakfast provoke hazardous blood sugar spikes. Type 2 diabetics who 'fast' until noon risk day-long consequences of hyperglycemia. Reducing the amount of starch and sugars in lunch and dinner will have no effect on reducing elevated glucose levels if diabetic individuals also skip breakfast.

Skipping Meals Promotes Belly Fat Storage, Increases Risk For Insulin Resistance May 20, 2015 05:11 PM By Justin Caba@jcaba33 Skipping meals leads to abdominal weight gain. Photo courtesy of Shutterstock Anyone looking to lose weight knows they have to restrict the amount of calories they consume, but how much and when they restrict those calories can make all the difference. A recent study conducted at Ohio State University has revealed that skipping meals not only leads to abdominal weight gain, but it can also lead to the development of insulin resistance in the liver. \"This does support the notion that small meals throughout the day can be helpful for weight loss, though that may not be practical for many people,\" Martha Belury, professor of human nutrition at Ohio State University, said in a statement. \"But you definitely don't want to skip meals to save calories because it sets your body up for larger fluctuations in insulin and glucose and could be setting you up for more fat gain instead of fat loss.\" Belury and her colleagues divided mice into tw o groups: one group that was put on a restricted diet and a second group that was put on an unlimited diet. Mice from the restricted diet group received half of the calories that were given to the unlimited diet group in the first three days before having additional calories added. Although mice in the restricted diet group initially lost more weight compared to those from the unlimited diet group, they regained that weight as calories were added back into their diet. By the end of the study, the weight of the restricted diet group was similar to the unlimited diet group. However, restricted diet mice had gained more weight around their midsection. Weight around the midsection of mice was likened to belly fat in humans, which is often associated with insulin resistance and higher risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease. \"With the mice, this is basically binging and then fasting,\" Belury exaplined. \"People don't necessarily do that over a 24 -hour period, but some people do eat just one large meal a day. Under conditions when the liver is not stimulated by insulin, increased glucose output from the liver means the liver isn't responding to signals telling it to shut down glucose production. These mice don't have type 2 diabetes yet, but they're not responding to insulin anymore and that state of insulin resistance is referred to as prediabetes.\" As the study continued, mice developed gorging eating habits that caused them to finish their daily amount of food in around four hours and fast for the remaining 20 h ours of the day. Gorging and fasting among mice led to a spike and then a severe drop in insulin that causes a variety of metabolic issues. Mice from the restricted diet group often experienced elevations in inflammation and a higher activation of genes that lead to the storage of fatty molecules and plumper fat cells \u2014 predominantly in the midsection. \"Even though the gorging and fasting mice had about the same body weights as control mice, their adipose depots were heavier,\" Belury added. \"If you're pumpi ng out more sugar into the blood, adipose is happy to pick up glucose and store it. That makes for a happy fat cell \u2014 but it's not the one you want to have. We want to shrink these cells to reduce fat tissue.\" A similar study conducted at the Oregon Research Institute (ORI) found that skipping meals or restricting the number of calories you consume each day can actually make unhealthy food more attractive. When adolescents who willingly curbed their eating habits were shown pictures of unhealthy but appetizing food, brain imaging showed a spike in hyperactivity. So, no matter the reason, skipping meals is depriving the body of essential nutrients. Source: Kliewer K, Ke J, Belury M, et al. Short -term food restriction followed by controlled refeeding promotes gorging behavior, enhances fat deposition, and diminishes insulin sensitivity in mice. The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. 2015. In order to stay healthy and avoid obesity, it is not only important to be careful what you eat. Tel Aviv University researchers have now found that it's not just what you eat, but also when. The Israeli research teams findings have been published in \"Obesity\". Daniela Jakubowicz and her fellow researchers examined 93 obese women, who were randomly assigned to one of two isocaloric groups. Each consumed a moderate-carbohydrate, moderate- fat diet totaling 1,400 calories daily for a period of 12 weeks. The first group consumed 700 calories at breakfast, 500 at lunch, and 200 at dinner. The second group ate a 200 calorie breakfast, 500 calorie lunch, and 700 calorie dinner. The 700 calorie breakfast and dinner included the same foods. By the end of the study, participants in the \"big breakfast\" group had lost an average of 17.8 pounds each and three inches off their waistline, compared to a 7.3 pound and 1.4 inch loss for participants in the \"big dinner\" group. According to Jakubowicz, those in the big breakfast group were found to have significantly lower levels of the hunger-regulating hormone ghrelin, and also showed a more significant decrease in insulin, glucose, and triglyceride levels than those in the big dinner group. More important, they did not experience the high spikes in blood glucose levels that typically occur after a meal. Hence the saying, \"Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and supper as a pauper\"!!! Successful grocery shopping is about focusing on what's healthy, nutritious and tasty, so you'll actually enjoy eating it. Diabetes educators can help people with diabetes make informed choices by explaining how different types of foods affect your diabetes, and sharing strategies about how to approach grocery shopping so it can help you meet your goals. They recommend starting with these tips: Grocery shopping can be a useful tool for diabetes management, if you do it wisely. Find a diabetes educator near you who can help you determine the best way to harness its power. First, make a list - Create a list of items you need a t the grocery store before you go. Think of the meals you'll make, the staples you're running low on and perhaps a new, healthy recipe or food item you'd like to try. Organize the list by food group to speed up the process and keep you on track. If nothing is written under the vegetable category, that's a red flag; think about what vegetables you want to eat, and consider searching for a new recipe that you can get excited about. Make copies of a standard list you can update every time you go, or try a smart phone shopping app. Ea t before you go - It's never a good idea to go shopping when you're hungry; that's when you're more likely to make poor choices. Eat a healthy meal or snack. Th ink inside the box, or bag or can - Fresh fruits and vegetables are great, but they aren't your only option. Dried, canned and frozen fruits and vegetables offer nutrients, too, and can be healthy, easy and affordable additions to your diet. Look for fruits that are packed in juice rather than heavy syrup. Look for \"low-sodium\" or \"no salt added\" canned vegetables. Be aware that starchy vegetables such as peas, corn and potatoes contain more carbohydrates than other vegetables. Re ad labels - Look past the \"sugar free\" or \"low fat\" claims. Read the nutrition label for specific information (from fat to carbohydrates to vitamins), noting the amounts that one serving of that food provides. Specifically: Con sider the carbohydrates - Looking at sugar content is fine, but it's more important to consider the amount of \"total carbohydrates,\" which affect your blood sugar. Work with a diabetes educator to learn how many grams of carbohydrates are appropriate for you to eat per snack, meal and day. Fo cus on fiber - Choose whole grain bread, rice, pasta and cereal. Then look for those that are a good source of fiber (2.5 grams or more per serving) or high in fiber (5 grams or more per serving). A healthy diet includes 25 to 30 grams of fiber from foods a day. Other good sources of fiber are beans, vegetables and fruits. Hu nt for healthy fats - Fats are an important part of every diet, but it's important to lean towards those that are heart-healthy, such as olive and canola oil, avocado and nuts, limiting them if you are watching your weight.CONQUERING THE GROCERY STORE PLANNING AHEAD CAN HELP WITH DIABETES MANAGEMENT Grocery shopping usually isn't at the top of anyone's list of fun activities. For people with diabetes it can seem especially overwhelming - The carbohydrates! The sugar! Making healthy choices! But with a little planning, grocery shopping can be a very effective tool in meeting goals, from managing blood sugar levels to losing weight. \"Planning ahead and shopping carefully are two great ways to take control, because you can get more out of your time and efforts,\" said Melissa Joy Dobbins, MS, RDN, CDE, a Chicago-area diabetes educator and spokesperson for the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE). \"It keeps you focused so you'll buy more foods that are healthy and fewer that have little or no nutritional value. That way you don't have to rely on your willpower when you're back home to eat less of certain foods and more of others.\"www.diabeteseducator.orgThe EdibleRx: Don 't Demonize Processed Food \u2014 'Processed food' has erroneously become a euphemism for bad food. PRIMARY CARE 02.04.2015 0 COMMENTS I'm not sure anything garners more discussion in the nutrition world these days than the term \"processed food.\" Everyone from nutrition experts (a non- standardized term that's used too broadly) to food writers to chefs recommend avoiding \"processed food,\" because it's bad. And, woe to the health professional , who disagrees with any part of that statement. Is there a clear definition of \"processed food?\" In a word, no. Most foods are processed in some way. Processing can encompass a whole range of things that are routinely done to food to make them more palatable, including cooking, blanching, peeling, grinding, chopping, fermenting, canning, pureeing, baking, and so on. Unless you bite the apple while it's on the tree, it's probably processed in some way, as even washing a food is by Keith Ayoob, EdD, RD it's probably processed in some way, as even washing a f ood is processing it to some degree - you're making it cleaner to eat. Processing actually serves a helpful purpose. I'd never tell a patient of mine to eat raw meat, for example. Indeed, please do process it to the proper temperature to turn it into a foo d that is safe and healthful to eat. Even if you choose to eat raw fish as sushi, it needs to be scaled and cleaned, thank you. Again, more processing. Preserving food by drying, freezing, or canning has made it possible for people in the past and present to continue eating fruits and vegetables (or fish and meat) out of season or when availability and access to food is difficult or uneconomical. Yes, those organic raisins and canned garbanzo beans are \"processed food.\" Organic refers only to the growing me thod - it doesn't mean the food is less processed. I'm a huge fan of low -fat milk and yogurt. Most days I eat both. Ironically, yogurt seems to have more of a halo, but it's also more processed. It has to undergo more processing than plain milk, which is processed minimally - just pasteurization and that's about it. Yogurt is pasteurized, but then fermented and flavored to produce something that consumers will like and eat. Should consumers be concerned about this extra \"processing?\" Not a bit. It's a great food and people would be better off eating yogurt instead of some of the stuff they now have as a snack or at breakfast. The point here is that processed food has erroneously become a euphemism for bad food, and that's wrong. When people speak of \"processed food\" they usually refer to mass -produced stuff that is often packaged to make it convenient, and it often contains refined grains and added fats or sugars. Fine and well to cut back consumption there, and we should be telling our patients to eat fewer of those foods. Notice I said \"fewer\" rather than \"none.\" Refined grains and some added fats and sugars crop up here and there but no need to demonize them, especially if the rest of the patient's diet is pretty good. But let's not jump on the \"avoid - proce ssed -food\" bandwagon just so we're trendy. Health professionals need to be the voices of informed reason. The last thing we should be doing is reinforcing absolutes, especially in the absence of proper context. Keith Ayoob, EdD, RD, is a pediatric nutritionist focused on obesity and heart health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. His column appears here weekly. Ayoob works with dairy and soybean producers, Dannon, the Calorie Control Council, and the Disney organization. Most of this work is in the form of advice and consultation on nutrition policy issues. Ayoob disclosed financial relationships with dairy, soybeans, Dannon, the Calorie Control Council, and also Disney to provide advice and consultation on nutrition policy issues. Applauding Fiber In May of 2015 there was more evidence released that a high fiber diet helps protect against type 2 diabetes. It was presented in research published in DIABETOLOGIA, a respected journal. The Imperial Col lege London, looked at data on 29,238 Europeans tracked for an average of 11 y ears. Those with the highest amount of fiber in their diet (more than 26 grams a day) were 18 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest fiber intake (less th an 19 grams a day), even after the team accounted for other dietary and lifestyle factors. Obesity was key. The researchers said that when a person's body mass index was accounted for, the benefits of a high fiber diet in warding off diabetes disappeared. When they focused on specific types of fiber, they found that people who consumed the highest amounts of cereal and vegetable fiber were 19 and 16 percent, respectively, less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those with who consumed the lowest amounts of these types of fiber. Cereals accounted for 38 percent of total fiber intake in the study, and were the main source of fiber in all countries except France, where vegetables were the main source of fiber. Consumption of fruit fiber was not associated with a lower risk of diabetes. The researchers also analyzed the findings of 18 other studies from the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. That analysis also found a lowering of type 2 diabetes risk as daily intake of fiber increased. \"Taken together, our results indicate that individuals with diets rich in fiber, in particular cereal fiber, may be at lowest risk of type 2 . Some other considerations in the benefits of fiber relate to improving control of blood sugar and decreasing insulin peaks after meals, and increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin.\" The 25 Lowest -Carb Vegetables It's not always easy to compare apples to oranges when it comes to carbs. Fruits and vegetables come in all shapes and sizes, and while it might seem like one is a lower-carb choice than another, it may just seem that way because of size and weight differences. We leveled the playing field for you here, so you can compare apples to apples ... so to speak!

More Evidence Supports Higher Fiber Intake to Lower DM Risk Effect might be largely due to weight loss linked to eating more grains and vegetables, experts say WEDNESDAY, May 27, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- More evidence that a high fiber diet helps protect against type 2 diabetes has been presented in research published online May 26 in Diabetologia. Dagfinn Aune, a Ph.D. student affiliated with Imperial College London, and colleagues looked at data on 29,238 Europeans tracked for an average of 11 years. Those with the highest amount of fiber in their diet (more than 26 grams a day) were 18 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest fiber intake (less than 19 grams a d ay), even after Aune's team accounted for other dietary and lifestyle factors. Obesity was key, however. The researchers said that when a person's body mass index was accounted for, the benefits of a high -fiber diet in warding off diabetes disappeared. Whe n the researchers focused on specific types of fiber, they found that people who consumed the highest amounts of cereal and vegetable fiber were 19 and 16 percent, respectively, less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who consumed the lowest amounts of these types of fiber. Cereals accounted for 38 percent of total fiber intake in the study, and were the main source of fiber in all countries except France, where vegetables were the main source of fiber. Consumption of fruit fiber was not associate d with a lower risk of diabetes. The researchers also analyzed the findings of 18 other studies from the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. That analysis also found a lowering of type 2 diabetes risk as daily intake of fiber increased. \"Taken toge ther, our results indicate that individuals with diets rich in fiber, in particular cereal fiber, may be at lower risk of type 2 diabetes,\" Aune, who is also affiliated with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said in a journal news release . He believes other mechanisms may be at work as well, \"for instance improving control of blood sugar and decreasing insulin peaks after meals, and increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin.\" Full Text Soluble fiber is a type of fiber that dissolves in water, and in so doing, transforms into a gooey, gummy, spongy mass that travels the length of the gut on its own timetable. But don't confuse this fiber's tendency to downshift digestive transit time with a constipating effect; rather, it is regulating. Soluble fiber still contributes to fecal bulk and is able to hold onto water, therefore contributing to stools that are soft, well -formed and easy to pass - the Platonic ideal of a poop. Generally, soluble fiber is found in the flesh of fruits, root vegetables and in cooked grains. Examples include beta glucan in oats and barley and pectin in apples and citrus fruits. Dried beans and legumes are an excellent source of soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber is what you might call \"roughage.\" When combined with water, its physical properties generally change very little; this is because it doesn't absorb water well. Therefore, insoluble fiber contributes bulk to the feces, helping to put pressure on the colon walls to stimulate a bowel movement. In this manner, insoluble fiber speeds up digestive transit time and is especially helpful when constipation is at issue. Insoluble fiber is found in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose from leafy veggies, fruit and vegetable skins or the bran layer of most whole grains; it's found in lignans from sesame or flax seeds and some mature vegetables. (A third type of fiber, called resistant starch, has some properties of both soluble and insoluble fiber. It's found in foods like beans, unripe bananas and potatoes that have been cooked and cooled.) A variety of different fibers from different foods sources will deliver a variety of different and important health benefits. Therefore, in healthy people without bathroom woes , the ideal diet would contain a mix of both fiber types. Certain types of soluble fiber help lower cholesterol levels. Insoluble fiber has been credited with helping to prevent colon cancer, since it helps speed toxins and cancer -causing food compounds out of the body without haste. Some fermentable types of both soluble and insoluble fiber help increase calcium absorption from the diet and stimulate the growth and activity of the gut's most beneficial bacterial populations. Both types of fiber also help delay stomach emptying after a meal and therefore tend to help improve blood sugar control. Generally, when constipation is a problem, a mix of both fiber types is helpful and well tolerated. But among people prone to diarrhea, urgent loose stools or \"hyperdefecation\" (increased frequency of bowel movements, even if they're not diarrhea), the mix of fiber in the diet may deserve more careful management. I often tell my patients with chronic diarrhea that soluble fiber in particular is their best friend: It helps slow down stool that's racing through the gut too quickly and can often consolidate trips to the bathroom for people who experience multiple, incomplete bowel movements in rapid succession. Lots of insoluble fiber, conversely, can make things a whole lot worse (particularly if it's not balanced out by some soluble fiber), exacerbating a pre- existing tendency toward urgent, loose bowel movements. For these patients, it can be helpful to think of soluble fiber as the \"anchor\" of each meal, ensuring that a fruit, veggie, grain and/or seed rich in soluble fiber plays a starring role in the mix. At the risk of overstating the benefits of this approach to dietary fiber manipulation, patients routinely describe the effect of so- called soluble fiber therapy as \"life changing.\" Furthermore, the timing of fiber intake can play a role in managing symptoms. For people prone to urgent, loose bowels in the morning specifically, limiting insoluble- rich foods like salads at dinner and including a soluble- rich veggie (squash, skinless sweet potato), cooked grain (rice, pearled barley, quinoa) and/or soluble fiber supplement (Citrucel, Benefiber) can help smooth out choppy morning bowel patterns. If symptoms tend to occur in the afternoon or evening, having a super -soluble breakfast (like oatmeal, chia seeds and banana) can help keep things flowing smoothly later on in the day. As you can see, there's a lot more to fiber than meets the eye - and more to know than what a typical nutrition label reveals. If you need help figuring out how to tweak the fiber content of your diet to optimize your health and digestive tolerance, consult a registered dietitian to help you navigate the supermarket shelves to your advantage. Heart Health Facts Small amounts of fat are essential for many body functions. Fat is an essential nutrient that provides calories for energy. Calories for energy are also from carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol. Fat provides 9 calories per gram of fat, carbohydrate and protein provide 4 calories per gram and alcohol provides 7 calories per gram. Besides providing calories fat helps our body absorb certain vitamins. Fat also insulates or pads our organs. There are four types of fat in our diet . Each type of fat affects heart health: MONOUNSATURATED FAT: BEST for heart health. Monounsaturated fats lower LDL the \" bad\" cholesterol, but do not affect HDL the \" good\" cholesterol POLYUNSATURATED FAT: Certain polyunsaturated fats lower LDL lev els, the \"bad\" cholesterol, but also lower HDL levels, the \" good\" cholesterol. Some polyunsaturated fats are beneficial. Omega 3 fats are recommended for heart health because Omega 3 fats lower triglyceride levels and may slightly raise HDL levels. Omega 3 fats also act to decrease plaque formation. SATURATED FAT: Raise LDL levels and increase the risk of heart and artery disease. TRANS FATS: WORST for heart health. Trans fats raise LDL levels and lower HDL levels. Most trans fats are found in processed foods. Hydrogenated oil or fat is a major source of trans fat. Food & Nutrition Almond Milk vs Cow Milk vs Soy Milk vs Rice Milk Written by Brian Krans Medically Reviewed by Peggy Pletcher, MS, RD, LD, CDE on September 17, 2014 Not too long ago, when being a milkman was a career option, the only thing you could expect to drown your cereal in was whole cow's milk. Now, dairy milk comes in all sorts of varieties: whole milk, 2 percent, 1 percent, skim (fat-free), and even lactose -free milk. What's your favorite kind of milk? \u00bb For those with dietary or allergy concerns, there are also alternatives to cow's milk. Almond, soy, and rice milk are popular alternatives to dairy, and they're becoming even more available in stores across the U.S. Each type of milk has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on a person's diet, health, nutritional needs, or personal taste preferences. For example, people in key development years \u2014 children over two, teens, and pregnant women \u2014 need proteins, vitamin D, and calcium. These are abundant in dairy milk. On the other hand, people who need to watch their calories or cholesterol \u2014 for wei ght reasons or heart health problems \u2014 should look to other options. Whole dairy milk contains more calories and cholesterol than any other milk. In looking at the differences in these popular types of milks, you can determine which best suits your needs. Dairy Milk Whole milk is cow's milk with none of the fat removed. It contains 8 grams of fat per cup, 8.5 percent nonfat milk solids, and 88 percent water. As none of the milk's natural components are removed, it is high in natural proteins , fat, calcium , and vitamin D . Other dairy milk has some or all of the fat removed. While whole milk has 150 calories in one cup, 1 percent milk has 110 calories, and skim milk has just 80 calories. Fat -free milk has all of the nutritional benefits of whole milk \u2014 a good source of protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals \u2014 without the saturated fat and calories, though absorption of some vitamins may be reduced due to the lack of fat. Lactose -free milk is processed to break down lactose, a natural sugar found in milk products. As with other milks, lactose -free milk is a good source of protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals. The fat and cholesterol content of lactose -free milk varies, as it comes in 2 percent, 1 percent, and fat-free varieties. The 3 Best Things About Da iry Milk 1. Whole milk can provide essential proteins and extra calories from fats, as well as vitamins and minerals for infants and the elderly. 2. Lactose -free versions are available for people who are lactose intolerance. 3. Widely available in grocery stores and convenience stores, including grass-fed and low-heat pasteurized milk options. Con: Those that are not fat-free are high in saturated fat and calories, which is bad news for people with heart problems, high cholesterol, or those who are trying to lose weight. Dairy milk is also a common allergen for babies, children, and adults. Almond Milk Almond milk is made from ground almonds and is lower in calories than other milks as long as it is unsweetened. It's also free of cholesterol , saturated fat, and is naturally lactose free . Even though almonds are a good source of protein, almond milk is not. Almond milk is also not a good source of calcium. However, many of the brands available in the market are supplemented with calcium as well as vitamin D. The 3 Best Things About Almond Milk 1. It's low in calories and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. 2. It's good source of vitamins A and D. 3. It's naturally lactose free. Con: It's not a good source of protein and, unless it is fortified, it contains no calcium, which is important for people with conditions like osteoporosis. (People who are allergic to almonds or nuts should avoid almond milk.) Some almond milk brands also contain carrageenan which may cause digestive issues in some people. Soy Milk Soy milk is made from soybeans. It's a popular milk alternative for vegans and people who are lactose intolerant. Since it comes from plants, it is naturally free of cholesterol, low in saturated fat, and contains absolutely no lactose. Soybeans and soy milk are a good source of protein , calcium (when fortified), and potassium . Probiotic or fermented soy milk is also available and is an even better choice, especially for someone with high blood pressure. The 3 Best Things About Soy Milk 1. It's a good source of protein, vitamin A, B12, vitamin D, potassium, and isoflavones. 2. Soy milk contains almost as much protein as cow's milk, yet is lower in calories than whole milk and comparable to skim milk. 3. It contains very little saturated fat, which is important for those with heart conditions. Con: Too much soy may be a problem for those with thyroid disease or other conditions. A 2008 Harvard study showed that higher intakes of soy -based foods caused fertility problems and lower sperm counts. Soy milk may also contain carrageenan. Rice Milk Rice milk is made from milled rice and water. It is the least allergenic of all of these products, which makes it a good choice for people with lactose or nut allergies. While rice milk can be fortified with calcium and vitamin D , it is not a natural source of either of these, just like soy and almond. The 3 Best Things About Rice Milk 1. It's the least allergenic of milk alternatives. 2. It can be fortified to be a good source of calcium. 3. Rice milk can be used by vegans. Con: Rice milk is very high in carbohydrate and very low in protein, so it's the least desirable choice for people with diabetes as well as people who want more protein, such as athletes or the elderly.

KATZ March 18, 2013 RSS Feed Print David Katz There was a time, not long ago, when all dietary fat was bad for our health. It was not truly bad, of course, but we talked ourselves into believing it was. How we responded behaviorally to that belief never made any sense, but that's a topic for other columns, past and future. For now, it suffices to note that we labeled all fat bad, and we were wrong. One would think, and certainly hope, that having engendered years of public policy and massive shifts in the food supply and prevailing behavior with a misguided boondoggle, we would be extremely cautious about doing it again. But not so! Repeating the follies of dietary history has become something of an honored vocation, if not a national pastime. Even in the aftermath of having been wrong about dietary fat in general, competing views about specific members of that large and diverse nutrient class are asserted with undiminished conviction. The case has been made by one research group, for example, that dietary cholesterol (and therefore eggs) is as harmful as tobacco. This would be astounding, if true, because tobacco has long been recognized as an even more important cause of disease and premature death than poor diet. So, in other words, if this assertion about cholesterol were true, it would leave almost no room for any other aspect of diet to account for any harm, because all dietary harm would be accounted for already. Figuring this out is not rocket science. The assertion about cholesterol is almost certainly wrong for this reason alone. But there are others. The study was led by an ardent proponent of vegan eating, and cholesterol, of course, is only found in animal foods. The study methods were extremely vulnerable to bias. And, there is a large body of evidence that, in the aggregate, all but eggsonerates the egg. Let's move on. [See Cholesterol Management] When we began to recognize that all fat wasn't evil, we needed a new villain. We chose saturated fat, and not unreasonably so. Around the world, diets high in saturated fats are associated with high rates of heart disease. But, of course, diets that derive lots of their calories (and, consequently, saturated fat) from meats, dairy, fried foods and so on, must derive less of their calories from alternatives \u2014such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils and so on. One of the perennial blind spots in nutrition epidemiology is that eating more of A either just means eating more altogether, which brings ills of its own\u2014or eating less of B. And thus, the harms of A may be partly explained by losing the benefits of B. In our perennial rush to judgment, such subtleties are routinely trampled. Simple reflections of this sort begin to suggest how we might have exaggerated the harms of saturated fat. Switching saturated fat to starch or sugar or trans fat could well be trading sideways, or even down. But that would not necessarily fully absolve saturated fat, as many voices are now suggesting with unfounded zeal. The evidence we have about saturated fat is not limited to population studies. It includes mechanistic studies showing that certain prevalent saturated fatty acids found in dairy and meat \u2014palmitic acid and myristic acid \u2014induce inflammation and atherogenesis (the process that gums up our arteries). [See Dr. Weil's Anti- Inflammatory Diet] But the same kind of evidence indicates that other saturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, found prominently in dark chocolate but also in meat, and lauric acid, found in coconut, may be innocuous. All saturated fat is not created equal. We once applied this mistaken \"can't differentiate baby from bath water\" appraisal to all dietary fat. Instead of learning from it, we now apply the same broken method to classes of fat. And that now extends to polyunsaturated fat of the omega- 6 class. Among my more adamant and persistent of my correspondents are those trying to convince me that what we once thought true of saturated fat \u2014namely, that it's bad\u2014is actually true of omega- 6 fat. I am told several times a week that it's this bad polyunsaturated fat that is the REAL cause of heart disease, cancer and our various other prevailing woes. Such thinking has even been distorted to the point of recommending bacon over tilapia. [See Best Heart -Healthy Diets] But this is just the same old misguided nonsense, tossed in a new direction. Omega- 6 polyunsaturated fat is, in fact, essential for normal human function. Along with polyunsaturated fat of the omega- 3 class, these groups make up the \"essential fatty acids.\" It's true that omega- 6s induce inflammation. Omega- 3s, in contrast, tend to be anti -inflammatory. N either is good nor bad. They are nutritional yin and yang. We need them in balance, and both in balance with other nutrients. Paleoanthropologists tell us that our native intake of omega- 6 and omega- 3 was in a ratio of between 1- to-1 and 4- to-1. In modern diets, we eat 11 to 20 times as much omega- 6 as omega- 3. Is that a problem? Yes. Does it make omega- 6 bad? No. Being out of balance is bad. This situation can likely be improved by eating more omega- 3, and/or eating less omega- 6, along with eating more monounsaturated fat. But we have no evidence that it would be improved by eating more saturated fat, as many now argue based on next to nothing. For those preoccupied with omega- 6s, cutting them is the one true answer. For those preoccupied with saturated fat or cholesterol, those remain the real problems. Those focused on omega- 3s argue that increasing those should be the priority. Even as factions skirmish over competing views of dietary fats, others see a basis for battle on a different war front altogether. Some contend that the only thing meaningfully wrong with our diets is the sugar , while others argue it's the dairy , and still others, the gluten. Others still argue it's all about carbs, or animal foods, or animal protein, or glycemic load, or lecithin. Some argue it is salt, others calories \u2014while others still seek to exonerate both salt and calories entirely. And everyone, it seems, is sure they're right. For the most part, those vindicating this or vilifying that are smart and well -intentioned people. The only thing I seem to have latched hold of that they have missed is this: If any one of them is right, then all the others are wrong. Let that sink in. All of the world's major (and probably minor) religions count among their congregations devout, pious people who believe their group knows the true nature and intentions of the almighty. If any one of those groups is right, then all of the others are wrong. And, so, alas for the equally pious, devout people who ha ppen to be seeking the wrong truth in the wrong temple! In the parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant , John Godfrey Saxe allows for all of the competing religious views to be a litt le right, but mostly wrong. What's mostly wrong, of course, is that they don't allow for the possibility that others are at least as right. For what it's worth, I have the same concerns about privileged claims to absolute truth in the realm of religion. Lo ok at the hatred and troubles competing versions of absolute truth bring us. But religion is not my professional realm, and I will let others wrestle with theology. Epidemiology keeps me plenty busy \u2014 particularly as the same problem overtakes us. It is a mi stake\u2014a grave mistake\u2014to infuse the imperfections of an ever -evolving science with religious zeal. Let me state the obvious: No one has claim to absolute nutrition truth, or complete knowledge. No one. And be reminded that the wise and thoughtful and cautious allow for doubt, while hucksters and the deluded have a constant monopoly on certainty. Renouncing claim to absolute knowledge of every tree does not leave us lost in the woods. We know what diets are associated with the best health outcomes. What do these diets tell us? Is it all fat, or saturated fat? Fructose or carbs? Cholesterol or omega- 6s? None of the above. The problem is imbalance. Bad combinations of questionable foods. We know that a diet rich in vegetables and fruits; beans and legumes; nuts and seeds; whole, unrefined grains; fish; eggs; with or without seafood, lean meats, and dairy \u2014and variations on such a theme\u2014 promotes health. Such a diet is relatively low in saturated fat, but not fixated on it. Such a diet is virtually devoid of trans fat, as that is found preferentially in processed junk. Such a diet provides a balance of omega- 6s (from nuts, seeds, grains and oils) and omega- 3s (from nuts, seeds, fish and seafood). It provides monounsaturated oil from nuts, seeds, olives and avocado. It provides little added sugar, because most foods are close to nature. It provides for moderate sodium intake, because most sodium is added during food processing. Focus on the forest of foods, in other words, and the trees will sort themselves out. Climb a tree, barking mad\u2014and enjoy the show as the forest burns down. The best way to choose the best fats is to choose the best foods in the right proportions. If you are expecting to find your way to better eating and health by selecting a single villain or savior, well\u2014fat chance. Some dietary fats are good for us. Balance and proportion are good for us. Some dietary fats are bad for us. Deficiencies, excesses and imbalances are bad for us. Sweeping generalizations, exaggerated claims and a silly sequence of vindications and vilifications are downright ugly. It's far past time to chew the fat accordingly, and spit out what history abundantly proves is indigestible nonsense. [See Recipe for Health] Hungry for more?

SOURCES OF DIETARY FATS TYPE OF FAT DIETARY SOURCES Saturated (medium chain) Coconut and coconut oil Palm kernel oil MCT (medium chain triglyceride) oil Saturated (long chain) Dairy fats: Whole and 2% milk, whole milk cheese, butter, eggs (okay in moderation - egg whites unlimited) Animal fats: beef, veal, pork, chicken, lard, beef tallow Baked goods made with dairy and/or animal fats Monounsaturated Heart (healthy fat) Olives, olive oil Canola oil Avocados Nuts or nut oils: peanuts, almonds, pecans, walnuts, cashews, pistachios Trans Fatty Acids (worst fat) Food made with hydrogenated shortening: may include margarine, baked goods, cookies, crackers Polyunsaturated (omega 6) neutral Vegetable oils: corn, soybean, safflower, sunflower, sesame Wheat germ, soybeans, certain margarines Polyunsaturated (omega 3) (healthy fat - can help reduce inflammation especially EPA and DHA fat) Fish: salmon, herring, albacore tuna, sardine, trout, sablefish, eel (EPA &DHA) Plant foods and plant oils: canola, soybean, flaxseed, wheat germ, rice bran, english walnuts, broccoli, spinach, purslane (ALA) The type of fat or oil used in processing food determines the type of fatty acids found in the food. The omega 3 content of fish is dependent upon whether the fish is wild or farmed. Eggs and meat may contain omega 3 fatty acids depending upon the animal feed. The oil used in processing determines the fatty acid content of margarine. Hydrogenation increases the saturation and trans fatty acids in processed food. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteResearch has found that diet affects the development of high blood pressure, or hypertension (the medical term). Recently, twostudies showed that blood pressure can be lowered by following a particular eating plan\u2014called the Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension (DASH) eating plan\u2014and reducing the amount of sodium consumed. While each step alone lowers blood pressure, the combination of the eating plan and areduced sodium intake gives the biggest benefit and may help prevent the developmentof high blood pressure. This fact sheet, based on the DASH research findings, tells about high blood pressure, and how to follow the DASH eating plan and reduce the amount of sodium you consume. It offers tips on how to start and stay on the eating plan, as well as a week of menus and some recipes. The menus and recipes are given for two levels of dailysodium con sumption\u20142,400 milligrams (the upper limit of current recommendations by the Federal Government's National High Blood Pressure Education Program(NHBPEP) and the amount used to figure food labels' Nutrition Facts Daily Value) and1,500 milligrams.

Sodium is found in many canned, packaged, and \"fast\" foods. It is also found in many condiments, seasonings, and meats. Why Is Sodium Important for People with CKD? Eating less sodium helps lower blood pressure and may slow down CKD. Talk with your provider about the right blood pressure goal for you. One of the kidneys' important jobs is to filter sodium out of the body and into the urine. Damaged kidneys cannot filter as well as healthy kidneys can. This can cause sodium to stay in your body and make your blood pressure go up. How Much Sodium Should I Eat Every Day? Most people need to eat less sodium than they are eating. Aim for less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium each day. Much of the sodium you eat does not come from a salt shaker. Sodium is added to the prepared foods you buy at the supermarket or at restaurants. Foods Lower in Sodium l Fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables l Rice, noodles l Cooked cereal without added salt l Fresh meat, poultry, seafood l Low-fat, low-sodium cheese l Unsalted nuts l Low- and reduced-sodium frozen dinners, peanut butter, salad dressings l Air-popped popcorn Foods Higher in Sodium l Bacon, corned beef, ham, hot dogs, luncheon meat, sausage l Bouillon, canned, and instant soups l Boxed mixes, like hamburger meals and pancake mix l Canned beans, chicken, fish and meat l Canned tomato products, including juice l Canned and pickled vegetables, vegetable juice l Cottage cheese l Frozen meals l Frozen vegetables with sauce l Olives, pickles, relish l Pretzels, chips, crackers, salted nuts l Salt and salt seasonings, like garlic salt l Seasoning mix and sauce packets l Soy sauce l Salad dressings, bottled sauces, marinades l Some ready-to-eat cereals, baked goods, breads l Ready-to-eat boxed meals and side dishes NKDEP_NutritionFactsheets_Sodium_Sept_v41.indd 1 9/2/11 12:48 PMHow Do I Lower the Sodium in My Diet? Buy fresh foods more often. Cook foods from scratch, instead of eating prepared foods, \"fast \" foods, frozen dinners, and canned foods that are higher in sodium. Use spices, herbs, and sodium-free seasonings in place of salt. Check with your healt hcare provider about using salt substitutes. Rinse canned vegetables, beans, meats, and fish with water to remove extra sodium. Alwa y s read the Nutrition Facts label to compare foods. Choose foods with the lowest Percent Daily Value (%DV) for sodium. The %DV lets you see if a food is high or low in sodium. 5% or less is low and 20% or more is high. Check the label on fresh meats and poultry. Sodiu m additives can be used to make meat last longer. Look for foods labeled: sodium free, salt free, very lo w sodium, low sodium, reduced or less sodium, light in sodium, no salt added, unsalted, and lightly salted. 2 l l l l l l l l l l l Sodium Vitamin C 2% Iron 4%Nutrition Fa cts Serving Size: 1 cup (228g) Servings Per Co ntainer : 2 Amount P er Ser ving Calories: 260 Calories from Fat: 120 % Daily Value* Total Fa t 13g 20 % Saturated Fat 5g 25 % Tr ans Fa t 2g Cholesterol 30mg 10 % Sodium 660mg 28 % Total Carboh ydrate 31g 10% Dietary Fiber 0 Vitamin A 4% Calcium 15% * Pe rcent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.There may be more than one serving in the package, so be sure to check serving size.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of HealthNational Kidn ey Diseas e Education ProgramThe Scoop on Sweeteners Sweeteners can be very helpful for both weight control and for the control of diabetes. There are two main types of sweeteners: nutritive and non- nutritive. A nutritive sweetener is one that contains calories and provides energ y. Examples of nutritive sweeteners are sucrose, fructose, and sugar alcohols . Nutritive sweeteners , which will raise blood sugar levels, are considered part of the total carbohydrate content of a diabetic's meal plan. Nutrition Facts labels, which a re found on most packaged foods, will list nutritive sweeteners (sugars and sugar alcohols) as part of the total grams of carbohydrate. Sucrose (table sugar) is a very common food additive, and almost impossible to avoid. There is no scientific reason to restrict its use, although foods that contain sugars are often high in total carbohydrate as well as fat. Diabetics need to be aware of sucrose' effects on blood sugar and use high sucrose foods discriminately. Fructose (fruit sugar) may have a lower gl ycemic response than sucrose, but in the amounts used in foods, it is unlikely to have much clinical benefit. Excessive amounts can also cause diarrhea. Fructose is most often used in baking, canning, and freezing. Sugar Alcohols - Sorbitol, Mannitol, Xy litol- also have a lower glycemic response, and because they are not completely absorbed, have about half the calories of other sugars. However, like fructose, in the amounts likely to be consumed and in the context of the total daily caloric intake, it is unlikely they will have much clinical benefit. Excessive amounts can also cause diarrhea. Non-nutrit ive sweeteners are safe to use and can be helpful by reducing total carbohydrate/caloric intake, i.e., by substituting them for nutritive sweeteners. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding can use the non -nutritive sweeteners; research has shown they are safe for the baby as well. Children may also use the non- nutritive sweeteners. Examples of non- Splenda ). Aspartame (EQUAL) is made from two amino acids (proteins). The name brand f or Aspartame is Equal when used as a table top sweetener, and NutraSweet or Na traTaste when used in food products. It will lose its sweetn ess when heated for cooking and baking. A form of Aspartame has been developed to withstand heat, and can be found in some commercial products. There have been some complaints of dizziness and headaches, but most consumers find Aspartame acceptable. As partame contains phenylalanine (an amino acid), so it should not be used by people with phenylketonuria. Produ cts that contain Aspartame will include a warning. Saccharin , the oldest sugar substitute, was widely used until a study in 1977 showed that large doses caused cancer in rats. However, there is no evidence that it causes cancer in humans. Saccharin is found in Sweet 'N Low and Sugar Twin. It tends to lose its sweetening power after exposure to high temperatures. Acesulfame -K is the major ingredient in the table top sweetener, Sweet One, and when used in food products, Sunette. It is heat stable in cooking and baking. For best results, substitute half the sugar called for in a recipe with the equivalent amount of Sweet One. Sucralose is the major sweetener ingredient in Splenda . It is the newest non- nutritive sweetener approved for use by the FDA. It is processed from sugar, but the resulting product is not well absorbed, and therefore not used by the body as an energy/calorie source. It is very stable in cooking and baking, and is used in baking, drinks, jams and processed foods. A Word About Stevia Stevia is a South American shrub whose leaves have been used for centuries by nati ve peoples to sweeten beverages. It is virtually calorie- free and hundreds of times sweeter than table sugar. Although Japan has used stevia since the early 1970's, the US Food and Drug Administration s tevia did not approve the use of stevia as a sweetener until 2008 or so. New products using are coming out rapidly. SUN CRYSTALS with Stevia is unlike any other sweetener - It is the only national retail brand that combines naturally sweet stevia and pure cane sugar to deliver its delicious sweet taste. E ach packet of SUN CRYSTALS All Natural Sweetener has the sweetness of 2 teaspoons of sugar, yet only 5 calories. Stevia has no effect on blood sugar levels- However, the pure cane sugar does provide a small amount of calories and 1g of carbohydrate per serving. Up to 3 packets of SUN CRYSTALS All Natural Sweetener count as a free food in meal plans for those with diabetes. Patients with diabetes who intend to consume more than 3 packets at a time need to count carbohydrates. New SUN CRYSTALS with Stevia offers patients an excellent option for a 100% natural sweetener with a delicious sweet taste, the texture of sugar, and only 5 calories per packet. It is a great way to help better manage weight and wellness and eat more healthfully. Info and free sample at www.suncrystals.com PureVia and sweetener.

Return to Web version Sugar Substitutes | What You Need to Know What are sugar substitutes? Sugar substitutes are chemical or natural substances that sweeten food and drinks without adding as many calories as sugar. Sug ar substitutes are many times sweeter than sugar, so it takes less to provide the same level of sweetness. Some sugar substitutes are low in calories, while others have no calories. You may have also h eard them called artificial sweeteners or non-caloric sweeteners. Why are sugar substitutes added to food and drinks? Sugar substitutes provide sweetness to food without the calories of sugar. This can be helpful if you are trying to control the amount of calories you eat or if you have diabetes and have to be careful about the sugar found in foods and drinks. Sugar substitutes ar e found in most of the \"light,\" \"reduced calorie\" or \"sugar-free\" foods and drinks available today. It's important to remember that simply eliminating sugar from your diet is not a perfect solution to your dieting needs. You sh ould still focus on getting the majority of your calories through healthy food choices , such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats and whole grains. What sugar substitutes are available in the United States? The following sugar substitutes are available in the United States: zAspartame , which is also known by the brand names Equal and Nutrasweet zAcesulfame K , which is also known as Sunett and Sweet One zSaccharin , which is also known as Sweet 'N Low and Sweet Twin zSucralose , which is also known as Splenda zStevia , which is also and maltitol I've heard that sugar s ubstitutes can cause cancer or othe r health problems. Is that true? According to the National Cancer Institute, there is no proof that sugar substitutes cause cancer. There have also been many me dical research studies on the sugar substitutes that are approved fo r use in the United States, and they have shown the sweeteners to be safe when used in moderation.One exception is for people who have phenylketonuria (PKU). Peopl e who have PKU cannot have the sugar substitute called asparta me because they are unable to metabolize it. How can I tell if a food or drin k contains a sugar substitute? Check the ingredient list for the names of sugar substitutes listed above. This list gives ingredients in descending order by w eight. How much sugar substitute s should be in my diet? Unless you add it yourself, it is often hard to know exactly how much of a sugar substitute is in a food or drink. Although sug ar substitutes have fewer calories than sugar, it's best to limit them and focus on healthy food choices , such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats and whole grains. These foods are the best sources of nutrition for your body. I'm pregnant. Are sugar substitutes safe for me? According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, aspartame is safe for pregnant women and their developing babies. There is als o good evidence that acesulfame K, sugar alcohols and sucralose are sa fe for pregnant women when used in small amounts. Some doctors recommend avoiding saccharin and stevia because there isn't enough medical research to say whether or not these sugar substitut es are safe during pregnancy.

You know the ones: agave nectar, stevia, monk fruit, et cetera. \"People seem to think that if you don't consume something fresh and raw and in its natural state then it's not healthy for you,\" she said. Cluskey, an associate professor in the Moore Family Center for Whole Grain Foods, Nutrition and Preventive Health at Oregon State University, said the line most people draw between \"natural\" foods and processed foods is, for the most part, an arbitrary one. Nutrition experts agree that choosing a sweetener is a confusing task. Given all the different sources of information on the subject \u2014 many of them conflicting \u2014 it's sometimes hard to know who to trust, especially with marketers throwing around words like \"natural\" and featuring leaves on their packaging. Even stevia, a calorie- free sweetener adored by many, a natural foods enthusiast for its origins in the Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni plant, is thoroughly processed to become the powder form in which it's consumed. \"If all we did was squeeze an agave leaf into our glass of iced tea or something, yeah, that would be more natural,\" Cluskey said. \"But the reality is, we don't. It has to be isolated and concentrated.\" When it comes to sweeteners, a little processing is a good thing, Cluskey said. Truly raw sugar, for example, cannot even be sold in the U.S. because it contains naturally occurring environmental contaminants, she said. 'Just keeps showing up' Often just the perception that a food is natural can blind consumers to its potentially harmful properties. Lori Zanini, a registered dietitian in Los Angeles and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said her diabetic clients often tell her they can add honey to anything and it'll still be good for them. \"It sounds funny, but people do that all the time,\" she said. Just because sweeteners like agave nectar \u2014 which is really more of a syrup than anything \u2014 honey and molasses are believed to be naturally occurring, people somehow don't believe they'll raise their blood sugar or cause them to gain weight like table sugar will, Zanini said. Honey, in particular, is often touted for containing beneficial nutrients like iron. But that's a lot like the anti-oxidizing effects of dark chocolate: You'd have to eat so much of it to derive that benefit, it wouldn't be worth it, Cluskey said. Likewise, agave nectar is touted for having a low glycemic index, meaning the sugars flow slowly into the bloodstream, releasing insulin gradually and keeping a person fuller longer. Plus, it's sweeter than sugar, so people will use less of it. That said, agave nectar has the same amount of calories and carbohydrates as sugar, according to the American Diabetes Association. Recognizing sugar's contribution to the growing ranks who suffer from chronic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and obesity, a number of organizations have created recommendations around daily consumption of added sugar, or sugar that doesn't occur naturally in food. The American Heart Association, for example, recommends women take in no more than 6 teaspoons, or 25 grams, from added sugars per day, and men no more than 10 teaspoons, or 38 grams, from added sugars per day. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture found in 2010 that people between the ages of 19 to 79 take in an average of 20 teaspoons, or 79 grams, of added sugar per day. Nearly 36 percent of that added sugar comes from soda and other sugar -sweetened beverages, the USDA found. \"We just continue to get evidence against why we should drink fewer sugar -sweetened beverages,\" Cluskey said. \"It just keeps showing up and showing up.\" Nutritive vs. non -nutritive A simple way to think about sweeteners is to divide them between nutritive (those that contain calories) and non- nutritive (those that don't). In the nutritive category, sugar alcohols, also known as polyols, are often added to gums and beverages that are labeled sugar -free. They contain two calories per gram, unlike sugar, which contains four calories per gram. The downside of sugar alcohols is they can have a laxative effect if consumed in large quantities, Zanini said. Some non -nutritive sweeteners are extremely sweet, which means one would likely use less of them. Sucralose, for example, is 600 times sweeter than sugar. Aspartame is 180 times sweeter. Saccharin is 300 times sweeter. Although some research has linked the non- nutritive sweeteners aspartame and saccharin to certain cancers, most medical organizations, including the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, American Diabetes Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, consider them to be safe. Saccharin required a warning label for decades before a study in 2000 found the mechanism that triggers bladder cancer in rats that consume the sweetener does not exist in humans. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, rec ommends against saccharin consumption, but aspartame is at the top of its list of sweeteners to avoid. CSPI points to independent studies that found it caused cancer in rats and mice. A 2012 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found drinking diet soda increased men's risk of non- Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but concluded it could have been by chance. Cluskey said CSPI tends to be more conservative than other organizations about whether or not they consider products safe. The most i mportant consideration when choosing a sugar substitute is simply which one tastes the best to you, Cluskey and Zanini agreed. And what you plan to use it for. \"My main message is it's a personal decision,\" Zanini said. \"They have to look at their overall eating plan and figure out what's best for them and what's their goal. Is their goal to lower their blood sugar? Is their goal to lower their calories? And what do they think tastes best to them?\" \u2014 Reporter: 541- 383-0304, tbannow@bendbulletin.com Allulose Allulose is one of many di erent sugars that exists in nature. It was identi ed in wheat over 70 years ago and is present in very small quantities in certain fruits such as gs, raisins and jackfruit as well as in foods like caramel sauce, maple syrup and brown sugar. T ate & Lyle has developed a proprietary process to produce allulose on a commercial scale so manufacturers can o er consumers the best of both worlds: all the taste and texture of sugar - and 90% fewer calories than sucrose. As a low-calorie sugar, allulose delivers both the satisfying taste experience and sweetness that - until now - only sugar could provide. Structurally, this monosaccharide (simple sugar) is absorbed by the body, but not metabolized, and is excreted intact primarily via the urine. As a global provider of distinctive, high-quality ingredients and solutions, T ate & Lyle has developed a proprietary process to convert the carbohydrate in corn into allulose to make it available on a larger scale. The result is DOLCIA PRIMA \u00ae Allulose, the low- calorie sugar that helps food and beverage manufacturers o er the best of both worlds: all the taste and texture of sugar without all the calories. DOLCIA PRIMA\u00ae Allulose DOLCIA PRIMA\u00ae Allulose functions like sugar in recipe formulations but without all the calories. A signi cant number of consumers express the desire to avoid sugars so as to decrease caloric intake. However, individuals who regularly consume foods and beverages with no-calorie sweeteners say they miss the satisfying mouthfeel of sugar in these no- and low-calorie choices.\"ALLULOSE /one.lin/zero.lin/one.lin\" FACT SHEET DOLCIA PRIMA\u00ae Allulose has a taste pro le that is similar to sugar, with a clean, sweet taste. In fact, products formulated with allulose ranked at parity with full-sugar versions in preference taste tests across a variety of foods. Numerous sensory studies have been conducted on allulose, including dose response, synergy, temporal pro le and mouthfeel. Using DOLCIA PRIMA \u00ae makes low-calorie food and beverage options taste better, and it also enables manufacturers to reduce the calories in their full-calorie products. Allulose behaves like sugar, making formulation easier because it delivers many of the bene ts that sugar o ers: T astes just like sugar Adds bulk and texture to products Browns when baking Depresses freezing point when making frozen products Works in synergy with certain high-potency sweeteners, such as sucralose and stevia, to enable even better sweetening systems O ers the same temporal pro le, or perception of sweetness, as sugar Can be used in a range of products including beverages, yogurt, ice cream and baked products SWN1214028FROM THEIR WEBSITE: Ajinomoto North America, Inc. 1300 N. Arlington Heights Road 110 newest sweetener is ADVANTAME which is a new ultrahigh potency sweetener derived from aspartame and vanillin. It is about 20,000 times sweeter than sucrose and 100 times sweeter than aspartame. Advantame has a clean sweet taste very similar to aspartame, with only a slightly longer sweetness duration. Advantame has similar stability to aspartame in most applications, better stability in many other applications. Due to its excellent taste and functionality along with very low cost in use, advantame can be used to partially replace sugar, high fructose corn syrup or other high potency sweeteners to reduce cost, and/or sugar content while maintaining the same taste profile or improving the taste and flavor profile of the products. Advantame can also be used to enhance many flavors such as dairy, fruit, citrus, mint, etc and can be used to extend sweetness duration in chewing gum and improve the sweetness porofile of many confections. Advantame is FEMA GRAS approved in Dairy, Frozen Desserts, Beverages, and Chewing Gum (FEMA#4716) and advantame ha s general use approval as a sweetener in Australia/New Zealand, the United States and European Union. Press Release For Immediate Release 2014.09.17 Contact: Stan Samples 678-303-2996 Calorie Control Council* comments on \"Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota\", Nature** 17 September 2014 Summary: The study suffers from small sample sizes, unrealistic sweetener applications, and a dependence largely on rodent research. Findings should be interpreted with caution. Statements from leading health organizations and other peer -reviewed published studies are contrary to the study findings. Leading health organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Heart Association (AHA), as well as numerous scientific studies agree that low-calorie sweete ners can be used as a safe tool to help manage calorie intake, which, in turn can be helpful for both weight management and diabetes management. In contrast to the assertions made by the researchers of this study, the overall evidence from studies on low-calorie sweeteners, including numerous human studies, show that these sweeteners are safe and do not have adverse effects on blood glucose control. Investigators of more than 40 studies in people, including a recent meta- analysis of clinical trials and other available evidence, have concluded that the use of low- calorie sweeteners does not lead to either an increased risk of obesity or diabetes. The safety of low- calorie sweeteners has been confirmed time and time again by scientists and regulatory agencies around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Health Canada. The study suffers from several significant limitations. The study by Suez et al., which concluded that low-calorie sweet eners lead to glucose intolerance and disruption in gut microbiota which in turn may be associated with increased obesity and diabetes, suffers from several limitations that diminish the generalizability of the findings. MICE EXPERIMENTS 1. Findings in mice may not be applicable to humans. The research was conducted mostly in mice, which have biological processes and microbiota that are different from humans, thus making it potentially difficult to translate the study findings to humans. Further, the mice in the high fat diet group received 60% of their calories from fat, which is twice as much as recommended for humans. 2. Limited testing. The study shows results of only a single glucose tolerance test - there is no baseline glucose test for comparison. 3. Testing results are inappropriately extrapolated. The researchers make generalizations largely based on one sweetener, about sweetener effects, on glucose control or tolerance. These assumptions were based on limited information and despite absence of confirmation from larger, longer studies, including clinical trials in people. 4. Too small a sample size to generalize. The different experiments conducted in the study included only a few mice in each experimental group. The small sample s izes used in these experiments further limit the applicability of the study results to humans. 5. Situations not reflective of real life. The experiments were also conducted in situations that are not applicable to real life. In some experiments, mice were fed low-calorie sweeteners in their pure form, which are not readily marketed to humans; in other experiments, mice were fed low-calorie sweeteners as available in the marketplace, but at a higher level than typically consumed. Some mice included in the study were also germ - free, an almost impossible scenario for humans with few exceptions unless in a restricted and controlled medical environment. 6. Consumption of low-calorie sweeteners was associated with decrease in food intake. Mice that were in the low-calorie sweetener groups had a dramatic increase in beverage consumption and an associated decrease in food intake. This change means that there was a significant change in the overall diet and nutrient consumption, even if the total calories remained the same. Therefore, less consumption of food and likely a reduced intake of fiber and protein rather than low-calorie sweetener consumption, and, may have led to the change in microbiota in those mice. 7. Mice in the low-calorie sweetener group s did not gain weight. The mice that were in the low-calorie sweetener group did not have any changes in weight. Therefore, it does not seem plausible for the researchers to conclude that the observed changes in microbiota or blood glucose response are related to obesity. HUMAN EXPERIMENTS The authors did examine humans. However, this research had some limitations that affect the ability to translate that study to the larger human population. 1. The observational study included a small sample size that may not be applicable to all populations. The observational study included 381 people, a relatively small sample size. There may be other confounders that may have influenced the outcome and it is not clear how the adjustments were made to address these confounding variables. 2. The methods of the observational study may introduce recall bias. This study introduces recall bias as consumers were asked to remember their past consumption of products containing low -calorie sweeteners. This potential bias may have affected the mean increase in HbA1C% that was reported, especially as there was no indication provided with regards to dose response and increase in HbA1C%. 3. The experimental study included too small a sample size to generalize. The study was conducted in only 7 individuals, an extremely small sample which makes it difficult to translate the results to the larger population. 4. Sample not representative. The participants in this study were nearly the same age (ages 28-36), which also makes it difficult to apply the study findings to the majority of the population. 5. Too short a time period. The experimental study was conducted over only one week. A longer trial with a larger, more diverse population would be more likely to generate findings that could be more statistically relevant and translatable to the human condition. 6. Lack of control group and unrealistic consumption levels. The experimental study did not include a control group and the amounts of low-calorie sweetener consumed by the participants were not levels that are typically consumed. These factors likely impact the generalizability of the study results. \"The study by Suez et al. contains several studies and experiments which have a number of limitations that are at odds with a large number of other peer-reviewed publications. Therefore, the results of the Suez et al. study warrant further research. * The Calorie Control Council (the \"Council\") is an international association of manufacturers of low-calorie, reduced- fat and \"light\" foods and beverages. Companies that make and use low-calorie sweeteners are among the Council's members. **Suez J, Korem T, Zeevi D, Zilberman-Schapira G, Thaiss CA, Maza O, et al.

For feedback or more information, visit About Calorie Control Council Study Finds Low -Calorie Sweeteners Not Associated with Sweet Cravings ATLANTA (October 30, 2014) \u2014A recent study has concluded that low- calorie sweeteners, including sucralose, are not associated with increased cravings. In the study, researchers set out to determine if low- calorie sweeteners would cause increased sweet cravings when compared to sugar. They conducted four separate experiments, each with around 400 participants. In the experiments, each participant drank wa ter mixed with sugar or mixed with different sweeteners, including sucralose. They were then asked to rate their perceived sweetness of the samples on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being the sweetest sensation they could imagine. The results found that the various low- calorie sweeteners such as sucralose did not have greater sweet sensations, or cause cravings, when compared to sugar. The researchers concluded that, \"Our data indicate that NNS [non- nutritive sweeteners] are not super -stimuli with regard to perceived sweetness intensity. That is, although NNS may have greater binding affinity to sweet receptors, this does not imply NNS over stimulate sweet receptors as has been implied previously.\" Finally, they added that \"present data suggest that NNS do not result in deleterious health effects by over -stimulating sweet taste receptors to produce hyper- intense sweet sensations.\" While there have been speculations that low- calorie sweeteners cause people to gain weight because they lead to consumers craving sweets, these research results provide further evidence that low -calorie sweeteners do not overpower peoples' taste buds or lead them to crave sweeter foods. Further, these results support previous scientific literature that suggest low- calorie sweeteners can assist people in losing and managing their weight while allowing them to enjoy the foods they love . .

Healthy Snacks for Persons with Diabetes Snacks can be part of a healthy meal plan and a great source of quick energy. They help prevent hunger between meals and overeating at meal times. Tips for snacking: Snacks should be at least 2 hours (ideally 3-4) after a meal. Eat larger snacks during the most active time of your day and smaller snacks in the less active part of your body. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains make great snacks. A whole grain food can be found by looking for the word \" whole \" in front of the grain on the ingredient list (i.e. whole wheat flour). Not all snacks are healthy, so it's important to make good choices. Avoid high fat, high calorie, low-nutrition snacks (candy, doughnuts, cookies, chips, fruit drinks, soda pop).

A cinch to put together, each snack idea has 15-20 grams of carb per serving. Low -Carb Snack Ideas for People with Diabetes If you need a pick- me-up between meals, a snack with 15-20 grams of carbohydrate is often the answer. For someone with diabetes, it's important to eat a fiber-filled and nutrient-rich snack to curb the appetite before the next meal, says Angela Ginn -Meadow, a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Talk to your health care provider about whether a snack will work in your meal plan. Grapes and Grahams Want a crunchy, sweet treat that's quick and easy to whip together? Spread 1 tablespoon light cream cheese on 2 graham cracker squares and top with 1/4 cup halved grapes. Fruit and Nut Yogurt Need a snack that will help you go the extra mile? Sprinkle 1 tablespoon dried cranberries and 1 tablespoon toasted slivered almonds atop a 6-ounce carton of plain fat- free Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt has more protein than its regular counterpart to keep you satisfied longer, and the sweet cranberries will balance the tangy zip of the yogurt. Cereal Nut Mix Get a good dose of fiber by mixing 1/2 cup unsweetened miniature shredded wheat cereal, 1 tablespoon dried cranberries, and 1 tablespoon roasted pistachio nuts. By using unsalted nuts, you'll keep the sodium to a record low of 2 milligrams. Pear and Cheese Pears and cheese go together like peanut butter and jelly. So next time you need a hearty snack, choose a small pear and a light cheese stick. The cheese will help you meet your calcium goal by providing 16 percent of your daily needs, and the pear provides 4 grams of fiber, getting you that much closer to the recommended 25- 35 grams a day. Tuna Salad Crisps Tuna salad doesn't have to be reserved for lunch. Combine 2 ounces of drained water- packed light tuna with 1 teaspoon light mayonnaise and 1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard, and spoon the mixture atop 2 rye crisps for a satisfying snack packed with heart- healthy omega- 3 fatty acids. Avocado-Tomato Open -Face Sandwich Mash 1/4 of a peeled avocado and stir in a dash of garlic salt. Spread onto a slice of toasted whole grain bread and top with a couple of tomato slices for a snack that is packed with flavor and fiber. Even with the generous amount of avocado, this snack contains only 150 calories. Bananas About Chocolate For a treat that's both decadent and healthy, slice half a banana and dip it in 1/2 ounce melted dark chocolate. Studies suggest that components in dark chocolate can help lower blood pressure. Guacamole and Veggies For a crunchy, south- of-the-border snack, dip 1/2 of a red sweet pepper, sliced, and 1/2 cup carrot sticks in 1/4 cup purchased guacamole. You'll cover your daily needs for vitam in A with the carrots, plus you'll more than meet your daily vitamin C needs thanks to the sweet pepper strips. Mini Pizza For a super quick snack anyone will love, toast half of a round whole grain sandwich thin and top with a couple tomato slices, one sliced fresh mushroom, and a couple tablespoons of shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese. Pop it under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes for a warm, melty treat. The best part -- it's only 100 calories. Ham and Pineapple For a low-fat snack that's sure to please, cut 1 ounce of thinly sliced deli ham into long strips and fold the slices accordion style. Skewer the folded ham slices with chunks of pineapple. Stick to 3/4 cup pineapple, and look for lower-sodium ham. Chips and Dip Craving something crunchy? Go for the classic combination of chips and salsa. Choose 1/4 cup of your favorite salsa, whether it's mild, medium, or hot, and 3/4 ounce baked tortilla chips. Yogurt and Fruit Parfait For a fun, flavorful way to get 25 percent of your daily calcium needs, whip up a quick fruit and yogurt parfait. Lay er a 6 -ounce carton of fat- free lemon -flavor yogurt with 1/3 cup fresh raspberries and 3 tablespoons puffed wheat, kamut, or millet cereal. Be sure to choose yogurt that is sweetened with an artificial sweetener. Cucumber -Topped Rye Crisps Rye crisps make an all -star snack because they are fat -free, low in sodium, and oh, so crunchy. Jazz them up by spreading 2 rye crisps with 2 tablespoons light onion- flavor cream cheese and topping with 1/4 cup sliced cucumber. Strawberries and Fruit Dip Strawberries pick up the slack to provide vitamin C in the summer when oranges are out of season. For a creamy dip to serve with a cup of fresh strawberries -- which will provide 150 percent of your daily vitamin C needs -- stir together 1 tablespoon light cream cheese and 1 tablespoon low- sugar orange marmalade. Hummus Roll -Ups Add some veggies to your diet with these simple, flavorful roll-ups. Spread 2 tablespoons purchased hummus on an 8-inch low-carb tortilla. Top with 1/4 of a red sweet pepper, sliced, and four quartered cherry tomatoes. Roll up the tortilla and cut into 1- inch slices for bite -size treats. Dried Apricots Dried apricot halves are a humble little snack, but eight of them will satisfy your sweet tooth and provide 20 percent of your daily vitamin A needs. Yogurt Choose 6 ounces of light yogurt for a carb-friendly snack. Not only is creamy yogurt cool and sweet, it's a great source of calcium, too. Orange If you're hungry for a snack, grab one small orange and get a juicy dose of vitamin C as well as fiber, which helps keep blood glucose under control. Frozen Fruit Bar Next time those hunger pangs hit, pick a frozen sugar- free fruit bar --it will treat your sweet tooth and might also have extra vitamin C. Graham Crackers They're not just for kids! Graham crackers are convenient, portable, and offer that oh-so appealing crunch. Grab three graham cracker squares to get 15 -20 g of carbs. Milk For a boost of calcium and a dash of creamy goodness, down a 10-ounce glass of skim or 1 percent milk. Opting for low-fat milk is good for your heart, too, because whole milk has five times more saturated fat. Bread with Peanut Butter When you need a more filling snack, spread one slice of whole wheat bread with 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. It's a hearty treat that's packed with protein and has heart- healthy monounsaturated fat. Popcorn If you have a hankering for a crunchy snack, skip the chips and grab 3 cups of light popcorn (no salt, no butter). Plus, popcorn is easy to grab on the go and full of fiber. We show you how to read food labels. [51] Apple Apples come in so many varieties, it's easy to find the perfect flavor. Choose one small apple at snack time for a serving of fruit that's also a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber, which helps prevent cholesterol buildup. English Muffin with Cheese and Apple Slices Want a snack with ooey-gooey melted cheese? You're in the right place with this combo snack that includes half of a whole wheat English muffin, 1 ounce low- fat cheese, and a couple of apple slices (about 1/4 of a small apple). Set it in a toaster oven or under the broiler for a few seconds for a chewy snack that hits the spot. Strawberries and Cottage Cheese For a snack that mixes a serving of dairy with a serving of fresh fruit, combine 1 cup of strawberries and 1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese. The combo provides a boost of vitamin C and calcium to your day. Grapes Grape fans unite! Whether you love green, red, or Concord, pick 1 cup of your favorite grapes and munch away for a carb-friendly snack that's full of vitamin C. Crackers with Peanut Butter A little bit salty and a little bit sweet, a little bit crunchy and a little bit creamy, this snack combines the best of all worlds. Put together four of your own peanut butter cracker sandwiches or buy a 4-pack from the vending machine. Just make sure to use only 2 teaspoons of peanut butter total to keep it carb -friendly and opt for low-sodium crackers to keep sodium at bay. Pudding with Banana Slic es Yes, you can have pudding! Just grab 1/2 cup of your favorite sugar-free pudding flavor, top with a few slices of banana, and you're good to go. Look for versions of pudding with calcium for an extra health boost. Plus, convenient snack packs make it even easier to take this treat with you. Cereal It works for toddlers and for grown-ups! Tote 3/4 cup of Cheerios for a crunchy, fiber- filled treat. Carrots with Ranch Dressing For a boost of beta carotene, fiber, and vitamin A, you can't do much better than snacking on 15 baby carrots with 2 tablespoons light ranch dressing. Many supermarkets sell individual snack packs of carrots, too. Pita Bread Pocket with Hummus Hummus isn't just a fun party dip, it's a great everyday snack option, too. Made from ground garbanzo beans (chick peas), hummus is a flavorful way to get your fiber. Spread 1 tablespoon of hummus on half of a pita bread pocket (1 ounce) for a delicious low- fat snack. ` Heart Healthy Dining Out Tips Eating out is fun, and it's often easier than cooking. But be aware that many restaurant foods are high in fat, salt and sugar! Here are some tips on staying healthy when eating out: Avoid 'starving' yourself before eating out, especially at all -you- can-eat buffets! You're more likely to eat too quickly, eat the less healthy foods, and overeat. Ask questions! Explain to the wait staff what you need. They may be able to offer more healthy alternatives. Consider sharing a main entr\u00e9e or ordering an appetizer for the main course. Have the wait staff bring you a doggy bag, and save half your entr\u00e9e for another meal. Order baked, broiled, poached, steamed, grilled, roasted or boiled foods. Avoid fried, saut\u00e9ed, and breaded fo ods. Order broth -based soups . Avoid cream and butter -based soups. Avoid greasy crackers; stick with plain soda crackers. Order steamed or raw, plain veggies without cream sauce. Order fresh fruits, angel food cake, sorbet or frozen yogurt for dessert. Sha re dessert with a friend. Avoid sweet, creamy desserts. Order low -fat salad dressings and other added fats \"on the side\" , and use only small portions. Go easy on cream - based/mayonnaise -type salad dressings. Avoid the bacon bits, croutons and shredded cheese toppings. Take advantage of fresh fruits and veggies on the salad bar. Avoid any cream based 'salads' (macaroni, potato salads, etc). More tips on Dining Out: Italian: Avoid cream/white /cheese sauces. Order the 'red' (tomato based) sauces. Try a vegetarian p izza; avoid sausage, pepperoni and 'double cheese' pizza. Mexican: Order bean -based dishes. Limit/avoid guacamole, sour cream, refried beans, cheese and chips. Try salsa instead. Asian: Try hot and sour soups; steamed veggies, steamed ric e. Order meats cooked in broth or steamed with vegetables. Indian: Try lentil or bean dishes. Try baked (Tandoori) chicken or grilled meats. Avoid coconut milk. Try pita bread. Family -Style: Try grilled chicken breast on a bun; avoid breaded meats. O rder mustard instead of mayonnaise -based dressings. Avoid cheese sauces, 'special' sauces. Try a baked potato with toppings 'on the side', and use them sparingly. DRUGS THAT INTERACT WITH GRAPEFRUIT JUICE Alpha and Beta In a new meta -analysis, patients with type 2 diabetes who took cinnamon displayed improved fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels, but showed no significant changes in HbA1c levels.... In the past, cinnamon's glucose lowering effect has been studied in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but their results either lacked power due to the small sample sizes or results were just inconsistent. Allen et al, conducted a more recent met a-analysis of randomized controlled trials looking at cinnamon's effect on patients with type 2 diabetes. The RCTs included in the analysis studied the effects cinnamon had on diabetic patients vs. those who did not have diabetes (control group). Lab values were then obtained to measure these effects and either included: glycated hemoglobin (A 1c), fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C), high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), or triglyceride levels. Weighted mean differences among these levels were then calculated between the treatment group and control group. Among the 10 RCTs included in the study, cinnamon doses ranged from 120 mg/d to 6 g/day for 4 to 18 weeks. It was found that the intake of cinnamon did decrease levels of fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL- C, and triglyceride levels. It was also shown to increase levels of HDL -C, but it had no significant effect on A1c levels. In conclusion, cinnamon's antiglycemic effect in diabetic patients shows its consumption to be beneficial. However, since this meta -analysis does not focus on a standard dose of cinnamon to take among patients with diabetes, its clinical use is still limited. Allen RW, et al. Cinnamon Use in Type 2 Diabetes: An Updat ed Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis. 2013; 11(5): 452- 459. www.medscape.com Sweetened Drinks May Boost Depression, Coffee Reduce It Megan Brooks January 09, 2013 New observational research hints that regular consumption of sweetened beverages, particularly diet soda, may raise the risk for depression in adults, while drinking coffee may protect against depression. \"Our research suggests that cutting out or down on sweetened diet drinks or replacing them with unsweetened coffee may naturally help lower your depression risk,\" Honglei Chen, MD, PhD, from the National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, said in a statement. In an email to Medscape Medical News , Dr. Chen emphasized, however, that the biological mechanisms behind the associations \"are not well -understood\" and \"more research is needed to confirm these findings.\" Dr. Chen will present the research at the upcoming American Academy of Neurology 65th Annual Meeting in March. Beverages and Depression \"A few earlier studies reported that coffee consumption was associated with fewer suicides,\" Dr. Chen told Medscape Medical News. \"Last year, the Nurses' Health Study reported that coffee consumption was associated with lower risk of depression. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first prospective study on sweetened beverages and depression,\" Dr. Chen said. The study team prospectively evaluated intake of sweetened beverages, coffee, and tea in relation to depression among 263,925 US adults aged 50 to 71 years at the outset. Beverage consumption was assessed in 1995- 1996. In 2004- 2006, a total of 11,311 participants reported being diagnosed with depression. All analyses, Dr. Chen said, were based on \"extreme\" exposures, which they defined as 4 or more cups or cans per day versus nondr inkers. The results showed that people who drank 4 or more cups or cans of soda per day were 30% more likely to develop depression than those who drank no soda, whereas those who reported this level of intake of fruit punch were about 38% more likely to develop depression. People who drank 4 cups of coffee per day were about 10% less likely to develop depression than those who drank no coffee. Table 1. Beverage Intake and Risk for Depression With 4 or More Cans or Cups per Day vs None Beverage OR (95% CI) Soda 1.30 (1.17 - 1.44) Fruit punch 1.38 (1.15 - 1.65) Coffee 0.91 (0.84 - 0.98) All P for trend < .0001. CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio. The risk appeared to be greater for people who drank 4 or more cups or cans of diet soda, fruit punch, or iced tea, as opposed to the same amount of regular soda, fruit punch, or iced tea. Table 2. Depression Risk With Diet vs Regular Sweetened Drinks (4 or More Cans/Cups per Day vs None) Beverage OR (95% CI) Soft drinks Diet 1.31 (1.16 - 1.47) Regular 1.22 (1.03 - 1.45) Fruit punch Diet 1.51 (1.18 - 1.92) Regular 1.08 (0.79 - 1.46) Iced tea Diet 1.25 (1.10 - 1.41) Regular 0.94 (0.83 - 1.08) \"Consistently, constituent -based analyses showed higher depression risk with aspartame intake (ORs between extreme quintiles: 1.36; 95% CI 1.29- 1.44) and lower risk with caffeine intake (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.78- 0.89),\" the researchers report. Dr. Chen said the analyses were adjusted for \"many socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, and only included cases that reported a diagnosis at least 4 years after the dietary assessment. However, we could not exclude the possibility of confounding by other factors or the possibility that individuals at higher risk for depression were drawn to sweetened drinks .\" The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the National Cancer Institute.

Coffee, Alcohol Affect Diabetes - 12 Year Study Coffee, Alcohol Affect Diabetes - 12 Year Study: In a very large cohort of African- American women in the US, (late onset diabetes) was studied for 12 years. Tea and decaffeinated coffee showed no relation wit h diabetes, but the regular moderate intake of both caffeinated coffee and alcohol appeared to reduce the risk of contracting late onset diabetes significantly. This paper is particularly important because some previous studies have not shown a strong association between alcohol and the risk of cardiovascular disease among African -Americans. African -Americans, especially women, tend to drink little alcohol, yet are at markedly increased risk of late onset diabetes. In the present study, the approximately 30% lower risk for moderate alcohol drinkers was about the same in these African -American women as has been found in many previous studies of Caucasians. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;92:960. Four Cups of Tea, Coffee Seem to Protect Against Diabetes Drinking lots of coffee and tea every day -- even decaf -- might keep diabetes away, new research shows. Each additional cup of coffee consumed in a day was associated with a 7% reduction in the excess risk of diabetes.... According to Rachel Huxley, PhD, of the George Institute for International Health in Sydney, Australia, in a meta-analysis of 18 studies, drinking three to four cups of coffee per day was associated with a 25% lower risk of diabetes than drinking two cups or less per day (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.82). There were similar results for decaf coffee and tea. \"If such beneficial effects were observed in interventional trials to be real, the implications for th e millions of individuals who have diabetes, or who are at future risk of developing it, would be substantial,\" the researchers concluded in the Dec. 14/28, 2009 Archives of Internal Medicine. Over the years, a variety of investigators have reported that coffee and tea consumption are inversely associated with Type 2 diabetes. To sort out the data, Huxley and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 18 prospective studies between 1966 and July 2009 with information on 457,922 patients. The researchers fou nd a significant inverse relationship between coffee consumption and subsequent risk of diabetes. Each additional cup of coffee consumed in a day was associated with a 7% reduction in the excess risk of diabetes (95% CI 0.91 to 0.95, P<0.001). The researchers said the heterogeneity across studies was independent of effects involving gender, geographic region, or the method of diagnosis vs. self- report. Six of the studies reported on the association between drinking decaffeinated coffee and subsequent risk of diabetes. A pooled summary estimated that those who drank more than three to four cups of decaf coffee per day had about a third lower risk of diabetes than those who didn't drink any decaf (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77). Seven studies also looked at the association between tea and diabetes risk. Again, pooled summaries showed that patients who drank more than three to four cups of tea per day had about a 20% lower risk of diabetes than those who drank no tea (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94). The researchers noted that the coffee findings may be an overestimate due to \"small - study bias,\" and cautioned that any possibility that the association between coffee and diabetes risk is age -dependent warrants further investigation. The findings suggest that the prote ctive effects of tea and coffee may not be solely related to the effects of caffeine, but rather involve a broader range of chemical constituents including magnesium, lignans, and chlorogenic acids, the researchers wrote. Tea catechins, for example, may decrease glucose production in the gastrointestinal system, leading to lower levels of glucose and insulin, and green tea in particular may prevent damage to pancreatic beta cells. The study was limited by the potential for uncontrolled confounding, and beca use it precludes a more detailed analysis of the effect of adjustment for confounders at an individual level. Also, it may be limited in its generalizability because only 20% of cohorts were from nonwhite populations. Lars Ryd\u00e9n, MD, of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, a spokesperson for the European Society of Cardiology, called the study a \"cautiously and carefully conducted meta-analysis.\" \"There are sometimes claims that coffee may do harm, that it may increase the propensity to cardiovascular disease, but there is no evidence for this,\" Dr. Ryd\u00e9n said. \"The message is that people may drink coffee safely. Coffee from this point of view may actually be of benefit, as well as reducing the risk of getting diabetes -- although the reduction is small.\" But Ryd\u00e9n noted that other lifestyle issues are far more important than coffee intake. \"Coffee helps, but other things are even more important,\" he said. \"Those who are overweight should reduce their bodyweight by 5% to 10% -- not too much -- and include physical activity, such as a brisk walk for 30 minutes a day. Then those people who are at risk of developing diabetes will reduce this risk by 40 to 50%.\" Practice Pearl: Explain that in a meta -analysis of 18 studies, tea, coffee, and decaf coffee were associated with a significantly reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes. Huxley R, et al \"Coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and tea consumption in relation to incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus\" Arch Intern Med 2009; 169(22): 2053-63. Coffee may reduce risk for type 2 diabetes Need an excuse to drink yet another cup of coffee today? A new study suggests that increasing coffee consumption may decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes. The apparent relationship between coffee and type 2 diabetes is not new. Previous studies have found that drinking a few cups or more each day may lower your risk - with each subsequent cup nudging up the benefit. This most recent study, published in the journal Diabetologia , was more concerned with how changing coffee consumption - either increasing it or decreasing it over time - might affect your risk. The conclusion: People who upped their consumption by more than a cup per day had an 11% lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with people whose consumption held steady. Decreasing coffee consumption by the same amount - more than a cup a day - was associated with a 17% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The data is based on an analysis of more than 120,000 health professionals already being followed observationally long term. Researchers looked at the study participants' coffee drinking habits across four years to reach their conclusions. Just how much coffee each day provides a benefit? \"For type 2 diabetes, up to six cups per day is associated with lower risk,\" said Shilpa Bhupathiraju, a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health and lead study author, citing previous research. \"As long as coffee doesn't give you tremors, doesn't make you jittery, it is associated with a lot of health benefits.\" In the case of diabetes, the reasons behind the supposed protection confe rred by coffee are not clear, but there are theories based on animal research. One involves chemicals present in coffee - phenolic compounds and lignans - that may improve glucose metabolism, according to Bhupathiraju. She added that coffee is rich in magnesium, which is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Coffee drinking linked to longer life Wait, though. Before you scramble out to purchase your fourth latte of the day, it is important to note that the type of coffee matters. Lattes and other types of specialty drinks - often laden with sugar - were not studied. The type of coffee involved in this study tended to be a simple eight-ounce cup of black coffee containing about 100 milligrams of caffeine. \"People think of (increasing their intake) as going and drinking an extra blended drink,\" said Bhupathiraju. \"We are not talking about 'frappuchinos' or lattes. It's black coffee with milk and sugar.\" Coffee good for y ou, but it's OK to hold back And while coffee may be associated with a reduction in some chronic diseases (not just diabetes, but cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and - according to a New England Journal of Medicine study - with a longer life, over all) scientists are still reluctant to call coffee a panacea. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy one more cup in the meantime. Post by: Stephanie Smith -CNN Medical Producer Filed under: Diabetes Diet and Fitness Caffeine Comeback for Patients with Arrhythmia John Mandrola May 14, 2015 For years and years, physicians\u2014 including me \u2014have told patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmia to forgo the pleasures of chocolate and coffee. A study presented during a featured poster session at the Heart Rhythm Society 2015 Scientific Sessions suggests we were wrong.[1] Thank goodness. (I'll pause a moment for a sip of espresso.) The joyous poster was born from the database of the Cardiovascular Health Study , which is a population -based cohort in the US. CHS began in 1 989 and followed more than 5000 patients over the age of 65. Investigators from San Francisco, St Louis, and Portland asked the question of whether the common dogma of caffeine avoidance in patients with atrial and ventricular ectopy was wise. It is an imp ortant question because the antioxidant properties of dark chocolate, coffee, and tea may confer health benefits. Plus, we ask patients with arrhythmia to give up many of life's pleasures \u2014calories and alcohol and sometimes triathlons, for instance. If we also take their coffee or chocolate, we surely do a lot. The research team quantified premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in the 1414 individuals who were randomly assigned to have 24 -hour Holter monitors. They then compared that data with self -reported food frequency questionnaire and did the usual statistics to assess for associations. They found none. Coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption did not associate with PAC or PVC frequency. The authors noted CHS was the largest cohort study to look at dietary data and cardiac ectopy. And their findings suggest \"clinical recommendations advising against the consumption of caffeinated products in patients with PACs and PVCs should be reconsidered.\" Comments The first thing to note is the title of the poster. The authors used the term \"healthy\" caffeinated products for a good reason. They looked at natural products like chocolate, coffee, and tea \u2014not amped up, calorie- laden sports drinks. Recall that a cup of black coff ee has less than 10 calories. Second, we can agree that observational trials have weaknesses. They used self-reported diet questionnaires, the groups were not randomized, and 24 - hour samples of ectopy may not be representative of overall arrhythmia burden. Yet the findings align well with prior heart- rhythm data. This 2014 meta - analysis of caffeine risk in patients with atrial fibrillation concluded that the relationship was inverse.[2] Habitual caffeine consumption may actually reduce AF risk. The caffeine -health narrative was just covered in the New York Times .[3] Dr Aaron Carroll, an Indiana University pediatrician, health policy professor, and explanatory health journalist, summed up the evidence on \"healthy\" caffeine products and came to the conclusion that \"it's way past time that we stopped viewin g coffee as something we all need to cut back on.\" This abstract changes my practice. And here we have a medical reversal that is cause for celebration. JMM References 1. Dixit S, Stein PK, Dewland TA. Consumption of \"healthy\" caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the recommended daily allowance for sugar consumption is no more than 6 teaspoons per a day. A 12-oz can of Coca-Cola contains about 10 teaspoon of sugar. The high amounts of fructose corn syrup, refined salts, and caffeine found in soda contributes to high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity when regularly consumed. Those who drink 1-2 cans of sugary beverages a day are 26% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Within 20 minutes of consuming a 12- oz can of Coca-Cola, blood sugar levels spike, which causes a burst of insulin release. Caffeine absorption is complete after 40 minutes causing blood pressure to rise and adenosine receptors in the brain to be blocked, which prevents drowsiness. Dopamine production is increased after 45 minutes of consumption to stimulate the reward and pleasure center of the brain, similarly to how heroin works. The phosphoric acid, which masks the sweetness of the soda, also binds to calcium, magnesium, and zinc, preventing them from being absorbed and utilized for processes such as bone growth. After an hour, the diuretic effects of caffeine kick s in causing urinary excretion of the bonded calcium, magnesium, and zinc, as well as sodium, electrolyte, and water. Finally, a sugar crash occurs, causing irritability and drowsiness. This process occurs not only for Coca- Cola, but for all caffeinated carbonated beverages. However, this does not mean that soda should be completely banned from your diet. Soda consumption will not do any major harm in small amounts when part of a balanced diet and lifestyle. Like everything else, the key is moderation. Practice Pearls: A 12 -oz can of Coca-Cola contains about 10 teaspoon of sugar. That one can of soda has more sugar in it than recommended by the World Health Organization for an entire day. The high amounts of fructose corn syrup, refined salts, and caffeine found in soda contributes to high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity when regularly consumed. Those who drink 1-2 cans of sugary beverages a day are 26% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. \"Consumption of Sugary Drinks in the United States, 2005-2008,\" accessed 31 July 2015.

With many tempting foods available it can be tough to stick to your food plan. This resource is designed to provide you with information to help you count carbs and make good food choices. To lessen the impact on your glucose levels, try splitting food with a friend. Walking at the fair will also help you handle the extra carbs and calories and be sure to watch your intake of fried foods, which can be high in fat and carbs.

Healthy foods give you energy to live, learn, and be active. They help you to: \u007fGrow at a healthy rate and stay active. \u007fKeep your blood glucose (GLOO-kos), also called bloodsugar, in balance\u2014not too high and not too low. \u007fLose weight slowly, if needed, under your doctor's care. Carbs are a great source of energy for our bodies. Many foods contain carbs. Some are better for you than others. If you eat too many carbs at one time, yourblood glucose may get too high. Learn to eat the right amount at meals and snack times to keepyour blood glucose in balance. Choose carbs that have lots of fiber: \u007fWhole grain foods\u2014whole wheat b read and crackers, oatmeal, brown rice, and cereals. \u007fLentils and dried peas or beans such as kidney, black, white, split, or black-eyed. These foodsare also a good source of protein. \u007fFresh fruits and vegetables from every color of the rainbow\u2014red,orange, yellow, white, green, blue, and purple. \u007fOther good sources of carbs includenon- or low-fat dairy foods, soy milk,pasta, potatoes, corn, squash, and yams. Choose these carbs less often: \u007f white bread \u007f white rice \u007f sweetened fruit drinks \u007f regular soda \u007f sweets and dessertsHow does food affect my body? Food is the fuel that our bodies use for energy. The three main sources of fuel arecarbohydrates (CAR-boh-HY-drates),protein, and fat. The body changesthese fuels into glucose for energy orstores them as fat. Eating a balance offoods that contain carbohydrates (carbs forshort), protein, and fat every day will help keepyour blood glucose close to normal. It may alsokeep your weight where you and your doctorwant it to be.Protein helps build strong muscles and bones. Foods with protein do not makeblood glucose go up like carbs do. Having protein in your meal can help you feel less hungry. Foods that are a good source of protein include: \u007fMeat and poultry without skin or extra fat. \u007fFish, low-fat cheese, and eggs. \u007fNatural peanut butter and soy products like tofu. Fats are a good source of fuel for the body and help you grow. Fat does not make blood glucose go up but too much fat can make you gainweight. Some fats are better for you than others. Choose the types of fats that keep your heart healthy: \u007fSmall portions of low-fat salad dressing, mayonnaise, and margarine. \u007fSmall amounts of nuts, olives, and olive oil. \u007fA slice of avocado. Choose these high fat foods less often. They arenot healthy for your heart: \u007fButter, stick margarine, and regular mayonnaise. \u007fFried foods like potato chips and french fries. \u007fMeats with fat on them, bacon, deli meats, and hot dogs. \u007fCakes, cookies, pies, and other desserts.

Start by stocking the home with healthier choices vs high sugar, high fat snacks/foods. Look at your dishes that you eat off of. There is an experiment, where intelligent persons were told that eating off of a larger plate created larger portions. Surely they would not be victim to this, smart persons that they are! But in an experiment where MBA students were given a 90 minute lecture on this concept and then brought back in 6 weeks to eat Chex Mix from large or small bowls. The folks who used the larger bowls ate 153 extra calories per session! Using smaller plates and tall skinny glasses vs short fat glasses makes a difference in our mind's eye. And that is what we are fig hting at times. Do you know how many times per day you make decisions about food? The estimate is about 200 times per day. When asked do you remember the last time you overate and to the point of regret and why? 93% of people remember the situation. Reasons were given as celebrating, 49% said for the taste of the food, and 39% said they were overly hungry before eating. In the movie theater experiment at Mount Prospect, they aged fresh popcorn to 5 days old (stale), but fed it in large containers to mo vie goers. At first taste they thought it wasn't very good and stopped, but as the movie went on they kept at it and took in 35% more in the larger containers than the smaller ones. These illusions are really hard to break. Some Herbs That Might Cause Surgery Problems Many common herbs can pose a risk during surgery. For example, some can interact with anesthetics or increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Research on these problems is only just beginning. Here are examples of possible complications that doctors suspect herbs may cause during or after surgery. ECHINACEA: allergic reactions; when used for less than eight weeks, diminished effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs; when used for more than eight weeks, suppressed immune system leading to poor wound healing or infection EPHEDRA (ma huang): disturbances of blood vessel function and blood circulation, heart attack, stroke, interactions with some anesthetics and other drugs; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about ephedra's many dangers. GARLIC: increased bleeding risk GINGER: increased bleeding risk GINKO: increased bleeding risk GINSENG: increases in heart rate or blood pressure, interference with anti - clotting medicines, increased bleeding risk, too- low blood sugar levels KAVA: prolonged sedation; FDA has issued a consumer advisory, warning that kava can seriously damage the liver ST. JOHN'S WART: prolonged sedation; changes blood levels of many other drugs VALERIAN : prolonged sedation In addition, there's a chance that an herb may interact with some of the drugs used during surgery. And even if the herb itself is safe, there's no guarantee that the bottle actually contains that herb and is free of unlabeled drugs, additives, or contaminants. Taken from diabetes forecast Aug 2003 What are dietary supplements? A Dietary supplements include vitamins, minerals, and other less familiar substances \u2014 such as herbals, botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, and animal extracts (see box at right). Dietary supplements are also mareketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, and gelcaps. While some dietary supplements are well understood and established, others need further study. What are the benefits of dietary supple - ments? A Some supplements can help assure that you get an adequate dietary intake of essential nutrients; others may help you reduce the risk of disease. However, supplements should not replace the variety of foods that are important to a healthful diet \u2014 so, be sure you eat a variety of foods as well. Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases. That means supplements should not make claims, such as \"reduces arthritic pain\" or \"treats heart disease.\" Claims like these can only legitimately be made for drugs, not dietary supplements. Are there any risks in taking supplements? A Yes. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects in the body. This could make them unsafe in some situations, and hurt or complicate your health. For example, the following actions could lead to harmful \u2014 even life-threatening \u2014 consequences. Combining supplements Using supplements with medications (whether prescription or over -the-counter) Substituting supplements for prescription medicines Taking too much of some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin D, and iron Some supplements can also have unwanted effects before, during, and after surgery. So, be sure to inform your health-care provider, including your pharmacist, about any supplements you are taking \u2014 especially before surgery.Some Common Dietary Supplements: Acidophilus Echinacea Fiber Ginger Acids St. John's Wort Saw Palmetto Vitamins Note: These examples do not represent either an endorsement or approval by FDA. Safety n Health n Science n Nutrition May 2006 1FOOD From the U.S. Food and Drug Administration QDietary Supplements What You Need to Know You've heard about them, have probably used them, and have even recommended them to friends or family. But how much do you really know about dietary supplements? Yes, some can be beneficial to your health \u2014 but taking supplements can also involve health risks. Read on for important information for you and your family about dietary supplements. Q QFor more information, contact: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Food Information Line at 1-888-SAFEFOOD (toll free), 10 AM to 4 PM ET , Monday through Friday . Or visit the FDA Web site at www.fda.gov .Safety n Health n Science n Nutrition May 2006 2 n n n FOOD Who's responsible for the safety of dietary supplements? A Dietary supplements are not approved by the government for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed. If the dietary supplement contains a NEW ingredient, that ingredient will be reviewed by FDA (not approved) prior to marketing \u2014 but only for safety, not effectiveness. The manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements are responsible for making sure their products are safe BEFORE they go to market. Manufacturers are required to produce dietary supplements in a quality manner and ensure that they do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled. Manufacturers will also be required to report all serious dietary supplement related harmful effects or illnesses to FDA starting January, 2008.FDA can take dietary supplements off the market if they are found to be unsafe or if the claims on the products are false and misleading. How can I find out more about the dietary supplement I'm taking? A If you want to know more about the product you are taking, check with the manufacturer or distributor about: Information to support the claims of the product Information on the safety and effectiveness of the ingredients in the product Any reports of adverse effects or events from consumers using the product How can I be a smart supplement shopper? A Although the benefits of some dietary supplements have been documented, the claims of others may be unproven. If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Be a savvy supplement user. Here's how: Watch out for false statements like: - A quick and effective \"cure-all\" - Can treat or cure diseases - \"Totally safe\" or has \"no side effects\" Be aware that the term natural doesn't always mean safe. Don't assume that even if a product may not help you, at least it won't hurt you. When searching for supplements on the Web, use the sites of respected organizations, rather than doing blind searches. Ask your health-care provider for help in distinguishing between reliable and questionable information. Always remember \u2014 safety first! For further information, visit: www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/default.htmBefore making decisions about whether to take a supplement, see your health-care provider and/or a registered dietitian. They can help you achieve a balance between the foods and nutrients you personally need. Q Q QWhat should I do if I have a reaction to a dietary supplement? You, your health-care provider, or anyone else should report a serious problem from the use of any dietary supplement directly to FDA's MedWatch Program at: 1-800-FDA-1088 (toll-free phone number) 1-800-FDA-0178 (fax) www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm (Web site) FDA would like to know whenever the use of a dietary supplement causes you to have a serious reaction or illness, even if you're not certain that the product was the cause, and/or you did not visit a doctor or clinic.

The nutrients are comparable. 2. Modify Your Mayo Switch from two tablespoons of regular mayonnaise to two tablespoons of low-fat mayonnaise. 3. Rethink Your Drink Substitute a 12-ounce can of a diet soft drink at 0 calories for a similar amount of a regu- lar soft drink at 150 calories. Or, drink a cold glass of water, perhaps with a slice of lemon! This strategy also may help you eat less in other ways. According to Dr. Barbara Rolls, Pennsylvania State University nutrition professor and author of Volumetrics: Feel Full on Fewer Calories : \u0093Various liquids are processed by different mechanisms in the body. The hungerand thirst mechanisms are quite separate. A soft drink will trigger thirst mecha-nisms, not hunger mechanisms, and add calories without satisfying hunger. You may end up consuming more total calories than if you didn\u0092t take the drink.\u0094 4. Downsize Your Drink If you\u0092ve been drinking a 20-ounce container of a regular soft drink, switch to a 12-ounce container size. 5. \u0093Dress,\u0094 Don\u0092t \u0093Drown\u0094 Your Salad Pam Anderson ( How to Cook Without a Book, Broadway Books, 2000) advises about 1 tablespoon of oil and a teaspoon of vinegar for each 1-1/2 cup portion of salad. In How to Make Salad (Boston Common Press, 1998), the test kitchen staff for Cook\u0092s Illustrated magazine advise 1/4 cup of vinaigrette should be enough to dress 2 quarts (8 cups) of loosely packed salad, an amount they suggest for 4 servings. That means each 2-cup serv-ing of salad greens should have about 1 tablespoon of dressing on it. TIP: Dressing slides off damp salad greens and collects in the bottom of the salad bowl. You\u0092ll get more flavor with less dressing if salad greens are washed and thoroughly dried. Bagged lettuce that\u0092s pre-washed and labeled \u0093ready to eat\u0094 should be dry enough as is. If you need to wash salad greens, the easiest way to dry them is in a salad spinner. Pack lightly to avoid overcrowding and bruising the greens. After spinning, pat off any remaining moisture with clean paper towels. If you don\u0092t have a spinner, dry greens thoroughly with clean paper towels. If you\u0092ve been using 3 (or more!) tablespoons of dressing per two cups of salad, try cutting back to 1-1/2 tablespoons of dressing or less. Or experiment with some of the reduced calorie versions \u0097 even then, your salad will taste best if \u0093dressed,\u0094 not \u0093drowned.\u0094 6. Size up Your Cereal Bowl A study reported in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition (June, 2001) found the amount of cereal eaten by adults was approximatelytwice the serving size listed on the box. That\u0092s not necessarily bad, but maybe one place calories are sneaking into meals. Check the portion size you\u0092repouring in relation to the size cited on the box; decide if you\u0092re pouring more calories than desired. Try eating from a smaller bowl to aid in portion control. - 2 -Single Dietary Changes Equal to about 100 calories- 3 -11/037. Watch Your Bread and Spread Limit the amount of bread (or rolls) and spread eaten before the main course to one serving when dining out. You always can eat more later if you\u0092re still hungry! 8. Count Your Cookies A single medium-sized cookie easily can have about 100 calories. Often we pop two or more into our mouths before we realize it. If you feel you\u0092re not getting enough \u0093crunch\u0094 by limiting yourself to one cookie, try eating an apple instead \u0097 the calories are similar. 9. Top Your Potato with Fewer Calories It\u0092s easy to slather a couple of tablespoons of butter or margarine (200 calories/2 tablespoons)on a baked potato. Try switching to sour cream; you canhave as much as a fourth cup for 100 calories. For even fewer calories, use oneof the light or fat-free sour creams. Or, substitute yogurt for sour cream. 10. Lessen Your Liquor If you drink alcohol, limit your daily consumption to one drink for women and two drinks for men as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines. A typical 5-oz. glass of wine has 100calories; a 12-oz. serving of beer, 150 calories; and 1 1/2 ounces of distilled spirits, 100 calories. 11. Be Size-wise with Fast Food Try one or more of these strategies the next time you visit your favorite fast food restaurant and you easily can save 100 or more calories: \u0095 Skip the mayonnaise when ordering your favorite fast food burger. If you\u0092re not very hungry, perhaps a \u0093small,\u0094\u0093regular,\u0094 \u0093junior\u0094 or whatever term is used by the restau-rant for its smallest burger, may be enough for you. \u0095 Order the smallest size of fries or split them with a friend. \u0095 Instead of fries, consider a side salad with a fat-free or reduced calorie dressing. It\u0092s still important to check thecalories on the salad dressing. Many salad dressings come in packets; a reducedcalorie dressing still may contain around 100 or more calories per packet. Refer backto tip number 5 \u0097 your salad might taste just fine without using the whole packet. \u0095 Order a diet soft drink or plain water. See tips 3 and 4 for more about this. Most fast food places offer nutrition information, including calories, at their restaurant. Many also provide nutrition information on their company Web site. At your next opportunity, total the calories you obtain from your favorite fast food meal. For many adults and children(age 2 and older), a calorie range somewhere between 1,600 to 2,200 is sufficient. It\u0092s easyto consume one-half or more of your daily caloric needs at one fast food meal, especially ifyou\u0092re super-sizing portions! 12. Practice Portion Control with Popcorn Popping microwave popcorn can be a daily occurrence in many work- places and homes. It\u0092s easy to eat half a bag or more at a sitting. While even TWO cups of the more buttery popcorns may weigh in at 100 calories or less, the entire package might yield 10 or more cups, or possibly over 500 calories! To gauge how many cups of corn you\u0092re consuming, one cup is about equal in size to a baseball or to your fist. Microwave popcorn can be a great snack. If you\u0092d like more than a few cups, experiment with some of the lower-fat versions.Fermented Foods for Better Blood Sugar Did you know that fermented foods like pickles and sauerkraut have anti - diabetes properties? By Elizabeth Keyser Tangy, tingling, Foods that have been fermented deliver umami and they also have unique health benefits, especially for people with diabetes. Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of preserving food. It's what transforms milk into yogurt; cabbage into sauerkraut and Korean kimchi ; soybeans into miso; and fruit into vinegar. The best part is that research shows that these foods are good for your blood sugar levels. The acids in fermented foods\u2014lactic and acetic acid \u2014interfere with carbohydrates' turning into blood sugar, thereby reducing spi kes. These benefits can carry over to the next meal \u2014but that's not all. Silent Health Boosters The good bacteria in fermented foods break down carbohydrates into acids, and promote the growth of more friendly bacteria. When we eat fermented foods, friendl y bacteria are allowed to thrive in our intestines, guarding our cells and fighting off the bad bacteria that can make us sick. They may also boost immune response, lower bad cholesterol, raise good cholesterol, and even have anti -carcinogenic properties. Modern methods of making yogurt, sauerkraut, miso, and other fermented products tend to take shortcuts, slashing fermentation and aging times. That means fewer health benefits and less flavor. Shop at natural supermarkets, specialty markets, health-food stores, and farmstands whenever you can to find these healthy foods made the traditional way. One of the best and easiest things you can do for your health is to eat one cup of yogurt a day. Along with being a great source of protein and calcium, yogurt comes with myriad health benefits, thanks to the friendly bacteria produced during fermentation. Buy plain yogurt that says it has \"live, active cultures\" or is \"probiotic.\" Check the fine print for lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, and bifidus . If you're not someone who likes eating yogurt as- is, try using it in salad dressings and marinades. Also, cucumbers and yogurt make a classic cooling dish to serve with spicy foods. Want to get elegant? Create an easy first -course soup. Chop ripe tomatoes, and cook them in a small amount of olive oil for ten minutes to reduce some of the liquid. Pur\u00e9e in a food processor, and strain through a fine sieve. Season with a pinch of salt. Mix the liquid into enough yogurt (that's come to room temperature) to keep the tomato color bright. Ladle into espresso cups, garnish with small basil or mint leaves, and top with a sprinkle of sea salt. Cabbage: Sauerkraut and Kimchi Sauerkraut is a Northern European dish made from shredded cabbage fermented with salt at a low temperature in a covered jar. The salt draws out liquids, creating brine that keeps the cabbage in an oxygen-free environment. There, beneficial bacteria transform it into a tart and healthy side dish that makes a tasty compani on to rich meats, like sausages. (The cabbage brine is a folk remedy for constipation.) Kimchi, a Korean dish, is made from whole cabbage leaves fermented with salt, garlic, hot pepper, and fish sauce (a fermented condiment made from anchovies). Spicy, garlicky, and sometimes fizzy, kimchi goes well with grilled beef. Olives Olives, which are too bitter to eat right from the tree, are made edible and savory by soaking in lye and fermenting in salt brine. Today, most grocery stores carry selections of Greek and European olives in the salad bar sections. Beware, however: canned black olives are not fermented, and have little flavor. When storing tasty salad -bar olives in your refrigerator, submerge them in brine or olive oil to keep them fo r weeks. A bowl of olives is an easy addition to a platter of appetizers. Or buy a jar of tapenade\u2014this chopped olive spread is great with raw vegetables and apple slices. You can also cook with whole, pitted olives . Braise or bake chicken thighs with olives and dried apricots (first, soak them to rehydrate) to add sweet and salty flavors. Miso Asian cultures use fermentation to transform soybeans into foods like soy sauce and miso. Japanese in origin, miso is a paste made by fermenting soybeans (or sometimes barley or rice) in a two -step process that converts the beans' carbohydrates into lactic acids. Rich, roasty-flavored miso can be used in salad dressings or marinades, but one of the tastiest ways to enjoy it is in miso soup . Made with dashi (broth from seaweed and bonito fish flakes) mixed with miso paste, the soup gets protein from cubes of soft tofu, and is garnished with scallion. Look for \"slow -fermented\" miso made with no artificial additives. Vinegar Vinegar is fermented alcohol. It can be made from pure alcohol (white vinegar), wine (red wine vinegar), apple cider (cider vinegar), rice (rice wine vinegar), malted barley (malt vinegar), or fruit (apple cider vinegar, for example). Vinegar is created when bacteria causes alcohol to convert into ace tic acid. The health benefits of vinegar were heralded even before the ancient Romans, who drank it mixed with water and honey. Use vinegar in dressings and marinades, or drink it diluted as a tonic. It plays an important role in the flavor of this Easy Russian Borscht , balancing the sweetness of the beets. Acetic acid, the acid in vinegar, is anti- microbial, which makes it a great preserving medium. The cucumber pickles you buy on the shelf in the grocery store aren't fermented at all. Instead, they're preserved in brine solutions made of vinegar, salt, and water, and heated in a water bath to prevent spoilage. The pickles don't develop the complex flavors that fermentation gives. That's why sugar and spices, like dill, are often added to the brine. It's fun to make homemade pickles , and it also allows you to curb the sugar in the brine. The vinegary brine is what provides all the health benefits \u2014and, most importantly, thwarts the effects of carbs on blood sugar.

While healthy, family meals are important to him, the nutrition quality often gets put on the back burner as time is king. The meal needs to be fast and easy to make so his limited repertoire of dinner options consists of pasta, hot dogs, veggie burgers, and hamburgers. Bryan reached out to me asking, \"I need some h elp with fast and healthy recipes, but I don't have the time at night or on the weekend to find dinner ideas. Do you have any suggestions?\" Understanding his dilemma, I knew there had to be an app for this so I scoured the Internet.
