Migraine treatment options You must be wondering how to treat headaches and migraines because the pain is too much to bear at times. While doctors have not found a cure for migraine and headache treatment, there are a plethora of options that you can choose from to relieve migraine symptoms when they occur and to prevent attacks in the future. For example, you can drink more water so that you get better soon. When you get a migraine, you can close your eyes and rest in a dark room where there is no light. This can help relieve you of the pain associated with a migraine attack. You can also place an ice pack on your forehead to relieve migraine pain. You can take medications for migraine that relieve you of migraine pain. This type of migraine treatment is called abortive treatment and medications need to be taken when you are already experiencing a migraine attack.

The following are some of the medications that you can take which help you feel better when you are already experiencing a migraine attack. Triptans are prescription medications and an example is Imitrex. Triptans can be taken in multiple ways including as nasal sprays and pills. These drugs can prove to be effective during a migraine because they block the brain pathways related to pain. If you are prone to a [heart attack](https://www.narayanahealth.org/heart-attack) then Triptans should be avoided at all costs. Opioid medicines are only prescribed when no other form of migraine treatment is working. These are seen as a last resort to relieve pain due to migraines. These types of medicines can be addictive which is why they are not often prescribed but they do help relieve many migraine symptoms. Pain relievers such as prescription drugs or over-the-counter medications can help feel better when you have a migraine attack. However prolonged use of pain relievers can cause other health conditions such as ulcers. Anti-nausea medications are often used for relieving migraine pain in those people who experience severe headaches and vomiting along with nausea. Anti-nausea medicines are usually used in conjunction with pain relievers to alleviate migraine symptoms. You should speak to your doctor about which medications are safe for you especially if you have a history of allergy or already suffer from a health condition. Prolonged use of OTC drugs can aggravate your condition, hence it is essential to check with a doctor about what you can safely take and what dosages should be prescribed. 7.

You can try acupuncture which is great for people with chronic migraine pain. However, we recommend you consult your doctor before you try out any of these alternative therapies that can help prevent a migraine attack.

Foods such as peanut butter, sunflower seeds, almonds, cashews, oatmeal, and eggs are rich in magnesium. Sometimes essential oils can help. For instance, lavender oil can help you feel better when you are experiencing chronic headaches such as headache due to stress or anxiety headache. There has been a published study that has found that people who inhaled lavender oil for 15 minutes felt better. You can even apply diluted lavender oil on your temples when you experience forehead headache such as headache right side of head or headache on left side of head. You should speak to your doctor about the natural remedies that you want to try because not all remedies are effective for everyone. Your migraine doctor can advise you on the kind of treatments or alternative treatments that will work for you. "}
