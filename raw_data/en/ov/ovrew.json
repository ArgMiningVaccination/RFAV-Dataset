Treating myself to massages, facials, body scrubs, hand and foot treatments (I could go on and on) was something that I really didn't get into until my late 30's (better late than never) and the fact that there is so much science backing up how taking care of ourselves in this way can reduce stress and help us solve a number of mental and physical health issues, well that's just a huge bonus for all of us.... April is Stress Awareness Month; (so why am I writing this in August?) Because I also believe that we need to be focusing our awareness on our Health, Happiness and Well Being every day.... I don't have to tell you the downside of stress and unresolved stress related issues and how they have numerous negative impacts in every area of our lives. Stress happens, and it happens and manifests for all of us in different ways. Allowing yourself the opportunity to relax is key to keeping those stress and anxiety levels under control. For many people, relaxation, de-stressing and re-energizing includes a day at the spa. (or at least a couple of hours) Spa treatments and massage therapies, which can be quick and pretty affordable, create both mental and physical health benefits. In fact, [studies ](http://www.webmd.com/beauty/spa/spas-the-risks-and-benefits?page=1)have shown that the frequency of visiting a spa directly correlates with better quality sleep, fewer sick days, reduced absenteeism from work and fewer hospitalizations. Very cool! More specifically, the far infrared heat from the [BioMat,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y75ZMdiMu70&list=PL_4z3pYLRyq2SSsegKN_UpLEgp69Uq5D8) a hot tub, sauna or steam shower soothes aches and pains from arthritis, fibromyalgia and other joint issues. Hydrotherapy, heat therapy and massages both improve blood circulation and manage blood pressure. Throughout the process of massage therapy, lymph flow stimulation enhances the immune system. Proper lymph flow helps the body's defense, draws out metabolic waste, excess water, toxins, and bacteria from the muscles. Swelling and soreness decreases while ability to fight off disease increases. [Massage](https://rosemaryfusca.typepad.com/my-blog/2018/06/ayurvedic-massages-and-why-you-should-get-regular-treatments.html) also improves circulation and posture. [Facials ](https://rosemaryfusca.typepad.com/my-blog/2017/07/12-reasons-to-get-regular-facials.html)and [Foot Treatments](https://rosemaryfusca.typepad.com/my-blog/2017/04/10-reasons-to-get-regular-reflexology-treatments.html) detoxify the skin from built up waste and bacteria. That's important because the skin is not only the largest organ in the body, but also the first line of defense against environmental toxins. Facials also release stress tension from the head and neck, which can prevent headaches. Body Scrubs exfoliate and nourish the skin through the earth's natural elements, like soil, clay, and water, which are full of vitamins and minerals.
