As we age, a decline in bone-protecting hormones can cause weak bones. As a result, postmenopausal women and older men are most likely to get this condition. Other factors that increase the risk of osteoporosis include body size, ethnicity, family history, diet, medical conditions, medications, inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol use. Verywell / Ellen Lindner Often there are no symptoms. That is why it is referred to as a \"silent\" disease. Osteoporosis is a condition not often discovered until a fracture or vertebrae collapse. The delay in diagnosis plus subsequent injuries can result in back pain, loss of height, and/or a hunched posture. While medications can treat osteoporosis, herbs have become a popular remedy for those suffering from this condition. This article examines the research behind these natural treatments and whether they can improve bone loss and osteoporosis. Who Is at Risk for Osteoporosis? About 54 million people are suffering from osteoporosis and low bone mass, making them susceptible to this condition. This condition occurs at any age, but adults 50 and older are most at risk. The Link Between Osteoporosis and Menopause Natural Herbs for Osteoporosis Treatment There are many natural herbs recommended for osteoporosis. They may be used in cooking or are taken as a supplement in the form of a pill, powder, or tea. Here is a list of herbs that may improve bone health and work as an alternative treatment for osteoporosis: Red sageRed cloverHorsetail ThymeTurmeric Talk to Your Doctor About Herbs and Supplements Always consult your doctor if you're considering taking an herb as a long-term supplement. Some herbs, including the ones listed in this article, may interfere with some medicines. If you have any health conditions and/or are on medications it is best to ask your doctor before taking a new supplement. Red Sage Red sage (Salvia miltiorrhiza) is a plant used in Chinese herbal medicine (where it is known as danshen) that has been associated with improvements in osteoporosis. A review of 36 clinical trials found red sage treated and improved more than 80% of osteoporosis cases. However, most research consisted of only small-sized, short-term studies. Salvianolic acid, tanshinones, and magnesium lithospermate B are compounds in red sage that may improve bone health. Salvianolic acids have antioxidant properties that prevent inflammation and free radical production associated with the breakdown of bone. These compounds can also help bone growth. Red sage is also a good source of vitamin K, which is needed for healthy bones. This herb comes in the form of a capsule or tincture, and it can be made into a tea. Red sage should be used for only a short period due to the safety concerns with long-term use. This herb may also cause side effects and drug interactions and is contraindicated during pregnancy and in use with blood thinners. More research needs to be done to find the proper dosage for osteoporosis. Red Clover Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is a perennial herb belonging to the legume family. Historically, it has been used as a complementary treatment for menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, as well as a variety of illnesses, including cancer, respiratory problems, and skin conditions. Research is mixed when it comes to red clover and osteoporosis. A 2015 study had 60 menopausal women take 150 milligrams of red clover for 12 weeks and the results were compared to a group that took a placebo (a substance having no therapeutic value). Researchers found that bone mineral density was improved in the women who took red clover. However, other studies showed no change in bone health. Red clover can be consumed as an ingredient in herbal tea, as well as through capsules, tinctures, extracts, and as a topical treatment. Horsetail Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) is a huge, tree-like perennial plant found throughout parts of Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North America. It is a medicinal herb that dates back to ancient Rome and Greece. Horsetail has been used to treat wounds, tuberculosis, and kidney issues. Quercetin, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid are antioxidants found in horsetail. These compounds may improve calcium levels and increase bone growth. Horsetail also contains the compound silica. Supplements made from silica have been linked to improved bone mineral density and strength. Although some benefits have been associated with horsetail, it still may not be the best option for you. Getting enough calcium may be more beneficial to bone health. Taking a calcium supplement for one year improved bone density better than horsetail in a study involving 122 postmenopausal women. Horsetail comes in capsules, tinctures, and as a dried herb that can be made into a tea or mixed with liquid and applied to the skin. Warnings for Horsetail Consumption Long-term use of horsetail is not advised. This herb can lower thiamin (B1) levels and may cause a deficiency in this vitamin. Horsetail could be harmful to pregnant women and those with diabetes, gout, heart issues, and kidney problems. Thyme Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) is an herb in the mint (Lamiaceae) family native to the Mediterranean. This small, low-growing shrub is a popular spice to use in cooking. It also is a medicinal plant that dates back to ancient times. Thyme has been used to enhance immune function and treat respiratory, nerve, and heart conditions. One study examined how taking 1,000 milligrams of thyme daily for six months would affect 40 postmenopausal women. Researchers found that regular consumption of thyme improved bone mineral density better than a calcium/vitamin D3 supplement. Thyme may be most effective when used with sage and rosemary. Bone mineral density levels were higher with this combination than with thyme alone. Vitamins in Thyme Thyme also offers a good source of calcium, vitamin K, magnesium, manganese, and zinc. These nutrients can improve bone health. You can find thyme as a fresh and dried herb. Oil extracts of thyme are also available in liquid and capsule form. Thyme is considered safe when used in small amounts. Large doses of this herb have been associated with side effects. Thyme may be harmful to people with bleeding disorders and hormone-sensitive conditions. It can also cause allergies in those allergic to other Lamiaceae plants such as oregano, sage, and lavender. This herb shows promise as a treatment for osteoporosis, but more research is needed to know how it can help bones long term. Turmeric Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a yellow perennial root belonging to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and native to South Asia. Its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties have made it important to herbal medicine for the past 4,000 years. Turmeric has been used to treat menstrual symptoms, arthritis, and digestive issues. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may help with low bone density. A preliminary study found taking a curcumin supplement for six months showed significant improvements in 57 people with low bone density. Turmeric comes as a dried powder that can be used in cooking. It is also available in a tincture, liquid, or capsule form. Side effects have been seen when using large doses or taking turmeric for more than 12 months. Turmeric may also cause allergies and complications in those with bleeding disorders, diabetes, and gallbladder issues. Longer studies need to confirm the overall safety and effectiveness of turmeric and curcumin for treating osteoporosis. Caution should be taken when trying this herb. Summary Herbal remedies have been seen as a natural alternative to osteoporosis medications. These plants contain bone-strengthening compounds that may improve bone growth. The research shows promise, but we need more extended large-scale studies to find the long-term effects of these herbs on osteoporosis. There is still a lot we don't know about these herbs and their effects on osteoporosis. If you are looking for help with your osteoporosis, these plants may be a good complement to your medical treatment, depending on your health status. Be sure to talk with your doctor before adding any supplements to your care routine. Frequently Asked Questions What are some other natural remedies for osteoporosis?
