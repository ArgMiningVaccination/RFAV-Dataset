These are gateways through which the practitioner exerts influence upon organs and functions, stimulating and activating the body's self-healing mechanisms. It is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine, (TCM) which also includes the application of electrical stimulation, heat, acupressure, diet, and Herbal Medicine. [back to top](#top) [What Is Qi? ] Qi is the substance of life. As the basis of the universe's infinite manifestations, Qi is present in all life forms. Pathways of Qi run throughout the body and are known as meridians or channels. Each channel is linked to a particular organ. These channels are the paths along which Qi flows, supplying life and energy to every cell. When systemic Qi flow is blocked, disharmony is crested and we experience disease. [back to top](#top) [How Does Acupuncture Work? ] Its theoretical basis is that everyone is born with a fixed amount of energy at birth. The Qi flows through the body along invisible pathways referred to as \"meridians\". Chinese Medicine is based on the discovery that certain areas of the skin are related to internal body organs and specific bodily functions. Insertion of very fine needles, sometimes combined with electrical stimulation and heat, serves to unblock and stimulate energy in the meridians and allow the Qi to flow freely and sufficiently once again. [back to top](#top) [Why Do They Need To Feel My Pulse? ] There are 12 pulse positions on each wrist that your acupuncturist will palpate. Each position corresponds to s specific meridian and organ. Your acupuncturist will be looking for 27 individual qualities that reflect overall health. If there are any problems, they may appear in the pulse. [back to top](#top) [Why Do They Want To Look At My Tongue? ] The tongue is a map of the body. It reflects the general health of the organs and meridians. Your acupuncturist will look at the color, shape, cracks and coating on your tongue. [back to top](#top) [How Many Treatments Will I Need?] The number of treatments will vary from person to person. Some people experience immediate relief, others may take months or even years to achieve results. Chronic conditions usually take longer to resolve than acute ones. Plan a minimum of month to see significant changes. [back to top](#top) [What Should I Expect During Treatment? ] Where the acupuncture needle has been inserted, you may experience a vague numbness, heaviness, tingling, or dull ache. Sometimes people experience a sensation of energy spreading and moving around the needle. This is called the \"Qi sensation\". All these reactions are good and a sign that the treatment is working. After treatment, you may feel energized or may experience a deep sense of relaxation and well being. [back to top](#top) [How Safe Is Acupuncture? ] Acupuncture is extremely safe. It is an all-natural, drug free therapy, with no side effects except the feeling of relaxation and well being. There is little or no danger of infection from acupuncture needles because they are sterile, used once, and then discarded.

They are used to strengthen, build and support the body or to clear it of excess problems like a cold, fever or acute pain.
