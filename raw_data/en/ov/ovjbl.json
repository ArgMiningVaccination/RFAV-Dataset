Pay only $79 for your 1st IV Therapy Infusion ($100 savings!) The start of 2020 was marked by the devastating effect of the COVID-19 virus. As we progressed, the number of affected and the death toll rose in exponential numbers. With the invention of vaccination, the spread of the COVID-19 virus was kept in check. But the second wave of COVID-19 is even more critical. In some nations, the number of infected is rising every minute, while a large number is struggling to stay alive. In this situation, the medical fraternity is looking for an alternative yet effective way of treating COVID-19 patients. A recent clinical study has revealed that Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, effectively treats COVID-19. Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C is proven to reduce the suffering of people diagnosed with the Coronavirus. The use of IV infusion therapy in Houston has been fruitful, and the same appears in the COVID-19 critical care guideline in Eastern Virginia Medical School. Apart from doctors in the United States of America, doctors in Italy and China are also using IV Vitamin C. A fluid containing Vitamin C is directly injected into the bloodstream intravenously, typically that of the arm. Such intravenous injection of Vitamin C is supervised by registered medical professionals in a clinic only. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin that finds application in treating several critical illnesses. Due to its anti-inflammatory property, Vitamin C influences cellular immunity and integrity of the vascular bodies of the cells. Vitamin C also possesses antioxidant properties and acts as a free radical scavenger. In states of oxidative stress, the human body needs more Vitamin C. The Coronavirus is characterized by severe respiratory syndrome coupled with influenza. Such a state increases stress in the body, and intravenous injection of Vitamin C can heal the pain and agony. Clinical study has shown Vitamin C is an effective therapy to treat the acute respiratory syndrome. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs to curb the spread of the Coronavirus, emphasis is being given on enhancing the host immunity defense. Injecting intravenous doses of Vitamin C can reduce the requirement of high doses of immunosuppressive drugs used to treat patients infected with the Coronavirus. Although no specific drug is available to date to treat patients infected with COVID-19, IV Vitamin C is clinically proven effective. There are different theories on how IV Vitamin C works. Still, the most accepted theory says that a very high dose of Vitamin C creates and releases free radicles when injected into the veins. The human body has an innate defensive mechanism against the free radicles, but the Coronavirus cannot withstand the free radicles and is destroyed. The other acceptable theory says that IV Vitamin C renews the level of antioxidants in the body. Serious infection like that of COVID-19 can consume the body's residual antioxidants and Vitamin C very quickly. Intravenous doses of Vitamin C can promote the body's immunity system and production of antioxidants. Intravenous Vitamin C is safe, and the use of FDA-approved roses is recommended. The most common side-effect is the inflammation of the injection site like any other intravenous injection. Vitamin C is known to boost the body's immunity power, and IV Vitamin C develops antioxidants that fight with the Coronaviruses. Medical professionals should administer IV Vitamin C infusion, and past medical history should be taken into consideration. Patients allergic to certain medications should undergo preliminary tests before going through a dose of IV Vitamin C.
