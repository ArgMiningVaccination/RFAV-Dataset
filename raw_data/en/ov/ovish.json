Injectable Nutrition can improve your immune system, help you recover from injury or illness, detoxify & combat inflammation, reduce oxidative stress, improve energy, help with weight loss, improve your skin, and even reduce cellular aging. Oral supplementation is good, but can present problems for those who have a hard time digesting nutrients or just wanting higher levels of nutrients. Unlike oral supplementation, injectables boast 100% bioavailability meaning that you absorb every drop of nutrition we give you. Intravenous (IV) Therapy Intravenous Infusions are the fastest and most efficient way to deliver high levels of fluids and nutrients into the body. We offer a variety of IV formulas for your individual needs. Our IV formulas come in 250 ml quick bags, and 500 ml large bags. We also offer smaller volume IV pushes for certain nutrition. Intramuscular (IM) Vitamin Injections We offer a variety of vitamin injections that are quick, easy and cheap. This is preferable in certain circumstances: when ingredients cannot be mixed together or given by IV, when smaller doses of about 2 ml will suffice, or when you simply don't have time for intravenous therapy.

Build IV Quick Bag $110 | Large Bag $150 Looking to seriously improve your physique and get ripped with the right nutrition? Gain muscle and burn fat with this phenomenal IV therapy formula. The trick to gaining lean muscle is to give your body the amino acids it needs and prevent it from burning up protein as an energy source. There is a lot of hype about supplying branched chain amino acids (BCAA), but current research shows that by only supplying these few amino acids your body will effectively be deficient in the other amino acids it needs. In turn, your body will draw from muscle tissue to meet your body's protein demands. If you are exercising vigorously, your body will draw even more protein from muscle to supply energy needs further robbing you of your hard earned muscle tissue. In truth, your body is always building up (anabolic) and breaking down (catabolic) muscle tissue. The secret lies in shifting the balance to build more than you break (supporting anabolic metabolism). What you really need is the right amino acids that your body typically lacks. This not only gives you what your body needs immediately to build muscle, but it also stops the break down of muscle when your body is deprived of one or more amino acids. The other half of the battle is getting your body to use fat for energy instead of depleting the protein sources you need to build muscle. This can be accomplished by supplying nutrients that support a fat burning metabolism. These particular nutrients are required to take fats out of storage, transport them through the blood, and put them into the mitochondria where they are burned for energy. The Build formula is an IV bag plus an intramuscular injection. This formula contains: the lipolytic amino acids MIC (Methionine, Inositol, lysine, citrulline, and carnitine).

Glutathione is a molecule that is absolutely crucial for protecting the cells from oxidative stress, repairing damaged tissues, and is the foundation for the main detoxification pathway in the liver. It has been called \"The fountain of youth molecule\". In fact, research shows that unhealthy, damaged, and diseased cells contain much less glutathione than healthy cells. Glutathione is reduced in chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, pulmonary fibrosis, and inflammatory bowel disease to name just a few. Unfortunately, glutathione is mostly destroyed by digestive enzymes in the gut and only limited absorption occurs with oral nutrition. The good news is that glutathione given directly by IV therapy has 100% bioavailability.

Below you will find the links to some articles/studies on the efficacy of magnesium. IM Injections $25 each Intramuscular Glutathione While not technically a vitamin, glutathione is the single most powerful natural antioxidant in the body. This has the same great benefits as IV glutathione above, but in a quicker easier IM injection. However, these shots can burn a little, and so not as much can be delivered in this form. Vitamin C Given in the right place, smaller amounts of C can be delivered into the body without too much sting.
