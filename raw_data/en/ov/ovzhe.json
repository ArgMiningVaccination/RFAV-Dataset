Box 1 3720 BA Bilthoven The Netherlands www .rivm.nl/enOur food, our health Healthy and unhealthy diets receive a lot of attention nowadays, and there are good reasons for this. Each year, overweight and unfavourable dietary composition account for thousands of new cases of illness and unnecessary deaths. The number of young people and adults who are overweight is increasing. Foodborne infections and allergic reactions to food constituents also cause some health loss. This report addresses questions such as what is the health loss due to unhealthy diets and unsafe food in the Netherlands? What are the causes of this problem? What effects can we expect to see in the future? The report shows that, in the Netherlands, a substantial portion of health loss can be prevented by a healthier diet and safer food. This requires an integrated strategy, involving greater activity on the part of all those involved. The main opportunities are to be found on the supply side, i.e. in the hands of the private sector. But the consumer also has an important part to play, by making the proper choices in terms of health. The government must first create the necessary conditions, possibly followed by enforcement where appropriate.

We cannot survive without it. It is a primary life requirement for us all. But food is more than that. Food also plays an important role in terms of our health. An opti-mal diet helps to maintain good health. In the Netherlands, an unhealthy dietary pattern is responsible for a large proportion of the ill-health and deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. An increasing number of Dutch people are overweight. This is due to eating too much, particularly fat-rich foods, and to insufficient physical activity. The increase in the number of children with overweight is alarming. We must halt this trend by encour-aging people to adopt a healthier diet and to be more physically active. The consump- tion of enough fruit, vegetables and fish is good for the heart and blood vessels. Thequantity of food consumed is also important, and should be in line with the dailyamount of physical activity. In short, eating healthily and in moderation is good for your health. Needless to say, our food must also be safe. Much has been done in past centuries to ensure that this is the case. Production techniques have been greatly improved, thequality of our food is continually monitored, and control systems have been intro- duced .In the Netherlands ,responsibility for food safety is shared by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. Although much has been achieved in terms of food safet y, we must not rest on our laurels. New developments and emerging threats must be addressed. New products are being in troduced all the time ,such as food with health-promoting additions and genetically modified foods .Their safet ymust also be assured . This report, which was commissioned by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, considers the various health-related aspects of diet and nutrition. It offers an overview of current knowledge concerning the effects of diet and foods upon health. It not only provides information about past trends and the curren tsituation, but also considers future developmen ts with regard to the nutritional value and safety of our food. The report has been written in such a way as to make it useful to both scientists and policy-makers. It will undoubtedly make a substantial contribution to the production and consumption of healthy, safe food .

In particular, they eat too much and consume the wrong types of foods. Over the past century, the Dutch diet has become healthier and safer. As a result, general health has improved and life expectancy has increased. Howevernowadays health is threatened by an unhealthy diet, and because the number ofpeople who are overweight is increasing. The percentage of people classified as obese has doubled in the last 25 years to approximately 10% of the adult population. It is predicted that this figure will rise to 15% within the next 20 years. Most alarmingly, there is a comparable increase inthe percentage of children who are overweight. Overweight and obesity are caused by an energy-dense diet in combination with a lack of physical activity,resulting in an energy imbalance. The unfavourable composition of the Dutch diet (based on the study of five impor- tant dietary factors) also leads to considerable health loss. The intake of saturatedand trans fattyacids is too high ,while the consumption of fish ,fruit and vegeta- bles is too low. Overweight and unfavourable dietary composition each account for approximate- ly 40,000 cases of adult-onset diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and different types of cancer in tot al per year .Unfavourable dietary composition is twice as likely as overweight to result in death: 10% of all deaths in the Netherlands are attributableto the composition of the diet and 5% to overweight. In terms of the average life expect ancyofall 40-year -olds ,this means that unfavourable diet arycomposition reduces life expectancy by 1.2 years, while overweight will reduce life expectancy by 0.8 years .It is not known what propor tion of the health problems caused by overweight can be at tributed to diet. The overall health loss caused by an unhealthy diet is comparable to that caused by smoking. Measured in DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years: a summary measure which combines death and illness, using a disability weighing factor for the seri- ousness of the disease), the annual health loss due to an unhealthy diet is between 300,000 and 400,000 unit s. This figure includes 245,000 DALYs caused by unfavourable diet ary composition and an unknown proportion of the 215,000 DALYs which are due to overweight. In the case of smoking, the annual health lossis estimated to be just over 350,000 DALYs. Dietaryinterventions can reverse a substantial proportion of the health loss. However, if the current trends continue, life expectancy may fall. Approximately one half of all deaths and illnesses due to the unfavourable dietary composition can be avoided by means of dietary interventions which are consider-ed feasible (based on small-scale experiments). In particular, reducing the contentof saturated and trans fatty acids in foods and increasing the consumption of fish, fruit and veget ables appears to be effective. In the case of overweight and obesity, approximately one quarter of all deaths and illnesses can be preven ted,assuming an average weight loss of three kilograms per person. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH KEY MESSAGES 13These modelled dietary interventions are in line with current favourable trends in fish consumption and the decreasing content of saturated and trans fatty acids in the diet. However, the trends in overweight and the consumption of fruit and vegetables show a very unfavourable picture. This indicates that a far more force-ful preventive approach is called for in this area. If these trends continue (and other factors remain unaltered), life expectancy in the Netherlands will start to fall for the first time in many decades. Functional foods and dietary supplements do not offer a solution to the health problems caused by an unhealthy diet. Consumers who follow the dietary guidelines have no need for functional foods or supplements. Only certain specific risk groups (such as infants and elderly personswith a low micronutrient status) will benefit from such products. Even in that case, the health gains will be limited. In many cases, no evidence exists to support the health claims made for such foods and supplements. The consumer may well be misled by extravagant advertising. As they may be consumed in excessive quantities, some bio-active ingredients pose areal risk of health loss .This is par ticularly the case with vit amin supplemen ts in which the unit dose exceeds (sometimes by a wide margin) the safe upper level of intake, as seen with vitamin B 6for example. Such products are currently freely available. The safe upper level can also be exceeded when several 'enriched' product sare used in combination . In recent years Dutch food has become demonstrably safer in terms of chemi- cal and microbiological con tamination .Never theless ,food safet yis often the subject of negative media coverage. The food consumed in the Netherlands has become safer over the past 20 years . For example ,the con tamination of animal product swith Salmonella has been reduced considerably, as has the concentration of dioxins in foods and humanbreast milk. Food safety generally reaches the news only when problems occur, usually due to unavoidable incidents ('Good news is no news'). This creates a distorted picture of the actual situation . The government and private sector have long been engaged in efforts to increase food safety and to provide a high degree of consumer protection. Food in theNetherlands, therefore, is now safer than ever before. Never theless ,unsafe food leads to health loss and new threat sare emerging . Although the overall number of incidents involving Salmonella contamination have decreased in the Netherlands, foodborne infections continue to present a per-sistent problem. Every year, there are between 300,000 and 700,000 reported casesof gastroenteritis and several hundred other cases of serious illness. Foodborneinfections accoun tfor some 20 to 200 deaths each year. The overall annual health loss is estimated to be bet ween 1,000 and 4,000 DALYs. KEY MESSAGES OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 14Insome cases, chemical contamination and the presence of naturally occurring chemical compounds in food lead to a limited degree of health loss in the popula-tion (either demonstrable or theoretically estimated). In terms of actual illness, allergens form the most important category of agents, but these must be con-sidered separately, given the differences in individual susceptibility. In the Nether-lands, the overall health loss attributable to chemical contamination and allergensis estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 DALYs per annum. Experts predict that food in the Netherlands will become even safer in future. This is largely due to the increased attention being devoted to food safety. At the same time, new threats to food safety may emerge. They include new types of foodborne infection, the globalization of food production chains, the increasing consumption of raw or unprocessed products, and the over-consumption of functional foods anddietary supplements. Effective risk communication with the consumer is essential in any food safety incident or crisis. There are no indications that the consumer has a persistent or increasing loss of confidence in food safet y.However ,this confidence is subject to major fluctuations when incidents or crises occur. The major problems attached to food safety incidents are those of assessing the actual risk to health and the unpredictability of public perception. Effective methods for assessing the actual health effect sinvolved are not always available . Alongside the objective, calculated risk, the consumer's perception of risk willoften form a far more important factor. This perception will be determined by factors such as the perceived seriousness and con trollabilit yof the risk or it s expected consequences, as well as the nature and extent of media coverage. Risk managemen t(and hence crisis management) therefore requires an under- standing of both the actual risk and the perceived risk. Adequate measures to - gether with open and transparent communication with the consumer form thebasis for success. Much greater health gains are to be made through encouraging a healthy diet than through improving food safet y. This has consequences in terms of the priorities to be set. The comparison of the health gains theoretically attainable from a healthier diet on the one hand and improved food safety on the other, shows a clear preferencefor the former. Just through ensuring a proper dietary composition, separate from avoiding over weight ,the maximum health gains (in D ALYs) are some 40 to 100 times greater than the current overall health loss due to unsafe food. Besides the potential health gains, other factors must be considered when establishing priorities. These include the current trends and the feasibility of theproposed interventions. Consequently, three priorities have been identified: OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH KEY MESSAGES 151. The promotion of a healthy diet, with the secondary aims of: - Reducing overweight and obesity (major health gains, unfavourable trends, and interventions which may not be fully feasible). - Promotion of a proper dietary composition (major health gains, variable trends and variable feasibility of interventions). 2. The maintenance and (where necessary) improvement of the current high level of food safety (limited health gains, important social mandate and good feasibi-lity of interventions). 3. Improvement of risk assessment methodologies and of risk communication with the consumer, particularly in the event of a food safety incident or crisis. The main opportunities for creating a healthier diet and for increasing food safety are to be found on the supply side, i.e. in the hands of the private sector. The private sector can make a major contribution to a healthier diet and safer food. This can be done by restricting the supply of 'unhealthy' foods, reducing portionsizes, reducing advertising for 'unhealthy' foods (particularly that targeting chil- dren), offering a more affordable range of 'healthy' foods, increasing the traceabili-tyof product sor ingredien ts, and by introducing new (food safety) technologies. Experts expect great gains from product modification, in which the composition of foods will be made healthier and consumers will not be required to alter their eat-ing habits dramatically. The private sector could do more to address it sresponsibilities with regard to the issues above, becoming even more active than it already is. The consumer also has an impor tantrole to pla y. The human environment has a major influence on people's eating habits. How- ever,each consumer has overall responsibilit yfor choosing the food he or she eats, and for it ssafe storage and preparation .Asignifican tcultural shif tis required to render a healthy diet and concern for one's weight a social norm. Eventually, this shift must lead to permanent and sustainable behavioural changes. The government must create the necessary conditions, and may be required to take enforcement action where appropriate. If consumers are to fulfil their responsibilities, they must be given adequate infor- mation about a healthy diet and safe food. But they must also put that knowledgeinto practice. This will require education, information campaigns and practicalskills training, together with a more explicit representation of their interests by consumer organizations in order to ensure adequate product information . The Dutch government must maintain the current high level of food safety. It must also invest in an adequate response to new developments in the commercial foodchains, in crisis management and in effective consultation with the consumer. A thorough understanding of the actual nutritional situation in the Netherlands is essen tial to proper food policy. This calls for an effective monitoring system which will not only ' keep a finger on the pulse' but will also be essential in evaluating and further developing polic ywith regard to healthy diets and food safety. KEY MESSAGES OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 16An integrated strategy seems to offer the best potential for promoting healthier eating habits. Such a strategy must not only address the supply side, but also theconsumer and his or her environment. There should therefore be a combination of pricing policy, legislation, guidelines for the catering industry, measures applyingto public places, health education and a shift in social norms. These measuresshould eventually lead to the 'healthy choice' becoming the 'easy choice.' An activeapproach on the part of government and the various societal organizations iscalled for.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH KEY MESSAGES 1719PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH: Summar yof the main findings of the repor t1 Introduction The report entitled ' Our food, our health; Healthy diet and safe food in the Netherlands 'is an English translation of a report that was originally published in Dutch. The originalreport, written by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment(RIVM) and entitled was presented to the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport on September 1, 2004. This English report, just like the original report in Dutch, consists of two parts, Aand B.Part A contains a summary of the report's main findings and is based on the scien- tific data presented and discussed in part B .This report also includes corrections to the data on disease-free life expectancy in part B, chapters 2 and7(sections 2.4, 7.4 and appendix 12 ). There are many aspects to food and diet. This summary, which is concerned with the past, present and future, provides answers to questions from the perspective of health.How healthy is the Dutch diet? How safe is Dutch food? What health gains are to be had through better diet and eating habits and by reducing overweight 1?What is the appropriate balance between the desire for a healthy diet and that for ensuring foodsafety? How will this affect the various parties involved in food production, distribu- tion and consumption? In answering these questions, a pragmatic definition of the terms 'healthy diet' and 'safe food 'is applied .Ahealthy diet relies on both the composition and the quantity of food consumed. Thus we should eat neither too much nor too little (energy intake in balance with energ yexpenditure), and the composition of the diet should be in line with the recommendations .With regard to food safet y, the emphasis is not only on possible microbiological or chemical contamination, but also on potentially harmfulnaturally-occurring constituents. Where the amount of such substances (either in or on the supplied/consumed foods) is below the level which could be considered harm- ful to human health, the term 'safe food' is applied. In the Netherlands ,the findings presented in this report can assist the Ministries of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) and Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) intheir efforts to develop a view on healthy diet and safe food. The information is also ofsignificance to other parties, including the local and national organizations which attempt to promote healthy diet sand bet ter health ,organizations which con trol food safety, those which produce, process, distribute, sell or prepare food (including the agri- cultural sector, the food industry, supermarkets, restaurants, schools, staff canteens andhealthcare institutes), organizations engaged in food and nutrition research and, ofcourse, the people most closely involved: consumers and consumer organizations. 1Overweight is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25; severe overweight (obesity) is defined as a BMI equal to or greater than 30.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 21PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 222 Main findings 2.1 How healthy is the Dutch diet ? a. A healthy diet and safe food have contributed to the improvement of general health and have increased the average life expectancy Food is a primary life requirement. Today, people in the Netherlands live much longer than previous generations. That is partly due to the availability of a sufficient quantityof good quality food. The Dutch now live in an era and a part of the world with an abundant food supply, and stringent control of food safety aspects. Furthermore, they now have access to greater scientific knowledge concerning healthy eating habits and food safety. b. Yet obesity is now one of the greatest threats to public health In the Netherlands, the percentage of people who may be described as obese has doubled over the past 25 years to approximately 10% of the adult population. The most worrying trend is the increase in the number of young children who are overweight or obese .In 1997, the percen tage of overweight persons in the 2 to 20 age group varied between 7% and 16%, depending on age. In the case of girls aged 6, this represented a 100% increase compared to the 1980 figures, while for boysaged 6, there had been a 200% increase (see figure 1). The trend is of particular con- cern because eating habit s,like so many aspects of lifestyle, are acquired in these formative years. Among those with only primary or lower vocational education, obesity is roughly three times more prevalen tthan among those with higher vocational training or a university degree. However, the increase over time is seen in both groups. Figure 1: Prevalence of overweight among Dutch children by gender and age. 03691215 6year 12 year 18 yearboys girls 6year 12 year 18 year 1980 1997prevalence (%)Obesity is more prevalent among Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean men and women in the Netherlands than among the 'native Dutch' population.There are, however, no trend statistics available. There is less information relating to other ethnic groups. Food consumption of the average Dutch citizen has not increased in recent decades. In fact, between 1988 and 1998, energy intake fell by 5%. The cause of theincrease of overweight is rather the over-consumption of food relative to theamount of physical activity undertaken. It is therefore clear that the degree ofphysical activity has decreased even further, although good statistics relating to trends in energy expenditure through physical activity are not available. It is expected that the incidence of overweight and especially that of obesity, will continue to rise sharply in the Netherlands. Given the current trend, the number ofDutch persons who are obese is likely to increase by 50% before the year 2020. Merely maintaining the current level will require significant efforts. c. The composition of the Dutch diet is still far removed from the recommended healthy diet In recen tdecades significan tchanges have occurred in the Dutch diet arypattern with regard to several important dietary factors. In the case of some factors, the diet has clearly become more healthy; for others, the reverse is true (see table 1). The main improvements are the decrease in the content of saturated and trans fattyacids in foods, and the increase in the consumption of fish. Between 1988 and 1998, the consumption of trans fatty acids decreased by over 60% as a result of modifications to the composition of margarines and cooking fats. The consump- tion of saturated fat tyacids decreased by 5%, largely due to the successful in tro- duction of lower-fat dairy and meat products. Fish consumption appears to have increased :in 2001, the quan tity of fish purchased for consumption at home had increased by 17% compared to the 1995 figure . However, fewer than 25% of people follow the recommendations with regard to the consumption of fruit, vegetables and dietary fibre. Over the course of 10 years (1988-1998), consumption of fruit and vegetables actually declined by between 15% and 20%. Despite improvements in terms of the fatty acid content of products, only 5% of the Dutch population follow a diet according to the recommended fat ty acid pat tern. Table 1: Actual dietary consumption compared to the recommended intake in the Netherlands.

The eating habits of young people are showing a less favourable trend than those of the population as a whole. In particular, there has been a much sharper declinein the consumption of bread and vegetables. Undernutrition may be observed among some more elderly citizens, which may lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The dietary composition of persons with a lower socio-economic status is, on aver- age, less likely to be in accordance with the recommendations than that of people in the higher socio-economic groups. Few statistics are available with regard to the food consumption of ethnic minority groups. There is no uniform picture covering all groups. The fatty acid content of the diet of some groups is actually better than that of the native Dutch population,but the average content of vitamins and minerals is somewhat lower. d. Overweight and unhealthy dietary composition cause considerable health loss Forthe purposes of this documen t,'health loss' is expressed in terms of the additional incidence of disease and mortality (e.g. through type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascu- lar diseases and various forms of cancer) which can be attributed to overweight orunfavourable dietary composition. Adult swho are seriously overweight are five to twelve times more likely to develop diabetes, and two to three times more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases orcertain forms of cancer. An excessive in take of the ' wrong 'type of fat s,such as saturated and trans fatty acids, increases the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases by 25%, while eating fish once or t wice a week will reduce this risk by 25%. The consumption of an adequate quan tityof fruit will reduce the risk of develop - ing coronary heart diseases, stroke, lung cancer, breast cancer2and stomach can- cer by between 20% and 30%, while an adequate intake of vegetables will reduce the risk of coronary heart diseases and lung cancer to approximately the same degree. Each year, 38,000 cases of cardiovascular diseases among adults aged 20 and above can be at tributed to the unfavourable composition of the diet (calculated accord- ing to the five factors), as can 2,700 cases of cancer (see figure 2). Overweight is responsible for 22,000 cases of diabetes, 16,000 cases of cardiovascu- lar diseases and 2,200 cases of cancer each year (see figure 2). Other consequences of over weight ,such as impaired mobilit y, have not been included . Approximately 10% of the total number of deaths in the Netherlands each year can be attributed to an unfavourable dietary composition, while overweight is directlyresponsible for 5% of deaths. 2According to a recent report published by the Dutch Cancer Society, the relationship between diet and breast cancer is debatable.When these st atistics are combined and expressed in DALYs3per year (Disabilit y Adjusted Life Years), approximately 215,000 DALYs lost as a result of the three dis-eases cited (cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes mellitus) can be ascribed to over weight ,and 245,000 D ALYsto unfavourable diet arycomposition . The average decrease in life expectancy resulting from unfavourable dietary com- position is 1.2 years (for the en tire Dutch population aged 40 and above). In the case of over weight ,the decrease in life expect ancyis 0.8 years .The health loss will clearly be much greater for those who consistently eat too much or eat the wrong types of food. In calculating the overall health loss due to an unhealthy diet, one cannot merely total the figures for overweight and unfavourable composition of the diet. Over- weight is caused in par tby the combination of insufficient physical activity and an energy-dense diet, which partially overlaps with the dietary composition considera-tion, although the exact degree of this overlap is unknown. Of the five dietary factorsconsidered, fruit and vegetables can help to reduce weight due to their high fibre con- tentand low energ ydensit y.However ,over-consumption of energy-dense foods has not been included in the food consumption scenarios modelled.

PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 26e. Improved dietary patterns can lead to considerable health gains The health loss presented above has been calculated by means of a comparison with the situation in which allDutch people follow the dietary and weight recommenda- tions. It should therefore be regarded as the maximum theoretical health gain. However, because it would be overly optimistic to assume that everyone will adopt a healthy diet overnight, a calculation has also been made on the basis of dietary pat-terns which are partially improved in the direction of the recommendations. Experi- ence with small-scale dietary interventions suggests that such an improvement is fea- sible. In these 'middle' scenarios we assume the following changes in the dietary patterns of persons who do not yet meet the recommendations in full: consumption of saturated fatty acids to be reduced by 2.5 energy per cent consumption of trans fatty acids to be reduced by 0.5 energy per cent consumption of fish to be increased by one or two portions per month consumption of vegetables to be increased by 50 grams per day consumption of fruit to be increased by 50 grams per day. These diet aryinterventions will reduce the maximum annual incidence of disease and mortality attributable to the dietary composition (with regard to the five factors stated) by approximately fifty per cent (see figure 3) . Asignifican tassumption in these calculations is that the success of the small -scale interventions can be extrapolated to the level of the entire population. The improve-ments cited have varying relationships to the current trends. In the case of trans fatty acids ,target consumption under the middle scenario is in line with the rapid decline seen in recent years. By contrast, the middle scenario target for fruit and vegetable Figure 3: Reduction in annual incidence of disease in the Netherlands: maximum and middle scenarios. 051015202530354045 incidence x 1,000 max = maximum; mid = middle scenarioDiabetes Cardiovascular diseases Cancermax mid max mid max mid max mid max mid max mid max mid saturated fatty acidstrans fatty acidsfive dietary factors combinedoverweight fish fruit vegetablesconsumption is at odds with the trend of recent years. The middle scenario targets for saturated fatty acids and fish consumption have, in this respect, an in-between position. Concerning the fatty acid intake, the middle scenarios are somewhat less ambitious than the objectives stated in a Dutch government policy document entitled ' Langer Gezond Leven' ('Living longer in good health'). The policy's target for saturated fatty acids is a reduction to 10 energy per cent by the year 2010, while that for trans fatty acids is a reduction to 1 energy per cent. These figures are in line with the dietary re-commendations. The policy does not state any specific target for fish consumption, and while it does seek to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, no firm figures are stated. f. Only through firm action to tackle overweight can any substantial health gains be made The results of small-scale experiments suggest that an average weight loss of three kilograms per person (1 BMI unit) is possible. The health gain that such a weight reduction would yield is in the order of one quarter of the maximum incidence of mor- talityand morbidit yattributable to overweight (see figure 3) .However ,the curren t trend runs in the opposite direction. Over the past 15 years, average bodyweight has actually increased by three kilograms and the number of persons with obesity, in par- ticular, will continue to rise. The policy objective is to at least stabilize the current level of over weight ,thus curbing the trend. The health loss that will be avoided in this manner is also in the order of one quarter of the current maximum incidence of mor- tality and morbidity attributable to overweight. Compared to the health gains to be made under the middle scenarios for diet arycompo - sition, that achieved by reducing overweight will be less marked. Overweight is therefore amore difficult problem to coun ter than an unfavourable diet ary composition. g. Without interventions it is unlikely that the Dutch will eat more healthily in the future Experts predict that the current trends in eating habits and in the types of food avail- able on the market will continue for the coming 5 to 10 years (see textbox 1). Despite a growing number of new foods which are appropriate to a healthy diet ,the overall range of product savailable will not become any healthier due to the even greater increase in unhealthy products. Consumers will buy more 'convenience foods' and theconsumption of snacks, larger portions and products which are energy-dense willcontinue to rise. Expectations are that the unfavourable effects will dominate. Children, teenagers and people with a lower socio-economic status will form a high-risk group. This relates tothe over-consumption of energy-dense products which contain few other nutrientsand are made particularly attractive by their strong sweet or salty flavour. Moreover,healthy food is generally more expensive .Without active social pressure to reverse these trends ,an adverse effect on public health may be expected, especially in terms of the number of people suffering from over weight and various chronic diseases .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 27PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 282.2 How safe is Dutch food ? a. Dutch food has become safer in several respects, due to a high level of consumer protection Over the past few decades, national and international governments have introduced an extensive system of legislation, standardization and control in the field of foodsafety. Producers have also introduced many more measures designed to enhance food safet y.The food consumed in the Netherlands is therefore safer in many respects than it was in the past. This is clearly demonstrable in the case of a number of micro-biological and chemical contaminants. For example:Greater availability of Products with improved nutritional quality, including healthy convenience foods (+)Energy-dense products (-)Unhealthy convenience foods (-)Larger portions (-)Functional foods and dietary supplements (?)Eating habits Shift towards convenience foods (overall bal- ance: (-))Shift towards larger portions and energy-dense products (-)More people who fail to eat breakfast (-)More snacks and other forms of 'grazing' (?) +:expected effect is favourable to public health; -:expected effect is unfavourable to public health; ?:nature of effect is currently unknownTextbox 1: Likely developments which will influence healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns in the Netherlands. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,00010,000 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000 Travel/other Cattle Pigs Layers/Repro/Eggs Broilers/products Salmonellosiscases,generalpopulationLab-confirmedcasesofsalmonellosis Figure 4: T rends in salmonellosis in the Netherlands.In the Netherlands, the incidence of food poisoning caused by Salmonella bacteria fell from approximately 150,000 cases in 1984 to approximately 50,000 in 2003(see figure 4 ). The concentration of dioxins and PCBs in human milk in the Netherlands has halved over the past 10 to 15 years due to the reduction in exposure through foods. The food-related incidents that have occurred in the Netherlands in recent years have had little or no effect on health. However, they do erode consumer confidence andserve to highlight shortcomings which still exist within the current food safety system. b. And yet foodborne infections remain an obstinate and persistent problem Based on population surveys, it is estimated that there are approximately 4.5 million cases of gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small and large intestines) each year. Of these, one third (i.e. 1.3 to 1.7 million) are thought to be due to a food-borne infection (see textbox 2 ).Between them, four types of bacteria and viruses are responsible for approximately half of all identifiable foodborne infections: noroviruses. Alongside the acute and usually mild health effects of gastroenteritis, there are also a few hundred cases of serious illness which can be attributed to foodborne infections involving a known pathogen .They include cases Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn- drome ,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome and listeriosis. Between 20 and 200 persons die as a result of a food infection each year. Expressed in DALYs, the estimated health loss due to foodborne infections with known causative agen tsis approximately 1,000 to 4,000 per annum .This is comparable to the health loss due to AIDS or bacterial meningitis. However, this figure is probably an underestimate given the unquantifiable contribution of food to the large number ofgastroenteritis cases due to (as yet) unknown causative agents. Textbox 2: Estimated annual incidence of gastroenteritis due to foodborne infections in the Netherlands. Total number of gastr oenteritis cases 4.5 million Number with known million Number due to infection not due infection Number with unknown causative agent 3 million Number possibly due to foodborne infection 1 million 1 Number not due to foodbor ne infection 2 million 1 1While they have not been empirically tested, these figures are based on the ratio of 1:2 among the cases of gas- troenteritis with a known pathogen. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 29c. There are also chemical food constituents and contaminants responsible for some degree of demonstrable health loss The health loss due to the presence of chemical food constituents or contaminants is more difficult to quantify than that due to microbiological contamination. A distinc-tion is drawn between chemical contaminants and those chemical components whichare naturally present in certain foods, such as nitrates, natural toxins and allergens. In the case of chemical contamination, there are usually no acute effects but there can be chronic health effects, such as cancer, which become apparent only after a long period of time. Because of the delay involved, such effects can rarely be directly attrib- uted to exposure to any one chemical substance. Estimates of safe (and unsafe) intake levels are usually based on experiments involving animals. The safe intake levels formany chemical food contaminants have been established in this way. In general, the intake of such substances in the Netherlands is well below the identified safe levels. Table 2 provides an overview of the chemical substances found in food and posing some health risk, together with an estimate of the possible health gain (in DALYs) ifexposure to these subst ances is avoided outright. In the case of allergens and certain natural toxins (phycotoxins and phytotoxins) there can indeed be an immediate and observable health effect. It is estimated thatfood allergies account for an annual health loss in the order of 1,000 DALYs. How- ever,allergens form a separate categor ysince the effects are partly due to genetic susceptibility and therefore vary from one person to another. They can also beavoided by a careful choice of food. The overall health loss due to the presence of natural toxins is smaller than that due to allergens . In the case of nitrates and nitrites, as well as a number of chemical substances which do not occur naturally in food (P AHs,acrylamide), estimates suggest that long-term health effect scan arise in the form of cancer .Here ,the estimated theo - retical annual health loss is in the order of 500 to 1,000 DALYs. Although information concerning developments over time is not available for some aspects, current information gives the general impression that Dutch food is now safer than it used to be .However, given the nature of the estimation methods used, it seems likely that the microbiological contamination levels have been underestimated (based as they are solely on information concerning proven food contamination by known agents) .Conversely ,the health risks posed by the chemical contamination of food are more likely to have been overestimated, since these often concern incidental measuremen tsin excess of the iden tified safe levels ,and because of the safet yfactors used and/or the conservative method of risk assessment applied (particularly with regard to genotoxic carcinogens). PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 30OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 31To summarize, the main food safety problems are currently represented by microbial foodborne infections and allergens ,and by the unavoidable occurrence of food -relat- ed incidents. It remains unclear whether the number of people suffering from someform of food allergy is increasing. The Dutch Health Council is currently collating the available scien tific knowledge in this respect. d.Food safety will continue to improve but new threats are likely to emerge According to the exper ts,the measures t aken by the governmen tand food producers will ensure that our food becomes even more safe than it already is (seetextbox 3). This will largely be due to better control systems and to the use of decontamination methods for dealing with micro-organisms on products of animal origin. However, no reduction in the incidence of microbiological contamination may be expected where this is due to incorrect storage and preparation on the par tof the consumer. In fact, it is thought that the consumer 's knowledge of food preparation and the necessary stan- dards of hygiene is declining. In addition, new threats due to the globalization of foodproduction and the food market will continue to demand attention. It may be expect-ed that the favourable effects will outweigh the unfavourable effects, but only if the curren tlevel of protection is main tained and due at tention is devoted to new threats.Table 2: Chemical substances in food in the Netherlands, with the health risks and possible health gains if exposure is avoided.

Interests other than those of health alone are also part of these decision making processes. This repor taddresses the positive and negative effects on public health. For this pur- pose,it uses three questions to bring these aspects into balance: 1. What is the relationship between health loss due to an unhealthy diet on the one hand and unsafe food on the other? 2. What is the relationship between 'healthy' and 'safe' with regard to four common food items for which specific recommendations exist? 3. How does that relationship apply to new developments such as the use of func- tional foods and dietary supplements? The DALY concept forms the basis for all comparisons.

The health loss due to unhealthy diet is many times greater than that attrib- utable to unsafe food When set against the health loss due solely to unfavourable dietary composition (245,000 DALYs), i.e. leaving the loss due to overweight aside, the estimated annualhealth loss due to microbiological foodborne infection involving known pathogens(1,000-4,000 DALYs) and chemical constituents (1,500-2,000 DALYs) is rather limited.The health loss due to unfavourable dietary composition is approximately 40 to 100times greater than that due to unsafe food. Overweight also accounts for a far greaterannual health loss (215,000 DALYs) than unsafe food. b. The health gains to be made through the consumption of more fruit and vegeta- bles, wholegrain products and fish, as well as through breastfeeding, are manytimes greater than the health risks involved Any food or group of foods may have both favourable or unfavourable health effects. This can be confusing for the consumer, particularly when the official dietary guide-lines recommend increased consumption of fish and vegetables, while it is recognized that these products can contain certain harmful contaminants. Accordingly, thebalance bet ween ' healthy 'and ' safe' has been calculated for four groups of common foods for which specific recommendations exist: Fruit and vegetables: leafy vegetables can contain relatively high levels of nitrates, while pathogenic microorganisms may be found on all raw fruit and vegetables. They may also con tain phytotoxins. Fish can contain dioxins or PCBs. Wholegrain cereal products (an important source of dietary fibre) can be contami- nated with mycotoxins derived from fungi . Human milk can contain dioxins and PCBs, while it is possible for an HIV-positive mother to transfer the virus via the milk. The annual gains to be made by following the consumption levels currently recom- mended (the maximum scenario) vary from approximately 1,000 to 2,400 DALYs (breastfeeding) to almost 100,000 DALYs (fish, fruit). Compared to these figures, the risks attributable to known contaminants, insofar as they are quantifiable, are usually some 100 times lower .In some cases the risks are even negligible. This does not mean that no further consideration needs to be given to contaminants. Rather, it highlights the success of the system of standardization and control that hasbeen developed in recent decades, as well as the necessity of ensuring that this system continues to adapt to new scien tific insight sand developmen tsin both food supply and food consumption. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 33c. The health claims of functional foods are often unproven and the over-consump- tion of bio-active ingredients can itself pose a risk The recommended diet will include all necessary nutrients. In recent years, however, anumber of products have emerged for which the manufacturers make certain health claims. These are the so-called functional foods and dietary supplements . Research into any positive or negative health effects associated with these products is still in its early stages. Because legislation is, as yet, inadequate (although it is devel-oping rapidly) consumers can easily be misled by extravagant advertising claims. For the vast majority of functional foods and dietary supplements now on the market, there is not only insufficient evidence for the presence of beneficial health effects, but also for the absence of detrimental effects. It is therefore not possible (or not yet possi- ble) to draw any useful conclusions regarding their contribution to public health. Only in the case of a few dietary supplements, such as folic acid and vitamin B6can firm statements be made: It has been shown that expectant mothers who take supplements containing folic acid at an early stage of their pregnancy can reduce the likelihood of birth defects(such as spina bifida). It has also been est ablished that no health risks at tach to the use of such supplements. In the case of vitamin B 6,the risk of overdosing exists, while there are no demon- strable positive effects attached to the use of the supplement. Approximately 16% of the product scontaining B6which are curren tly on the Dutch market con tain a dose which exceeds (sometimes by a wide margin) the established safe upper levelof intake. Moreover, the ordinary daily diet will contain sufficient vitamin B 6and no groups with any deficienc yare known . The dosage of vit amins and minerals in many ' enriched' foodstuffs remains relatively low.Often,it is comparable to the quan tityto be found in an ordinary daily diet (the 'Recommended Daily Intake'). Furthermore, there are generally no indications of health risks attaching to most of the vitamins and minerals contained in dietary sup- plements. Nevertheless, the dietary supplements do pose a particular risk of overdos- ing, since the concentrations of vitamins and minerals in such products are very much higher than in the enriched foods .However, since the most recent National Food Con- sumption Sur vey (in 1998), no new information has become available concerning the consumer's usage of high-dosage vitamin and mineral supplements, nor about trends in the use of supplements in general.PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 34d. Consumers and scientists often have differing views about risks Although the health loss due to an unhealthy diet is far greater than that due to unsafe food, consumers often view matters from a different perspective. They usually attach more weight to those risks which are beyond their sphere of influence, ratherthan to those which are due to their own choice of food and eating habits. According-ly, food safety issues are often regarded as more serious (risk perception) and result ingreater public disquiet than any unhealthy aspects of a diet that is not in line with therecommendations. The government and food producers must take this phenomenonseriously and must gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This is necessary not only to ensure adequate risk communication with the public, but also to maintain consumer confidence. 3 Significance of the findings a. What are the priorities? Priorities for policy are determined by several factors, such as the potential health gains ,curren ttrends and expect ations ,the feasibility of interventions, the balance between measures addressing a healthy diet and those directed at food safety, the costs of the measures, and so on. When these factors are taken into account, but leav-ing the question of costs aside, three important priorities in the field of healthy diet and safe food can be iden tified . Priority 1: The promotion of a healthy diet, which involves a two-pronged approach Reduction of overweight and obesity The calculations presen ted show that the maximum health gains achievable through the reduction of over weight are no greater than those to be made through the improvement of dietary composition. Nevertheless, there are various reasons for tack-ling the problem of overweight as a matter of the greatest urgency. Firstly, we see an unfavourable trend: the prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase, the rise being greatest among children and young people, which would suggest an even more acute problem in the future .Secondly, the seriousness of the obesity prob- lem has long been underestimated ,despite the scientific community having drawn attention to the upward trend in the 1980s. Only in the last few years attention hasbeen devoted to overweight at the national and international political level. Thirdly, itwould appear that the health loss which can be obviated by means of feasible weight- related in terventions is relatively small (approximately 25% of the tot al). A major soci - etal effort will therefore be required to ensure that the prevalence of overweight in the Netherlands does not rise further, and to avoid reaching the situation that canalready be seen in the United States and the United Kingdom. Promotion of a health ycomposition of the diet It would not be appropriate to base polic ysolely on the reduction of overweight. A proper composition of fat tyacids in the diet, regular fish consumption, and an ade-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 35quate intake of fruit and vegetables can do just as much in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancer, quite aside from the considerations of achieving aproper bodyweight. When we look at the health gain thought achievable on the basis of previous small-scale experiments, we see that the effect of a proper dietary compo-sition (based on the five dietary factors) is more than double that of the reduction inoverweight. The trend is currently positive with regard to some factors (saturatedfatty acids, trans fatty acids and fish consumption) but the decreasing consumption of fruit and vegetables is still worrisome. There are also a number of vulnerable groups,such as the very young and the very old, who face specific dietary problems which must be addressed separately. For example, very few babies under three months are now breastfed. And there is also some undernutrition among the elderly, with result- ing vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Priority 2: Maintenance and, where possible, improvement of the current high level of food safety In the current situation, it is clear that the health loss attributable to unsafe food is many times smaller than that due to an unhealthy diet. This is largely due to the factthat an effective system of food safet ymeasures and con trol has been developed in recent decades. Clearly, this system must be maintained. However, it is appropriate to ask what maintenance level will be required in the future, in the light of existing andnewly emerging threats. Priority 3: Better risk assessment methods and improved risk communication with the consumer Food safet yinciden ts,both large scale and small scale ,will con tinue to occur .Human error, malfeasance and new 'surprises' can never be ruled out. The 'zero-risk' situation is therefore unat tainable. In order to limit the impact of incidents, a more effective assessmen tof the actual health risks is required ,together with a bet ter risk communi - cation with the consumer. As both uncertainty regarding the extent to which risks are known and social complexity (the number of stakeholders and conflicting interests) increase, so must a more open social debate be conducted. b. Investing in a healthy diet is just as important as investing in other healthy lifest yle factors In order to place the health loss attributable to an unhealthy diet and unsafe food in perspective, table 3 presents a comparison of the health loss (in DALYs) due to these factors and that due to other lifestyle factors. The health loss for various other envi- ronmen tal factors is shown in order to put in perspective the par tplayed by food safe - ty. Lastly, a comparison is made with the health loss due to a number of significant diseases, irrespective of their causes. The calculations are particularly complex andthe underlying data involve some uncertainties. As a result, the comparison is broad,and the health loss is presented in categories. PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 36The comparison shows that the overall health loss due to an unhealthy diet is similar to that caused by smoking. The theoretical health gains which could be achievedmerely by adopting a proper dietary composition (based on all five factors studied) is in second place and is of the same order as that of reducing obesity (shown hereas 'energy balance'), or of increasing physical activity. Moreover, it is shown that aproper dietary composition could provide health gains equivalent to the overallhealth loss due to the most common diseases in the Netherlands, including coronaryheart diseases and depression. c. Investing in food safety is just as important as investing in combating infectious diseases or in other environmental factors Table 3 also shows that the demonstrable health loss due to microbiological contami- nation of food is comparable to that due to a number of significant infectious diseases such as AIDS. In the case of chemical contamination, the health loss is lower than thatof a number of major environmental factors. However, the health loss due to allergensand acrylamide is greater than that caused by various substances found in the envi- ronment. In the context of health protection, allergens must be considered separately, since most are normal constituents of certain foods that elicit greatly differing effects in dif-ferent people. The most important form of protection is the avoidance by susceptible individuals of foods known to cause allergic reactions ,and not the removal of aller- gens from the products concerned. Proper information concerning the presence ofcertain potential allergens in products is essential in order that the consumer can make well -informed choices .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 37PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 38Table 3: Annual health loss (in DALYs) due to dietary factors and energy balance, against other lifestyle fac- tors, environmental factors and disease categories in the Netherlands.

The health loss due to overweight has been modelled using BMI as indicator. Overweight can also be caused by lack of physical activity, which falls under 'other lifestyle factors' in this table. 4.It is assumed here that moderate alcohol consumption (one to three units per day for men and up to two for women) prevents cardiovascular diseases, as compared to total abstinence. The health loss due to alco-hol dependency is shown in the seventh (right-hand) column. 5.HIV/AIDS: Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired prevention Whatis required to address the three priorities successfully, and what part is to be played by the three parties most closely involved: the private sector, the consumer andthe government? The answers to these questions will largely be determined by ourknowledge of the factors which influence the dietary problems concerned, the pointsof policy action which can be derived from this knowledge, and the feasibility andreturns of the proposed measures. It will be useful to review past successes and fail-ures, as well as scientific insights into the psychology of behavioural change and risk perception. The key elements in ensuring a healthy diet are the supply side (the food available), social norms and customs, and the consumer's behaviour (purchasing and eating habits). In the case of food safety, the entire food chain is important: from productionto storage and preparation in the kitchen. The private sector, the consumer and thegovernment each have a specific role in promoting a healthy diet and food safety. a.The approach to ,and oppor tunities for ,the promotion of a healthy diet are not the same as those for smoking According to modern views on health promotion, prevention is particularly effective if the interventions rely on an integrated approach. Such an approach not only addresses people directly about their personal behaviour ,but also modifies the physi - cal and social environment in such a way as to encourage desirable behaviour and dis-courage undesirable behaviour. This form of integrated approach is probably the key success factor in the United St ates'reduction of smoking .Asimilar approach is now being used in the Netherlands. The approach entails a combination of health-related information about stopping smoking ,pricing measures ,smoking bans in public places ,other legislation and a shif tin social norms .There is close cooperation between health institutes, the government, industry and the scientific field, and inter- ventions are adapted to the 'settings' which are important to children and adults, such as school and the workplace. Much can be learned from in terventions to discourage smoking. However, it must be realized that there are marked differences with regard to diet and eating habit s. In the case of smoking, there is a clear and unequivocal message: it is bad for you and forthe people around you. While a person's overweight may cause some concern orinconvenience to others - as in prolonged or regular sick leave, greater nursing requiremen tsor in the surgical situation - our eating habit sare largely based on the necessity of eating, and are unlikely to cause any real harm to others. Accordingly, the relationship between the government and the production industry is different. In thecase of smoking, the government's health promotion activities are diametricallyopposed to the financial interests of the tobacco industry. In the case of food, thegovernmen tactually needs the industry to produce healthy products which are appropriate to a healthy diet ,while at the same time, that government must contend with an industr ywhich curren tly produces and promotes many unhealthy products. AOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 39further consideration is that the healthy diet message is more complex than the non- smoking message, because the consumer must choose from a large and very diverserange of foods, some of which can have both favourable and unfavourable effects on health. However, the comparison with smoking demonstrates that intensive and cre-ative efforts are required if changes are to be brought about successfully. b. The private sector must devote greater attention to healthy and safe food There are many ways in which food producers, wholesalers and the catering industry can help to combat overweight, to promote a healthy diet and to improve food safety. Greater availability of healthy products, and less advertising for unhealthy products Alongside a lack of physical activity, the cause of the rise in obesity is to be found in the overabundant supply of energy-dense foods in shops, workplace canteens and school dining halls. The advertising of unhealthy products is also a contributory fac-tor. Convenience, flavour, price and acquired habits are the factors which determinethe consumer's eating patterns. The private sector can use all these factors in pro- moting a healthier diet. The recently modified policy of the Dutch food producersfederation (V AI/NFLI 2004), and it scode of conduct for adver tising and promotional activities, remains inadequate in this respect and can be improved. Improved product composition and innovative product modification There are many ways in which foods can be modified in order to render the ' healthy choice' the 'easy choice', without requiring consumers to alter their eating habits verymuch. In some cases, product modifications require no behavioural change at all on the par tof the consumer .Examples from the past include the addition of iodine to table salt and the altered fatty acid composition of margarines. Moreover, such changes do not have to limit the consumer 's choice .Rather, there are excellent oppor- tunities for providing an extremely varied range of product s,with something to appeal to every taste. The maintenance and improvement of food safety in the light of new circumstances Safe food is a precondition of healthy eating. The maintenance and further improve- mentof food safety begins with the awareness of its importance. There does indeed appear to be a high level of awareness in the Netherlands .Two aspects will be impor- tant in future. The first involves enhanced food safety in the animal (derivatives) foodchain, by such means as ensuring good hygiene in the primary production phase andin the final phase of actually preparing the food. The second aspect is the introduction of more effective qualit ycontrol for novel and existing ingredien ts,and for produc- tion chains. Improved consumer information Clear information, such as labelling to indicate the nutritional and safety aspects of a product ,can help the consumer to make a sound choice with regard to both a healthy diet and safe food (avoidance of allergens). New and creative forms of informationand labelling are required to enable the consumer to find the desired product infor -PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 40mation quickly and easily. The current labelling forms are not fully effective. The information must also take the consumer's perception of risk into account. c. Consumers should be more aware of the advantages of a healthy diet, the disad- vantages of overweight and an unhealthy diet, and the importance of hygieneduring food preparation Acultural turnabout is required There will always be healthy and less healthy food products on the market. The most important requirement is a cultural shift on the part of the consumer and in the gen- eral social setting. There must be increased awareness that healthy food can also be enjoyable, while overweight and an unhealthy diet cause inconvenience, discomfort and disease. To date, the general public does not seem to be fully aware of the threatthat an increase in the prevalence of overweight represents. However, it is important that this cultural shift is not based on any stigmatization of persons with overweight.The consumer is responsible for his or her own behaviour and, taking personal healthinterests into account, must take a personal decision to eat less or be more physically active. Consumers must also realize that there is no such thing as 100% safe food, and that they are the last link in the food safety chain. They themselves are responsible forchecking the expiration dates on packages, ensuring good hygiene in the kitchen to preven tcross -infections, and for the thorough cooking of products, particularly those of animal origin. Awareness and information must be accompanied by practical skills There are many people who wish to eat more healthily or to lose weight. However, a large propor tion of the population does not know which foods are healthy and which are not ,and may be confused by complex or con tradictor ymessages .The consumer can only assume his responsibility if he has adequate knowledge about a healthy diet and about safe food, and if he possesses the skills required to put that knowledge into practice. However, the influence of the sheer size of the product range available, advertising and other (social) factors is so great that many people - particularly younger consumers - are not able to offer adequate resist ance. This underscores the impor tance of the task awaiting consumer and educational organizations in pro- viding good support. d. The government must provide a strong impulse to the collective interests of a health ydiet,reduction of over weight and enhanced food safet y Ahealthy diet, the reduction of obesity rates and the promotion of food safety are all collective interests. Accordingly, the government has a part to play. In recent decades,the main emphasis of food policy has been on safety. The analysis offered by thisreport suggests that the reduction of overweight and the promotion of a healthy dietshould be given higher priorit ythan has hitherto been the case, without the current high level of food safet ybeing adversely affected.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 41The emphasis should now be on effective implementation of the food policy In the field of overweight (and a healthy diet) the government has opted to imple- ment a preventive approach in partnership with a broad coalition of stakeholders. The approach, set out in a government policy document entitled 'Langer Gezond Leven'('Living longer in good health') ,addresses both lifestyle factors and environmental factors which encourage a healthy diet and sufficient physical activity. However, theemphasis should not be solely on overweight and energy balance, thereby maskingthe significant influence of a proper dietary composition on the prevalence of certainchronic diseases (both in association with and aside from overweight). In the parlia- mentary debate on Dutch government policy, the emphasis is placed on the personal responsibility of consumers and on the voluntary cooperation of the private sector. This is contradictory to the causal analysis made by experts, who call for the emphasisto be placed on the physical and social environment. Legislative measures may be useful in promoting a healthy diet With regard to a healthy diet and eating habits, the government seeks to exert far less control than in the case of food safety, preferring to leave many aspects to socialforces .Food safet yinvolves the use of legislation ,sanctions, controls, inspections and supervision. It is felt that the interests of a healthy diet are better served by voluntary agreements and information. This difference in approach may be justified in terms ofthe principle of public health protection that applies to food safety. However, as this repor tmakes clear ,the promotion of a healthy diet requires a strong push by the government and by society itself. If incentives and voluntary agreements do not havethe desired effect, legislation may prove appropriate. For example, measures could be introduced to curb adver tising which t arget schildren ,or to stipulate which product s may and may not be offered in schools or public places. The approach adopted to coun ter smoking can ser ve as an example. New safety risks call for a new approach In the field of food safety, the government's focus is shifting towards the safety of the entire food chain (whereby all parties - including the consumer - have a certain degree of responsibility) and to crisis management. In addition, consumer confidence in food safet y(and the restoration of that confidence) has been high on the political agenda for some years .Astrategy which is solely geared towards increasing food safe- ty by means of ever more stringent standards will not be enough. The governmentmust also involve the consumer in the decisions that have to be made, and must ren-der its policy more transparent in order to achieve broader public support. Measures should be in troduced requiring manufacturers to subst antiate the health claims they make on behalf of functional foods and dietary supplements, thereby protecting the consumer against false claims. European legislation in this area is currently beingdrafted. The methodology for quantitative comparison of positive and negative healtheffects must also be developed further. Finally, in view of the ongoing globalization offood production chains ,improved methods must be developed to trace the exact ori- gins of product sand their ingredients. PART A OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 425 Monitoring and research This report answers many questions. Its ability to do so derives from the large body of knowledge and information available in the Netherlands. However, there are alsosome questions which have yet to be answered in full, either because they fall outsidethe scope of the current report, because there are gaps in our knowledge, or becausethere are limitations in the continuity of the information flow. Moreover, new topicswill emerge and will become important due to scientific and social developments.Four aspects in particular demand further consideration: The continuity of the National Food Consumption Surveys (VCP) and the support- ing databases. Scientific research into the health and safety aspects of food and diet, and into bet- ter methodologies for the comparison of positive and negative health effects. Research into the determinants of consumer eating behaviour, and incentives whereby the private sector and other relevant parties can be encouraged to supplyhealthier and safer products. Research into the ways in which successful small-scale interventions can be imple- mented more widely .Here ,the cost-effectiveness ratio must also be considered .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH PART A 43PART B OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH: Healt ydiet and safe food in the Netherlands 451 INTRODUCTION Why this report ? For centuries, knowledge of what is good and safe to eat, and how it should be pre- pared, has been passed down from mother to daughter. In the early twentieth centu-ry, this empirical knowledge could be given a more scientific basis, partly due toadvances in science and in epidemiology. Since then, our scientific knowledge con-cerning the relationship between nutrition, diet and health has greatly increased, and continues to develop today. That knowledge is mainly concerned with the biological effects of the individual constituents of food, such as nutrients, additives, micro- organisms and chemical contaminants. Preventive measures intended to promotehealthy eating patterns and greater food safety are largely based on this type of knowledge. However, a more complete understanding of all potential health effects,both positive and negative, is required in order to weigh measures one against theother in terms of the likely health gains and the efforts to be made by policy makers. Governmen tpolic yand super vision must increasingly take into account issues which demand an 'integrated' product assessment, i.e. one which looks at both the positive and negative aspects of a certain food. Familiar examples include dioxins in humanmilk, PCBs in oily fish, and fungal toxins on cereals. While arriving at a scientific assessmen tof the positive and negative health effect sis difficult in itself, it is also necessary to provide clear, unambiguous information to the public. Todate,sources which presen tcoheren tknowledge concerning the relationship between the many types of nutrients and other food constituents are scarce. Accord- ingly, there is an urgen tneed for in tegrated information about healthy diet and safe food to assist in formulating priorities for polic y, both in the area of health protection and health promotion. This report attempts to fill the current void, at least in part,and also presents some of the likely developments in the field. Diet and food in relation to health and health policy Food and drink are, like the air we breathe, essential to human life and physical func- tion.In all life phases, from conception to old age, an appropriate quantity and com- position of the food is essential. In addition, a variety of other nutrients are required,as illustrated in textbox 1.1 .This requirement can be met relatively simply, at least here in the Western world, by ensuring adequate variety in our diet. After all, most foods var ymarkedly in composition .In many cases ,e.g.plant-based products, their composition can be extremely complex. This means that, in addition to the 'desired' nutrients, they are likely to contain numerous other substances and constituents.Some of those constituents may actually have an adverse effect on health, whileothers seem to promote good health. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1 47Textbox 1.1: Diet and food constituents.1 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 48Diet contains more than just fuel for the body. Alongside substances which provide energy, wealso consume those which build tissue and regu-late bodily functions. These substances arenecessary to create and replace tissue and cells,or to maintain their structure and function. This isnot only important for children during theirgrowth, but also for adults. Many of the tissues ofour body, such as those of blood, bone and skin,are subject to a constant process of degeneration and replacement. The substances contained inour food which provide energy, regulate bodilyfunctions and enable regeneration are generallyreferred to by the collective term 'nutrients'.Based on the quantity in which these nutrientsare to be found in our diet, they are classified aseither 'macronutrients' or 'micronutrients' (see figure 1.1 ). 1. Naturally occurring constituents - Nutrients Macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates, proteins, alcohol Micronutrients: vitamins, minerals, trace elements -Other naturally constituents Fibre: non-digestible complex carbohydrates factors: tr ypsin inhibitors (in etc. Secondary from plants and other organisms: -Bio-active compounds (polyphenols, lignans, -Natural toxins Various categories (preservatives, colourings, flavouring agents etc.) -Contaminants (from raw materials, pr ocess and/or environment) Microbial contaminants ( Salmonella ,Campylobacter ,etc.) Chemical contaminants (PAHs, PCBs, Hg, Pb, etc.) The main sources of energy are the carbohy- drates and fats, and to a lesser extent the pro-teins. Although alcohol also pr ovides ener gy,its contribution at the level of the population is small. The most important nutrients after the fats, carbo-hydrates and pr oteins are the vitamins, minerals and trace elements. Various such constituents, aswell as metabolites derived from the essentialfatty acids, have a regulatory function due to theirinvolvement in metabolic processes such as fluidregulation and metabolism. Examples include Bvitamins, zinc and selenium. More than 50 nutri-ents, most of which ar eessential to human life, have been identified. Here, 'essential' means that the body needs these substances in order to func-tion, and is unable to produce them itself, orunable to do so in sufficient quantity (Den Hartog etal., 1980; Binsber gen et al ., 2001).Besides the nutrients, our diet also includes many other substances and constituents, both naturallyoccur ring and non-naturally occur ring (see figur e 1.1). The naturally occurring constituents which are not regarded as nutrients are often termed'non-nutrients'. However ,there is no consensus regarding which substances fall into which group.(Some people regard water and fibre as nutri-ents).The non-naturally occurring substances may ormay not be introduced into food deliberately.Additives, for example, may be used to extend aproduct' sshelf life, or to enhance its colour. How- ever, there can also be undesired contaminants present. These may be chemical or microbial innature, and can be introduced during cultivation,production, processing or storage.Figure 1.1: Naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring food constituents.Ithas long been realized that a relationship exists between diet and food on the one hand, and health and disease on the other. If our intake of the substances which pro-vide energy is too low, the result will be undernutrition. Similarly, an inadequate intake of the vitamins and minerals required for regeneration and regulation is likelyto lead to various deficiency diseases, some of which can be life-threatening. Current scientific insights however, suggest a more complex relationship between diet and health, particularly in terms of the so-called 'lifestyle diseases'. A high energyintake with low energy expenditure is unhealthy, because this will result in over- weight, which is a risk factor for a number of chronic diseases. Similarly, an excessive intake of certain macronutrients, such as the trans and saturated fatty acids, is known to have an adverse effect on health. Toxic effects have also been observed from a highintake of certain micronutrients, including vitamins. Conversely, beneficial effects have been ascribed to certain non-nutrients, which are said to protect against some chronic illnesses. In particular, this is the case with fibre and certain plant metabolites (polyphenols and lignans) as found in fruit and vegeta-bles.Other tssuch as naturally occurring toxins and anti-nutritional fac- tors, however, may lead to adverse health effects. Given the undeniable importance of healthy diet and safe food in terms of public health ,the Dutch governmen thas for many decades devoted due attention to these factors, regarding this as one of its key tasks. The government is often in the front lineof food safety issues, and is able to implement the measures required to ensure food safet y.However ,the promotion of healthy eating habit sis a somewhat more difficult undertaking, given that this is largely a matter of individual choice and that it is more difficult to force changes in behaviour and lifest yle. The possible harmful effects of non-naturally occurring food constituents form an important focus of government policy. This is particularly true for constituents which are introduced intentionally, such as preservatives and flavourings, and more recently the phytosterols and phytostanols added to margarines with a view to reducing cho- lesterol levels .It also applies to the constituents which are not intentionally added, such as chemical and microbiological con taminants. Besides the serious chronic ill- nesses associated with these contaminants, particular attention is devoted to acutehealth problems such as gastro-enteritis and food poisoning. Given the more acute risk or greater severit yof cer tain (poten tial) health effects, food contamination with microbial or chemical constituents often occupies a prominent place on the political agenda and in the public perception of food safety matters. Thegovernment therefore faces an important challenge. Although many experts nowbelieve that our food is safer than ever before, this is not always the view held by thegeneral public .The series of recent food-related incidents has demonstrated that not only must the governmen tcontinue to strive to maintain the current high level of protection ,it must also persuade the public that ever ydue measure has been taken.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1 49Textbox 1.2: Definitions applying to (healthy) diet and (safe) food. The government must also remain alert to ongoing developments (e.g. globalization of production and trade) which increase the vulnerability of food safety, and to newthreats as and when they emerge. The terms 'healthy diet' and 'food safety' and their determining factors No unequivocal definition of the term 'diet' exists in the Netherlands. Some experts apply a rather narrow definition, while others are very much broader in their inter-pretation (see textbox 1.2 ). It is assumed that we must obtain the necessary nutrients from our everyday 'package' of the foods that we eat. The relative quantities of each nutrient will, however, vary greatly from one type of food to another. The same is true of the potentially deleterious food constituents. The determining factor of any defini- tion of 'diet' is therefore the average package of foods consumed by the individual orpopulation, whether or not expressed in terms of the nutrients and other constituents it contains. In this report the authors have opted for a pragmatic approach whereby a more con- crete definition is applied. This helps to delineate the term, rendering its essence clear(see textbox 1.2 ). The term ' diet' covers both the quan tityand the composition of the food (and nutrients) consumed. We may speak of a 'healthy' diet if the total package,1 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 50Some fifteen handbooks on diet and nutrition wereconsulted for this r epor t. None contains a simple, usable definition of the terms 'diet' or 'nutrition'. Enquiries among various organizations(Ministry of Health, andResear ch Centr e, the Netherlands Or ganization for Applied Scientific Resear ch) reveal that both very broad and very narrow definitions exist. Thebroad definitions include all aspects of food and eating, including availability, eating habits, the consumption of nutrients and non-nutrients,absorption and digestion, nutritional status, etc.Arecent European Union document adopts a simi- larly br oad definition of 'nutrition': \"...the processes involved in obtaining and assimilatingnutrients into the body so that the body functionsproperly and health is maintained\" (EU, 2002).For pragmatic r easons, the authors of this r epor t have opted for a mor econcrete definition of the terms 'diet' and 'food', making clear both theessence of each and the dif ferentiation between the two. The definitions applied are also more in line with the objectives of gover nment policy . Diet: the total consumption of food and drink, expr essed in ter ms of foods or nutrients and other food constituents, by an individual or a (sub-)population. (i.e. what is actually consumed) Food: the variety of foods made available by the agricultural sector and/or food pr ocessing indus - try. (i.e. the products available to the general public) Given these definitions, we may then apply the terms: Healthy diet: when the consumption by the individual or (sub-)population, with regard to the quantity and composition of all nutrients and other constituents, is optimal for human health. Safe food: when quantities of micro-organisms, chemical substances or other harmful con- stituents do not exceed levels likely to affect human health, on or in the foodsoffered or consumed.calculated in terms of the quantity and composition of the nutrients and other health- promoting constituents, is 'optimal' (in terms of health) according to current scientificinsights. Maintaining a healthy eating pattern is therefore a question of eating nei- ther too much nor too little (the energy intake must be in balance with energy expen-diture), and that the dietary composition (in terms of the main nutrients) is in linewith the recommended levels. The term 'food' is defined as the complete range offoods and edible products made available by the agricultural sector and the food pro-cessing industry. We may speak of 'safe food' if the foodstuffs offered and eventuallyconsumed contain no harmful concentrations of micro-organisms, chemical contami- nants or other undesirable constituents, according to current scientific knowledge. From the above, it will be clear that the relationships between diet, food and health are complex. Nevertheless, we wish to arrive at certain principles on which to base government policy. More specifically, we shall attempt to identify policy lines andrelated activities which make a real contribution in terms of maintaining or improv-ing health. To assist in this process, a number of factors specifically related to diet have been added to the conceptual model of the Centre for Public Health Forecasting(cPHF), as shown in figure 1.2 (see also V an Oers (Ed .), 2002; Gezondheid op koers? p. 56). The main assumptions of the model presented in figure 1.2 are (1) that the determi- nantsdo, by definition, determine health, (2) that within the 'determinants' block are the elements of prevention which affect the other determinants in various ways, (3)that health policy will control and direct preventive activities, and (4) that autonomous factors (beyond the influence of health polic y) will also influence the overall process. An examination of the figure from top to bot tom,with specific at tention for diet- related factors, reveals the following picture. The arrow between 'Health status' and 'Diet' is self-explanatory. While diet will have an influence on some personal charac- teristics (e.g. overweight) it should be noted that the interplay of diet and personal characteristics (e.g. individual differences in sensitivity to certain food constituents) will also affect overall health outcomes . Diet in terms of actual consumption is determined by lifestyle factors (eating behavi- our or eating habits) on the one hand, and the external factor (physical environment)of food supply on the other, both in terms of the range of foods available and their qualit y.Diet may therefore be regarded as the product of eating behaviour on the one hand and available foods on the other (Diet = Eating behaviour x Food supply). Eating behaviour encompasses both the choice of food products and the manner in which they are stored and prepared. This in turn is determined by personal factorssuch as knowledge ,attitude and preferences - from junk food to haute cuisine. In many cases (such as for babies ,children, hospital patients and for others who rely on organized catering), the choice of food is actually determined by other people .SocialOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1 51factors are also impor tant in terms of income and the affordability of food products, and the role that eating and drinking play in the individual 's life. The food supply is further influenced by 'autonomous' factors such as developments in food productiontechnology and market globalization, as well as by food safety legislation and publicinformation programmes designed to promote healthy eating behaviour. From the perspective of prevention, food safety (in terms of legislation and enforce- ment) is a matter of health protection policy. Health promotion policy targets eatingbehaviour, both through personal characteristics (the behavioural determinants suchas knowledge and attitude) and through social environmental factors (the socio-eco-nomic behavioural determinan ts). As a consequence, there is a certain logical differ- entiation (albeit not absolute) between policy addressing a healthy diet and that con- cerned with food safet y.1 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 52 Lifestyle Personal Social environmentPrevention Exogenous determinantsHealthcare (mental)Healthcare and preventionGlobalizationandfoodtechnologyHealth policy Healthy diet Food safety DietFood of products -qualityEating behaviour -food choice -food conceptual model adapted for diet.Terms of reference, objective and structure of the report The key question addressed by this report is how we can improve our diet, eating behaviour and food supply so as to maintain the health gains achieved in the past as well as making additional health gains in the future. The report also attempts to iden-tify the extent to which the health gains of diet-related interventions relate to thosewhich may be achieved through other types of intervention. The objective of the report is to coherently present and analyse the scientific know- ledge and government measures relating to both healthy diet and food safety. In doing so, we shall examine where the greatest potential health gains are to be made, or where past gains can be maintained, on the basis of previously identified principles for policy addressing eating behaviour and food supply. The report therefore seeks toprovide important input for government policy. Part A of the report presents a summary of the main findings, while Part B (starting with this introductory chapter) is structured to respect the existing distinction at the policy level between 'healthy' and 'safe'. Chapters 2 and 4 form the main framework for each of these aspect s,and each presen ts: a) a general summary of current know- ledge and the status of health-promoting and health-threatening constituents in the diet, b) modifying factors; c) an identification of the most important dietary con-stituents which have a positive or adverse effect on health, and d) an analysis and quan tification of the poten tial health gains or health losses. Further to this 'problem analysis', chapters 3 and 5 describe the policy currently implemented by the govern- ment and the existing legislation and other measures addressing 'healthy diet' and 'safe food 'respectively .These chapters therefore presen . These separate considerations of ' healthy diet' ( chapters 2 and 3 )and ' safe food '(chap- ters 4 and 5 )are followed by three chapters in which the health aspect sof diet and food supply are considered in greater cohesion. Chapter 6 opens with a summary of the (alleged) positive and negative health aspects of the so-called 'functional foods' and dietary supplements. Current developments in legislation are also described. Chapter 7 attempts to make a quantitative comparison between the health and safety aspect sof certain recommended foods (such as fruit and vegetables, fish, cereals, etc.) and the ' functional foods' and supplements. Furthermore, the potential health gains of dietary interventions are compared with those addressing other lifestyle factors. Chapter 8 considers in greater depth the coherence between 'healthy diet' and 'safe food' in the perception of the consumer. The contents of this chapter rely primarily on curren tknowledge and insight srelating to eating behaviour and the risk perception of the general public, and on how these can influence each other. Chapter 9 takes a look into the future, describing the likely trends and developments in food safety andeating behaviour for the coming five to ten years, together with their possible conse-quences for public health. Chapter 10 presents a general discussion and the main con- clusions of the repor t. This chapter also forms the basis for the 'Key Messages' of the repor t.

Working docu- ment. Brussel: October 2002. HOW HEALTHY IS THE DUTCH DIET ? 2.1 Introduction The state of public health in the Netherlands underwent a veritable revolution in the twentieth century. Over a one-hundred-year period, life expectancy (at birth) rosefrom 47.5 to 75.2 years for men, and from 50.4 to 80.5 years for women. The greatestgains were made during the first sixty years of the twentieth century, when life expectancy for both men and women increased by 24 years. In the case of men, the trend levelled out between 1960 and 1980, but life expectancy then increased by a further three years in the following two decades. The continual increase in women'slife expectancy seems to have peaked in about 1990, with only 0.5 years having been added between 1990 and 2000 (CBS 1,2004). Underlying this increase in life expectancy is a shifting pattern of the causes of death, as shown in figure 2.1 .Between 1900 and 1970, there were fewer pandemics of infec- tious diseases ,but an increase in degenerative or chronic diseases such as cardiovascu - lar disease and cancer. The period following 1970 has been termed the era of 'delayed degenerative diseases'. The mortality from cardiovascular disease fell, shifting to anolder age group. After 1990, cancer mortality also levelled out (Mackenbach, 2001). The reduction in deaths from infectious diseases must be seen as one of the great public health successes of the twentieth century. It is attributable to such factors as improved hygiene ,vaccination programmes and safer food .That food became safer is largely due to the introduction of pasteurization, the emergence of the domestic refrigerator ,and the publication of food safet yguidelines. A second major success can be seen in improvemen tsto diet and nutrition .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 55Figure 2.1: Mortality in the Netherlands in the twentieth century, by cause of death (Source: CBS, 2004). 0%20%40%60%80%100% 1910 1930 1950 1970 1990 2000Other causes of death of injuryandpoisoning Respiratorydiseases Malignantneoplasms Cardiovascular diseases 1Statistics Netherlands, Voorburg/HeerlenNot only have foods become microbiologically safer, their nutritional value has increased, serving to eliminate the major deficiency diseases such as pellagra andrachitis (US Centers for Disease Control, 1999). The chronic diseases which are now dominant do have an important relationship to diet and nutrition, but that relation-ship is of a very different order. This chapter therefore addresses the question, 'howhealthy is our diet in these times of excess?' Section 2.2 presents a summary of the relationships between diet and the major chronic diseases, while section 2.3 describes the food consumption of the Dutch population. Based on this information, section 2.4 goes on to assess the health loss in the Netherlands that can be attributed to an unhealthy diet and, conversely, the potential health gains to be made through dietary interventions. The way in which those interventions can be made is discussed in sec- tion 2.5 ,which is followed by a general discussion and conclusions in section 2.6 . 2.2 Diet in relation to health and disease M.C. Ock\u00e9, D. Kromhout # There are many nutrients implicated in the development of diet-related chronic dis- eases. Some nutrients have an adverse effect on health, while others have a positiveeffect. Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, also play a par t,as do environmental factors and genetic susceptibility to certain dis- eases. This complex network of contributory causes has yet to be fully understood. In 2003, the W orld Health Organization/F ood and Agricultural Organization pub - lished a report which includes a summary of current scientific knowledge concerning the relationships bet ween diet ary factors and the most common diet-related diseases worldwide (WH O,2003). The diseases in question are cardiovascular diseases ,cancer , obesity (severe overweight), diabetes mellitus type 2, dental disorders and osteoporo- sis. These are also the main diet-related diseases in the Netherlands. As shown in figure 2.1,cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the main causes of death. Obesity is taking on epidemic proportions, its prevalence having doubled to approximately 10% over the past 25 years .Dental disorders, and caries in particular, affect almost the entire Dutch population .In 2000, there were over 400,000 people with osteoporosis and a similar number with diabetes mellitus type 2 (Van Oers, 2002). A number of these con-ditions are interrelated. For example, overweight and diabetes type 2 are importantrisk factors for cardiovascular diseases. 2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 56#With contributions by and T.L.S. Visscher.2.2.1 Dietary factors in relation to chronic diseases Table 2.1 shows the relationships between nutrients and food products (or product groups) and the chronic diseases, where the WHO/FAO expert commission has identi-fied 'convincing evidence' or 'probable evidence' of such relationships. The table hasbeen adapted to reflect the situation in the Netherlands, insofar as information rela-ting to fish salted in the Chinese manner, aflatoxins, excessive fluoride, hypocal-caemia and vitamin C deficiency has been omitted as irrelevant. The extent to which dietary factors and certain diseases are interrelated is discussed below. However, this consideration is limited to those dietary factors for which 'con- vincing evidence' of a relationship exists, i.e. energy balance, fatty acid pattern, fruitand vegetables, fibre and sugar, certain vitamins and minerals, and alcohol consump- tion. Where possible, references to relevant reports of the Gezondheidsraad 2are given, since these are directly applicable to the Dutch situation. Established relation-ships between dietary factors and less prevalent disorders, such as that between folic acid and neural tube defects, are not discussed in this chapter. Energy balance The food we eat is the source of energy for the human body. The main sources of ener- gy in food are the carbohydrates and fats, with a small contribution being made by proteins and possibly by alcohol .In healthy people ,the energy intake should be in balance with energy expenditure. Regular monitoring of body weight is a simple wayof assessing whether this is the case. A slight positive energy balance over a longer period will lead to an increase in body weight. This may even tually lead to over - weight, either moderate or severe. A negative energy balance can lead to under- weight. The definitions of the terms ' overweight' and 'underweight' are given in textbox 2.1. Overweight During the period 1998 to 2001, 55% of Dutch men and 45% of Dutch women aged between 20 and 70 were overweight. Clinical obesity (severe overweight) could be seen in 10% of men in this age categor y, and in 12% of women (Blokstra & Schuit, 2003). This represen ts a twofold increase over the previous 25-year period (Visscher et al., 2002). It is predicted that the number of adults with obesity will rise by a further 50%over the coming 20 years (Bemelmans et al., 2004 ). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children has also risen. Between 1980 and 1997, the number of young children with over weight more than doubled (see figure 2.2 ). Depending on age, the proportion of boys with overweight was between 7.1% and 15.5% in 1997, thefigure for girls being between 8.2% and 16.1% (Fredriks et al., 2000).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 572Health Council of the Netherlands, The Hague2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 58Table 2.1: Summary of the evidence for relationships between dietary factors and obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dental disorders and osteoporosis, adapted to reflect the situation in the Netherlands (WHO, 2003).

However, the increase in the number of persons with obesity may be across the board ,regardless of education (Blokstra & Schuit ,2003). Among adult sof Moroccan, Turkish, Surinamese and Antillean descent, obesity is more common than in the 'native' Dutch population. This is particularly true among women: the percent-age of adult females with obesity varies from 20% in the Antillean ethnic group and 26% among the T urkish ,compared to 12% in the mainstream Dutch population (Van Lindert et al ., 2004). Little information is available concerning the other ethnic groups. Obesity is also more common among Turkish and Moroccan children than among those of Dutch descen t(Brussa ard et al., 1999). Obesit yis an impor tant risk factor for heidsra ad,2003a). Morbidit yrise in to the bodyOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 59The World Health Organization uses the 'body mass index' (BMI) as the indicator of a person'sbody fat in relation to his or her height. The bodymass index is calculated by dividing weight by thesquare of the height (kg/m 2). The BMI categories shown in table 2.2 .apply to Western adults. Dif- ferent cut-off points apply in the case of childrenand ethnic groups. Table 2.2: BMI classifications.

This is particularly true of diabetes mellitus type 2, but also holds for cardiovascular diseases, gallbladder diseases, conditions which impair mobility(such as arthritis), and various forms of cancer. An expert commission appointed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (an official WHO agency) found 'con-vincing evidence' to suggest that obesity represents an increased likelihood of devel-oping cancer of the colon, breast (post-menopause), uterus, kidney or oesophagus(IARC, 2002). Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, glucose intolerance and (in theUnited States) diabetes mellitus type 2 are more prevalent among obese children thanothers of the same age. The reduced quality of life experienced by persons with obesi- ty is not only due to the increased likelihood of (co-)morbidity, but also to psychologi- cal and social problems, including a higher rate of employment incapacity. The Health Council of the Netherlands states that treatment for obesity does not usuallyresult in any permanent weight loss. It is therefore important to prevent obesity from developing in the first place (Gezondheidsraad, 2003a). The Health Council arrives at similar conclusions to those of the WHO with regard to the relationship between the risk of developing obesity and dietary factors, physicalactivit yand environmen tal factors (see column 1 of table 2.1 ). It summarizes curren t knowledge of dietary factors as follows. The likelihood of over-consumption (i.e. ener- gy intake in excess of energy expenditure) is greatest with a diet rich in fats, asopposed to a low-fat, high fibre diet. This is particularly so in combination with a lack of physical activit y.The influence of various types of carbohydrates on the regulation of the energy balance is not yet fully understood. Various other dietary factors willalso affect energy intake, including the energy density of the diet, the quantity con- sumed (por tion size), and the frequenc yof meals (with par ticular regard to ' snack - ing'). The diet which is likely to do most to help maintain an appropriate energy balance is one with a low energ ydensit y, i.e. containing a large proportion of fruit, veget ables and cereal product s(Gezondheidsra ad,2003a). Underweight Anegative can lead to to underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2). Gradual, unintentional weight loss is an important indicator of insuffi- cientenergy intake. Persons who lose five or more kilograms over a period of five years have a higher risk of death than those who do not. Among older men ,this level of weight loss is associated with an increase in the risk of death in the order of 2.2 (DeGroot et al. ,2002). Unintentional weight loss of 4% per year has been shown to be an independent indicator of increased risk of death. Undernutrition is often accompa- nied by impaired physical functioning and a decrease in the qualit yof life (De Jong , 1999; Mathey, 2000). With the exception of a number of specific groups, undernutrition is relatively uncommon in the Netherlands. The groups with a high prevalence of undernutritionare elderly persons in (residen tial) care, the chronically ill, and those addicted to alco- hol or drugs .In one survey of 'apparently healthy' Dutch citizens aged between 70 and 75, 14% of men and 31% of women were found to have lost five or more kilograms2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 60inbody weight over a period of ten years (De Groot etal.,2002). Of elderly persons admitted to a long-term residential care facility, 30% are suffering from undernutri-tion (Anon., 2001), while among those admitted to hospital, the prevalence of under- nutrition can rise to as much as 62% (Naber et al., 1997; see also RIVM, 2004). Fatty acids Fatty acids in our diet play a particularly important part in the atherothrombotic process which underlies the development of coronary heart diseases. Various (classesof)fatty acids have various effects. The differences between the various classes of fatty acids is explained in textbox 2.2. Quantitative relationships have mostly been described between the intake of fatty acids on the one hand and intermediary risk factors, such as high concentrations of serum cholesterol fractions ,on the other .In the case of saturated fatty acids, the rela- tionship with serum LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol) is the most important. Thelevel of LDL cholesterol has a strong correlation with the total cholesterol level. Inter- vention studies have demonstrated that the replacemen tof one energ yper cen tsatu- rated fatty acids by carbohydrates is accompanied by a reduction in the total serum cholesterol of 0.052 mmol/l mmol/l (Clarke et al. ,1997). Trans fatty acids raise the LDL cholesterol level and lower that of HDL cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). Besides the adverse effects on serum cholesterol fractions, other adverse effects can be seen, having a link with the risk of coronary heart diseases such as thrombosis .On the basis of cohort studies, it is estimated that an increase in trans fatty acid intake equivalent to two energy per cent will produce a 25% increase in the risk of coronary heart diseases (Oomen, 2001). Substitution of saturated fatty acids by polyunsaturated acids was shown to reduce the risk of coronar yheartdiseases in three of the four long -term in tervention studies undertaken. The Health Council therefore concludes that the effect may be attribut- able to linoleic acid, although -linolenic acid could also be responsible for the find- ings (Gezondheidsraad, 2001). The n -3 or omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids listed in textbox 2.2 are known to reduce the risk of fat al cardiovascular diseases. Fish is a rich source of these lipids. Epidemio- logical research and in tervention studies have established that the consumption ofOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 61Textbox 2.2: Types of fatty acids in the diet. Fat in our diet is mostly in the form of triglyc- erides, made up of glycerol and fatty acids.Fatty acids be saturated (e.g. myristic acidand palmitic acid) or unsaturated, which meansthat they have one or more double bonds betweenthe carbon atoms. The number of double bondsdetermines whether the fatty acid is monounsatu-rated (e.g. oleic acid) or polyunsaturated (e.g. linoleic acid). The site of the double bond is repre-sented, for instance, as n-3 ( -linoleic acid, fish fatty acids) or n-6 (linoleic acid). The symbolomega ( )is sometimes used instead of the 'n'. Double bonds can occur either in the cisor trans form.fish reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases. A daily intake of 400 mg fish fatty acids (the equivalent of eating fish once or twice per week) reduces the risk ofcoronary heart diseases by approximately 25%, compared to a situation in which no fish fatty acids are consumed (Bucher et al., 2002; Whelton et al., 2004, He et al., 2004). Fruit and vegetables Fruit and vegetables are important sources of dietary fibre and various vitamins, and help to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Moreover, a high consumption of fruit andvegetables reduces the risk of certain chronic diseases. Based on cohort studies, it is estimated that the risk of coronary heart diseases can be reduced by 20% with a high consumption of fruit and vegetables, compared to a situa-tion in which consumption is low (Liu et al., 2000; Hirvonen et al., 2001; Joshipura et al., 2001; Bazzano et al. ,2002; Steffen et al. ,2003). In the case of stroke, such a relative risk reduction can also be seen for the consumption of fruit and vegetables in combi-nation (Joshipura et al., 1999; Hirvonen ,2003; Bazzano et al.,2002; Steffen et al. ,2003). However, the results of cohort studies examining the consumption of fruit and veget ables separately are less consisten t. In the largest cohort study, no relationship was established between the consumption of vegetables and the risk of stroke, but high consumption of fruit was estimated to reduce the riskby 30% (Joshipura et al. ,1999). The relative risks established by the largest cohort stud- ies have been used as the basis for the modelling in section 2.4 (see table 2.3 ). In the early 1990s, it was estimated that high consumption of fruit and vegetables would reduce the risk of cancer ,particularly it sepithelial forms ,by approximately 50% (Block et al., 1992). This risk reduction has since been subject to some downwards adjustmen t,and a discrepancy between patient-control and cohort studies has been noted .Both the IAR C(2003) and the Signalling Commit tee Cancer of the Dutch Can - cer Society (Signaleringscommissie Kanker KWF, 2004) have made an inventory of the evidence for a relationship between the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables and cancer. Both conclude that consumption is indeed likely to reduce the risk of cancer of the mouth and throat, oesophagus, stomach and lung. The IARC adds that there is some evidence ,albeit limited, to suggest that the consumption of fruit and vegetables has a preven tive effect with regard to cancers of the colon, ovary, bladder and kidney. If the evidence from cohort studies is considered in isolation, then the incidence oflung, stomach and breast cancer would appear to have an inverse relationship to theconsumption of fruit, while cancer of the lung has a similar relationship to that of veget ables .As shown in table 2.3 ,the risk reductions are in the order of 20% (IAR C, 2003). However, these estimates are based on some considerable uncertainties and with the exception of breast cancer, they are also conservative estimates. Moreover,exactly how high consumption of fruit and vegetables must be in order to achieve these risk reductions is not clear, since each study has compared different intake levels. Besides nutrien ts, fruit and vegetables contain a wide range of non-nutrients, such as flavonoids and other polyphenols ,which may also play a role in reducing the risks of2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 62chronic diseases. Furthermore, the as yet unknown constituents of fruit and vegeta- bles will probably have some significance in relation to health as well. To date, it hasnot been possible to demonstrate exactly how or why fruit and vegetables can offer protection against chronic disease. Dietary fibre Dietary fibre comprises indigestible carbohydrates. The main sources of fibre are brown ,wholemeal and mixed -grain bread ,potatoes, fruit and vegetables. Dietary fibre hasapreventative effect with regard to obesity, coronary heart diseases and diabetes type 2. The possible effect with regard to bowel cancer remains disputed since the evi-dence, although based on well-conducted cohort studies (Park et al., 2003; Bingham et al., 2003) appears to be conflicting (K WF,2004). A diet rich in fibre is more important in preventing overweight than one low in fat (Gezondheidsraad, 2003a). However,fibre supplements have not been consistently shown to have any positive effect in pre- venting obesit y.Cohor tstudies reveal that an increase in daily fibre in take of more than 10 grams (for women) and 15 grams (for men) is associated with a 20-30% reduc- tion in the risk of developing et al., 1996; Rimm et al., et al., 1999; Mozaffarian et al., et al., 2003). V arious obser va- tion and intervention studies support the hypothesis that dietary fibre also reduces the risk of developing diabetes type 2 (Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board, 2002; Montonen et al., 2003). The effects in terms of coronary heart diseases and dia- betes type 2 are mostly attributed to dietary fibre derived from cereal products. Sugar The consumption of carbohydrates always entails some impact on the teeth. Whether that impact will lead to caries varies from individual to individual and, apart from thefrequency of carbohydrate intake, will depend on the individual's oral hygiene regi- men.With effective administration of fluoride ,good oral hygiene and a relatively infrequent intake of carbohydrates, the risk of developing caries is small. Accordingly, the Health Council has not produced a dietary standard or guideline for sugar con-sumption (Gezondheidsraad, 2001). Minerals and vit amins The in take of the mineral sodium is positively related to blood pressure, while potas- sium has the opposite effect. In tervention studies demonstrate that a reduction of theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 63Table 2.3: Estimated health effects (relative risks) of high versus low consumption of fruit and vegetables.

For those who do suffer from hyper- tension, the reduction is 2.5 mm Hg (Gezondheidsraad, 2000a). A meta-analysis ofintervention studies of potassium intake suggests that potassium suppletion willreduce systolic blood pressure by 1.8 mm Hg in subjects who do not have elevatedblood pressure, and by 4.4 mm Hg in those who do. Fruit and vegetables are goodsources of potassium (Geleijnse & Grobbee, 2003). A diet which includes a high pro-portion of fruit, vegetables, fish, nuts, low-fat dairy products, and a low proportion of total fat and saturated fat has been shown to have a positive effect on blood pressure (Gezondheidsraad, 2000a). Calcium and vitamin D are, alongside physical activity, two important factors in the development and maintenance of the skeleton. Among the elderly, a high intake ofboth calcium and vitamin D has been related to a lower risk of developing osteoporo-sis and bone fractures (Gezondheidsraad, 2000b; Ooms, 1994). A high consumption of milk and milk products, as well as a high intake of calcium (more than 1000 mg perday) demonstrate a slight but consisten treduction in the risk of bowel cancer (K WF, 2004). This report does not examine the diet as a source of fluoride ,since in the Netherlands, toothpaste con taining fluoride is considered a far more important contributor to the prevention of oral health problems than the quantity of fluoride in the diet. Alcohol The consumption of alcohol, particularly in excess, can have many adverse effects (Klat sky & Friedman ,1995). According to the figures published by Statistics Nether- lands (CB S), 831 people died in the Netherlands from an alcohol -related condition (e.g. alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis) in the year 2000, where alcohol couldbe identified as an explicit contributory factor. This figure must be regarded as a minimum, since it does not include deaths which are indirectly related to alcohol con- sumption. For example, each year approximately 200-250 people die in road accidents in which at least one driver is under the influence of alcohol ,with a further 3,000 to 3,500 individuals suffering serious injur y. Excessive alcohol consumption is also an important cause of osteoporosis and hyper- tension, the latter increasing the risk of stroke and coronary heart diseases (WHO, 2003). Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor in cancers of the mouth ,throat , oesophagus, liver and breast. The most important public health effect of alcohol is the risk of breast cancer, since this is more prevalent than other alcohol-related forms ofcancer. Women who consume one unit of alcoholic beverage per day are at approxi-mately 8% higher risk of developing breast cancer than those who do not drink at all.There are also clear indications that alcohol consumption is implicated in thedevelopmen tof bowel cancer (KWF, 2004).2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 64However, alongside the many negative effects of excessive alcohol consumption, there is evidence to suggest that moderate consumption (one to three units per day for menand one or two units a day for women) actually reduces the risk of coronary heart diseases, and possibly also stroke (although this is less clear), compared to total absti-nence or high alcohol consumption (Holman et al. ,1996). 2.2.2 Dietary standards, Guidelines for Good Nutrition and Rules for a healthy diet In the Netherlands, it falls to the Health Council (and formerly the Netherlands Nutri- tion Council) to formulate dietary reference values and guidelines for good nutritionand diet. The dietary standards nutri-ents. The 'recommended quantity' and the 'adequate intake' reflect the level of intakeatwhich no deficiency symptoms will appear, and at which the likelihood of chronic diseases is minimized. A recommended quantity is calculated on the basis of informa-tion regarding the average requiremen tand it svariance ;where insufficien is the 'adequate intake' is proposed. The 'acceptable upper limit' is the quantity above which undesirable side-effects arelikely to be seen (Gezondheidsraad, 2001). Since 2000, updates of the dietary stan- dards have been published for a number of nutrien ts. In 1986, the Nutrition Council published the Guidelines for Good Nutrition. This docu- mentdescribed the average Dutch diet at that time ,and set out the changes that were seen as desirable, based on the recommendations of the Nutrition Council and the Health Council with regard to the preven tion of illness and disease . The documen toffers the following guidelines : Maintain a varied diet. Limit your intake of fat - particularly saturated fat - but ensure that you eat a suffi- cient quantity of polyunsaturated fats. Moderate your cholesterol intake. Eat plenty of complex carbohydrates and dietary fibre, and avoid too frequent or excessive consumption of sugars . Moderate your alcohol consumption. Moderate your salt intake. In addition to these guidelines, the document also stressed the importance of achiev- ing and main taining an appropriate body weight (Nutrition Council ,1986). The guidelines have been subject to periodic re-evaluation based on current scientific knowledge (Nutrition Council, 1989, 1991). With regard to the guidelines for fat, thisled to a shift in emphasis from the importance of limiting overall fat intake to that oflimiting the in take of saturated fat. The importance of eating fish (n-3 fatty acids) was also given greater emphasis .In the case of the trans fatty acids, there was insufficient evidence at the time (the early 1990s) on which to base any recommendations .WhileOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 65the 1986 Guidelines for Good Nutrition may now appear somewhat dated, they are still adequate in their general outline. However, a revised version is currently beingprepared by the Health Council and will incorporate the considerations described in section 2.2.1 . The most important dietary changes recommended by the Nutrition Council since its 1986 Guidelines for G ood Nutrition are shown in textbox 2.3. Based on these documents, the Netherlands Nutrition Centre published a set of 'Rules for healthy diet', represen ting a popularized accoun tof recommended in take and dietary patterns for the purpose of general public information. The guidelines for the consumption of fruit and veget ables is included (see w ww.voedingscentrum.nl). 2.3 Food consumption and the intake of nutrients M.C. Ock\u00e9, K.F.A.M. Hulshof # Following a description of the relationships between dietary factors and the main diet-related chronic diseases, this section describes how healthy the Dutch diet actual-ly is, and it also outlines current developments in food consumption patterns. Developmen tsin food consumption have been described by the Health Council of the Netherlands (Gezondheidsraad ,2002), based on an analysis of the results of the national Food Consumption Surveys for 1987/1988, 1992 and 1997/1998. (For the pur-poses of this account, we shall simply refer to 'the period 1988 to 1998'). The mostimportant findings of the Health Council are described below. Where possible, morerecen tinformation from other sources has also been incorporated, together with2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 66 The amount of protein in the diet may remain unaltered. A reduction in fat consumption, from an aver- age of 40 energy per cent to an average of 30-35 energy per cent is considered necessary.This reduction should primarily be achievedthrough restricting the intake of saturated fats.Since 1991, the recommended consumption ofsaturated fats is no mor ethan 10% of the daily energy intake. Individual consumption of cholesterol should be no higher than the average consumptionlevel of 33 mg/MJ. The consumption of carbohydrates should increase from an average of approximately 45energy per cent to 55 energy per cent. This increase should be accounted for by greaterconsumption of complex carbohydrates. The consumption of mono- and disaccharides should be limited, particularly in terms of fre-quency. An acceptable intake level would bebetween 15 and 25 energy per cent. Consumption of dietary fibre should increase from approximately 2.4 g/MJ to approximately 3 g/MJ. Excessive alcohol consumption should be dis- couraged. Individual consumption of table salt should not be higher than the former average consumptionlevel of 9 g/day.Textbox 2.3: Guidelines for Good Nutrition (most important changes in diet). #With contributions by E.

The consumption of functional foods, fortified products and dietary supplements is discussed in chapter 6 . In general, the developments seen are less marked than had been expected on the basis of market surveys. Nevertheless, they are in line with the moderate changesrevealed by Social Planning Bureau's studies of the way in which Dutch people occupytheir time. This might indicate that the average consumer is more conservative in hisor her dietary choices than the trendwatchers assume. In this context, it should benoted that the trendwatchers' statements are usually based on short-term research among small and very specific groups of consumers. The difference may also be due to the fact that people with a heavy workload and little free time are not adequately represented on the panels used to assemble information about food consumption(Gezondheidsraad, 2002). 2.3.1 The general population Mealtimes In general, the traditional pattern of three meals a day was maintained during the period 1988 to 1998. Even in 2003, most people still appeared to be eating one hotmeal per day (Albert Heijn, 2003). However, the trend during the period 1988-1998 was for slightly fewer people to eat breakfast (85% of responden tshad eaten breakfast on both survey days in 1988, falling to 81% in 1998). This was particularly true of thelowest socio-economic group. The nutrient intake was slightly lower among those who frequen tly omit ted breakfast (G ezondheidsra ad,2002). For the hot meal of the day, which the Dutch usually t ake in the evening, there was a clear rise in the preference for product swith relatively shor tpreparation time and for pre-prepared convenience meals (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). In 1995, 19% of consumersstated that they purchased pre-prepared meals from time to time, while by 1999 this figure had risen to 25%. Sales figures also indicate a rising trend in the consumption of pre-prepared meals. Between the first half of 2001 and the first half of 2002, the total quan tity (by weight) of pre-prepared meals sold rose from 32 million to 35 million kilograms ,while the average number of purchases per consumer rose from 7.7 to 7.9 per year (Bijman et al., 2003). During the period 1988 to 1998, the traditional Dutch hot meal, consisting of meat, potatoes and veget ables ,lost ground to rice and past adishes ,and composite dishes, i.e. those in which all ingredients are combined (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). However, in 2003, the potato remained the most commonly eaten basic ingredient (51%) of the hotmeal (Albert Heijn, 2003). On average, a dinner prepared using potatoes as the stapleingredient contains more vegetables and more fat than one based around pasta orrice (F ood Consumption Survey VCP-3 data 1998, supplementary analyses). OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 67Between meals, the traditional beverages of tea and coffee were seen to give way to cold drinks (sugar-free and standard soft drinks, fruit juices), and bakery productsreplaced by nuts and packaged snacks. However, the information provides no indica- tion that the habit of all-day 'grazing' has markedly increased (Gezondheidsraad,2002). The number of people eating out, i.e. eating breakfast, lunch and/or dinner at a loca- tion other than their own home, increased by between 3% and 5% between 1988 and1998 (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). The proportion of consumers stating that they occa- sionally eat out was approximately 55% in 1999. The number of adults who often or exclusively do so rose from 6% in 1995 to 11% in 1999 (CBL, 2000). Foods During the period 1988-1998, the total consumption of staple foods such as potatoes, vegetables, fruit and meat can be seen to have fallen. This was accompanied byincreased consumption of cereals, nuts, snacks, composite meals and non-alcoholic beverages (see figure 2.3 ). The most important changes were seen between 1988 and 1992. In 1998, the average consumption of fish was low, at 10 grams per day (Gezondheid- sraad, 2002). Fish was eaten two to three times a month on average. Only some 25% of the adult population met the recommended level of fish consumption ,i.e. at least once a week (MORGEN project, 1993-1997). Based on the domestic consumption offish and fish products, it would seem that consumption has since risen somewhat (the volume in 2001 being 17% higher than in 1995) (Bijman et al.,2003).2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 68Figure 2.3: Change in the consumption of product groups between 1988 and 1998, expressed as apercentage of consumption in 1988 (V CP 1,3; after Gezondheidsraad, 2002). -20 - 100 period the average daily consumption of fruit fell by 15% to 102 grams, while that of vegetables fell by 18% to 120 grams (Gezondheidsraad, 2002).The consumption level was therefore markedly lower than the recommended intake (150-200 grams vegetables, 2 pieces of fruit for persons aged 12 and above). Less than25% of the population meets the recommendations with regard to fruit and vegeta-bles. The consumption of fruit and vegetables, calculated on the basis of sales perhousehold, fell yet further between 1999 and 2001 (Bijman et al., 2003). Energy The reported energy intake fell by 5% during the period 1988-1998. However, it is like- ly that part of this reduction is attributable to under-reporting. The number of people with overweight or obesity rose considerably during the period, as described in sec- tion 2.2 .This would suggest that the reduction in energy intake was exceeded by a reduction in energy expenditure. In its report on obesity, the Health Council offersseveral indications of reduced energy expenditure, although quantitative informationis not available (Gezondheidsraad, 2003a). Fat and fat tyacids The average fat content of the diet and the composition of fatty acids has seen a posi- tive trend over time. The reduction in the intake of trans fatty acids between 1988 and 1998 was in excess of 60%, which may clearly be described as substantial. This is attri- butable to the lower con tent of trans fattyacids in plant-based spreads and similar (semi-) hardened vegetable fat products. The reduction in total fat intake (approx. 5%),and hence that of the saturated fatty acids, is primarily due to changes in consump- tion pat terns within the product groups ' oils,fatsand savour ysauces 'and ' milk and milk products', whereby products with a high fat content were replaced by 'light' ver- sions having a lower fat con tent. To a limited extent, the reduced use of visible fats (spreads and cooking fat s) was compensated by the consumption of product swith industrially added 'hidden' fat. The reduction in the intake of saturated fatty acids inspreads and cooking fats, milk products, cheese, meat products, cakes and pastries was not accompanied by any increase in the intake of these fatty acids from sources such as potato products and pre-prepared meals (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). Despite the favourable developmen tover time, the quantity of saturated fatty acids and, to a lesser degree, trans fatty acids in the diet remains markedly higher than the recommended levels (see table 2.4 ). Only 5% of Dutch people have a diet in line with the recommended fatty acid pattern. The intake of unsaturated fatty acids is in line with the ' adequate 'intake level ,being an average of 20 energy per cent. The Nether- lands Food Composition Table (the 'NEVO' table) does not yet present sufficient infor- mation with regard to the content of fish-derived fatty acids to allow the averageintake of these nutrients to be calculated on the basis of the general food consump-tion surveys. Accordingly, the best substitution method appears to be an assessmentof the frequenc yof fish consumption compared to the recommendations in this regard .(See the section on 'Foods' above). OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 69Dietary fibre, monosaccharides and disaccharides The reduction in the consumption of bread, potatoes, fruit and vegetables renders it ever more difficult to achieve the recommended intake of dietary fibre. The average intake of dietary fibre is 2.3 grams per megajoule energy, which is somewhat belowthe recommended level of 3 grams per megajoule .In 1998, 17% of responden tsmet the guideline in this regard (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). The World Health Organization uses the term 'free sugars' (as in table 2.1 )to refer to all mono -and disaccharides (shor t-chain carbohydrates) which are added to products bythe producer, cook or consumer, together with sugars derived from honey, syrups and fruit juices. No consumption statistics are available for these sugars. The overall quan tityof mono -and disaccharides in the Dutch diet is approximately 23 energ yper cent (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). Vitamins and minerals The intake of vitamins B6and C rose between 1988 and 1998. However, intake of most micronutrients (vitamins A, E, D and B12,folic acid and the mineral iron) fell, while that of calcium remained unaltered. The reduction in the intake of vitamins A and D is partly due to the reduction in the use of spreads and cooking fats, the reduction in the consumption of liver (and liver product s), and the shift from the consumption of full- fat milk (product s) to that of semi-skimmed, skimmed and fat-reduced alternatives (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). The intake of folic acid and \u00df-carotene fell during the period 1988-1998 due to the reduction in the consumption of veget ables (G ezondheidsra ad,2002). Studies of folic acid status reveal that, from the perspective of optimal homocysteine levels, at least 60% of adults had a suboptimal status during this period (Brussaard et al., 1997a). The average intake of iron, which was already lower than the recommended level in1988, particularly among women of childbearing age, fell yet further during the ensu-ing ten years (G ezondheidsraad, 2002). However, studies of the iron status among adult sduring the period 1990-1993 do not indicate any widespread nutritional inade- quac y(Brussa ard et al., 1997b).2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 70Table 2.4: Average intake of fat and various fatty acids by Dutch men and women aged 20 and above, in energy per cent (en%). Recommended level Men Women Total fat 20-30/35 (*) 36,6 37,0 Saturated fatty acids < data 1998; recommenda- tions: Gezondheidsraad 2001. (*) The upper limit is for overweight individuals or for those exhibiting an undesirable weight increase; for others, the upper limit for total fat is 40 en% and for unsaturated fatty acids, 38 en% (Gezondheidsraad, 2001). The relevance of the low intake levels of the other micronutrients can only be deter- mined by specific research into nutritional status. At present, too little information isavailable. The average intake of sodium can only be effectively determined by measuring thesodium levels in 24-hour urine. In 2000, the Health Council estimated the sodiumintake of Dutch adults to be an average of 3.7 grams per day, based on the results ofthe 'Intersalt' study and other, less extensive, recent studies (Gezondheidsraad, 2000a).Data on 190 adult subjects (male and female) derived from the Dutch part of the EPICcalibration study (1995-1997), indicate a slightly higher average intake of 3.9 grams per day. This corresponds to an average table salt consumption of 9-10 grams per day. The Guidelines for Good Nutrition recommend that individual consumption of table salt should not exceed 9 grams per day. Alcohol Based on sales figures for the year 2001, Dutch adults consume an average of 8.1 litres of alcohol per annum (PGD3,2002). This figure has remained reasonably stable over the past ten years. The proportion of men who drink alcoholic beverages either regu-larly or occasionally is 92%, while 80% of women do so .Among male adult s,43% drink less than one unit of alcohol per day, the figure for women being 57%; 38% of men and 17% of women are moderate drinkers (1 to 3 units per day for men and 1-2 units forwomen) (CBS, 2000). Excessive alcohol consumption (3 or more unit sper day for men and 2 or more for women) is more prevalent among men (approximately 11%) than among women(approximately 6%). For men, excessive alcohol consumption is highest in early adult- hood ,while among women it first increases with age ,and then declines .These age - related trends have been confirmed by survey-based studies (e.g. the MORGEN project, 1992-1997) although the exten tto which questionnaires can provide reliable informa - tion regarding the propor tion of moderate and excessive drinkers remains unclear . 2.3.2 Food consumption of specific age groups Infan ts In the Netherlands ,alarge proportion of mothers commence breastfeeding immedi- ately after the birth of their baby. Since 1996, 70% or more of all mothers have doneso, a percentage which was not matched in the preceding period (Burgmeijer & Reijn-eveld, 2001; Lanting et al. ,2002). In 2002, 75% of newborn infants were exclusively breast fed.By the age of three mon ths,this figure has fallen considerably, with only 32% relying exclusively on mother-milk (whether directly from the breast or via a breast pump). At six months, the figure has fallen yet further to 17% (Lanting et al., 2003). The percentage of infants relying on breast milk on the first day of life, at threemonths and at six months shows some increase since 1997, although the figures havelevelled out in recen tyears (see figure 2.4 ).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 713Marketing Board for Distilled BeveragesDespite this trend, breastfeeding remains less prevalent in the Netherlands than in some other European countries (Breastfeeding Promotion Foundation/SZB, 2002). In Scandinavia in par ticular ,breastfeeding is more common and continues for longer. In 1999, 92% of Norwegian babies were exclusively breastfed for the first three months oflife (SZB, 1999). A summary of the health effects of breastfeeding compared to those of bottle-feeding is given in textbox 2.4 .(See also R IVM,2004). Children Information relating to the nutrition of young children aged 9, 12 and 18 mon ths has recen tly been published (Breedveld & Hulshof ,2002). When this information was com-2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 72 0102030405060708090 1953 1957 1961 1965 1969 1973 1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 1997 2001% first day of life three months sixmonthsFigure 2.4: Percentage of Dutch babies exclusively breastfed on the first day of life, at three months and at six months (1953 - 2001). There is convincing evidence that breastfeeding protects infants against a number of conditions, including infections of the middle ear (Oddy , 2001), asthma and conditions of the lower respira- tory passages (Bachrach etal., 2003). Given that all thr ee of these conditions ar ecommon, and that the risk r eduction in question is in double- digit per centages (up to 50% in recurrent middle ear infections), this is an issue of importance to public health. In addition, br eastfeeding has been shown to have a slight positive ef fect on cognitive development (Anderson et al .,1999). Moreover, there are grounds to suppose that the risk of obe-sity is lower among those who were breastfed asinfants (WHO, 2003). Breastfeeding also has afavourable health ef fect for the mother, the risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer being substantial-ly lower (Beral etal., 2002). Despite the decr easing levels of dioxins and PCBs in mother -milk (see chapter 4.3 )the pr esence of these substances remains a matter of concern, albeit minor. Another reason that breastfeedingmay not be consider ed the optimal sour ce of nutrition for babies is the risk of HIV transmission. Chapter 7 examines the balance between the pos - itive and the negative effects of breastfeeding in greater detail. The W orld Health Organization advises that babies should be exclusively br east - fed up to the age of six months in order to achieve the greatest possible health gain (WHO, 1998,2001). It also recommends monitoring the growthof breastfed children against a growth curve pub-lished for this specific purpose.Textbox 2.4: The health ef fects of breastfeeding. pared to the published nutritional standards for these age groups, the following issues were identified. Infants aged nine months have a low intake of fat, and the diet of allthree age groups has an unfavourable composition of fatty acids (the saturated fatty acids content being too high). Among the toddlers aged 18 months, iron intake wastoo low, as was that of vitamin D for those children not being given vitamin D supple-ments or follow-on milk. Because no data relating to vitamin D or iron status are avail-able, it is not possible to state whether the children concerned suffer from any actualdeficiency of these micronutrients. Teenagers Overall, the food consumption of young people developed along the same lines as those of the general population during the period 1988-1998, but the adverse trendswere more marked. In particular, there was an above-average reduction in the con- sumption of bread and vegetables. Although the overall consumption of alcoholicbeverages declined during the period in question, consumption by 13 to 18-year-oldsrose. The increase was particularly marked among young males, being 86%. Teenagers and adolescen ts'intake of vitamin A was lower than the recommended level. However, in the absence of data relating to the vitamin A status, the significance of this finding is unclear (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). The elderly In general, elderly persons living independently have an adequate intake of fruit and vegetables, but their intake of fats is not in line with the recommendations, particu- larly with regard to the fat tyacid composition .The average in take of micronutrien ts is adequate, except for that of vitamin D (Anon., 1998). Based on food consumption sur veys,it can be concluded that the average energ y intake of elderly persons living independently is adequate, except in the case of a few specific sub-groups. Among those aged 75 and above, 32% of women and 10% of men were found to have an energy intake of less than 6.3 MJ per day (De Groot et al. ,1999). This corresponds to a low energy requirement due to limited physical activity, and a low resting met abolism. Given a daily diet in line with this low energy requirement, it becomes difficult to obt ain sufficient nutrients (Voedingsraad, 1995). As the elderly become more dependent on care, so they expend less energy. Among institutionalizedelderly women, the average intake of the vitamins A, B 1,B6,C, D, and E is below the recommended daily level, as is that of calcium (Mathey, 2000; Wouters-Wesseling et al., 2002). Dat arelating to men in the same situation is limited ,but poin tsin the same direction. This is a serious situation, especially if it continues for a long period of time. Aninadequate micronutrient status is frequently found among frail elderly persons and those in residential care. The proportion of women over 80 who have an inade-quate vit amin D status is estimated to be 65% (Ooms, 1994). Low values of the vitamins B 6,B12and folic acid are also of ten found among seniors. It is simply impossible for many people over 75 to acquire sufficien tvitamin D and vitamin B12through theirOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 73regular diet. Suppletion of vitamin D is therefore recommended for women aged 50 and above, and for men aged 60 and above (Voedingscentrum, 2003), while that ofvitamin B 12isrecommended for all seniors with a low vitamin B12status (Gezondheid- sraad, 2003b; see also RIVM, 2004). 2.3.3 Food consumption among the lower socio-economic and ethnic groups Lower socio-economic status groups In dietary surveys, persons with a lower socio-economic status reported having a higher consumption of potatoes, meat and meat products, visible fats, coffee and (formen) soft drinks than those in the higher socio-economic groups. On the other hand, consumption of vegetables, cheese and alcohol was greater in the higher socio-eco-nomic groups (Hulshof et al. ,2003). The intake of dietary fibre and most micronutrients was found to be slightly less favourable among the lower socio -economic groups (see table 2.5 ). However ,one notable exception is the fat-soluble vitamins. The fat intake of the lower socio-eco- nomic groups was slightly higher than that of the higher groups, except in the case ofsaturated fatty acids. In general, the diet of the lower socio-economic groups fell short of the recommended nutritional st andards more of ten than that of higher socio- economic groups (Hulshof et al., 2003). Ethnic groups Although information relating to the diet and nutrition of ethnic groups is scant, that which does exist sug geststhat the intake of macronutrients, particularly in terms of fattyacids ,is more favourable among the T urkish ,Moroccan and Surinamese commu- nities in the Netherlands than among the 'native' Dutch population (Van Leest et al. , 2002; Brussaard et al., 1999). However, the Turkish and Moroccan communities have a lower average intake of many vitamins and minerals (Brussaard et al. ,1999).

High SES Average SES Low SES Very low SES Energy Source :Hulshof et al., 2003.form trends are to be observed across the board of the various ethnic groups in the Netherlands. Further research into their food consumption and nutritional status isrequired to confirm and elaborate these findings. 2.4 Potential health gain through improvements to the diet W.M.M. Verschuren, R.T. Hoogenveen, P.G.N. Kramers, D. Kromhout, M.C. Ock\u00e9 Earlier in this chapter, we considered the relationship between certain dietary compo- nents and six common diseases. Information about the food consumption of theDutch population was then given. By combining these two aspects, it becomes possi- ble to estimate the health loss currently suffered by the Dutch due to a sub-optimaldiet. At the same time this gives an indication of the maximum potential health gainwhich can be achieved through improvements to the diet. The effect sonpublic health have been calculated for five diet aryfactors ,both individ- ually and in combination. They are: saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, fish (as a source of n-3 fatty acids), fruit and vegetables. A large proportion of the Dutch popu-lation fails to meet the recommended consumption levels for each of these dietary factors (see section 2.3 ). There is firm evidence to indicate that these factors are associ - ated with certain forms of cardiovascular diseases and/or cancer (see section 2.2 ). The current health loss due to overweight has been calculated separately. The effects of alcohol consumption on public health are calculated in chapter 7, in which the poten - tial health gain through dietary inventions is compared with that which may be achieved through in terventions targeting other lifestyle factors. The effects of the five dietary factors and of overweight have been calculated for vari- ous forms of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes, as shown in the second column of table 2.6 .Each of these diseases has been shown to have a clear relationship with one of the five dietary factors or with overweight. For each of these relationships, the relative risk (RR ,as derived from the literature) has been used as the basis of the calculations .Afull list of the RRs by risk factor category, age range and gender is given in appendix 12 ,with sources stated. Health loss and health gain in three scenarios First of all ,wehave calculated the health loss that can ,in theor y, be at tributed to the current sub-optimal dietary pattern and body weight of the Dutch population. This is the same as the health gain that could be theoretically achieved were everyone imme-diately to achieve the recommended weight and adopt the various other recommen-dations with regard to diet. Clearly, this cannot be realized in practice. Accordingly,we have also calculated the health gain that can be achieved through those in terven- tions which are indeed considered feasible ,based on the results of several small-scale experimen ts. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 75All calculations rely on comparisons. The current health loss is calculated by compar- ing the actual situation today with the hypothetical situation in which everyone com- plies with the recommendations for a healthy diet. The more realistic health gain iscalculated by comparing the current situation with one in which the effects of theinterventions considered feasible are simulated. The three situations are termed 'sce-narios'. The 'reference' scenario represents the current situation. The 'maximum' (or'Utopian') scenario represents the situation in which everyone meets the dietary re-commendations, and the 'middle' scenario which falls between the two, is considered to be an attainable scenario in practice. Definition of the scenarios In technical terms, the scenarios have been defined for each risk factor as the division of the total population into between three and five categories according to intake ofthe five dietary factors or BMI value. In the maximum scenario, everyone thereforefalls into the 'most favourable' category, while in the middle scenario, those who have not yet achieved the most favourable category move up one category (towards mostfavourable) in comparison to the reference scenario (a more det ailed explanation is provided in appendix 12 ). Table 2.6 presents a summary of this, using average values. The third and fourth column show the reference and maximum scenarios respective-ly. The middle scenario in column 5 presents a distribution which lies between the two,as deemed feasible on the basis of documented (usually small-scale) interven- tions. For saturated fat ,fruit and veget ables ,this feasible situation is reasonably in line with the actual changes achieved in intervention studies (Ammerman et al., 2002). These interventions were small-scale and involved various strategies and populations. In the case of saturated fat tyacids ,the greatest reductions were seen among the risk popu - lations. Successful approaches included working in small groups and working towards firm, quantifiable objectives. In the case of fruit-and-vegetable interventions, the number of studies which quantify the changes achieved (n=12) is not enough to iden- tify the successful interventions. In the case of trans fatty acids, the reduction in con- sumption seems feasible ,given the ongoing efforts to reduce or eliminate the trans fat content of industrially produced pastries and fried products (Gezondheidsraad, 2002). No relevant intervention studies have been conducted with regard to the consump-tion of fish, but it is assumed that an increase in the frequency of consumption on thepart of those who do not currently eat fish weekly is possible (whereby they will in future do so once or even t wice a week). Finally, in the case of B MI,the middle sce - nario assumes that everyone will be able to shed 1 kg/m 2,being an average of approx- imately 3 kg per person. Although this weight loss is considered feasible on the basisof successful intervention studies (Lean, 2000), it nevertheless seems somewhat 'Utopi-an' given the current weight trends within the Dutch population. In every case, thescenarios are based on the premise that the small -scale successes achieved can be extrapolated to the population as a whole .2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 76If we compare the choices for the middle scenario ,as based on the literature ,with the policy objectives stated in the Ministry of Health's policy document Langer gezond leven ('A longer life in good health', VWS, 2003), we see that the objectives with regard to the consumption of saturated and trans fatty acids in 2010 are in line with the cur- rent recommended levels and hence more ambitious than the levels on which the middle scenario is based .The reverse holds true of the BMI targets, for which policy 'merely' aims to halt the trend towards overweight (see chapter 3 ). Three calculation methods Three types of calculation have been made, giving rise to the following results: The directly at tribut able health loss ,per annum ,in terms of disease ,death and DALYs. The cumulative health loss over 20 years. This simulation of the development in disease and death over a longer period provides a more realistic picture than the'directly attributable' method, and can therefore serve to confirm or elaborate theoutcome thus achieved. The effect in terms of life expect ancy and disease-free life expectancy. This simu- lates the overall effect throughout the en tire lifetime, taking the substitute causes of death in to accoun t.

In the case of the 20-year cumulative health loss and life expectancy methods, a dynamic calcula- tion model has been used: the RIVM's 'Chronic Diseases Model'. For the dietary fac- tors, it is assumed that the proportion of the population falling into each of the risk factor categories will remain const ant during the period considered by the model. For BMI, age-related changes are accounted for in the model. Abrief explanation of the three calculation methods is given in textbox 2.5 ,with a more comprehensive account of the methodologies, model calculations and scenario assumptions included in appendix 12 ,along with det ailed outcomes .Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 present the main findings. 2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 78Textbox 2.5: Summary of the three methods used to calculate health loss. (See also appendix 12 ) Directly attributable annual health loss. This can be illustrated using an example in which it isknown that the consumption of fish once a weekwill reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by25%, compared to the situation in which fish iseaten less than once a week (the relative risk, RR,is thus 0.75). If the number of people who eat toolittle fish (or none at all) is also known, it becomespossible to calculate which fraction of the currentincidence of cardiovascular diseases is attribut-able to low fish consumption (the population-attributable risk, or PAR), and hence the incidencewhich can theoretically be avoided by greaterconsumption of fish. In the tables and figures, thecalculated health loss for adults aged 20 andabove is expressed as the number of new casesof disease, the number of deaths, and the numberof DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years), wherebydeath and disease, the latter weighed in ter ms of severity and duration, are combined. The cumulative health loss over a period of 20 years .This calculation relies on the RIVM's 'Chronic Diseases Model', which calculates inyearly stages the number of people, for example,who eat fish, develop cardiovascular diseasesand eventually die. The outcomes in ter ms of dis - ease and death are determined by the input distri- bution of fish-eaters, by the likelihood of develop-ing cardiovascular diseases in the next annual'step' in relation to the consumption of fish, etc. The calculated risk of disease is based on thesame RRs as in the previous method. This model-based approach is more realistic than the directlyattributable approach in that it takes delay andsubstitution effects into account, where delayrefers to the fact that people may be spared car-diovascular diseases due to higher fish consump-tion in the earlier phases, but will go on to developit at a later stage. Substitution refers to the factthat these 'spared' people will live longer but maydevelop some other form of disease and will even-tually die of another cause. The original modelcalculation was based on a cohort of subjectsrepresenting the demographic composition of the Dutch population aged 20 and above, with lifecareer over 20 years being simulated. The ef fects on life expectancy. Effects in terms of life expectancy were also calculated using the RIVM' sChronic Diseases Model. The results of all effects and interactions on the overall life car eer of a cohort of 40-year-old subjects are projected, whereby the effect of the substitution disease isassumed to be far gr eater than in the 20-year approach. In addition to the life expectancy, the disease-fr ee life expectancy is calculated by sub - tracting the number of years during which a per- son suffers from one of the modelled diseasesfrom the total life expectancy.2.4.1 Current health loss in the Dutch population: the maximum scenario Directly attributable health loss Figure 2.5 presents the health loss accounted for by each of the five dietary factors (individually and in combination) and by overweight (BMI) in the maximum scenario,as compared to the reference scenario. The effect of overweight has not been includedin the combined calculation since there is a relation between diet and BMI. Figure 2.5 presents the death rate and incidence (absolute number of cases) of disease, catego- rized for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Of the dietary factors, the greatest number of deaths and cases of disease are attribut- able to inadequate consumption of fish and fruit. The effect of overweight is compara- ble to the combined effect of the dietary factors in terms of disease (both approxi-mately 40,000), but approximately half in terms of deaths (approximately 7,000compared to 13,000). The DALY values ( table 2.7 )combine the incidence of disease with the death rate. Here too, the combined effect of the five dietary factors exceedsthat of over weight. These figures are used in section 7.5 to arrive at comparisons with other causes of death and disease. When we compare the three categories of disease ( figure 2.5 ), we see that the health loss due to cardiovascular diseases is many times greater than that caused by cancer . This is true of the five dietary factors in combination (incidence 14 times greater anddeaths 5 times greater), as well as for BMI (7 and 4 times greater respectively). Dia- betes is influenced only by B MI.With regard to incidence ,the health loss is higher than for cardiovascular diseases but the death rate is lower due to the limited fatality of diabetes .Cardiovascular diseases has been approximated to accoun tfor 38,000 cases of disease and 10,500 deaths ,being 25% of the tot al in each case .BMIhas an effect on all three categories of disease. In the case of diabetes, approximately 50% of the total incidence and of all deaths may be attributable to overweight. Finally, it is noticeable that the difference between the incidence and the death rate from cancer is much smaller than in the other two categories. This reflects the higher fatality of most forms of cancer . It should be noted that the evidence of the effects attributable to the dietary factors is of varying weight, whereby the results are subject to a varying degree of uncertainty.This uncertainty is greater with regard to the relative risks for fruit and vegetables than for the fat tyacids .The uncer tainty in the relative risks for overweight lies some- where in the middle. The differences are due to the varying research methods employed by the relevant studies: prospective observational studies with question-naire-derived data for fruit and vegetables, the same type of study supplemented byheight and weight measurements for BMI, and intervention studies (with risk factorsand disease incidence as outcome indicators) for fat ty acids. The relationship between fruit consumption and breast cancer is not endorsed by all exper tgroups (see section 2.2). If the supposed relationship is discoun ted,the health loss attributable to addi-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 79tional cancer cases falls by approximately one third and the death rate from cancer by approximately one fifth. However, the reduction in the total death rate due to inade-quate consumption of fruit is less than 10%. The statistics presented here may differ from those of previous publications due to the use of more recen tresearch findings .For example, the Public Health Status and Fore- cast repor tof 2002 concluded that almost 5% of all deaths may be at tribut able to excess intake of saturated fatty acids (Van Oers, 2002). The much lower figure of 1% used in this report is due to the use of more accurate age-specific relative risks. More- over, the results shown in table 2.7 are not directly comparable to the data previously published in the report \"Enkele belangrijke ontwikkelingen in de voedselconsumptie\" (Some impor tant food consumption, Gezondheidsraad, 2002) since this repor tfocused on a specific population group: young adults of lower socio-eco- nomic status .The 2002 Public Health Status and Forecast report put the contribution of inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption to the overall death rate at almost 5%.This is comparable to the current estimate, which is based on more recent data (IARC, 2003). In the 2004 repor tpublished by the Dutch Cancer Societ y(KWF) it is estimated that 2,000 new cases of cancer each year are attributable to overweight. This figure corresponds well with the estimate presented here. Rougoor et al.(2003) arrive at an estimate of 23,000 deaths per year due to the effect of diet. This figure differs some-what from those offered in the current report (13,000 deaths due to dietary composi-tion and 7,000 to over weight, which cannot be totalled due to partial overlap) because Rougoor used the higher Public Health St atus and Forecasts figures for satu- rated fat s,did not allow for the effect of trans fattyacids and fish consumption, and2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 80 051015202530354045 x1,000 dietary factors IM IM IM IM IM IMFigure 2.5: Calculated health loss due to the consumption of various fatty acids, fruit and veg- etables (individually and in combination) and body weight not being in line with recommenda - tions: number of cases of disease (incidence) or death directly attributable on one-year basis.included a proportion of the deaths due to high blood pressure and cholesterol. Because these are intermediary factors, the total of 23,000 could well be an overesti-mate. The cumulative health loss over a period of 20 years As previously stated, the 20-year modelling differs from the directly-attributable cal- culation model in that it takes the substitute causes of death into account. Reducingthe effect of one particular cause of death will result in a higher prevalence of othercauses, and vice versa .If we compare the cumulative 20-years effects with the directly attributable effects (see appendix 12 )we find that the figures for the incidence of dis- eases are some 20 times greater, but those for deaths are in the order of 10 to 15 times greater (see figure 2.6 ). This provides an understanding of how the model works. First- ly, time delay plays a part. In the directly-attributable calculation on a one-year basis, the mortality is calculated as immediately occurring; in the 20-years projection, deathoccurs only after a variable number of years of illness. That the 20-years incidence ismore than 20 times the annual figure reflects the increasing age of the modelled cohort. Afurther aspect is the occurrence of ,for inst ance ,cardiovascular diseases as a compli- cation of diabetes. The one-year calculation includes only the direct associations, and not this type of secondary complication. In the 20-year calculation, the shift in theincidence of diabetes over a longer period also influences the incidence of cardiovas- cular diseases and related deaths . Calculated over a 20-year period, the effect on the death rate is therefore proportion- ally smaller than in the directly -attribut able calculation model .Accordingly, the con -OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 81Figure 2.6: Calculated health loss through death, due to the consumption of five dietary factors and body weight not being in line with the recommendations; comparison of directly-attribut - able deaths with the cumulative death rate over twenty years (divided by 20; '20 y'). 02468101214 mortality x 1,000 factors combinedoverweight fish fruit vegetablestribution of the dietary composition (five dietary factors) and that of the BMI to the total death rate falls in the 20-years model, to approximately 5% and 2,5% respectively(see figure 2.6 ).Although the results for the 20-years cumulative effect are more diffi- cult to interpret, they do provide a better approximation of the actual situation thanthe directly-attributable method. The 20-years calculations introduce 'light and shade'into the directly-attributable method, but also support the results thus derived withregard to the extent of the effects. The effect on life expectancy When we consider health loss over an even longer period, i.e. that of total life expectancy, the aspects of substitute causes of death and the cumulative ('stacked') effects play an even greater role (see table 2.7 ). The largest reductions in life expectan- cy are attributable to dietary factors in combination (1.2 years) and overweight (0.8 years). Of the individual dietary factors, inadequate consumption of fruit (0.5 years)and fish (0.3 years) can once again be seen to have the greatest effect. The loss of 1.2years' life expectancy due to dietary factors may not seem spectacular compared to the 13,000 deaths thus caused. However, the death rate quoted is less than 10% of thenumber of deaths each year .Life expect ancyis calculated on the basis of the tot al number of deaths, whereby substantial variations would be required to bring about even a minor difference in life expectancy. The loss of disease-free years is in all caseslarger than the reduction in life expectancy (see table 2.7 ).This can best be under- stood by realizing that the health loss is also the health gain that can ,in theor y, be achieved by effective dietary interventions. If life expectancy (calculated from the ageof 40) increases by 1.2 years, the disease-free life expectancy increases by 2 years (see table 2.7 ). In other words ,healthier eating habit spostpone disease longer than they postpone death. However, this apparent 'compression of morbidity' is, at least in part, aconsequence of the modelling technique :the postponed deaths includes all causes of death (some of which are not influenced by nutrition), whereas the postponed mor - bidity only refers to the diseases included in the model.2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 82Table 2.7: Calculated effect in D ALYsper year for adults aged 20 and above, and effect on life expectancy and disease-free life expectancy for 40-year-olds, under the maximum and middle scenario .

In theory,this loss is also the gain that can be achieved through interventions addressing thefive dietary factors and overweight (the 'maximum' scenario). However, experienceshows that it would be unrealistic to expect that everyone would comply with therecommendations within the foreseeable future, even if substantial investments aremade. Accordingly, a realistic 'middle' scenario has been produced, representing the health gain to be made by the interventions which are thought feasible, and which have proven themselves to be so during small-scale trials. Table 2.7 presents selected key figures and figure 2.7 shows the results in terms of new cases of disease under the middle scenario, in a direct comparison with the maximumscenario. As may be seen from figure 2.7 ,the outcomes for the dietary factors in the middle scenario are some 1.5 to 2.5 times smaller than in the maximum scenario. In the case of overweight, the reduction is more than four times. In terms of deaths, thereductions are comparable (see t ables in appendix 12 ). The reduction in cardiovascular diseases which could be achieved by addressing all dietary factors in combination is 13-14% in the middle scenario (compared to approximately 25% in the maximum sce-nario), with 5% to 6% only by increasing the consumption of fish. Interventions target- ing B MIwould yield a 50% reduction in diabetes under the maximum scenario; in the middle scenario this figure falls to approximately 11%. Accordingly, the reduction inthe total death rate which could be achieved through dietary interventions falls fromOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 83Figure 2.7: Calculated health gain for five dietary factors and overweight, by new cases of dis- ease (incidence), directly attributable on a one-year basis: the maximum scenario (in whicheveryone complies with the recommendations) compared to the middle scenario (interventionsconsidered feasible). 051015202530354045 incidence x 1,000 max= maximum scenario; mid = middle scenariomax mid max mid max mid max mid max mid max mid max mid Diabetes Cardiovascular diseases Cancersaturated fatty acidstrans fatty acidsfive dietary factors combinedoverweight fish fruit vegetables10% in the maximum scenario to approximately 5% in the middle scenario, while that of interventions addressing overweight falls from 5% to 1%. It would seem that thehealth loss due to the current prevalence of overweight will be more difficult to 'reclaim' than that caused by dietary factors. Overweight must be regarded as a special case, since in practice its prevalence is expected to increase while policy strives for a stabilization. However, it is reasonableto expect that the health gain to be achieved through the realistic scenario presentedhere (weight reduction of one BMI unit, being approximately three kilograms, rather than a stabilization), will be broadly equivalent to the health gain achieved by stabiliz- ing weight rather than allowing a further increase of one BMI unit. In general, the same reductions in the effects (compared to the maximum scenario) are to be seen in the cumulative calculations over a 20-year period. While in the maximumscenario deaths attributable to the five dietary factors in combination fall by 5% andthose attributable to BMI by 3%, the figures fall to approximately 2% and less than 1% in the middle scenario. Nevertheless, the 20-years model shows a 14% reduction in the inci-dence of diabetes and a 3% reduction in that of cardiovascular diseases (almost 140,000 cases each). For these and other figures, please refer to the tables in appendix 12 . The effect in terms of life expectancy is also halved in the middle scenario, to 0.6 years in the case of diet arycomposition (all five factors in combination) and 0.3 years for BMI. Half of the additional life term will be spent in good health. The curren ttrends have not been t aken in to accoun tin these middle scenarios .As previously stated, improvements can now be seen in the consumption of saturated and trans fattyacids and fish consumption, while the situation is worsening in terms of the consumption of fruit and veget ables and with respect to over weight. If these trends continue, it is reasonable to assume that the health gain calculated for the pos-itive trends (0.3 years additional life expectancy; see table 2.7 )will indeed be achieved, but will be offset by negative developments (loss of 0.3 years due to inadequate con- sumption of fruit and vegetables and 0.3 years due to overweight, with some overlap rendering it inappropriate to add these figures together). If all other factors remain const ant, life expectancy would then fall. Arecent study examining policy objectives with regard to overweight chose to adopt different scenarios to those used in this report (Bemelmans et al., 2004). However, insofar as the result sare directly comparable ,they presen taconsisten tpicture . Conclusion: realistic health gain through dietary and body weight interventions Taking all factors into account, we conclude that substantial health gains can be made through dietary interventions which are considered feasible. For example, therewould be over 20,000 fewer cases of cardiovascular diseases each year .Similarly, inter- ventions addressing body weight would result in almost 5,000 fewer new cases of dia- betes each year and 4,000 fewer cases of cardiovascular disease .Seen over a longer2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 84period, this would result in a limited gain in terms of mortality and life expectancy, due to the substitution effect of other causes of death. Of the possible dietary inter-ventions, those targeting consumption of fish and fruit will have the greatest effect. By means of the feasible interventions in these areas, approximately half of the healthloss due to unfavourable dietary composition can be reversed (See section 4.2.1 ). The formulated BMI intervention will offset only a quarter of the health loss that wouldotherwise be experienced. Given the principles adopted, overweight is therefore likelyto prove a more stubborn problem than a sub-optimal choice of food. 2.5 Options for dietary interventions H. Verkleij, C.F. van Kreijl # As previously stated in section 2.4 ,substantial health gains can be achieved through attention to diet and good nutrition. Moreover, various unfavourable trends in food consumption and the increasing average body weight also compel to interventions inorder to preven tfurther health loss . Chapter 1 (figure 1.2 )demonstrates that our diet is the result of the food supply (physical environment) and eating behaviour (lifestyle). Interventions must therefore be in line with the current available knowledge aboutthese determinants of food intake. The underlying theory and mechanisms of eating behaviour are explained in greater det ail in chapter 8 ,which also examines the ele - ments of risk perception in relation to food safety. This section focuses on the applica-tion of this knowledge in terms of dietary practice, with particular reference to inter- ventions t argeting the environmen tal and personal factors . 2.5.1 Food supply and other en vironmental factors Recent decades have seen an enormous growth in the food supply, both in terms of the variety of foods available and in the number of sales outlets. At the same time, the consumer's purchasing power has increased. The assortment of foods offered by the local supermarket ,staff restaurant or school canteen will have a clear influence on the consumer 's choice. The availability and accessibility of foods is an important determi- nant of eating behaviour. The obesogenic environment as an important cause of the increase in overweight The increase in the prevalence of over weight and obesit yprovides a good example by which the role of environmental factors can be explained. The main cause of this increase is that Dutch people now engage in less physical activity and, at the sametime, eat too much and the 'wrong' type of foods. The World Health Organization(2003) cites four factors with convincing, or extremely plausible, evidence that theyhelp to foster over weight and obesity. Alongside a sedentary lifestyle and high con-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 85#With con tributions by Staveren, C. Thijssumption of energy-dense food products, the WHO points to the extensive advertising campaigns for energy-dense foods and the high number of sales outlets offering con-venience food. In its report on obesity, the Health Council of the Netherlands also states that, along- side the individual factors, environmental factors are likely to be of great importance inthe development and maintenance of overweight in both adults and children (Gezond-heidsraad, 2003a). Obvious examples of such environmental factors include the habit ofwatching television or playing computer games (which not only represent a particular- ly inactive lifestyle but also encourage the consumption of snacks). Other examples are vending machines and school canteens, which supply high-energy soft drinks and snacks, and fast-food restaurants offering 'super-sized' portions. Intrusive televisioncommercials promote drinks and snacks with a high sugar and/or fat content. Each year in the Netherlands, some 40 million euros are spent on television advertise- ments which specifically target children (including those for non-food products). Approximately 70% of the advertising between children's programmes is for candy,snacks and sof tdrinks (G ezondheidsra ad,2003a). But do such commercials actually influence the eating behaviour? The Health Council cites controlled and randomized American research which suggests that television advertising strongly influences thepreferences of young children, prompting them to favour the energy-dense snacks and sof tdrinks thus promoted .It has long been known that this type of advertising has a clear effect on parents' purchasing habits and on children's energy intake(Gezondheidsraad, 2003a). Textbox 2.6 provides an account of the extent and influ- ence of food product sadver tising aimed at children in Australia . Based on the findings of the WH O, the Health Council and the Netherlands Council for Public Health and Health Care (R VZ,2002), it is reasonable to conclude that2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 86Textbox 2.6: Food adver to Childr en' has examined a number of studies car - ried out in both Australia and New Zealand over the past ten years. Among the conclusions whichemer ge ar e: -In Australia, television is the main medium by which the food industr yand fast-food chains attempt to reach children. Australian childrenaged 5 to 12 watch an average of two-and-a-halfhours of television per day, of which over fiftyminutes could be advertising. Commercials forcandy (confectioner y) and fast-food r estaurants are broadcast three times more frequently during children's programming than at other times of theday. During children's programming, an averageof 26 commercials per hour are broadcast, onethirdof which are for food products. Of the food advertisements, an average of 72% are for prod-ucts with high ener gy density and low nutritional value. Chocolate, other confectioner y,sweetened breakfast cereals and fast-food restaurants are dominant on the list of food commercials. -Other studies r eveal that childr en in families who regularly watch television during mealtimes arelikely to consume more of the advertised 'unhealthy' products (pizza, savoury snacks, softdrinks) and less fruit and vegetables. Childrenwho spend more time watching television are alsolikely to weigh more than their counterparts whospend less time doing so. The coalition therefore concludes that the contentof televised food advertising in Australia is almostdiametrically opposed to the government's mes-sage on healthy diet and good nutrition. Sour ce: Mehta, 2002.attempts to prevent overweight and obesity by means of behavioural change will be doomed to failure without corresponding modification of this obesogenic environ-ment. Accordingly, strategies must be sought whereby people are not required to make a conscious decision to take more exercise or to eat less. The Health Council hasnot been afraid to propose some far-reaching measures, such as banning motorizedtraffic from city centres in order to encourage walking and cycling, or implementingagradual reduction in the energy value of processed foods (Gezondheidsraad, 2003a). Positive trend in fatty acid consumption due to improved product composition Asecond example of the influence of environmental factors is the reduction in the consumption of saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids. The reduction in intake of saturated fatty acids, albeit limited, is attributed to the modifications made to the fatcontent and fatty acid composition of food products, with greater availability of fat- reduced ('light') versions, skimmed and semi-skimmed dairy products and productswith improved fatty acid composition. Large groups of consumers have subsequentlybeen prompted to purchase such products by advertising, low prices and health edu- cation messages. The substantial reduction in the consumption of trans fatty acids is largely due to the reduced con tentof these fat tyacids in foods, and particularly in spreads and cooking fats (see also section 2.3 ). A further reduction of the trans fatty acid content of biscuits, bakery products and pre-prepared fried foods in particularwould achieve yet further health gains (Kraak, 2004). The food-processing industry has under taken to modify the fatty acid composition of many products, partly on its own initiative and partly as a response to the recommendations made or endorsed bythe government. Trend towards convenience foods displaces fruit and vegetables Athird example of environmen tal factors may be seen in the reduced consumption of fruit and veget ables .In recen tdecades ,afar greater range of fruit and veget ables has become available in our shops. While many varieties were once seasonal, modern transport and storage technology enables them to be imported from abroad and made available all year round. Nevertheless, the consumption of fruit and vegetables in the Netherlands is falling. This may be due in part to the increasing demand for convenience foods :products which are easy to carry, to store, to prepare and to eat. Convenience foods ,such as ready-to-eat meals generally have a low vegetable con- tent. The increase in the consumption of rice and pasta products as the main meal ofthe day also plays a role, since these meals generally contain less vegetables than thetraditional evening meal with potatoes . Modifications to product composition could help to obtain greater consumption of fruit and vegetables. For example, it would be possible to include a higher (high-fibre)vegetable content in certain convenience foods, such as pizzas. It is possible thatlower prices would also prove an effective method of encouraging consumers to eatmore fruit and veget ables. In 2003, Dutch households with a lower income were twice as likely to economize on food ,beverages and tobacco than those with a higher income (CB S, 2003). It is known that the consumption of fruit and veget ables is higherOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 87inthose countries in which these items are cheaper, such as the Mediterranean coun- tries. Bol et al. (2004) state that the reform of European Union agricultural subsidies must be conducted in such a way as to ensure that fruit and vegetables do not become disproportionately expensive. Making the healthy choice the easy choice To summarize: environmental interventions can encourage a healthy choice of food and diet. Such interventions could include ensuring the wide availability of affordablehealthy food products, and raising the profile of those products to promote recogniz- ability. The further encouragement of product modification provides a promising principle for policy and indeed has already accounted for important health gains. Other principles may include pricing policy and control of advertising. The settings in which successful environmental interventions can be implemented include the school, workplace, family, neighbourhood, youth health and welfare ser-vices, and first-line health services. The interventions will require cooperation on the part of the food processing and advertising industries, supermarkets, staff restaurantsand school can teens .Given that lack of physical exercise is another impor tant cause of overweight, principles for policy also exist in the cooperation with other sectors, such as the transport, computer games and infrastructure sectors. 2.5.2 Interventions targeting personal factors Making healthy food more readily available and accessible is one side of the equation . The consumer's cooperation is also required. After all, in most cases it is the consumer who must actually adopt the healthy options .Alongside the environmen tal factors discussed in the preceding section ,our eating behaviour is determined by numerous personal factors: intentions, thoughts, ideas, feelings and perceptions. The behaviour-al intention is the most direct determinant and is in turn determined by attitude, norms, awareness and knowledge with regard to diet and nutrition. A realization of one's own abilities and the opportunities to adopt or change a certain behaviour also play a par t. Health considerations actually play a relatively minor role, except in the case of foods which are perceived to be par ticularly unsafe, or when the individual is prompted to think more about his or her own health. This is why young mothers andthe elderly are inclined to be more interested in a healthy diet. Intervention strategies designed to bring about permanen tchange in eating behav - iour must take these and other personal factors into account (see table 8.1 in chapter 8). Attempts to alter attitude will be primarily concerned with the expected advan- tages and disadvantages of certain food products (flavour, ease of preparation, cost,current habits), which can vary from one demographic group to another. Making 'thehealthy choice the easy choice ', for instance by clearly labelling the healthy products, can help to enhance oppor tunities for behavioural control. Similarly, raising con- sumer awareness is impor tant: many people have a tendency to underestimate their2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 88actual food consumption. The target group's own social network and social environ- ment will provide the best avenue of approach for interventions targeting personalfactors, perhaps through everyday role models and peer instruction. Discouraging fat consumption requires a different approach to promoting fruit and vegetables There is a relatively large body of research into the personal determinants of fat con- sumption and fat reduction (Baranowski et al., 1999; Brug, 2000). One important bar- rier to the adoption of a diet with less fat is the lack of awareness regarding the fat content of one's current diet (Brug & Van Assema, 2001). Expectations with regard to taste, cost and ease of preparation also account for negative attitudes towards fat reduction. A tailor-made dietary advice with regard to fat may raise people's aware-ness of their own consumption and, allowing for attitudes and perceived behavioural control, may encourage a reduction (Brug et al., 2003). Interventions to encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables must take into account the fact that many people do not find the taste of many vegetables particular-ly appealing ,being an acquired t aste which some find difficult to change (G lanz et al., 1998). Moreover, people who eat relatively little fruit and vegetables tend not to appreciate their positive qualities (vitamin content, digestibility), and are less aware ofwhy fruit and vegetables are considered healthy. There are also many people who seri- ously overestimate their own consumption of fruit and veget ables . Information about healthy diet can sometimes bring about radical change That eating behaviour can indeed be influenced by education and information is amply illustrated by the increase in the consumption of brown bread in the Nether- lands seen since 1960. The shif tfrom white bread to brown was due to a number of factors ,including lower price and (for some) bet ter flavour .Even more impor tantly, however, it was the result of nutritional information which placed the emphasis on the health benefits of brown bread: it is a rich source of dietary fibre and therefore improves or maintains good bowel function. The agricultural sector and food industry then fostered the development by producing proportionately more brown bread. The trend began among the higher income groups and was then ,to a lesser degree, adopted by other income groups (De Bekker ,1978). It is possible that part of this suc- cess can be attributed to the fact that the transition from white bread to brown is notsuch a great leap, and that little change to one's usual eating habits is required. 2.5.3 Interventions will vary according to target group Eating behaviour varies by age, gender and other socio-demographic factors such as socio-economic status and ethnic origin. It is therefore important to differentiatedietary interventions accordingly. The World Health Organization, for example, dis- tinguishes five age categories :the unborn child, babies and toddlers, children and adolescen ts, adults, and the elderly. The WHO calls for particular attention to be paidOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 89tothe risk factors for children (especially the environmental factors) and for adults, as it is in this group that the greatest health gains are to be made in the short term. Atthe same time, the WHO states that successful dietary interventions targeting the elderly are indeed possible, and could well lead to a considerable reduction in thelikelihood of disease (WHO, 2003). The following paragraphs present some of the spe-cific characteristics which must be borne in mind when designing dietary interven-tions addressing infants, young people, elderly people in need of care, lower socio-economic groups and ethnic minorities. Infants Various factors influence a mother's choice between breastfeeding and bottle-feed- ing. In most cases, the choice will be made even before the baby is born, perhaps evenbefore becoming pregnant. The determinants of that choice are the norms instilled by the mother's social setting and her own attitude to breastfeeding. Her main motivefor opting in favour of breastfeeding is usually the health of the child. Complicationsduring pregnancy or childbirth, anticipated practical problems, or bad experiences in the past may serve to swing the decision in favour of bottle-feeding immediately afterthe child is born . The duration of breastfeeding is primarily determined by the degree to which moth- ers believe they can cope with any problems that occur. The most common reason for discon tinuing breast feeding soon after birth is the mother's inability to produce enough milk. After three months, the main reason is the difficulty of combiningbreastfeeding and work. Obviously, breastfeeding is also more difficult when the child is being cared for elsewhere for par tof the day .Mothers with lower educational qualifications and those who smoke tend to discontinue exclusive breastfeeding soon- er than others (Burgmeijer & Reijneveld ,2001). Because the majority of Dutch mothers do begin with breastfeeding, measures designed to prolong the duration of breastfeeding offer the greatest opportunity of enhancing the level of breastfeeding in the Netherlands. This will entail helping mothers overcome the practical problems involved, the provision of successful exam- ples,and practical measures to facilitate the combination of breastfeeding and work (see also R IVM, 2004). Young people Obesity and unhealthy eating behaviour are now particularly prevalent among chil- dren (see section 2.3 ). When the child is ver yyoung ,the paren tsare the main determi - nants of behaviour. Later, this role is taken by the child's peer group: other children of the same age. Research into the success and failure factors for health interventions inother areas than nutrition suggests that a combination of interventions (such as edu-cation together with an advertising ban) is required in order to be effective. Theresearch fur ther reveals the importance of the school setting (but also that it is diffi- cult to implemen tinterventions within the educational sector). Feedback relating to the in terventions is likely to enhance their success. Active involvement of the young2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 90people themselves will also be more effective, although more labour-intensive and hence more expensive (Jansen et al., 2002). The influence of advertising, both in its traditional and newer forms, on the eating behaviour of young people is also seen as an increasingly important factor (see textbox 2.6 ). The (vulnerable) elderly The elderly, particularly those requiring full-time care, are at increased risk of a quali- tatively and quantitatively inadequate diet (see section 2.3 ). The prevention of under- nutrition in the elderly is important because they have greater difficulty in regulating their energy balance than their younger counterparts. Once the energy balance is negative, it can be difficult to rectify (Roberts et al., 1994). In order to reduce the effects of undernutrition among elderly persons in care, it is important to recognizethe risks and the causes as soon as possible, whereupon timely preventive interven- tions can be advised. It is here that the principles and opportunities for policy lie. It is important to main- tain appropriate physical activity (Chin A Paw, 1999) and to monitor the body weightof these risk groups among the elderly on a regular basis .Afirst requiremen tis there - fore that personnel in the health care sector are trained to recognize the risk factors and remain alert to the warning signs, perhaps relying in part on the simple screen-ing methods already available. The implementation of the multidisciplinary guideline 'Sensible supply of fluids and nutrition '(Anon., 2001) deserves consideration by those in the health care sector. Adequate supplements and/or fortified products developedespecially for the elderly can also greatly assist in the prevention of undernutrition (De Jong ,1999), while flavour -enhancers and a positive social environmen tduring mealtimes will also have a positive influence (Mathey, 2000; see also RIVM, 2004). Ethnic groups and the lower socio -economic groups Various ethnic groups have a high prevalence of overweight, while the lower socio- economic groups display an above-average prevalence of both overweight and other nutritional problems (see section 2.3 ). Both groups are difficult to reach with health promoting programmes intended for the Dutch general public. Moreover, the resi- dential setting of these groups is often not conducive to good health. Interventions must therefore include additional ,specific attention for these groups. Such interven- tions might include ensuring an adequate range of affordable healthy foods is avail-able in the deprived urban areas, and introducing facilities to encourage physicalactivity. The interventions targeting ethnic groups must also take into account their cultural norms and customs .In many cases ,information in the group 's own language and offered by representatives of their own culture will prove most effective (Jansen et al., 2002).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 912.5.4 The integrated approach and comparison with interventions targeting smoking According to modern views on health promotion, prevention will be more effective if the interventions are combined within an integrated approach (Gezondheidsraad,2003a; Jansen et al., 2002; Van Oers, 2002; see also chapter 8 ). An integrated approach not only addresses individuals about their behaviour, but modifies the physical andsocial environment in such a way as to support the desired behaviour to the greatestdegree possible. This type of integrated strategy may well account for the success of anti-smoking efforts in the United States, where it was decided to implement a combi- nation of health education focused on giving up smoking, pricing policy, legislation and the modification of social norms. The overall programme has involved healthcare organizations, the government, the private sector and the scientific community working together. Much can be learned from the anti-smoking interventions, but it must be remem- bered that there are important differences between smoking on the one hand, anddiet on the other .In the case of smoking ,there is a clear and unequivocal message :it is bad for the person who smokes and for others in the vicinity. In the case of diet, eat- ing is a necessary activity and, no matter how unhealthy one's diet, will not cause anydirect harm to the health of others. Accordingly, the relationship between the govern- mentand the private sector is somewhat differen t. With smoking, the government and its health interests is in direct opposition to the tobacco industry and its econom-ic interests. In diet and nutrition, however, the government needs the industry to pro- duce healthy product s,while that same governmen tmust oppose the industr y's pro - duction and sale of too many unhealthy products. In addition, the healthy diet message is more complex than the non -smoking message ,since the consumer is required to choose from a large and varied range of foods and food product s,which have both positive and adverse effects on health in varying degrees. The importantfactor is the person's overall dietary pattern: what is healthy and what is less healthy in one product will depend in part on the other components of the diet and on per- sonal health characteristics. The comparison with smoking does however show us how in tensive and creative our investments in a healthy diet must be in order to achieve the desired changes . 2.6 Summary and conclusions Overweight, in both adults and children, is a major public health problem which shows no sign of abating. Approximately 50% of Dutch adults are now overweight,and some 10% are defined as obese. This situation is accompanied by considerableeffects on disease burden: 22,000 extra new cases of diabetes each year, 16.000 of car-diovascular diseases and 2,000 of various forms of cancer .Approximately 5% of annual mortality is thought to be directly attributable to overweight. Taking into account the postponemen tof death and other factors ,this figure is slightly lower over a period of2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9220years: if the prevalence of overweight remains stable, 3% of mortality among today's adult population will be due to overweight. In terms of the average lifeexpectancy of Dutch men and women aged 40, this entails a loss of 0.8 years due to overweight alone. If everyone in the country were to lose approximately three kilo-grams (1 BMI unit), some 20% of this health loss could be undone. An integratedstrategy, combining changes in the physical and social environment with measures tosupport changes in individual diet and physical activity, is recommended in order tohalt and reverse the current epidemic of overweight. Specific attention should bedevoted to the lower socio-economic and ethnic groups. In terms of dietary inter- ventions, diets with a low energy-density, and with much fruit, vegetables and cereal products, hold out the best opportunities for success. In addition to poor energy balance, the average Dutch diet displays shortcomings in other aspects. The main problems are inadequate consumption of fruit, vegetablesand fish, and excessive consumption of products with a high concentration of saturat-ed and trans fatty acids. The combination of these unfavourable dietary factors accounts for 38,000 extra new cases of cardiovascular diseases each year, and almost3,000 cases of cancer .Some 10% of all mor talitycan be attributed to the combination of five dietary factors. When factors such as postponement of death are taken into account, the estimate is halved: if consumption patterns remain unaltered, approxi-mately 5% of mortality occurring during the coming 20 years will be attributable to unfavourable diet arycomposition. This is expected to result in the loss of 1.2 years in the life expectancy of all Dutch citizens currently aged 40 and above. It is the inade-quate consumption of fish and fruit which has the greatest effect in this respect. Inter- ventions addressing the five diet aryfactors and considered feasible will offset approx - imately half of the total health loss. The projected increase in the number of disease -free years resulting from diet ary interventions shows that intervention post- pones disease longer than it postpones death and that in tervention therefore result s in a longer period in good health. It is recommended that the current dietary problems are addressed by rendering 'the healthy choice the easy choice' and by influencing eating behaviour in a positive direction .Making it easier to adopt a healthy diet will demand a combination of improved product composition (par ticularly that of convenience foods) and support- ing changes to the physical and social environment. Those in the lower socio-economic groups have, on average, a slightly more unfavourable diet arypattern than those in the higher socio -economic groups .Little is known about the diet of ethnic groups. In some respects, their diets would seem to be healthier than average (fatty acid pattern), while in others they appear to be some-what less healthy than average (particularly with regard to vitamins and minerals). Attention must also be devoted to the diet of the very young and the very old. The average duration of breast feeding is currently not long enough. Working mothers experience a number of practical obst acles to breast feeding. Principles for policyOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2 93include removal of these obstacles and changes to the social norms (even limited breastfeeding still has advantages). As they lose independence, the elderly have an increased chance of undernutrition and particularly of deficiencies of vitamins D and B12.The use of existing screening methods in the health care sector is important in identifying the warning signs ofundernutrition in time. Undernutrition among institutionalized elderly can be pre-vented by such means as encouraging physical activity, the use of supplements, forti-fied products and flavour-enhancers, and ensuring a stimulating social environment during meals. 2 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 94REFERENCES Albert Heijn.

H.M.J.A. van Leent-Loenen, M.C.M. Busch 3.1 Introduction Chapter 2 described the extent to which the Dutch diet may be considered 'healthy' or 'unhealthy'. What are the contributory factors and what health gain can be achieved through change? This chapter provides an account of the action taken by the Dutchgovernment in recent years to promote a healthy diet, and what the actual results of its efforts have been in practice. This mainly involves the diet-oriented efforts made ofthe Ministry of Health [in full: Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport] as part of itsbroad prevention policy designed to promote a healthy lifestyle. The policy therefore addresses aspects other than healthy diet and nutrition, such as not smoking, moder-ate alcohol consumption ,more exercise and safe sex. This chapter does not consider other areas of departmental policy which are relevant to a healthy diet, such as agri- culture, education and international trade. Neither does it examine in detail the activ-ities of other organizations targeting a healthy diet and nutrition, such as regional health authorities ,residen tial care facilities, the Consumer Association and research institutes. This accoun tof governmen teffor tsis based on the official polic ydocumen tsof the past twenty years, where these relate to prevention policy in general and to diet and nutrition in par ticular (see table 3.1 ). The first P olicyDocument on Nutrition, pub- lished in 1983, has been t aken as the st arting poin t. However ,the emphasis falls on the period following the publication of the document Nederland: Goed Gevoed? ('The Netherlands: Well Fed?') in 1998. Further information has been acquired by means of interviews with policy staff from the Ministry of Health. Section 3.2 focuses on polic yintended to promote a healthy diet. It describes the objec- tives which the ministr ywishes to achieve, the target groups addressed, and the divi- sion of roles and responsibilities adopted. Section 3.3 then offers an account of the instruments applied by the ministry, together with the specific measures designed topromote a healthy diet. The effects of these instruments and measures in practice are then presen ted in section 3.4 .The effor tsaddressing the main diet aryproblems out - lined in chapter 2 are described in greater detail in section 3.5 .The final section of this chapter, section 3.6 ,presents the summary and conclusions. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 993.2 Policy: objectives, target groups, roles and responsibilities Table 3.1 presents a list of the official Dutch policy documents which have addressed issues of healthy diet and nutrition.1 Objectives: from general objectives to a more comprehensive set of specific targets The first official polic ydocumen ton diet and nutrition ,published in 1983, included two distinct main objectives: to ensure good food supply with safe foods, and to pro- mote good eating habit s.Anno 2003, these remain the main objectives of the govern- ment's nutrition polic y.The 1983 documen tdid not include any explicit objectives with regard to food consumption, since at the time there was inadequate insight into the relationships between health problems, nutrition and food consumption figures. The measures proposed by the document were mostly concerned with investments in research and infrastructure. It was in the ' First Progress Report', published in 1987, that 'lowering fat consumption' became a priority. This objective was based on the 1986 advisory report by the (then)Nutrition Council, the 'Guidelines for Good Nutrition' (see chapter 2 ), which stated that 'high fat consumption is still the greatest problem of the Dutch diet'. The 'Second Progress Repor t' (1993) placed the emphasis on the consumption of saturated fats.3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1001In addition to the published policy documents, the Ministry of Health's annual budget and work plan devotes attention to nutrition policy (in the policy sections on prevention and health protection). However, because the descriptions in the annual reports are somewhat general and are themselves based on the policy documents (to which they refer), it has been decided not to include the reports as a separate source. 2This was the first policy document to include written statements of the government's standpoints and intentions with regard to a healthy diet and safe food. Alongside the plans for the future, the documentalso presented a comprehensive account of the achievements thus far and of work in progress.Table 3.1: Policy documents focusing on healthy diet and nutrition as published by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) [formerly Ministry of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs, WVC].

It attempted to encourage a further reduction in fat con-sumption to below 35 energy per cent. Another objective was to increase consump- tion of fruit and vegetables by at least ten per cent. The 1998 policy document Nederland: Goed gevoed? (The Netherlands: Well Fed?) sta- ted that the overall objective, to 'promote good eating habits', in effect included twotypes of objective: those to promote good eating habits in general, and those target-ing specific nutrition issues (see textbox 3.1 ). With this document, the Ministry of Health wished to make clear that government policy was concerned with more than a healthy dietary pattern alone. Nevertheless, the general objectives which had already been stated in the 1995 document Gezond en Wel continued to enjoy priority, the objective for fat consumption being subdivided into total fat (less than 35 energy per cent) and saturated fats (less than 10 energy per cent). For the consumption of vegeta-bles, the target value of 200 grams per day was added. The target for fruit consump-tion became two pieces per day. The increased consumption of fruit and vegetables would also achieve the aim of increasing the intake of dietary fibre. The documen t Langer gezond leven (Living longer in good health) set out the following objectives ,to be met by the year 2010: reduction of the intake of trans fatty acids to 1 energy per cent reduction of the intake of saturated fats to 10 energy per cent increase in the proportion of babies being exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to 25% It was further stated that the government would continue to encourage the consump- tion of more fruit and vegetables, and wished to ensure that consumers would acquirean appropriate quantity of vitamins and minerals in the diet. The document also sta-ted the in tention of achieving a twofold increase (from 35% to 70%) in the number of pregnan twomen taking folic acid supplements throughout the recommended period in order to preven tspina bifida in the newborn baby .Overweight was cited as one ofOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 101Objectives intended to pr omote good eating habits in general: reduced fat intake (particularly that of saturated fats) increased consumption of digestible complex carbohydrates increased consumption of dietary fibre achievement and maintenance of normal body- weight increased consumption of fruit and vegetables Objectives addr essing specific nutrition issues: prevention of deficits of essential nutrients (such as iodine) encouragement of breastfeeding as a means of preventing disease prevention of some specific diet-r elated diseases (such as osteoporosis) prevention of the onset of risk factors (such as hyper tension) promotion of the quality of life among patients with chronic diet-related diseases prevention of the adverse effects of over- sensitivity or allergy to food constituents Textbox 3.1: Two types of objective within the main objective of promoting good eating habits. (sour ce: Nederland: Goed Gevoed?, 1998).the three 'spearhead' areas in which the government wished to achieve firm results within the coming years, the target being to stabilize the overall number of peoplewith overweight or obesity, and to bring about a reduction in the number of children so affected. The government stated that the attainment of these objectives woulddepend on policy addressing both diet and the promotion of physical activity. Afterall, the main cause of overweight is an imbalance between energy intake through thediet on the one hand and energy expenditure through physical activity on the other. Target groups: alternating focus between consumers, vulnerable groups and producers The first policy document on nutrition acknowledged that there are certain 'vulnera- ble' groups which would benefit from a specific preventive approach. The groupsidentified were: babies (and their parents), children, the elderly, ethnic groups and those with an 'alternative' diet. Although the lower socio-economic groups were notspecifically included in this list, the document did acknowledge that dietary adviceand nutrition education was likely to have less impact on these groups. In the 1998 polic ydocumen t Nederland: Goed Gevoed? the st ar- geting specific groups may be useful' gave way to a deliberate choice for this approach. It was noted that policy whereby certain groups would be targeted in a cer-tain way should be developed, and that intervention strategies should be similarly specific .The 1998 documen tpresented general action programmes for the Dutch population as a whole, and for young people, the elderly, the lower socio-economicgroups and ethnic minorities. Finally, the most recent policy document, Langer gezond leven (2003) identifies only three t arget groups :young people, the elderly and those with a lower standard of education .Ethnic minorities are thus no longer seen as a separate t arget group for prevention measures, although their more vulnerable members will generally fallunder one or more of the target groups that are cited. The government has opted to distinguish several specific policy areas (nutrition, smoking, alcohol) within preven- tion policy as a whole, and increasingly avoids singling out specific target groups. This approach is fur ther to the broadening of the government's nutritional policy (aimed atpromoting health and preven ting disease) to become a more general policy by which the government wishes to promote a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle. The government's policy on diet and nutrition also targets food producers and proces- sors.Besides encouraging a healthy choice of food and healthy eating habit son the part of the consumer, the Ministry of Health's efforts have increasingly focused on the food supply chain. Producers are encouraged to make their products 'healthier', andtoassist in making 'the healthy choice the easy choice' for consumers. For example, as part of the Let op vet ('Watch the fat') campaign (see textbox 3.2 ), producers were encouraged to modif ythe fat composition of their products. The 2003 document also announced the in tention of arriving at agreements regarding overweight within the context of the ' Regular Consultation Platform on the Sale of Food and Drugs Act'3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 102(ROW)3.These agreements would cover aspects such as modifications in product com- position, portion size, the contents of confectionery and soft drinks vendingmachines, product information and advertising. The agreements are now subject to discussion by an 'offshoot' of the ROW, the 'Regular Consultation Platform on Over-weight' (ROO), the meetings of which are separate to those of the ROW, although themembership is the same. Division of roles and responsibilities: ensuring consumer choice, stressing personal responsibility The first policy document on nutrition (1983) devoted considerable attention to the role of the government. It was noted that the government's influence in terms of pro- moting good eating habits was of a different order to that with regard to food safety.\"In a society with the character and traditions of ours, it is appropriate to apply some caution with regard to interventions in the personal life of the individual\". The effec-tiveness of government policy addressing healthy diet is therefore not so much relianton legislation, but more on the promotion of a cohesive set of activities which enhance the consumer's ability to make appropriate dietary choices. It is acknow-ledged that the governmen t's activities and strategies in this regard should focus on fostering knowledge about aspects of nutrition, making regular and targeted use of the mass media for the purposes of information and education with regard to diet andnutrition. Such information should reflect and make use of current trends (such as the preference for slenderness and more natural behaviour), while negative at titudes and misconceptions (\"healthy food is less flavoursome and more difficult to prepare\")should be countered. The 1998 policy document states that further health gain can be achieved by focusing polic yon the improvemen tof both eating habits and food supply. It emphasizes the citizen 's personal responsibilit ywith regard to improving eating habit s,this being in line with the more integrated approach seen in the prevention strategy of recent years. This entails a shift in emphasis onto creating awareness of the opportunities for improving and maintaining one's own health. The government sees its own role as one of 'initiator', where necessary as the 'director', and the 'monitor' of the process of anutrition polic yfocused on promoting health and preventing disease. The 2003 policy document adds that the individual has primary responsibility for ensuring a healthy lifestyle and healthy diet, and that more will be done to draw theindividual's attention to the adverse effects of an unhealthy lifestyle. The government does not wish to in terfere in personal choices ,but it does consider it self responsible for the identification and provision of clear information about the consequences of those choices, and for promoting the availability of 'healthy' products. One of theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 1033The Regulier Overleg Warenwet (Regular Consultation Platform on the Food and Drugs Act; ROW) is a dis- cussion platform comprising representatives of industry, trade and consumers. The government, the regu-latory authorities and the Nutrition Centre also take part in its deliberations. The government traditional-ly submits draft legislation further to national and European consumer protection laws to the ROW forconsideration and advice.explicit principles on which the government bases its approach is that 'the healthy choice must be the easy choice'. Accordingly, it will remind local authorities, the pri-vate sector, producers, schools, health care providers and health insurers of their responsibilities with regard to the health of the individual. For example, the privatesector is to be reminded of its social responsibility in the field of public health. Thegovernment is to encourage a system of self-regulation in this regard, and will intro-duce legislation only if such a system proves ineffective. To summarize, we may state that the government's aim has always been to enable and promote a healthy (or healthier) choice on the part of the consumer. Over the years, this general objective has been further elaborated and quantified. The government has adopted a two-pronged approach, targeting both the consumer (the generalpopulation and some vulnerable groups) and the producer. It has always maintained a more tentative 'hands-off' approach with regard to the promotion of healthy eatinghabits, based on the realization that the consumer is entitled to a free choice. Thegovernment sees its own role in terms of creating appropriate conditions, providing information and encouraging healthier choices, rather than enforcing them. It wishesto en tice the consumer towards the healthier choice ,and is now increasingly firm in opting to do so in association with the other actors involved. However, the fact that the final choice must always fall to the consumer himself or herself is subject toincreasing emphasis. 3.3 Instruments and measures Asstated above, the government's role in the field of healthy diet is that of providing information and facilit ating the healthy choice .This section explains what this actual- lymeans in terms of polic yinstrumen tsand measures .The measures are classified according to the system developed by Van der Doelen (1993), who distinguishes six policy instruments, some of which promote desirable aspects while others repress the undesirable aspects (see table 3.2 ). Information: from labelling to public campaigns The Dutch government has made extensive use of public information to promote a healthy diet. After all, the consumer must have adequate and reliable information onwhich to base the ' healthy' choice. The packaging of a product and its labelling, for example ,informs the consumer about the composition and nutritional value of that product.3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 104Table 3.2: The classification of policy instruments according to Van der Doelen (1993). Incen tive Repressive Communicative Information Propaganda Economic Subsidy Levy Legislative Covenant Order / banThegovernment designated the Netherlands Nutrition Centre as the health promotion institute (GBI) for nutrition, one of its main tasks being to inform consumers abouthealthy diet and nutrition. The Nutrition Centre's activities in this area include provid- ing information via a website and digital newsletter, operating a telephone helpdeskto answer consumer questions, producing and distributing printed information, pro-viding information about special diets suitable for certain types of patient, informa-tion about branded items suitable for those with increased sensitivity or allergies, andconducting projects and campaigns 4.Public campaigns, some several years in dura- tion, inform the consumer about the importance of a healthy diet (see textbox 3.2 ). Subsidies for interventions, research, school milk and fruit and vegetables in schools The economic instrument of the subsidy is also extensively used. Subsidies are primar- ily intended to fund prevention activities (interventions) and third-party research.They are awarded directly or through intermediary organizations such as the Nether-lands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) and the Fonds Openbare Gezondheidszorg (Fund for Public Health Care). The Nutrition Centre itselfis in receipt of ongoing subsidy .Todate,the Dutch governmen thas chosen to subsi- dize specific 'healthy' foods to a limited extent only. For example, subsidized school milk 5is provided and, since January 2003, subsidized fruit and vegetables have been distributed in several hundred Dutch primary schools as part of a temporary nutri- tional awareness campaign 6. Voluntary agreements: the emphasis on cooperation with the private sector, with legislation only where necessar y The government applies extreme caution with regard to the use of legislative instru- ments. It prefers to encourage self-regulation by the private sector, with the bare mi- nimum of legislation in tended to enforce ' responsible behaviour '. The 2003 polic y document Langer gezond leven states that the government intends to increase the emphasis on agreements ('covenants') yet further. As part of the action plan on over- weight, for example, there will be a covenant with the private sector establishing agreements on advertising, portion size, product composition and the like. However ,binding legislation also exists. It includes the various safety directives for baby foods and special diet foods, the requirements for food labelling ('declaration ofnutritional values'), and a directive covering the addition of essential nutrients toOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 1054In 2003, the ongoing campaigns were those promoting breastfeeding, addressing the school canteen, encouraging the maintenance of a healthy (weight-reduction) diet, and promoting good nutrition among the lower socio-economic groups 5The subsidy is no longer provided by the Dutch government but now comes from the European Union. The provision of school milk has been subject to reduction over the years. Fewer primary schools now sup-ply milk, and there is only one dairy company which supplies schools directly. 6Under this scheme, a total of 70,000 primary school pupils will receive a free portion of fruit or vegetables twice a week for two years. The intention is that the children will come to regard fruit and vegetables astasty, healthy and 'cool', representing a healthy snack which becomes part of their daily school routine(www.voedingscentrum.nl).some products (e.g. iodine in bread and salt). The Council of Europe and the European Parliament are currently considering proposals for legislation to control the claimsmade of certain food products (e.g. 'functional foods') by their manufacturers, and to set st andards with regard to the ' enrichment' or 'fortification' of food products (see also chapter 6 ). Research as a precondition of effective polic y Alongside the instruments described above, the government has also commissioned various research studies ,recognizing the impor tance of research as a precondition of effective polic y.Investmen tshave been made in research in to the dietary patterns of the general public, into the relationship between nutrition and certain health pro- blems, and an infrastructure for nutrition research has been put in place. For example, asurvey system providing ongoing information about food consumption in the Netherlands has been developed. The results form the main input when formulating new polic yobjectives and priorities. To summarize, the government has chosen to implement its policy of targeting a healthy diet largely through the use of stimulatory instruments. Consumers areencouraged to eat healthily (mainly through public information), while consultation is used to encourage manufacturers to produce a healthier range of product s.This is appropriate to the division of roles and responsibilities in diet and nutrition interven- tions. Unlike policy addressing food safety (see chapter 5 ), policy on nutrition is notable for its relatively limited reliance on binding legislation. 3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 106In 2002, the Nutrition Centre launched a five-year campaign intended to prevent overweight. Thiscampaign follows two earlier national campaigns( Let op Vet ,1991 to 1995 and Goede voeding, wat let je? ,1997 to 2001) each of which was notable for a combination of activities addressing both theconsumer and the environment. The mass mediawere used to provide information, and there wereactivities providing information directly to individ-uals, such as nutrition tests and recipe books. Thecampaigns also encouraged product modification.Each of the Nutrition Centre's campaigns is imple-mented in several phases, the first designed toincrease awareness on the part of the targetgroups, whereupon the emphasis shifts to behav-ioural change in the later phases. The campaignstargetboth the general population and specific target groups. Their objectives and target groupsarebased in part on the results of the Food Con- sumption Sur veys. The Good Nutrition Steering Group is responsible for devising, preparing and running each cam-paign. The Steering Group was founded by thegovernment in 1987, with the task of implementingthe Nutrition Centre's 'Guidelines for Good Nutri-tion'. The reduction of fat consumption was givenparticular emphasis at this time. The SteeringGroup comprises representatives of organizationsinvolved in all aspects of nutrition, food produc-tion, information, as well as the government andconsumer groups. Since its inception, the GoodNutrition Steering Group combined its activities inconnection with the coordination of public cam-paigns with efforts to promote product modifica-tion. Having now become a project within theNutrition Centre itself, the Steering Group's activi-ties addr essing the food supply have been dis- continued. Textbox 3.2: The Nutrition Centre's public campaigns. 3.4 The effects of policy in practice The foregoing section describes the instruments which the government has opted to apply in pursuing its objectives. This section examines the effects of those instrumentstodate. Increasing attention for evaluation Information about the effects of dietary interventions is relatively sparse. In Effecten van preventie ('Effects of prevention', Gunning-Schepers & Jansen, 1997) the authors note that the information required on efficacy, to be derived from controlled inter- vention studies, is not widely available in the Netherlands, going on to note that cer- tain types of intervention (e.g. legislation) do not lend themselves to experimentalevaluation. The availability of information concerning effectiveness also leaves some- thing to be desired. In 1996, however, the founding of the Netherlands Organizationfor Health Research and Development (ZON, now ZonMw), the intermediary organiza-tion for the programming and funding of research projects in the field of prevention, represented a step forwards. The ZonMw Prevention Programme forms the frame-work within which research ,developmen t,evaluation and implemen tation of preven- tative interventions - including those involving healthy nutrition - is managed. The programme also includes research into the effectiveness of public information abouthealthy nutrition, with evaluations of the public campaigns being conducted. How- ever,the ZonMw budget is curren tly under extreme pressure. The effects of mass media health education: mainly a question of awareness Although mass media health education campaigns do not readily lend themselves to evaluation (Gunning-Schepers & Jansen, 1997), it is generally accepted that they do serve to raise public awareness of the consequences of eating behaviour ,and that they can enhance knowledge of the ways in which risks can be reduced .Arepor ton the Nutrition Centre's public campaigns (Maessen, 2001) states that the studies (andreview studies) cited in the literature indicate that the main effect of mass media information is to be seen in terms of knowledge and awareness, with effects on atti- tude and behaviour seen to a lesser extent. Gunning-Schepers & Jansen (1997) state that information programmes which are solely in tended to provide information to the target group (such as televised public information messages) are unlikely to have any direct effects on health. Their main benefit is in the area of 'agenda-setting' (i.e. bring-ing a topic to the attention of a wide audience). Actual health effects are more likelyto be derived from programmes which not only provide information, but which also influence behaviour and enhance the skills required to develop a healthier lifest yle. Integrated national campaigns have more effect The public campaigns run by the Nutrition Centre go further than merely providing mass media information. They include numerous subsidiary activities targeting theconsumer and the industr y(see textbox 3.2 ). These campaigns are subject to extensive evaluation ,both during their implementation and upon completion. A 'zero measure- ment' (reference situation) is first t aken. In each year of the campaign, the effects areOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 107evaluated by examining such aspects as the target group's awareness of the cam- paign, and the knowledge, awareness, attitudes and intentions with regard to(changes to) eating behaviour (see chapter 8 for terms and definitions). Process evalua- tions are also conducted. The results of the evaluations sometimes lead to the formand structure of the campaign being adjusted. Textboxes 3.3 and 3.4describe the campaign evaluations. During the Let op Vet ('Watch the Fat') campaign, national fat consumption did indeed fall slightly, but the effects of the campaign Goede voeding, wat let je ('Good nutrition - what's stopping you?') were disappointing. This may have been due to the complexity of the message. The Nutrition Centre has therefore decided to limit the current campaign addressing overweight to just one message. Afew national interventions promoted or enforced by the government to provide public information have not been subject to any evaluation of effects. They includeproduct labelling, the special logo and label for fruit and vegetables, and dietetic recommendations. 3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 108The evaluations revealed a reasonably high awareness level for the campaign itself, and someeffect in terms of awareness of the problem of fatconsumption. In almost all aspects, the first yearwas more successful than the subsequent years.Maessen (2001) suggests that this might havebeen due to the larger budget available and thehigher number of activities undertaken during thefirst year .The objective of the second and third years - to impr ove attitudes - was not achieved. Further more, few changes in the target group's actual behaviour or in the determinants of behav- iour wer eseen. Accor ding to the evaluations, the overall objective of the campaign, behavioural change, was ther efor enot attained. However, the National Food Consumption Survey reveals that fat consumption has been reduced since, with fat intake falling fr om 40.0 energy per cent in 1987/1988 to 36.9 energy per cent in 1992, and that of saturated fats from 16.5 to 14.1 energyper cent. The RIVM r epor t Effecten van pr eventie ('Effects of Prevention'; Gunning-Schepers & Jansen, 1997) points out that it remains unclearwhether the reduction in fat consumption was due to changes in consumer demand or to productmodification on the supply side. The campaignencouraged a number of activities on the part ofmanufacturers, which in the first year in particu-lar led to additional adver tising, the intr oduction of new or modified products with a lower fat con- tent, and temporary price reductions. The umbrel-la or ganization representing Dutch supermarkets (CBL) played an active r ole in this. The RIVM repor tgoes on to comment on the integrated approach: \"... the added value of the combination of inter ventions tar geting both demand and supply is difficult to quantify, but may be argued. Interde- partmental cooperation on a national scale r esult - edin gr eater coor dination and mor econsistency in the message presented and the related activi- ties. Mor eover, an information message and assor ted themes which are announced well in advance of the campaign, offer various points of departure for (commercial) initiatives designed toadjust the supply side, and hence demand, on apermanent basis.\" Textbox 3.3: 'Watch the Fat' (1991 to 1995), intended to reduce the consumption of (saturated) fats. Subsidized fruit and vegetables in schools: results not yet known No research has ever been undertaken into the effects of providing subsidized school milk. It is too early to make any statement with regard to the effects of the currentprogramme providing subsidized fruit and vegetables to schoolchildren. A zero (refer-ence) measurement was taken in early 2003, to be followed by further measurements in 2004 and 2005. At the end of the programme, it will then be possible to statewhether the project has been a success . The positive effects of agreements with the private sector The RIVM report Effecten van preventie (Gunning-Schepers & Jansen, 1997) states that modification of the available supply of food product scan suppor tgovernment inter- ventions, or could even render such interventions superfluous. With regard to thereduction of (saturated) fat consumption, this would apply to the composition of mar- garines ,product swith reduced fat con tent,and fat substitutes .The in troduction of 'functional foods' has also been cited as a development which can enhance the avail- abilit yof healthy food .It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of legislation. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the addition of iodine to bread and salt (under theCommodities Act Decree) has helped to reduce the incidence of iodine deficiency(struma) in the Netherlands. To summarize, there are several examples of dietary interventions which have been successful to a greater or lesser degree .Success is most marked where an integrated approach is adopted ,addressing both the consumer and the food industry. 3.5 Efforts targeting the main nutritional problems Chapter 2 listed a number of major diet-related health problems, the resolution of which could result in substantial health gain. This section describes the Dutch govern-ment's efforts with regard to these specific nutritional problems. Over weight Until a few years ago, overweight was not treated as a priority. It was in the 1998 poli- cydocumen FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 109The interim measurements reveal that, after two years, there was a slight improvement in terms ofthe determinants of behaviour (with the exceptionof fruit consumption) which could lead to a posi-tive change in consumption patterns. However,the main barrier to actual behavioural change -misconceptions - remained in place (Maessen,2001). The target group agrees that their diet isnot sufficiently healthy, but blames this on envi-ronmental factors and does not accept personal responsibility. Accordingly, the campaign did notbring about any positive behavioural change. Infact, the consumption of fruit and vegetablesactually fell. Awareness among the target groupswas at a reasonably high level, and knowledgewith regard to good nutrition was slightlyimproved. Textbox 3.4: 'Good nutrition: what's stopping you? (1997 to 2001), intended to increase the consumption of complex carbohydrates, dietary fibre and antioxidants.one of the objectives of nutrition policy (see textbox 3.1 ).In late 2002, a response to the Health Council's advisory report on the National Food Consumption Surveys setout the measures that had since been taken to counter overweight. The Health Coun- cil was asked to produce recommendations with regard to obesity, a knowledge cen-tre was founded to provide information and to help prevent overweight, and theNutrition Centre was asked to devise and implement a public campaign. The subse-quent policy document Langer gezond leven ('Living longer in good health') (2003) raised overweight to the status of 'spearhead'. The approach is still under develop-ment, with the government attempting to form a broad coalition of interested parties. In May 2003, a start-up conference was held, to which 25 relevant social organizations were invited. Themes and action points were established during the conference. One of the main intentions is for the government to make agreements with both the sup-pliers of food products and organizers of physical activities, whereby 'the healthy choice can be made the easy choice'. Fat intake Reduction of fat intake was cited as an objective in the First Progress Report further to the 1983 polic ydocumen t. The Let op V et('Watch the F at') campaign was instigated with this aim in mind. Subsequent Nutrition Centre campaigns ( Goed gevoed, wat let je and Maak je niet dik )also adopted reduction of fat intake and the improvement of the fatty acid composition of the diet as important aims. The government has opted to fol- low a t wo-pronged approach. On the one hand, the consumer is encouraged to eat less fat and to increase the proportion of the 'better' fats within the total amount con-sumed. On the other, manufacturers are encouraged to modify their products. In the 2003 polic ydocumen t('Living longer in good health ') the governmen tencourages the food industry to develop products with a reduced fat content and improved fatty acid composition .Further to this, the Nutrition Centre compiled a project plan in 2003, en titled ' Hidden fat s'. Itsintention is to increase knowledge of the hidden fat content of foods, in collaboration with manufacturers themselves. Fruit and vegetable consumption For several years, one of the government's main dietary objectives has been to increase the consumption of fruit and veget ables. The Nutrition Centre's second pub- lic campaign was in tended to achieve this aim, but appears to have been unsuccessful. The consumption of fruit and vegetables has been falling for several years. A numberof other national initiatives have been launched to encourage consumers to eat morefruit and vegetables. They include: aspecially designed logo and label for fruit and veget ables ,which producers can apply to their products to provide additional consumer information the project in which schoolchildren are given a free portion of fruit or vegetables twice weekly (see section 3.3 ) the campaign Lekker in je vel met groente en fruit ('Feel good with fruit and vegeta- bles'), launched in 2003 to tie in with the trend for 'wellness' diets. The campaign seeks to encourage the consumption of fruit and veget ables among young adults by emphasizing the shor t-term positive effect s(helping to maintain both a healthy3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 110weight and adequate resistance). The campaign is run by AGF Promotie Nederland (Central marketing and communication bureau for the Dutch produce sector) The following may be added with regard to the two nutritional problems linked to a certain life phase. The elderly It was the 1998 policy document which designated the elderly as a separate target group, acknowledging the risk of undernutrition. An action programme was announced, primarily intended to enhance the expertise of care-givers in the health sector. The intention was to conduct a study of the nutritional status of elderly persons and of means by which this could be improved. The market introduction of foods withhigh nutritional value would also be encouraged. The subsequent 2003 policy docu- ment does not devote any attention to the nutritional status of the elderly. Apparent-ly, their situation is no longer regarded as problematic. Breastfeeding It has long been acknowledged that the propor tion of Dutch newborn babies being breastfed is too low. The government has stated the objective of increasing the per- centage, and has taken certain measures in this respect. For example, the Warenwet- regeling Zuigelingenvoeding (Commodities Decree on Baby Food Preparations) includes aban on the adver tising of mother -milk substitutes by the industry. The World Health Organization's International Code of Conduct also restricts the marketing of suchpreparations. The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority operates an active and repressive enforcemen tstrateg y.In the late 1990s ,the Nutrition Cen tre produced guidelines for baby foods, included in a Health Care Inspectorate bulletin on nutrition for children under four ,intended for the use of health sector staff. Sticht - ing Zorg voor Borstvoeding (the Breast feeding Promotion F oundation), which is funded by ZonMw, participates in the worldwide Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, under theauspices of the WHO and Unicef. Part of the initiative entails certification of hospitals with an active breastfeeding policy. The 2003 polic ydocument points to a rising trend, but states that the percentage of breast fed babies remains too low. The objective of having at least 25% of children breastfed for the first six months of life was set. Accordingly, the Nutrition Centre wasasked by the Ministry of Health to devise an action plan to encourage breastfeeding.The plan includes a five-year campaign Borstvoeding verdient tijd ('Breastfeeding deser ves time ')which was commenced in 2003. It draws at tention to the benefit sof breastfeeding from various perspectives: the mother, the child, the environment, health care and policy. In summary, we may state that the Ministry of Health has devoted both ongoing and inciden tal attention to the dietary problems listed, and established policy objectives accordingly .Priority has been given to fat intake and to the consumption of fruit and veget ables ,while breastfeeding has also enjoyed ongoing attention. However, theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 3 111efforts to date have not (yet) had the desired effect. The 2003 policy document ('Living longer in good health') announced activities relating to four of the five issues: under-nutrition among the elderly was no longer included. Given the extent of this problem, it does seem advisable to devote attention to undernutrition among the elderly onceagain. It is too early to make any statement regarding the extent to which the new ini-tiatives will be able to alleviate the problems they address. 3.6 Summary and conclusions As long ago as the 1980s, the Dutch government acknowledged that the dietary pat- tern has a strong influence on public health, and set itself the task of promotinghealthy (or healthier) choices on the part of consumers. At the time, the priority was the role of fatty acids in the development of coronary heart diseases. It was decided toinvest in periodic research into food consumption, but no structural budget was set.'Guidelines for Good Nutrition' were also established. The general objective (the encouragement of the healthy choice) has since been elaborated to form quantitativetarget sfor the general population and ,since the mid -1990s, there has been a con- scious effort to inform specific target groups. The measures implemented by the government over the past twenty years have tar- geted both consumers and food producers .Agreemen ts with the industry have had a positive effect. A greater range of products with lower saturated fat content hasserved to reduce consumption of these fats, although not to the degree considered desirable under the ' Guidelines for G ood Nutrition '. The governmen trealizes that the consumer must be allowed a reasonable freedom of choice with regard to the range of foods ,whereby it sown role is to create the preconditions, provide information and encourage the healthy choice .It wishes to ' seduce 'the consumer in to making the healthy choice, and is increasingly doing so in collaboration with other parties. The fact that it is the consumer who bears final responsibility for making the healthy choice is subject to ever greater emphasis. Government policy continues to address the diet-related areas in which substantial health gains are possible ,as listed in chapter 2 ,to a greater or lesser exten t. However, it is only since the publication of the 2003 policy document 'Living longer in goodhealth' that a specific policy on overweight has been in place. Investments are nowbeing made in research and knowledge development (albeit on a limited scale) and a national campaign has been launched .Since the late 1990s ,several measures have been implemented and initiatives begun to encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables, and that of products containing high levels of dietary fibre. Nevertheless,there has been a reduction in the consumption of such products. An initiative whichcan reverse this trend must now be sought. The promotion of breastfeeding hasformed par tof nutrition policy for many years, but it was not until 2003 that a quanti- tative target was set and a public campaign begun. Finally, undernutrition among the extremely elderly and those in residen tial care was subject to specific at tention in the3 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1121998 policy document but is not acknowledged as a problem in the later (2003) docu- ment. It is not possible to state whether the government's interventions to promote a healthy diet have been successful based on an analysis of the policy documents alone.However, some conclusions may be drawn, and indicators for future policy may beidentified based on epidemiological trends and the experience gained in preventiveinterventions to date. The problem of overweight has only recently been placed on the agenda. It is a signi- ficant problem which deserves to be given high priority in public health policy. Success will depend on the concerted efforts of many actors, comparable to the efforts intend- ed to reduce smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. However, the government's role with regard to overweight is somewhat more difficult than that in these otherareas of public health, since overweight is an individual problem and does not direct-ly affect the health of others. As stated in section 3.4 ,an integrated approach targeting both producers (supply) and consumers (behaviour) seems to be the most promising.The food industr ycan do much to help by improving the composition of product s,by developing and promoting products with a low energy-density but high nutritional value, by modifying portion sizes, and by reducing the amount of advertising for'between meals' snacks and drinks. At the same time, consumer awareness of the problem should be increased ,with clear and unequivocal messages enabling and 'seducing' the public to make the healthy choices. It is important that this message isdirected at specific target groups in their relevant settings. Asimilar approach is appropriate with regard to promoting the consumption of fruit and veget ables .The campaign Goede what's stop- did not have the desired effect. Apar tfrom information and education , various initiatives are required to make fruit and vegetables the easier, more attrac-tive choice. It remains unclear whether initiatives such as that in which free fruit and vegetables are provided to schoolchildren will serve to increase consumption on a permanent basis.

In addition to various useful nutrients and other constituents which are beneficial to health, they can also contain componentswhich are less desirable, or even harmful to health. It is the presence of these 'harm-ful' constituents which forms the main determinant of food safety and, together with the nutritional aspects, determines the quality of our food. Determinants of food safety The two main determinants of food safety are the food supply, and the manner in which food is stored and prepared (see chapter 1, figure 1.2 ). On the supply side, the most important factor is the quality of the end product, and hence the quality of the food purchased by the consumer. Various potential safetyproblems exist here ,relating to foods with undesirable microbiological con tamina - tion, foods which contain harmful chemicals, and foods with bio-active ingredients which are in themselves beneficial to health, but which can be harmful when con-sumed in excess. (\"Too much of a good thing\"). The so-called 'genetically modified' foods form a special categor ywhich of ten draw public and political attention due to their alleged health risks. Storage and preparation practice falls under the personal responsibilit yofthe con - sumer (as part of eating behaviour). This is particularly important in the domestic situation in order to preclude microbiological con tamination. However, professional caterers ,such as rest auran tsand institutional kitchens ,also bear a personal responsi- bility in this regard. Scope This chapter will focus mainly on the first two food safety threats: microbiological contamination ( section 4.2 )and chemical con tamination, i.e. the presence of harmful chemicals ( section 4.3 ). Food safety as a whole, i.e. both microbiological and chemical, will be considered in a broader context in section 4.4 ,which also addresses controver- sial aspects such as 'organic farming' and the 'hygiene hypothesis'. Chapter 6 examines the situation with regard to specific health promoting foods (also called 'functional foods'), dietary supplements and herbal preparations which (areclaimed to) have a beneficial health effect but which can also be harmful when takenin excess. Chapter 7 (section 7.3 )presents a more detailed consideration of the health- related and safety aspects of these type of products. This chapter does not consider the topic of genetically modified foods in great det ail. Asummar yofkey information on the subject is presen ted in textbox 4.1 .In fact ,inOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 1154 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 116Textbox 4.1: Genetically modified foods. The term 'genetically modified foods' includes all products which consist of, are derived from, orare obtained using genetically modified organ-isms (GMOs). Examples include genetically modi-fied crops such as soy, corn and rape. Foods forwhich the production process relies on the use ofgenetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs), orenzymes derived from those micro-organisms,also fall under the heading of 'genetically modi-fied foods'. They include certain dairy products,such as cheese, and some bakery products. Genetically modified crops are grown on a largescale in a number of countries, notably the UnitedStates, Canada and China. In Europe, we havebeen rather reluctant to follow suit. In 1998, anumber of EU member states (Austria , France,Germany, Greece, Italy and Luxembourg) actuallyimposed a moratorium on the cultivation of suchcrops, invoking the precautionary measuresincluded in their envir onmental legislation. Although no formal moratorium has been imposed in the Netherlands, the Ministr yof Housing, Spa - tial Planning and the Environment has prevented cultivation (whether for research or production)in a number of cases, citing ,the commer cial cultiva- tion of genetically modified crops remains limited throughout Europe, and even the admission intothe EU of imported GM end products forms aseemingly insurmountable problem for somemember states. By 2004, however ,some change in this situation could be seen, with the Eur opean Commission taking steps to have the moratoria lifted. For the time being, the (supposed) risks pr esent - ed by GM crops seem to be in areas other than food itself, such as the environmental impact ofcultivation activities (ecology, out-crossing, etc.),veterinar yhealth (use in animal feeds) and con - sumer perception. A further important point for attention is the use of cer tain marker genes (antibiotic resistance genes) which, upon dissem-ination in the envir onment or among humans and animals, could have a negative effect on medical and veterinary practice. Although this risk hasbeen assessed as extremely small (Bennet et al ., 2004), the general trend today throughout Europeis not to use marker genes of this type. They arepermitted only in older pr oducts, with the poten- tial health risks being assessed on a case-by-case basis. In terms of the risks associated with consump- tion, it is important to realize that the currentfirst-generation GM crops were created with aview to achieving agronomic advantages. Thesecrops have one or more new proteins (intended topromote herbicide or disease resistance) whichare mostly present in extremely low levels. Inthese cases, the food safety evaluation is con-cerned with the possible toxic or allergenic prop-erties of the new protein, and with possiblepleiotropic effects of the genetic modification, i.e.unintended structural alterations to the genomeor possible secondary effects on the organism'smetabolism resulting from the expression of thenew protein. This may result in changes to thelevels of naturally occur ring toxins, or other sec- ondary plant metabolites.In the European Union, legislation (Directives90/219/EC and 90/220/EC) was implemented sever-al years ago to addr ess the envir onmental risks of GMOs, which has since been regularly amended (98/81/EC, 2001/18/EC). Genetically modified foodsfall under the so-called 'Novel Food' directive(97/258/EC) while until recently, animal feedswere not covered by any specific GMO regula-tions. The implementation of Dir ective EC1829/2003, which came into effect in April 2004, means that there is now a single regulationcovering both GM foods and GM animal feeds. Two supplementary directives (EC1830/2003 andEC65/2004) have been implemented as well, r egu- lating the traceability and labelling r espectively of GM organisms and foods, and implementing a system of uniform identification numbers. Allthese dir ectives ar eto be incorporated into the national legislation of the various member states. In the Netherlands, the safety assessment of GMproducts within the scope of the 'Novel Food'directive is the task of the Health Council' s\"Com - missie Nieuwe Voedingsmiddelen\" (Commission on Novel Foods). The evaluation of the toxiceffects of, say, new proteins is in principle com-parable to that of other deliberately added sub - stances such as additives. Assessment of the possible pleiotropic effects relies on a measure-ment of the levels of the main naturally-occurringtoxins and other secondary metabolites. Alterna-tively, toxicological and clinical studies of thefood as a whole ar econducted. terms of the safety assessment with regard to consumption, these foods are not so very different from conventional foods. Only the technology by which such productsare derived differs. In the Netherlands, we assume at present that the current proce- dures for the assessment of GM food products (with particular regard to the geneticmodification itself) are adequate to establish their safety (RVZ/RIKILT, 2001). Accord-ingly, GM foods may be regarded as being just as safe as their conventionally pro-duced counterparts. However, this does not detract from the fact that there are someproblems in terms of regulation and enforcement. In particular, better 'tracking andtracing' detection methods for GM products are required. Also, the second generation of GM crops, in which nutritional changes have been made (e.g. to the levels of micronutrients or other bio-active constituents), may present new risks in future (RVZ/RIKILT, 2001). The consumer's risk perception An important aspect of food safety, and one that must certainly not be underestimat- ed, is the consumer's perception. The health risk of eating microbiologically or chem- ically contaminated food is not only an objectively measurable or calculable risk. It isalso a ' perceived risk ', the exten tof which is largely determined by the con text and by subjective aspects during observation. The genetically modified food products men- tioned above provide a good example. In terms of microbiological or chemical conta-mination, they present no specific problem. However, the consumer's perception is quite differen t,as demonstrated by the ongoing controversy surrounding these prod- ucts. Here, the extent of the perceived risk relies also on other factors, such as the ideathat man has been 'meddling' with nature, trust, confidence, etc. It therefore falls to the governmen tand the food industr yto gain a more complete underst anding of the consumer's risk perception with regard to food safety. This is also essential if there is to be effective risk communication bet ween the governmen tand the general public, which calls for an active t wo-way in terchange of information .Although there are cur - rently no indications of any persistent or growing lack of consumer confidence in food safety (Timmers & De Jonge, 2004), good risk communication can help to main- tain consumer confidence. Therefore, chapter 8 (section 8.3 )examines the mechanisms of risk perception in greater detail, including the relationship between risk percep- tion and eating behaviour ( section 8.2 ). OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 1174.2 Pathogenic micro-organisms in our food A.H. Havelaar, Y.T.H.P. van Duijnhoven # 4.2.1 Introduction The microbiological contamination of foods and products is and will remain a topical issue, attracting considerable attention from the media and public alike. In January 2001, for example, a New Year's reception in The Hague was identified as the source of foodborne infection involving norovirus contamination. In October 2001, an out- break of Salmonella in a clinic in Zwolle was subject to much media coverage and dis-cussion. In 2002, a group of schoolchildren were taken ill having drunk untreated milk during a visit to a dairy farm. The milk was found to be the source of a Campy-lobacter infection. In 2003, no fewer than 85 of over one hundred people attending abarbecue in Hoofddorp were taken ill, 35 requiring admission to hospital. In that same year, two Dutch sporting heroes, Pieter van den Hoogeband and Martin Verkerk,succumbed to foodborne infection which seriously affected their match per formance . The Dutch government has long recognized the problem of foodborne infections (see chapter 5 ). Nevertheless, a joint study conducted by the Dutch Consumers' Association and the F ood and Consumer Product Safet yAuthority (VWA) in 2003 once again revealed that the problem of Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination of chick-en meat remains stubborn (Van der Zee & Wit, 2003; Kramer et al., 2003). The out- come prompted the VW Ato submit a let ter (dated 17 July 2003) to the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport and the Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality advising them to \" renew agreemen ts with the poultry sector, so that interventions leading to a permanen tand subst antial reduction of these con taminants can be made as quickly as possible.\" This part of chapter 4 presents a summary of current knowledge concerning food- borne infections caused by pathogenic micro-organisms. Following a general overview of the types of pathogenic micro-organisms that can occur in food, we con- sider the nature and severit yof the associated illnesses ( section 4.2.2 ).An estimate of the number of foodborne infections in the Netherlands is then given ( section 4.2.3 ), followed by an account of the foods in which pathogenic micro-organisms are most commonly found and the factors which influence the likelihood of contamination (section 4.2.4 ). Section 4.2.5. goes on to iden tifythe main microbial hazards in terms of potential health gain. Section 4.2.6 presents the summary and conclusions. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 118#With contributions by E. Duizer, A.W. van van Pelt4.2.2 Overview of pathogenic micro-organisms and other infectious agents in food The types of pathogenic micro-organisms and other infectious agents in food Many different types of micro-organisms and other infectious agents can occur in our food, the majority of which are not pathogenic, i.e. they will not cause illness. How- ever, when food is kept for too long or is stored at too high a temperature, micro-organ- isms (such as bacteria, fungi and yeasts) can multiply, usually causing food spoilage. Ingeneral, the flora responsible for this process does not pose a risk to consumer health. Indeed, there is a certain degree of 'built-in protection', since the consumer will be warned by the smell, appearance and/or off-flavour of a product that has spoiled. The pathogenic micro-organisms and other infectious agents are therefore in a rela- tive minority, but can nevertheless give rise to many symptoms of illness. Newpathogens are still being discovered today; new associations are being made betweenknown conditions and known pathogens, new links are being identified between known types of pathogens and the manner in which they are distributed via food. Andproblems that were thought to be under con trol have reappeared or are increasing in extent. These are referred to as emerging and re-emerging infections. Table 4.1 pre- sents a general overview of the main groups of pathogens to be found in food. Inaddition to a biological classification, they have been arranged according to their mechanism of action (see textbox 4.2 ), and the most prevalen tconditions or symptoms they cause. The table is not exhaustive. A more comprehensive list of the known food-borne pathogenic micro-organisms and other infectious agents and their associated symptoms can be found in appendix 5 . It is not always possible to draw a clear distinction bet ween flora responsible for spoilage and pathogens .Among the micro -organisms which can multiply under nor - mal storage conditions and which can cause spoilage, we also see a number of pathogens (e.g. Bacillus cereus ,Listeria monocytogenes ). larger the metabolic by-products of the micro-organisms responsible for spoilage can also cause symptoms of illness. The food industry must therefore do everything possible to stop the multiplication of micro -organisms, not only to prevent spoilage, but also to protect public health . The severity of foodborne infection/foodborne intoxication symptoms The intestinal tract is the main route by which all the pathogens listed in appendix 5 enter the body .Many foodborne pathogens have therefore specialized in multiplying in the intestines, and their pathogenic properties involve a disruption of the normal bowel functions (enteric symptoms). In most cases, the result is an episode of gas-troenteritis. The prevailing symptoms will vary according to the nature of the organ-ism itself. Bacteria, viruses and protozoa usually cause vomiting, watery diarrhoea, orsymptoms similar to those of dysen tery, with blood and mucus in the faeces and vio- lentstomach cramps. The presence of a tapeworm in the gastrointestinal tract will usually not lead to specific symptoms ,but rather to a general feeling of discomfor t. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 119There are also pathogens which remain presen tin the in testines only briefly, and then migrate to other parts of the body. They may develop a generalized infection (for exam-ple, septic conditions such as typhoid) or they may affect specific organs such as the ner- vous system (including the brain), the liver ,etc.Moreover ,larval st ages of migrating parasites can often cause serious problems elsewhere in the body. Usually, non-enteric symptoms are directly related to the presence of the pathogen in the affected organ ,as in the case of liver damage caused by hepatitis viruses .However ,Haemoly tic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) is caused because toxins of a certain type of Escherichia coli which are produced in the intestines, end up in the kidneys via the bloodstream, where they cause serious damage to the capillary blood vessels and coagulation of platelets, which can lead to acute, and sometimes even chronic, kidney failure. Finally, there are also illnesses which are caused by the immune system at tacking the body 's own cells. This can occur if the same immunologically-active structures (epi- topes) are found on the surface of the micro-organism as on human cells. This phe-nomenon is known as 'molecular mimicry' and is at the root of conditions such asGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and reactive arthritis. 4.2.3 The scale of foodborne infections in the Netherlands and their effect on public health It is extremely difficult to st ate the exact scale of foodborne infections and intoxica- tions in the Netherlands ,orthe resultant impact on public health. This is because many of the people affected do not seek medical assist ance ,or because even if they4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 120Table 4.1: Taxonomy of pathogenic micro-organisms and other infectious agents found in food and their main associated symptoms of disease.

Also, many of the pathogenic micro -organisms and other infectious agents listed here are not found exclusively in food,but can infect humans by other routes, including direct contact with other people or animals, via water (either through consumption or contact, as in swimming)or via the environment in the broadest sense of the term. It is therefore not possible toestablish an adequate surveillance system which can directly quantify the scale and exact health effect of foodborne infections . Indirectly, information relating to the probable incidence of foodborne infections can be inferred from the total number of recorded 'relevant illness reports', together withestimates of the percentage of these reports which are indeed attributable to food. Inprinciple ,two approaches are available: (i) based on the causal pathogenic agents (known as strain or laboratory surveillance ,see textbox 4.3 ), or (ii) based on the result - ing condition or symptoms (known as syndrome surveillance; see textbox 4.4 ).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 121Textbox 4.2: The mechanisms of pathogenic organisms and micro-organisms in food. Infections Infections result from the entry and survival of pathogenic organisms in the intestinal tract.These organisms will then multiply in the intesti-nal tract or elsewhere in the body. In general,infections occur following a single exposure. The'incubation time', being the period between expo-sure and the onset of symptoms, can vary from afew hours to several months, or even severalyears in the case of prions, some bacteria (the mycobacteria) and parasites (e.g. echinococci). Infectious organisms can disrupt the normalfunction of the host in various ways, including theinvasion and destr uction of cells, and the produc- tion of toxins. It is generally assumed that, in the-ory, it takes only one organism to initiate theprocess of infection, although the likelihood ofthis happening is small. The natur eof the symptoms of illness depends primarily on the extent to which the host's immune system is able to control the multiplica-tion of the infectious or ganisms. An extremely effective immune system may prevent any symp- toms appearing at all (i.e. the infection is 'asymp - tomatic'). In many cases, the immune system willbe able to eliminate the pathogenic organism ormicro-organism from the body after a period dur-ing which symptoms ar eappar ent. In some cases, however, the infection will be chronic, resulting in permanent symptoms or even death.This also applies to parasites such as round-worms and tapeworms. The tapeworm Taenia saginata forms an exception to the multiplication rule, in that each lar va ingested will r esult in one new worm, which does not reproduce further. The nature of the symptoms produced will depend onthe number of worms present in the body, and hence on the number of larvae ingested. Intoxications The term 'intoxication' refers to the multiplication of, and toxin production by, pathogenic organismsin the food prior to consumption. Intoxicationscan be acute, as the result of a single exposure (this is usually the case for bacterial toxins), ormay appear after prolonged exposure, as usual in the case of the toxins produced by fungi. Because these mycotoxins lend themselves tothe same analysis as toxic substances, we shallconsider them in mor edetail in section 4.3. The likelihood of becoming ill and the severity of thesymptoms are directly proportional to the quantityof toxin ingested and the harm caused to the host. NB: Although the distinction between 'infections' and 'intoxications' is a useful one, the borderlinebetween the two is not absolute. The pathogenic-ity of many infectious bacteria and some vir uses results from the production of toxins in vivo (inside the body), and ar ether efore also termed toxicoinfections. In the case of intoxications involving the Clostridium perfringens bacterium, toxins are produced during the process of sporeproduction by the vegetative cells pr esent in the food. The Bacillus cereus bacterium has strains which can cause foodborne infection as well assome which cause foodborne intoxication. Clostridium botulinum usually causes a foodborne intoxication, but can (for example when ingestedin honey) r eproduce in the intestinal tract of ver y young children and cause a toxicoinfection. Finally, we may note that much research is conducted into explosive outbreaks of foodborne infections. Of course, this research is primarily intended to resolve theproblem as quickly as possible, but it is also conducted with the associated publicity in mind, and because it can help to reveal where the weak points of our food safety sys-tem lie. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 122Tekstblok 4.3: Strain or laboratory surveillance. In strain or laboratory surveillance, data from medical laboratories is used to determine howoften a given pathogenic organism or micro-organism is identified. Gastroenteritis is a rela-tively mild condition and only a small proportionof patients will consult a doctor. In most cases,the doctor will then advise them to wait until thesymptoms disappear spontaneously. In somecases, generally the most serious ones, or thoseinvolving particularly vulnerable patients, thedoctor will submit a sample of the patient' sfae- ces to a medical micr obiology laborator yin or der to identify the organism responsible for the symp- toms. Only a limited number of micro-organismtypes will be tested for ,and so the r esults ar e biased in favour of the known and expected. Most national surveillance systems are based onthese kind of laboratory statistics. However, thedata represents only the tip of the iceberg: see figure 4.1 .The relative size of this 'tip' varies accor ding to the or ganism involved and by demo - graphic group. Information about the symptoms prompting the laboratory tests is not available,while details of the denominator population andthe adherence areas to which the data refers arenot r outinely available. Laborator ydata is, how - ever, relatively simple to obtain, and can be gath- ered on an ongoing basis. It therefore forms agood basis for a study of trends, assuming that the proportion of patients attending for a consul-tation and the response of doctors will remainunaltered over time. Figure 4.1: Surveillance pyramid for gastroenteri- tis (De Wit, 2002). Reported cases Cases for which laboratory tests are requested Visit to GP No medical consultation Textbox 4.4: Syndrome surveillance. Togain a greater understanding of the degree of selection which takes place in laborator ysurveil- lance, specific studies must be conducted tar get- ing either those patients who consult their doctor or all patients in the population. This type ofresearch is therefore not based on any particularorganism, but on a certain type of illness or set ofsymptoms. Hence the name 'syndrome surveil-lance.' In order to make any statements about thecontribution of various pathogenic agents, sam - ples (e.g. faeces) are collected from registeredpatients and investigated. In the ideal situationsamples from healthy control subjects will also betested. In the Netherlands, this type of r esearch was conducted on a lar ge scale during the period 1996-1999. Inter nationally ,only England and Wales can provide comparable data. In some cases, syndrome surveillance is based on longer-term activities, such as the inclusion of gastroen-teritis cases (since 1996) in the Continuous Mor-bidity Registry maintained by the NetherlandsInstitute for Health Services Research (NIVEL),the mandator yrepor ting of foodborne infections to the Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) and the reg- istration of consumer complaints by the Food andConsumer Product Safety Authority (VWA).Estimated incidence of foodborne infections and the impact on public health An estimate of the overall incidence of foodborne infections in the Netherlands, based onlaboratory and syndrome surveillance, must rely on information derived from several sources. It is therefore subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty. In theNetherlands, relatively good information is available with regard to the incidence ofgastroenteritis and the causal micro-organisms. However, our understanding of otherconditions which may be connected to foodborne infections or intoxications is frag-mentary, deriving in part from laboratory surveillance (e.g. for STEC O157), and inpart on syndrome surveillance (e.g. for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome). Often, the relevant research projects are short-term in nature rather than ongoing. That still leaves a dif- ficult question to be answered: how many of these cases were attributable, directly or indirectly, to infected or contaminated food. Case-control studies have been widelyused, but are subject to a number of limitations. In some cases (such as that of Salmo- nella) a comparison of types of bacteria in certain reservoirs (e.g. farm animals) and inhumans will reveal information concerning the relative contributions of these variousreservoirs. Unofficial estimates of the number of cases of illness resulting from food- borne infections and/or intoxications (hereafter 'foodborne infections') in the Nether-lands var yfrom 2 to 4 million per year (Rougoor et al., 2003). Appendix E of the Health Council of the Netherlands' report on foodborne infections (Gezondheidsraad, 2000) places the estimate of illnesses caused by known pathogens at 250,000 to one millioncases per annum. Some of the data on which the Health Council based its figures (a number of incidence st atistics ,proportion of food-related illnesses) has since been superseded by more accurate information (Van Duynhoven et al., 2001, 2002; Van Pelt et al., 2003; De Wit et al., 2001a, b). This section presents the latest estimates and the trends they reveal . In figure 4.2 the estimates of the incidence of foodborne infections and in toxications in the Netherlands have been summarized as accurately as possible .For a large num - ber of pathogens which can be transmitted in food (whether exclusively or not) the incidence of illness in the total population is given, alongside an indication of the pro- portion of all illnesses attributable to food. As stated above, this fraction is largely unclear for the majority of pathogens, whereupon the figures presented are qualita- tive in nature .Asubstantiation of the data presented for cases of gastroenteritis is to be found in appendix 6 . Gastroenteritis: In 1999, a population study was conducted into the incidence of gas- troenteritis in the Netherlands. It determined the standardized incidence to be 283 cases per 1000 person years .Based on the tot al population ,this is the equivalen tof 4.5 million cases of gastroenteritis per year. The highest incidence is seen among chil- dren, particularly those aged four years or below. Extensive microbiological tests iden-tified the pathogenic micro-organism responsible in 21%viruses, 6% protozoa and 4% bacterial toxins). In words, the cause of 1.6 millioncases of gastroen teritis per annum is known. A proportion of these cases is attributed to foodborne infections .The exact extent to which this happens varies according to the micro -organism concerned (see appendix 6). Based on these st atistics, the numberOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 123of cases of gastroen teritis caused by known pathogens in food is curren tly more than 300,000 to 750,000 per annum (see table 4.2 ). This is between 20% and 50% of the 1.6 million cases of gastroen teritis at tributable to known pathogens. Estimates of the total number of deaths from food -related gastroen teritis are subject to an even lesser degree of accuracy, but are currently placed at between 20 and 200 per year, mostlyamong elderly people. Because the exact cause of the gastroenteritis could be estab- lished in only one third of cases, the figures presented here are likely to be an under- estimate of the actual incidence. It is possible that new pathogens which can, to some exten t, be transmitted in food will be identified in the future. If food were to con- tribute equally to the incidence of gastroen teritis caused by unknown pathogens (3 million cases per year), the number of such cases can be placed between 600,000 and1.3 million per year, being equivalent to a total incidence of between 900,000 and 2million cases of foodborne gastroenteritis per year. Non-enteric complications: In a number of cases, gastroenteritis can lead to further, serious complications, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following a Campylobacterinfection (approximately 60 cases per year), reactive arthritis following various bacter-ial infections (with 1400 cases per annum due to Campylobacter alone; Mangen et al., 2004), and Haemoly tic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) as a complication of infection with Shiga toxin producing E .coli (STEC; 20-30 cases per year; Havelaar et al., 2003). These complications are also responsible for a number of deaths each year ,sometimes4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 124 123456 Incidence (10log number of cases per year)UnknownLowHighExclusively via incidence of foodborne infections in the Netherlands. The severity of illnesses will vary greatly and is not taken into account in this figure (see Appendix 5). Where the name of an organism appears between square brackets, this indicates that the incidence cannot beaccurately established, because the organism is found in approximately the same frequency in patients as in controls, (B. cereus. S. aureus. G. lamblia) or because a causal relationship between the organism and a spe- cific illness has not yet been established (M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease).involving young children. As in the case of gastroenteritis, only a proportion of the cases can be at tributed to foodborne transmission ,depending on the actual micro- organism in question . Other, usually enteric, pathogens cause diseases which, after primary infection, are always severe in nature. They However, for most of these infectious diseases ,the number of cases notified by Dutch doctors to the Health Care Inspectorate is small :no more than ten per year. Moreover, the majority of cases are contracted overseas. The number of cases of hepatitis A (HAV) and toxo-plasmosis ( T. gondii )(several hundreds to thousands per year) is markedly higher, as shown in figure 4.2 .However, the proportion of these cases which can be attributed to the consumption of infected food remains unknown ,asdoes the number of deaths resulting from such infections. It is clear that the number of cases reported to theHealth Care Inspectorate represents only a fraction of the actual incidence. The degree of selection depends on such factors as the seriousness of the disease and theneed for measures such as source and contact-tracing. Based on serological research(the P IENTER project, De Melker Conijn-van Spaendonck, 1998), the number of cases of Toxoplasma infection has been estimated at 12,000 per year. The majority are asymptomatic or presen tonly mild symptoms (Kor tbeek, personal 4 125Table 4.2: Incidence of food-related gastroenteritis caused by known pathogens in the Netherlands.* Organism Incidence Food Incidence gastroenteritis attributable food-related (per year, all causes) fraction gastroenteritis (per year) Campylobacter spp. 107,000 0.3 - 0.9 48,200 - 53,500 Shigella spp. 1,000 - 10,000 0.1 - 0.5 100 - 5,000 Escherichia coli O157 1,250 0.5 - 0.9 625 - 1,125 Yersinia enterocolotica 1,000 - 10,000 > 0.9 900 - 1,000 Total infectious bacteria 82,000 - 146,000 Clostridium perfringens toxins 147,000 1 147,000 0 - 236,000 Bacillus cereus toxines 0 - 35,700 1 bacteria 147,000 - 419,000 Norovirus 499,500 0.1 - 0.2 50,000 - 100,000 Sapovirus 107,000 0 - 0.1 0 - 10,700Rotavirus groep A 191,800 0 - 0.1 0 - 19,200 Total viruses 50,000 - 130,000 Giardia lamblia 0-165,000 < 0.3 0 - 50,000 Total protozoa 0 - 50,000 Total known microorganisms 279,000 - 745,000 *Based on studies in 1996-1999, see Appendix 6 for a more detailed substantiation.Comparison of the Dutch situation with that in other countries In many other industrialized countries as well, only general statistics relating to food- borne infections are available. Most have only the data derived from laboratory sur- veillance. Nothing is known concerning differences in the extent of under-reporting,which makes a direct comparison of the statistics from the various countries quite dif-ficult. A few countries have produced estimates similar to those of the Health Councilof the Netherlands (2000) and those presented in this chapter. The estimates for theUnited States were published in 1999 (Mead et al., 1999), and reveal a total of 76 mil- lion cases of illness, 14 million of which were caused by known pathogens. When adjusted according for the Dutch population figures, this is the equivalent of more than 800,000 cases due to known pathogens, being comparable to the upper limit of the Dutch estimates. Unlike the Netherlands, the United States has no reliable dataconcerning the incidence of gastroenteritis in the general population, and the pathogens responsible. Apart from the Netherlands, only England and Wales have col-lected such data (for the period 1993-1995) by means of a longitudinal populationstudy (Wheeler et al., 1999). A comparison of the Dutch situation with that in England and Wales suggests that the incidence of gastroenteritis is markedly higher in theNetherlands (283 per 1,000 person years against 190 per 1,000; Wheeler et al., 1999; De Wit et al., 2001b). However, given a clear difference in the proportion of gastroen- teritis patients consulting a general practitioner in the Netherlands (approximatelyone in twenty will do so compared to almost one in six in England and Wales), the incidence of gastroen teritis as presen ted to a physician is lower in the Netherlands than in England and Wales (Wheeler et al., 1999, De Wit et al., 2001c). Based on these statistics, Adak et al.(2002) estimate that there were approximately 2.4 million cases of foodborne infections and in toxications in England and W ales in 1995 (population approximately 60 million), with 21,000 hospital admissions and more than 720 deaths .By 2000, these figures had fallen to 1.3 million cases ,21,000 hospital admis- sions and 480 deaths . Trends in foodborne infections in the Netherlands To follow the trends in gastroenteritis and some of the micro-organisms responsible, we can use the data relating to patient consultations for gastroenteritis taken from the Continuous Morbidity Registration Centres (CMR sentinel stations) maintained by the NIVEL, and from laboratory surveillance systems such as the Infectious Diseases Sur- veillance Information System (ISIS), the Laboratory Surveillance of Infectious Diseases(LSI), and weekly virological reports (produced by the Clinical Virology Workgroup). The CMR includes information relating to consult ations for gastroen teritis during the periods 1992/1993 and from 1996 onwards. Between 1992 and 1999, the number of consultations fluctuated from 53 to 71 per 10,000 person years. In 2000, the figurerose to 91 per 10,000, the greatest increase being seen in male children under the ageof one year and, to a lesser extent, in children of both sexes aged between 1 and 9(Bartelds, 2001). In 2001, the figure rose yet further to 101 consultations per 10,000 head of population .The cause of this increase remains unclear, and it is not known whether food played any par t. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 126Statistics produced by the LSI show a gradually decreasing trend in the incidence of salmonellosis, beginning in the 1980s (see figure 4.3 ). Temporary deviations from this trend may be seen, as in the mid-1990s (primarily due to the presence of S.Enteritidis in eggs). In 2001, there was a rise in the number of isolated (multiresistant) S. Typhimurium DT 104 identified (Van Pelt et al., 2003, 2001). In 2003, the import of infected eggs further to the avian influenza crisis resulted in another rise in the inci-dence of S.enteritidis (Mevius & Van Pelt, 2004). Statistics relating to the incidence of Campylobacter have been kept since 1996 and show no clear trend, whether upwardsor downwards. As shown by figure 4.3 ,the vast majority of Salmonella infections are due to infected food (cross-contamination included). In the case of Campylobacter, the relative role of food in relation to other risk factors (e.g. contact with pets, contami- nated water, foreign travel) is less clear (Havelaar 2002, Evers et al., 2004). Outbreaks of foodborne infections Outbreaks of foodborne infections provide another, albeit limited, source of informa- tion about the incidence and trends in such infections (see textbox 4.5 ).In the period from 1999 to 2002, between 300 and 350 explosive outbreaks were reported to theFood and Consumer Product Safet yAuthorit y(the former Inspectorate for Health Pro - tection and Veterinary Public Health, KvW) each year, involving a total of between 1,500 and 1,800 cases of illness per year (Van Duynhoven et al., 2001; 2003). In almost three quarters of these explosive outbreaks, the implicated food products had beenOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 127 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,00010,000 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003025,00050,00075,000100,000125,000150,000 Travel/other Cattle Pig Layer hens/reproduction/eggs Broiler chicken/products SalmonellosisingeneralpopulationLabconfirmedsalmonellosisFigure 4.3: T rends in salmonellosis in the Netherlands. The figure shows the trend in the number of registered cases of salmonellosis as identified by laboratory sur - veillance (left y axis) and an extrapolation to the total number of cases in the Dutch population (right yaxis). The extrapolation factor is derived from recent epidemiological studies (V an Pelt et al., 2003). Also shown is the fraction of all cases of salmonellosis which can be attributed to various food sources.

The pathogen thought to be responsible for symptoms was identified in 12% to 18% of the outbreaks investigated by the VWA, themost frequen tly obser ved being Bacillus cereus and Salmonella spp.Where samples of the suspect food were available for analysis (20-30% of explosive outbreaks), it was pos- sible to identify the pathogen in a far greater number of cases, i.e. 35-55% (Van Duyn-hoven et al., 2001, 2003). The number of outbreaks reported to the Health Care Inspectorate in each year between 1999 and 2002 ranged from 60 to 100, with some four hundred people affected each year .Salmonella spp.was most frequen tly repor ted as the responsible pathogen, followed by Campylobacter spp. However, it should be noted that samples of the food and of the faeces of the victims are rarely investigated for viruses or parasites . In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that noroviruses form a more signifi- cant cause of foodborne infections in the Netherlands than had previously been assumed (De Wit et al., 2003; Van Duynhoven et al., 2001, 2003. See also textbox 4.6 ). 4.2.4 Factors which influence microbial food quality Pathogenic micro-organisms usually occur in specific types of food. Most organisms are often found in particular products and not in others. This is because the micro- organism requires cer tain conditions in order to sur vive or reproduce .Some micro - organisms, such as parasites, have a specific life cycle which depends entirely upon a certain host species. For example, the tapeworm Taenia saginata has a cycle which is restricted to humans and cattle. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 128Textbox 4.5: Outbreaks of foodborne infections in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, explosive outbreaks of food infections and intoxications are investigated bythe local health departments (GGDs) and, wherethere is reasonable cause to suspect that anoffence has been committed, by the Food andConsumer Product Safety Authority (VWA). TheVWA investigation will usually centre on theinfected food and the place of its preparation.Under the Infectieziektewet (Infectious Diseases Act), doctors are obliged to notify the Health CareInspectorate (IGZ) if two or more related cases offoodborne infection or intoxication are presented.All cases in which the patient is employed in thefood industry or (residential) care services shouldbe reported to the Inspectorate as well. However,it is known that the number of reports made represent only a small proportion of the actualnumber of food-related outbreaks. In most cases,only the larger explosive outbreaks, those associ-ated with a particular restaurant, those linked tosocial events and those which result in seriousillness, hospital admission or death are reported(Van Duynhoven et al., 2001, 2003). Nevertheless,agreater proportion (25% - 40%) of the incidents reported to the Health Care Inspectorate relate toasingle household. Private households fall outside the regulatory responsibility of the VWA,which will therefore not investigate suchincidents. Appendix 7 includes a list of the pathogenic micro-organisms associated with certain categories of foods. The table clearly shows that pathogenic bacteria, parasites(helminths, protozoa) and prions are particularly associated with meat and animalproduct s. Most viruses have only humans as hosts. They can be transferred to vegeta- bles,fruit and shellfish via faecal contamination. Some viruses have recently been shown to be ' zoonotic ', i.e. they can be transmitted from humans to animals and viceOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 129Textbox 4.6: Noroviruses as food contaminants. Noroviruses (NoV; formerly described as 'Nor- walk-like viruses and 'small-round-structuredviruses') are RNA viruses which belong to the Norovirus genus ofthe Caliciviridae family .NoV are known to cause gastroenteritis in humans,and are a notorious cause of outbreaks in peopleof all ages. NoV will give rise to actual symptomsin 30-50% of all persons exposed to the virus,regardless of age. However, the highest inci-dence is seen among children. Following an aver-age incubation time of one to three days, fever,nausea, headache and diarrhoea will appear asthe most conspicuous clinical symptoms. Therewill be no blood or mucus in stools. The symptomsgenerally persist for approximately two days inpersons of (otherwise) good health, but cansometimes last much longer, particularly inchildren under the age of one year (median 6days, Rockx etal., 2002) and elderly people. Virus shedding is via vomit and faeces, and cancontinue for up to three weeks following theonset of symptoms. Persistent infections in per-sons with compr omised immunity have r ecently been reported, as have some deaths associated with outbreaks of NoV, particularly in residentialcare facilities. However, the scale of these phe-nomena has not been subject to targetedresearch. There are some indications to suggestthat susceptibility to NoV may be geneticallydetermined.The NoV are particularly contagious, wherebysecondar yinfections are common. This may lead to gastroenteritis spreading rapidly where people live in close pr oximity ,such as residential care homes and cruise ships. The high infectivity and resistance of NoV ,and the widespr ead contami- nation of surfaces due to aerosols of virus-laden vomit, explain why the infection, once establishedin a par ticular setting, can persist for a long time. NoV can be introduced into a vulnerable group by infected individuals (r egardless of whether or not they exhibit symptoms), or via infected water orfood. Shellfish and fr esh fruit have often been implicated, but in fact outbreaks involving many types of hand-prepared, hand-harvested and/oruncooked food have been described. The r ole ofzoonotic transmission (i.e. from humans to ani- mals or vice versa) remains unclear. This routehas never been demonstrated, although virusessimilar to NoV have been detected in pigs andcattle. The large-scale international spread of NoV infood has been described. A newly identified riskis that of the creation of recombinant (new) virus-es by simultaneous infection of a host with tworelated NoV strains. In 2002, a significantincrease in outbreaks of illness was reportedthroughout much of Europe, caused by a newNoV strain. This emerged simultaneously in sev-eral countries in January 2002, and supplantedthe endemically prevalent strains as the maincause of outbreaks by the summer of the sameyear. The prevention of NoV infection seems particular-ly impor tant in products which are eaten raw, or after minimal processing, (particularly shellfish,fruit and vegetables), and on the further process-ing of food following heat treatment. In the caseof shellfish, it has been established that the cur - rent EU directives are not fully adequate. Work has commenced on the development of qualityindicators for viral infection. In the case of agri-cultural produce, the quality of irrigation waterand strict hygiene during harvesting are of partic-ular impor tance, as is the fur ther pr ocessing of the produce. Subsequent infection of food can only be prevented with strict hygiene, whichincludes guidelines for the exclusion of infectedpersons from food preparation areas. CurrentHACCP pr otocol should be car efully re-evaluated in terms of the protection they provide against viral infection. One pr oblem in this r egar dis that the detection of viruses in food products other than shellfish is still in its infancy .For the time being, tracing the causes of foodbor ne viral infections must therefore rely on active surveil- lance, for which the monitoring of outbr eaks in combination with molecular classification pr e- sents an adequate means of investigating infec - tions with a common source. For further informa- tion, refer to Koopmans & Duizer (2004).versa. They include the hepatitis-E virus. The noroviruses form a special case, in that they often appear as post-contamination on prepared food, transmitted via infectedfood handlers (see textbox 4.6 ). In general, foods which are cooked or heated during preparation pose a lesser risk than those eaten raw. When food enters the kitchen in a raw state, there is some riskof cross-contamination, whereby other components of the meal (e.g. salad) will becontaminated. This risk can be markedly higher than that posed by food which hasbeen inadequately heated, and is also far more difficult to manage. Whether the food we eat contains pathogenic micro-organisms depends on good safety management throughout the entire chain, from primary production to prepa-ration in the kitchen. Food production chains are complex, are becoming longer and have a greater geographic distribution than in the past. The import and export of rawmaterials used in the primary production process, of prepared foods and of the neces-sary ingredients are becoming increasingly important, and the dietary preferences of the Dutch consumer are changing all the time. Pathogenic micro-organisms can beintroduced in to food at various poin tsof the supply chain. Similarly, there are often opportunities to prevent or reduce contamination. Any consideration of food safety must therefore encompass the entire chain, from primary production to preparationand storage of meals. We now offer a brief account of the current information relat- ing to the occurrence of pathogens in various st ages of the food production chain , how they enter that chain, and how the risks can be (better) managed. a.The food production chain Primary production The basic requiremen tfor the safe production of foods is that con tamination of pri- maryproduct s,whether agricultural ,horticultural or dairy products, should be avoid- ed as much as possible. As appendix 7 illustrates, it is the foods of animal origin which are most prone to infection by a wide range of pathogens. Much attention has there- fore been devoted to the safety of this product group in the past, and a relatively large body of information concerning the incidence of pathogens is available (see for exam- ple textbox 4.7 ). In the Netherlands, some pathogens have since long been effectively controlled by means of targeted prevention programmes. Further to the relevant European Uniondirectives, Dutch cattle have been officially declared free of Brucella abortis and Mycobacterium bovis. Similarly, Trichinella spiralis has not been found in Dutch pigs since 1979 (Van Pelt & Valkenburgh, 2002). Ongoing surveillance programmes areconducted in order to monitor this situation. A positive test result is now extremelyrare. In recent years, special attention has been devoted to the infection of cattle withthe BSE prion. The prevalence in the Netherlands is extremely low: in 2001, over530,000 beef cat tle were tested with only twenty positive results (six of which related to cows which already displayed symptoms consisten twith those of BSE). The animals which tested positive were removed from the food chain (Hun tley et al., 2002).4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 130There is also a number of pathogens which are not yet under control, such as Campy- lobacter (see also textbox 4.7 )or which have only recen tly been iden tified ,such as the hepatitis E virus. Better management of these pathogens will result in a reduction of the burden of disease within the Dutch population .The action to be t aken often includes ensuring the segregation of farm animals from those living in the wild andfrom the environment. However, this is inconsistent with society's desire for more'animal-friendly' production, which means that an increase in the prevalence of cer- tain pathogens is more likely than any decrease in the foreseeable future. There is also some risk of the re-emergence of pathogens which have been brought under control but which con tinue to exist in wild animals. These include trichinellas. The safety of the food available in the Netherlands is only partly determined by the hygiene status in the primary production process. A large proportion of the food con-sumed in the Netherlands is actually imported from other countries, while the greater partof Dutch food manufacturing is expor ted elsewhere .It remains ver ydifficult to obtain good quantitative information concerning the import and export flows, and even more difficult to obtain information concerning the prevalence of pathogens inor on imported products (see also textbox 7.2 in chapter 7 ). Accordingly, it is very diffi- cult to make firm statements with regard to the health risks faced by Dutch con-sumers .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 131Textbox 4.7: Monitoring/surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in farm animals. In 1997, the RIVM joined the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) in implementing amonitoring programme examining trends in theprevalence of zoonotic pathogens in farm ani-mals. Each year between 1997 and 2002, approxi-mately eight hundred groups of animals (flocks ofchickens kept for egg production, and chickensintended for consumption, herds of pigs, dairycows and veal calves) were tested for Salmonel- laspp., Campylobacter spp. and/or verocytotoxin producing E. coli O157. The results for 1998 to 2002 were reported (Bouwknegt et al ., 2003, 2004) and show that the estimated prevalence of Salmonella inboth types of poultr yfell significantly during the period, from 20% to just over 10%. Salmonellawas found in approximately 30% of the pig herdstested. The prevalence in dairy cows and vealcalves was below 10% throughout the study peri-od. S. Enteritidis (a ser otype which can be trans - mitted via eggs) was the most prevalent serotype among the laying hens, while (from 2000) S. paratyphi Bvar.Java was the most prevalent strain in broiler chickens, occurring in 33% of theflocks that tested positive in 2002. This strainaccounts for r elatively few cases of illness inhumans, but has multiple resistance to antibiotics (flumequine and ciprofloxacin in particular). Thedominant pathogen in pigs was S.typhimurium, with increasing prevalence of the multiresistantphage type DT104 in the study period. The preva-lence of Campylobacter in broiler chickens fluc-tuated between 15% and 30%. The estimatedprevalence of E. coli O157 in dairy cows increased from 8% to 14% between 2000 and2002. An increase in this pathogen was also seenin veal calves during the study period, possiblydue to the disproportionately high number of'ros\u00e9' calves in the sample. These are associatedwith an elevated risk of E. coli infection, whereby the cur rent shift in consumer preference from white veal to ros\u00e9 may result in an increasedinfection risk for humans. In addition, the RIVM conducts thematic researchinto other pathogens, including viruses (rota-,noro- and hepatitis-A) and pr otozoa. Detailed information about zoonotic pathogens in the Netherlands can be found in the annual report tothe European Commission, as required by the EU'Zoonosis Directive' (Anon., 1992, Van Pelt &Valkenburgh, 2002).The prevention of contamination in the primary production process is clearly the pre- ferred approach, but can be hampered by practical problems. It therefore maybecome appropriate to implement additional measures further along the food chain, although this should not detract from efforts to prevent contamination at the source. Processing The processing of primary products into foods that are marketed (slaughtering, pro- cessing industry) presents opportunities to extensively reduce the levels of pathogenswhich reach the final consumer product. A familiar example is the pasteurization of milk, which effectively eliminates a range of pathogens, notably Mycobacterium bovis , STEC O157 hygiene proto- cols (GHP, GMP and HACCP), the processing stage represents an effective barrier. Inrecent years, the decontamination of certain types of meat has been advocated as an effective intervention. This may be appropriate for chicken meat and for beef intend-ed for the production of raw or rare-cooked products such as steak tartar and ham-burgers. Most decontamination methods do not result in the complete eradication of pathogens, but they do account for a considerable reduction in the number ofpathogens in meat. This could accoun tfor a marked reduction in the health risk. In terms of public health, minimally processed refrigerated foods also demand specif- ic attention. Such products form a suitable environment for the survival and multipli- cation of spore -forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus. of these products with pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes can also present problems. Modifications to preservation methods, packaging materials, etc., also demand ongo- ing adjustmen tsto the monitoring programmes .Monitoring the effectiveness of mea - sures implemented during processing usually relies on general hygiene indicators, such as the tot al number of viable bacteria ,or the presence of specific groups such as the Enterobacteriaceae .Statistics relating to these indicators are readily available ,but there is little direct information relating to the prevalence of pathogens during pro-cessing. For example, in 1999 the former Inspectorate for Health Protection and Vet- erinary Public Health (KvW), now named Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA), conducted 187,000 microbiological analyses. Of these, 102,000 (55%) focused on non -pathogenic bacteria (as indicators of hygiene and process control), 60,000 (32%) on toxin -forming bacteria, and 25,000 (13%) on infectious pathogens, 9,000 of which were specifically testing for Listeria monocytogenes .Acomparison with table 4.4 sug- gests that the VWA's research is therefore primarily intended to reveal incidents inwhich the set standards have been exceeded. The lack of any standards for the main infectious pathogens in unprocessed ,raw foods and beverages is ,indirectly, the cause of the paucity of information with regard to their prevalence. Targeted surveillance programmes should be implemented to rectify this situation (see also textbox 4.8 ). Distribution During the distribution of food and food product s, the observance of general hygiene guidelines ,including the use of effective refrigeration, is extremely important. Here too,much of the research conducted to date ,whether by the government or the4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 132industry itself, has been geared to ensuring compliance with hygiene indicators although there has also been some specific research into the prevalence of certainspecific pathogens. For some years, the VWA has been conducting a surveillance pro- gramme to establish which pathogens are to be found in which products, and at whatlevels. Since 1999, the prevalence of a number of known pathogens in various types offood products has been monitored. To date, details of such contamination have beenestablished for a considerable number of product groups of all types (animal, veg-etable and composite). (For further information, see Ware(n)chemicus ,2000). One ongoing programme is the 'chicken monitoring' study (see textbox 4.8 ). Consumer exposure The consumer or more generally, everyone who is involved in the purchase, storage and preparation of food, whether professionally or at home, is the final link in the chain, and an important one. It must be possible for the consumer to opt for safe food, particularly in the case of the high-risk groups. Pregnant women, for example, may choose to preven tlisteriosis and toxoplasmosis by avoiding all raw meat, soft cheese, smoked fish and fresh product swhich have been stored for too long. The consumer can prevent many problems by ensuring that food is stored and prepared properly.Many foods are cooked or heated prior to consumption, which reduces the number ofpractically all pathogens to a negligible level. However, this effect can be undone if inadequate measures to preven tcross -contamination bet ween raw ingredients and prepared foods (e.g. transmission of Campylobacter) are taken, or if the person preparing the food is himself or herself a source of pathogens which will contaminatethe food (as in the case of noroviruses). Recent research (Griffiths et al., 1998; Clayton et al., 2002; EFFI, 2002; Redmond & Griffiths, 2003) has clearly shown that, despite adequate knowledge ,unsafe food-handling practices are common, both in the home and in professionally -run kitchens. Food preparers generally state that they consider their food -handling practices to be less hazardous than those of others ,acommonlyOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 133Textbox 4.8: Monitoring chicken products in retail trade by the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA). In 1986, the for mer Inspectorate for Health Pro- tection and Veterinary Public Health (KvW) com-menced a monitoring programme to determinethe average percentage (per year) of chickenproducts contaminated with Salmonella spp.(including S. enteritidis) and thermophilic Campy- lobacter spp. Since 1996, this information has been collectedaccor ding to an inter national standardized proto- col, for the purposes of the mandator yrepor t within the framework of the European 'Zoonosis Directive'. Since 2002, the study has also exam-ined the Salmonella isolates to deter mine the degree of resistance to certain antibiotics and/or growth pr omoters. Each year, 1600 samples are collected from the various categories of direct suppliers (supermar-kets, butchers and poulter ers) according to their proportionate market share. In 2002, Salmonellawas found in 13.4% of the samples (with S. Enteri-tidis in 0.3%). Campylobacter was found in 31.3%of the samples (Van der Zee & Wit, 2003). Over50% of the Salmonella isolates were of the strain S. paratyphi var.Java, a serotype that rarely causes illness in humans, but which has multiple resistance against antibiotics (especially flume - quine and cipr ofloxacin). A comparison with the results of preceding years shows that the preva- lence of Salmonella contamination is graduallydecr easing. That of Campylobacter fluctuates from year to year, but does not yet show any per- manent downwar ds tr end. encountered and biased view of one's own abilities (Weinstein, 1989; see also section 8.2). In theory, a substantial health gain can be achieved in the consumer phase, although in practice it will be difficult to change the consumer's hygiene habits. Re- commendations in this regard have been presented in various hygiene codes, includ-ing those targeting the domestic kitchen. Accordingly, ongoing hygiene education topromote the safe storage and preparation of food continues to be necessary. It wouldbe appropriate to devote renewed attention to this topic in the school setting. Howev-er, very little is known about the effects of information and education on actualbehaviour. Based on research into outbreaks of foodborne infections and intoxications, it is possi- ble to form an impression of where the main problems arise (see table 4.3 ). It would appear that the majority of reports made to the VWA relate to food prepared on com- mercial premises. The Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) handles a greater number ofreports relating to foodborne infections in the domestic setting or in health care insti-tutes such as residential care facilities. It should be noted that the reports are subject to a high degree of selectivity, with the emphasis on cases of illness which can bereadily associated in time and place ,with the suspect food having been consumed in a location other than one's own home. b. Setting standards and comparing intervention opportunities In recen tyears, efforts to ensure food safety have seen a shift in focus, from inspection of the end product to process con trol. Process control according to the HACCP system (Hazards Analysis Critical Control Points) is intended to provide adequate manage-ment of all relevant risks. Additional microbiological 'guideline values' have been for-mulated for the purposes of verification of process control. The primary risk manage- mentactivities focus on the ' Critical Con trol P oints' (CCPs), such as preventing inadequate heating and post-contamination. In the Netherlands, a number of standards have been set with regard to certain path- ogenic micro-organisms, see table 4.4 .Most relate to end product control. The stan- dards do not apply to unprocessed ,raw foods and beverages, although these are responsible for the majorit yof cases of illness. For several years, efforts have been ongoing to harmonize the criteria for micro -organisms in food and/or the production4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 134Table 4.3: The origin of foods implicated in outbreaks of foodborne infections and intoxications, 1999-2002 (Van Duynhoven et al., 2003).

These standards will focus on both the end products and the safety of the preparation processes, in a system based on HACCPprinciples and suitable for batch control, verification and validation. The criteria are expected to come into effect in 2006 or 2007 (Anon., 2003c). In 1997, the Product Board for Poultry and Eggs implemented a number of action plans intended to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter in poultry forconsumption ,and that of Salmonella in eg gs.However ,the objectives agreed with the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport - reduction in contamination of end products to less than 10% of flocks for Salmonella and to less than 15% of flocks for Campylobacterwithin two-and-a-half years - were not achieved. Supplementary measures were there- fore agreed in 2000, accompanied by additional t arget s. In a letter dated 15 December 2003, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport and the Minister of Agriculture, Natureand Food Quality announced in the Regular Consultation Meetings on the Consumer Goods Act in the Netherlands ,that,in an ticipation of E Ulegislation ,the st andards stated in table 4.4 would henceforth apply to all poultry sold for consumption. As we saw in chapter 2 ,anumber of diet aryfactors ,such as too much saturated fat and inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables, have a marked impact on health due to their association with a number of chronic diseases. The quantitative informa- tion gives an indication of the health gain to be made through preventive interven- tions which succeed in lowering the number of Dutch people facing one or more of the st ated risk factors. It further offers an impression of the relative importance of pre- ventive interventions (measures and activities) targeting each of the risk factors indi- vidually. This type of quantitative information is not available with regard to the determinants of foodborne infections .Although it is indeed known how of ten cer tain product groups are contaminated with certain pathogens, this does not provide any insight into the Dutch consumer's exposure to pathogens in food, since this will be deter-mined by a number of variables which have not - or can not - be quantified. The vari-ables include the prevalence of contamination in prepared foods, the number ofpathogens in or on the con taminated food, the frequency of consumption and the quan tities consumed. It is not possible to measure all these factors, a fact which ren- ders the model -based approach increasingly impor tant. This attempts to describe theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 135Table 4.4: Standards for pathogenic micro-organisms in foods (art. 4, BBI Commodities Act). Micro-organism Criterion Salmonella spp Not detectable in 25 g or ml Campylobacter spp Not detectable in 25 g or ml Listeria monocytogenes Not detectable in 0.01 g or ml Staphylococcus aureus No more than 100,000 per g or ml Bacillus cereus Nomore than 100,000 per g or ml Clostridium perfringens No more than 100,000 per g or ml N.B. These standards do not apply to raw, unprocessed foods and beverages. dynamics of contamination in food chains using mathematical models, whereupon the likely effect of an intervention can be assessed: the 'microbiological risk assess-ment'. The models developed can be linked to economic models to provide an indica- tion of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed measures. Over the past ten years, riskassessment models have been under development both in the Netherlands and else-where, with the prime focus on Salmonella spp. in chicken and eggs, Campylobacter spp. in chicken, STEC O157 in beef and Listeria monocytogenes in food products for immediate consumption (see Nauta et al ., 2001; 2003, Anon. 2003b, and http://www.who.int/foodsafety/micro/jemra/en/). One example is the CARMA project, which has been subsidized since 2001 by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority) and the Ministry of Agricul- ture, Nature and Food Quality (see textbox 4.9 ).4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 136Textbox 4.9: The CARMA project: Campylobacter Risk Management and Assessment. The objective of the CARMA project is to advise the Dutch government on the effectiveness andefficiency of measures intended to reduce the incidence of campylobacteriosis among the Dutch population. The pr oject is multidisciplinar y, involv- ing the input mathematical economists socialscientists. Poultr yis a significant sour ce of Campylobacter infection in humans, but it is not the only source. Campylobacter is also to be found in other farmanimals, in surface water, on raw vegetables andonfish products. Many Dutch people are infected during a trip abroad. CARMA aims to compare thesignificance of each of these possible infection routes. In the case of the infection route throughchicken (meat), ther ewill be an extensive study to determine the costs and likely effects of proposed measur es. This will involve collecting all r elevant information, which will then be used to build mathematical and economic models. The projectwill also examine the attitudes of various socialgroups to the Campylobacter pr oblem and its pos - sible solutions. The structure of the project is shown in the figure below. For further information,see Bogaardt etal., 2004 and www.rivm.nl/carma. The risk assessment model is focussed on the production chain for poultry products (primaryproduction, slaughter, preparation), and includesan exposure model, a dose-response model andan integration module to estimate the number ofCampylobacter Infections per year .The model will then be used to assess the effect of interven-tions at various points in the exposure chain. Theresults of the risk model for mthe input for an eco - nomic model, in which the extent of health lossand associated costs due to campylobacteriosis are calculated. The model will also calculate thepotential health gain and reduction in costs whichcan be achieved. Based on this information, thecost-effectiveness ratio can be calculated, show-ing the net costs of each year of (healthy) lifeexpectancy gained, or those of each case of dis-ease or death averted. This enables a comparisonof various types of inter vention. Economic analysisAcceptance level for interventions Political culturePolitical decision-makingCost-ef fectiveness analysisRisk assess mentAnew instrument which can be used to establish standards for foodborne pathogens is the 'Food Safety Objectives' (FSOs). The FSO concept is currently the topic of con-siderable international discussion. FSOs set limits on the occurrence of pathogens in food at the moment of consumption ,this being directly linked to an explicitly stated 'Appropriate Level of Protection' further to the World Trade Organization's Sanitaryand Phytosanitary Agreement. Risk assessment is an important aid to the formulationand substantiation of FSOs, which are emphatically not intended as instruments formonitoring or enforcement. Rather, they are 'design principles' for safe food prepara-tion which should be entirely in line with previous safety criteria. In practice, 'perfor- mance objectives' and 'performance criteria' will be derived from the FSOs, indicating the degree of control required to manage the risk of a particular hazard in a particu- lar process phase (e.g. a reduction by a given factor). The process criteria (such astime-temperature combinations for cooking or heating) can then be formulated. It is these process criteria that lend themselves well to (ongoing) monitoring. FSOs shouldbe seen as a supplement to existing hygiene codes such as the 'Good Hygiene Prac-tices' and the HACCP system. The HACCP instruments traditionally used to verify the process will therefore remain in effect. 4.2.5 The most important foodborne pathogenic micro-organisms in terms of possible health gain Based on the foregoing, we may state that the prevalence of pathogenic micro-organ- isms in food is still considerable, as is the health loss attributable to foodborne infec- tions and in toxications .The question is then :what are the main pathogenic micro - organisms which must be addressed in view of both incidence and the severity of the health effect sobser ved? In other words, for which of the micro-organisms is the great- est poten tial health gain to be achieved by means of supplemen tarymeasures? The main foodborne pathogens responsible for of) Clostridium perfringens and the noroviruses. Between them, these are responsible for almost half of all cases of gas- troen teritis and related deaths further to foodborne infections and intoxications (see appendix 6 ). Effective reduction or elimination of these pathogens would ,in theory, result in the avoidance of between 280,000 and 380,000 cases of gastroenteritis peryear, and the associated 10 to 100 deaths. Similarly, reduction or elimination of Toxo- plasma gondii infections could result in several hundred fewer cases of congenital and ocular toxoplasmosis ,and the associated mor tality.Given the serious nature of their effects, infections involving L. monocytogenes are also significant despite the relatively low incidence of this pathogen. The toxins of S. aureus and B. cereus may be significant in terms of health gain, but their actual significance remains unclear and it is not pos-sible to give any accurate estimate of the number of avoidable cases of illness. However ,this is not to suggest that attention should be focused on these pathogens alone .Even where the number of cases of illness is small ,measures are indicated if theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 137effects are serious or can lead to death, especially if they can be implemented at rela- tively low cost. Examples include measures to reduce the incidence of STEC O157 (see table 4.7 )and Enterobacter sakazakii .The process of prioritization will also depend on criteria such as costs, trends, avoidability, risk perception (as determined by such fac-tors as the likelihood of explosive outbreaks) and the health gain already made andmaintained in the past. The RIVM commenced a structural analysis of these criteria in2004. The actual disease burden or health loss attributable to the presence of micro-organ- isms in our food can be calculated in terms of DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years). This unit of measurement comprises two factors: the life-years lost due to premature death, and the years lived in poor health (see appendices 8 and 12 ). The health loss is, by definition, also the health gain to be achieved if adequate preventive measures are implemented and activities undertaken to negate exposure entirely. With some 300,000 to 750,000 cases of illness (mainly gastroenteritis), approximately 25,000 visits to the GP, and 20 to 200 deaths per year, foodborne infections account forahealth loss of bet ween 1,000 and 4,000 D ALYsper annum (see calculation in appen - dix 8 ). This is more than can be attributed to tuberculosis, and comparable to prob- lems such as (bacterial) meningitis and bacterial STDs, as shown in table 4.5 .If the esti- mated incidence of non-identified pathogens is included in the figures, the disease burden could well rise to bet ween 3,000 and 10,000 D ALYs per year, comparable to that attributable to AIDS or upper respiratory tract infections, but still lower than thatdue to pneumonia, acute bronchitis and acute bronchiolitis. Despite the relatively low mortalityrate,the calculations (see appendix 8 )indicate that deaths do make a sub - stantial contribution to the overall disease burden. For the time being ,the calculation of D ALYsattributable to foodborne infections is based on the effects of gastroenteritis. Other, non-enteric symptoms or consequences of (specific) foodborne infections have not been taken into account at this stage. In the case of campylobacteriosis, for example, the inclusion of the secondary effects would4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 138Table 4.5: Disease burden due to various infectious diseases.

As shown in table 4.6 ,one case of campylobacteriosis in every 1,000 to 2,000 leads to the development of Guil-lain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, being the equivalent of approximately 60 extra cases of illness and approximately two deaths a year, and hence an additional disease burden of 299DALYs (Havelaar et al., 2000, Mangen et al., 2004). Another secondary complication of campylobacteriosis is reactive arthritis, which accounts for 1,400 additional cases ofillness each year and to an extra disease burden of 126 DALYs. With a health loss of1,185 DALYs, the problem of campylobacteriosis is therefore comparable to those oftuberculosis, bacterial STDs and bacterial meningitis (1,300, 2,400 and 2,600 DALYs respectively), as mentioned in table 4.5 .Between 30-80% of Campylobacter infections are attributed to contaminated food (see appendix 6 ). Table 4.7 shows that another foodborne pathogen, STEC O157, is directly or indirectly responsible for approximately 90% of the disease burden due to Haemolytic UraemicSyndrome (including the consequent end stage renal disease; Havelaar et al., 2003).The difference in severity between the various symptoms and conditions caused by these two organisms is made clear by the comparison of the average disease burdenper 1,000 cases of gastroen teritis :15 D ALYs for Campylobacter and 55 DALYs in theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 139Table 4.6: Annual disease burden and costs of illness attributable to campylobacteriosis (all sources) in the Netherlands (Mangen et al., 2004) Clinical symptoms Total Gastroenteritis Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Reactive arthritis Inflammatory Syndrome bowel disease Incidence 80,000 60 1.400 10 Mortality 30 2 - - DALY11.185 634 298 126 127 YLD 752 234 266 126 127YLL 433 400 32 n.a. n.a.

Some 50-90% of all STEC to contami- nated food (see appendix 6 ). Table 4.6 also shows that the social costs of campylobacteriosis amount to approxi- mately 21 million euros per annum, of which approximately two thirds is accountedfor by short-term absence from work due to gastroenteritis. No calculation of the totalcosts of all foodborne infections and intoxications has yet been made, but extrapola-tion of the figures for campylobacteriosis suggests that the costs could be in the tensof millions, perhaps even in excess of one hundred million euros per year. Van den Brandhof et al.(2004) estimate the costs of gastroenteritis in the Netherlands (regard- less of cause) to be 345 million euros per year. The costs of foodborne infections and intoxications involving known pathogens would then be in the order of 23 to 58 mil-lion euros per year. If the estimated incidence of non-identified pathogens is then included in the calculation, the costs rise to some 70 to 150 million euros per year. 4.2.6 Summary and conclusions Pathogenic micro-organisms are primarily found in foods which enter the kitchen without having undergone a prior heating stage, and especially those of animal ori-gin. Contamination is mainly introduced during primary production, but post-conta- mination and multiplication of pathogens during processing and preparation are alsoimportant. The pathogens which are transmitted in food can also take other routes,especially that of contact with other people or animals, or through the environment. Foreign travel also increases the risk. Accordingly, it is extremely difficult to deter - mine the relative part played by food in comparison with other infection routes. In most cases ,foodborne infections and in toxications lead to gastroen teritis ,although other more serious conditions and even death can result. Each year, there are 4.5 mil- lion episodes of gastroenteritis in the Netherlands, of which an estimated 300,000 to 750,000 cases are due to known pathogens in contaminated food. Approximately 25,000 cases lead to the patient seeking medical advice. There are between 20 and 200 deaths at tributable to gastroenteritis each year. The disease burden due to known foodborne gastro -intestinal pathogens is 1,000 to 4,000 DALYs per year, being more than that attributable to tuberculosis and comparable to bacterial meningitis andbacterial STDs. The costs run into many tens of millions of euros each year. If a propor-tion of the episodes of gastroenteritis due to an unknown cause are assumed to be due to food ,each of these figures increases by a factor of three approximately, whereupon the disease burden of foodborne infections and intoxications is roughly comparable tothat of AIDS or infections of the upper respiratory tract. Other serious diseases, of which 10 to 100 cases each year are attributed to contami- nated food ,include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome, (con- genit al) toxoplasmosis and listeriosis. These diseases further contribute to the disease burden ,although this con tribution has been quantified only partly. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 140The main foodborne agents of Clostridium perfringens and the noroviruses. Between them, these are responsible for almost half of all cases of gastroenteritis and the consequent deaths. The greatest health gain is therefore to be made by reducing the bacterial infection infood products of animal origin (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens) and by improving hygiene practices during food preparation (bacteria and norovirus- es). Measures should therefore seek to reduce the levels of contamination in theproduct supplied to the consumer, and to ensure adequate hygiene during storageand preparation. The prevention of cross-contamination between food components and contamination by infected food-handlers is crucial. Although attention must in the first instance be focused on the pathogens listed above, an integrated food safety policy must consider all relevant pathogens in all products. The safety of foods is based on process management according to the HACCP system (e.g. adequate heating and the prevention of post-contamination). HACCP systems arebeing developed to manage and control all relevant risks. The criteria relating to the microbiological safety of food must centre on the validation and verification of suchsystems .There are curren tly few st andards for pathogens .Most current standards are concerned with inspection of the end product. They do not apply to unprocessed, raw foods and beverages, while it is known that these products are responsible for thegreatest health loss. New developments in the international arena will give rise to more explicit ' Food Safety Objectives'. These should be based on the policy objectives which set out the desired level of consumer protection. The consumer forms the impor tantfinal link in the chain .Good food -handling prac - tices, including proper storage, heating and good hygiene in the kitchen, can substan- tially reduce the health risks .However ,it is the manufacturer who is responsible for supplying safe food ,and for ensuring effective hazard con trol during the production and processing stages. It is here that control measures will generally be more effec-tive. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 1414.3 HARMFUL CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS IN OUR FOOD A.J. Baars, F.X.R. van Leeuwen, P.G.N. Kramers # 4.3.1 Introduction Our food can contain various chemical constituents which are harmful to health. Over the years, legislation has been developed in the Netherlands, and more particularly in the European Union, which has helped to eradicate these substances from food, or to reduce their level to one at which health risks are absent or considered negligible. Nevertheless, various incidents which placed food safety at risk have occurred in recent years. In 1998, Brazilian citrus fruit pulp used in animal feed was found to con-tain high levels of dioxins. In 1999, chicken meat and eggs in Belgium were alsofound to contain high levels of dioxins and PCBs, and the toxic substance DON (deoxynivalenol), produced by fungi, was found in cereal products. In the same yearshrimp catches were shown to be con taminated with an timicrobial subst ances such as chloramphenicol and furazolidone, while in 2002, palm oil and some vitamin prepa- rations were found to be contaminated with PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).In early 2002, it was found that potato products, particularly fried products, contain a relatively high level of the hazardous subst ance acr ylamide. In the same year, the con- tamination of pig feed with the hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) wasdiscovered, caused by the use of contaminated molasses, and in 2003 the use of a new and illegal grow th promoter (a boldenone derivative) was shown in beef cat tle. Each of these cases involved either an exceeding of existing safet ystandards or the discover yof new poten tial risks ,although no actual adverse health effect swere iden - tified. The outcome of the 'Sterrenmix' affair of 2001 was very different. Dozens of people developed nausea and some suffered convulsions having drunk a herbal tea made from star anise. This was found to have been prepared using the Japanese strain of star anise which contains the nerve toxin anisatin, rather than the harmless Chi- nese strain usually used in the product. The overall health impact of these incidents remained limited, thanks to rapid action on the part of government and the private sector, together with effective public infor-mation. However, public confidence in food safety was eroded. It is clear that ongoing attention must be devoted to chemical food safet y.At the same time ,we must ask where the main health risks lie, and hence what the priorities must be. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 142#With contributions by H.P. van Egmond, Loveren, M.N. Pieters, A.G.A.C. KnaapInthe following sections, we offer an overview of the various types of harmful chemi- cal constituents ( section 4.3.2 ), of the current legislation ( section 4.3.3 )and of the fac- tors which influence chemical food quality ( section 4.3.4 ).We then examine certain specific constituents, the control of which will enable substantial health gain to bemade ( section 4.3.5 ). 4.3.2 Harmful chemical constituents in food: a general overview Chemical constituents which are potentially harmful to health can be classified into two main groups: 1. Substances which occur naturally in or on foods, such as: Allergens. Toxins produced by fungi (mycotoxins). Shellfish toxins (phycotoxins).Planttoxins (phy totoxins). Nitrates. 2. Substances which do not occur naturally. These can be further subdivided into: Those which are deliberately added to foods ,such as preservatives, colourings and flavourings. Those which result from deliberate human action, such as residues of pesticides or veterinar ymedicines . Those which enter food unintentionally, such as process contaminants and environmen tal contaminants. Appendices 9 and10include a summary of the main groups of chemical contaminants in both categories. The columns of the table show: The foods in which the substance is to be found, and its origin. The health effects of high or prolonged exposure to the substance. Whether any legislative standard for exposure or content level exists and, if so, whether this is based on any risk assessmen t. Whether there is indeed any exposure above the standard in practice, whether any health effect can be observed and, if so, to what extent. Whether exposure can be influenced or controlled. The information sources .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 143Inthis section, we examine a selection of these substances or groups of substances, being those subject to specific attention in relation to potential health effects. a. Naturally occurring chemical substances Allergens The main allergenic foods are shellfish (shrimps, lobster, crab, mussels), eggs, fish, milk, peanuts, other nuts, soy, and wheat (gluten). In addition, there is a long list offood constituents which can give rise to incidental problems. Food allergies can resultin a wide range of symptoms, including gastro-intestinal problems, skin conditions and respiratory difficulty, which can be life-threatening. The prevalence of food aller- gies in the general population is currently estimated to be 2%, the figure being three times higher (6%) among children. Contrary to popular belief, food components with alow molecular weight, such as colourings, do not cause food 'allergies', although they may be responsible for food 'intolerance' (see textbox 4.10 ). The use of genetically modified crops forms a special case. Genetic modification may involve the addition of new proteins to the product concerned, and hence newsources of food allerg y.This is an essen tial poin tfor attention during the evaluation of such crops before being allowed onto the market, both today and in the future. For further details, please refer to section 4.1 (textbox 4.1) . There are major differences bet ween individuals with regard to food allergies .These differences are partly genetic. Furthermore, the developing immune system can beaffected by immunologically active factors. The exact moment of the individual's first contact with food allergens can greatly influence whether he or she will develop a full-blown allergy. Accordingly, it is far from simple to establish any threshold values below which no effect swill be seen .In the case of eggs, it has been reported that con- sumption corresponding with 10 to 190 mg ovalbumin can cause severe reactions inpersons with an allergy requiring the administration of medication. Research into4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 144Textbox 4.10: Food allergy and intolerance. Allergenic substances represent a special cate- goryof potentially har mful food constituents, because the health risks attaching to these sub- stances (primarily proteins) are restricted to per-sons who are oversensitive, i.e. 'allergic', to them.If the human body is exposed to 'for eign' pr oteins, this will generally result in a response by the immune system. In normal circumstances, there isno perceptible immune response to proteins infood, due to 'oral tolerance'. However, in someindividuals, the ingestion of certain foods canlead to immunological r eactions. W ecan then speak of a food 'allergy' (Taylor & Lehrer, 1996;Van Loveren, 2002).There may also be other, non-immunological, reactions to food constituents. This phenomenon is known as food 'intolerance', the mechanisms of which vary and can be based on irritation, phar-macological action, the disruption of normalenzyme activity ,or could even be psychosomatic. Sometimes, the symptoms of food intolerance are very similar to those of a 'real' allergy, but theresponses are usually mild and are rarely life-threatening. The compounds responsible for foodintolerance include colourings (tartrazine, azo-dyes), or substances such as benzoic acid andsulphur dioxide. The general public perception isthat food allergies are extremely common. This isnot strictly tr ue, since some of the ef fects seen will be due to food intolerance.allergies to cow's milk revealed responses following exposure in the range from 1 microgram to 6 grams of protein. One fatal incident has been reported involvingexposure to 60 mg casein, a milk protein. The exact quantity of peanut allergen that is required to evoke a reaction in persons with a peanut allergy varies from 0.1 to 50 mg(Van Loveren, 2002). Health gain can be achieved if persons who are over-sensitive to certain food con- stituents are able to effectively avoid exposure to those constituents. This requiresgood information and the effective labelling of food products. Mycotoxins In 1999, relatively high levels of deoxynivalenol (DON), a Fusarium mycotoxin of the trichothecene group, were found in wheat products. Policy measures and interven- tions on the part of the processing industry have since reduced the concentration ofDON in these products considerably, whereupon human ingestion of DON has beencut by over half. A recent risk assessment showed that, based on the current estimated intake, 5% of 1-year-old children experience delayed growth of 9% or more (Pieters et al., 2001, 2002, 2004). G iven the expected reversibilit yof this effect ,we may conclude that the current exposure to DON is unlikely to cause any adverse health effects. Mycotoxins which are primarily found in corn play a part in the development of vari-ous veterinary diseases, such as 'hole-in-the-head syndrome' in horses and pulmonary oedema in pigs .In the Netherlands ,the 99th percentile of average lifetime exposure to ochratoxin A, a substance which has attracted considerable attention due to itssupposed genotoxicity, remains well under the provisional 'Tolerable Weekly Intake' (TWI) est ablished by the WH O.Accordingly, we may conclude that there is no health risk (Bakker & Pieters, 2002). Levels of aflatoxin B1 in food products in the Netherlands are usually reasonably low .Analyses of the meals consumed in a day enables the aver - age daily in take to be est ablished at <0.03 ng/kg body weight per day (Sizoo & V an Egmond, 2004). According to the WHO's estimates of increased cancer risk (1998), this level would give rise to one additional case of cancer in the Netherlands every sixteen years. Phycotoxins 'Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning' (PSP) toxins are regularly found in shellfish harvested from European coastal waters, but to date not in the Dutch coastal areas. Cases of'Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning' (DSP) have occurred a few times in Europe in recentdecades, but again none have been reported in the Netherlands. However, DSP toxins have regularly been found in shellfish in Dutch coast al waters ,leading to the tempo - rary closure of the catchment areas in the Wadden Sea in 2002, and to other inciden- tal measures. 'Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning' (ASP) toxins were first identified as recent-ly as 1987, during an outbreak of food poisoning in Canada which involved 105 acuteintoxications and three deaths. In recent years, the presence of ASP toxins has becomeapersisten tproblem in scallops from Scottish and Irish waters, and other regions. In 2002, the European Commission therefore in troduced specific legislation and limits for this t ype of shellfish .Similar measures have been taken with regard to 'AzaspiracidOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 145Shellfish Poisoning' (AZP) toxins, which in 1995 caused the illness of eight people in Ireland who had eaten mussels. During the past decades there has been an increase in the number of incidents involv- ing shellfish toxins, although it is not clear whether this is due to the increased atten-tion for their effects (Van Apeldoorn et al.,2004). Health gains can be achieved in this area through research into the pathogenic mechanisms of the toxins themselves, intothe dynamics of algae growth, and the monitoring of all shellfish. Phytotoxins Food-poisoning by phytotoxins (e.g. through eating poisonous berries, toadstools and certain types of potato) has long been a familiar phenomenon but can also emergequite suddenly, as in the 'Star anise' herbal tea incident of late 2001. Nevertheless, there is relatively little information regarding the presence of phytotoxins in foods orthe significance of such presence. Similarly, there is little regulatory legislation. Thatwhich does exist is not based on firm scientific evidence (Speijers & Van Egmond, 1999). The pyrrolizidine alkaloids form a large group of chemical substances. There are approximately two hundred different types or compounds which occur in manyherbs, herbal preparations and teas. In high doses, several types have been shown to cause liver damage and liver tumours in test animals (Speijers & V an Egmond ,1999). Anisatin is a neurotoxic compound which was responsible for the 'Star anise' tea inci-dent described above, involving a double-figure number of intoxications. The toxin, which was presen tin the tea due to confusion bet ween differen tstrains of anise ,pro- duced nausea, vomiting, lowered heart rate, fainting, convulsions and hallucinations in itsvictims (Johanns et al., 2002). Nitrate/nitrosamines Methemoglobinemia ('blue baby syndrome') caused by exposure to nitrite (derived from from nitrate) is a problem which continues to demand attention in view of the availability of nitrate-rich vegetables and the possible contamination of private drink- ing water sources .There is some evidence to suggest that this condition is more likely to occur if ,in addition to the ingestion of high levels of nitrate, the subject has some physiological abnormality of the gastro-intestinal tract (WHO, 2002). There are noindications to suggest that methemoglobinemia occurs in Dutch children. Neverthe-less, the national Nutrition Centre recommends that children younger than six months should not be fed (freshly prepared) nitrate -rich veget ables . Nitrite, which is formed in the body from nitrate, can react with the amines in fish products to become nitrosamines (especially N-nitrosodimethylamine; NDMA). Zeil-maker et al.(2004) have estimated the exposure to NDMA resulting from simultane- ous ingestion of nitrate -rich vegetables and fish. They did so using an in vitro model in which a nitrite solution was brought in to contact with fish. Information derived from the model was then combined with that from the F ood Consumption Sur vey (VCP-3).4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 146However, the matrix effects relating to the vegetables and the effect of vitamin C, both of which could result in lower nitrosamine formation, were not taken into considera-tion in this study. Provisional experimental results indicate that, under conditions which more closely emulate the actual situation (the 'fish-plus-food' matrix), the for-mation of nitrosamines is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that esti-mated on the basis of fish and nitrite alone. Based on these results and an extremelyconservative estimate of the elevated risk of cancer due to N-nitrosodimethylamine(NDMA), we may provisionally conclude that the average lifetime exposure tonitrosamines formed further to simultaneous exposure to nitrate-rich vegetables and amines in fish may lead to a number of additional cancer cases in the Netherlands, this number being in the order of a few tens to approximately 100 per year. b. Non-naturally occurring chemical substances Veterinary medicines An important issue raised by antibacterial agents is that of resistance. Many of the antibiotics used in food-producing animals are also used in human medicine. The farm animals' long-term exposure to low concentrations of these antibiotics can resultin the emergence of resist antbacterial strains which could also pose a risk to humans . Aspecial category is that of the growth promoting substances ('hormones'), which may be divided into naturally-occurring steroids (oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone) and the these subst ances (e.g. trenbolone, zeranol) or other substances which promote growth (such as the beta-agonists). The problems causedby the use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the early 1980s led to a complete ban on the use of grow th-promoters in Europe from 1988 (E C,1996). However ,their use is still permitted in other meat-producing countries such as the United States, Australia and some coun tries in South America .Moreover, despite the ban, growth promoters are used in Europe to a subst antial and increasing degree (Nielen et al., 2003). In general, the exogenous (and illegal) administration of natural hormones does not result in levels which are measurably higher than those found naturally, i.e. within the physiological range of the animals concerned (FAO, 2000). Although oestradiol is regarded as genotoxic ,the WHO (2000b) assumes that any carcinogenic effect is prob- ably due to it shormonal properties. Given that no significant additional intake has been established (compared to the normal intake of naturally-occurring oestradiol) itseems likely that exposure to illegally administered natural hormones does not pose arisk to the consumer. In the case of the non-naturally-occurring growth promoters, the situation is somewhat less clear .Little is known about the toxic proper ties of most of the synthetic analogues of steroid hormones which are used. However, an incident in Spain has shown that the consumption of liver derived from cattle to which thebeta-agonist clenbuterol has been administered can produce acute symptoms such ascardiac arrythmia and neurological effects, which in some cases were serious enoughtorequire hospit al admission (Salleras et al.,1995).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 147Process contaminants During the (domestic) cooking process, and particularly the frying or barbecuing of meat and fish, a hard crust will form on the surface of the product. This crust consists of the products of the pyrolysis of the natural juices in the product, with a high con-tent of amino acids, sugars and fats. Important constituents of this 'crust', which isoften considered desirable in terms of flavour, are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) and heterocyclic amines, both of which have been shown to be toxic and car-cinogenic in laboratory animals (Nagao & Sugimura, 2000). A conservative estimatehas been made of the increased cancer risk posed by benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P), one of the best known and most harmful PAHs, whereby lifelong intake of 5 ng/kg bodyweight per day is associated with a risk of 1:10 6(Kroese et al., 2001). Assuming that the car- cinogenic potential of all PAHs in food is approximately ten times greater than that ofB[a]P alone (SCF, 2002), we can calculate that an average exposure of the Dutch popu- lation equivalent to 80-210 ng per person per day will result in one or two additionalcases of cancer each year. The frying or baking of potato and flour products, whether in the industrial process or in the domestic situation ,can result in the formation of small quan tities of acr ylamide on the product surface. This substance is known to be neurotoxic and is thought to be carcinogenic. In early 2002, Swedish researchers identified acrylamide in productssuch as potato crisps, chips and biscuits, findings which were later confirmed world- wide .In the Dutch situation ,estimated exposure rates and information regarding cancer risks have been used to calculate that the presence of acrylamide in food prod-ucts may lead to between 75 and 130 additional cases of cancer per year (RIVM/RIK- ILT,2002; Konings et al., 2003). Environmental contaminants: hea vy metals In the Netherlands ,environmen tal legislation and other measures have resulted in a marked reduction in the levels of heavy metals in the environment in recent years. However, there may still be some minor health impact in a few cases. Lead inhibits the biosynthesis of haemoglobin and is neurotoxic, particularly in children, as has been demonstrated by extensive epidemiological research conducted in the past (IPCS, 1995). The main source of lead is curren tly the lead water pipes still present in some older houses (par ticularly in the historic city centres). Under the terms of the Water Supply and Transport Directive of 9 January 2001, the standard for lead in drinkingwater (measured 'at the tap') is to be reduced from 25 micrograms per litre to 10micrograms per litre, with effect from 1 January 2006. This means that all lead water pipes must be replaced before that date .The average background exposure of the population to lead, and hence the blood lead level, will then fall to well below theinternationally agreed threshold limit value, under which no neurological effects will occur. Organic mercur yis neurotoxic and is harmful to the foetus (ATSDR, 1999). In the 1970s ,high levels of organic mercury in fish caused a severe outbreak of acute illness in Minamat a,Japan. Levels of mercury in fish have shown a downwards trend for4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 148some years, due to the international measures taken to reduce mercury emissions. Recently, the European Food Safety Authority published a report on methyl mercury(EFSA, 2004), which concludes that in the Netherlands, the average intake of methyl mercury in fish is well below the revised 'Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake' (PTWI)published by the WHO in 2003, of 1.6 \u00b5g/kg bodyweight per day. This is due to the rel-atively low consumption of fish in the Netherlands, and to the fact that the type of fishin which relatively high concentrations of methyl mercury are found - such as tunaand swordfish - is not eaten in great quantities. Environmental contaminants: dioxins and related compounds 'Dioxins' is the collective chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and chlori- nated dibenzofuranes (PCDFs). The also often used to include the dioxin-likepolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These substances enter the environment by a num- ber of routes, such as processes of combustion. They then enter food products via theraw materials used in the food and animal feed industries, particularly animal oilsand fats. Dioxins are extremely persistent and accumulate in fatty tissue. Even extremely low concentrations have been shown to damage the immune system andfertilityof laborator yanimals ;they impair the development of the nervous system and are (non-genotoxically) carcinogenic. Dioxin levels are generally expressed as toxicity equivalents (TEQs), based on the most toxic compound of the dioxin group ,i.e. 2,3,7,8-TCDD. In May 2001, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) advised that the maximum tolerableintake of dioxins should be set at 2 pg TEQ per kg bodyweight per day expressed as 'WHO-TEQ'. In it s'Opinion 'the S CF stated that, in view of the long half-life of these substances, it preferred not to express the maximum tolerable intake as a daily aver- age,but as a weekly average of 14 pg WH O-TEQ per kg bodyweight (SCF, 2001). Given the accumulation of dioxins in fat tytissue ,the weekly value must be seen as the aver - age maximum tolerable intake per week during a person's entire lifetime, whereby a higher level of intake, provided it is incidental and short-term, is unlikely to have any adverse health effect (SCF, 2001). Exposure to dioxins and the dioxin -like PCBs in food will occur primarily through ani- mal product ssuch as dairy products, meat and fish (see also chapter 7, section 7.2 ). In recent years, a considerable reduction in exposure through these products has been achieved (see figure 4.4 ). Nevertheless, it has recently been shown (by Freijer et al., 2001; Baars et al., 2004) that approximately 8% of the Dutch population continue to exceed the tolerable weekly in take of dioxins ,as est ablished by the S CF and the WHO (SCF, 2001; WHO, 2002) by a factor of three to four maximal, with less than 1% having an intake of more than three times the TWI. Because a considerable safety margin hasbeen taken into account in establishing the Tolerable Weekly Intake, it is unlikely thatthis section of the population faces any additional health risk. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 149Aspecial consideration is the presence of dioxins in human milk ,which may pose a threat to babies being breastfed. There are indications that infants exposed to rela-tively high concentrations of dioxins and PCBs in human milk tend to score worse in testsof neurological and cognitive developmen tthan those with lesser or no expo - sure. However, it should be noted that breastfed children still score better than those who are bot tle-fed (Koopman-Esseboom, 1995; Vreugdenhil, 2003; see also chapter 7, section 7.2 ). The presence of dioxins and related compounds in human milk (due to the accumula- tion in fatty tissue) offers a suitable method of measuring women's body load of these substances. Further to the reduction in exposure via food, the concentrations of dioxins and P CBs in human milk have fallen by approximately 50% over the past ten to fifteen years (Zeilmaker et al., 2002). 4.3.3 Risk assessment, admission policy and setting standards The majority of the substances and groups of substances discussed in this chapter and in appendices 9 and 10 are subject to legislative standards. In most cases, the standards are derived on the basis of scientific risk assessments. This section examines the assess-ment process in more detail. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 150 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Year0246810Figure 4.4: Reduction in the Dutch population 's exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food, expressed in pg WHO-TEQ/kg bodyweight/day (Zeilmaker et al., 2002).Risk assessment The process of assessing the risk posed by a particular substance involves four stages: 1. Identification of the hazard. 2. Characterization of the hazard.3. Assessment of exposure.4. Characterization of the risk. Sub 1.In the first of these phases, the harmful properties of the substance are identi- fied, based on toxicological information. In the ideal situation, the results of studies involving human subjects are used. However, in practice such results are rarely available and, even where they are available, will often relate to the acute hazards rather than those which could emerge after long-term, regular (daily)intake. In the vast majority of cases, the toxic properties of a substance are therefore established using laboratory animals. Sub 2.In the second phase, that of defining the hazard, the toxic properties of the sub- stance are further characterized. In line with the adage coined by Paracelsus (1493-1541): 'All substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison.The right dose differen tiates a poison from a remedy, the approach involves quantifying the hazard (or hazards) of human exposure to the substance con- cerned wherever possible. Necessarily, this will also involve animal tests, forsuch purposes as establishing the dose-effect relationship for a specific toxic effect ,and studying what happens to the subst ance in the body. Based on this information, it is then possible to establish the quantity of the substance thatcan be ingested daily during an individual's lifetime with no adverse health effect s:the AD I-'accept able daily in take', or the TD I-'tolerable daily intake'. Unlike the ADI, the TDI is used for contaminants, since the word 'acceptable' is considered inappropriate for subst ances which are not deliberately added to foods .In both cases ,however ,the procedure is iden tical in that it looks at the total intake of the substance in question, regardless of the product in which the substance is to be found (Janssen & Speijers, 1997; Benford, 2000). Sub 3.The third phase is that of establishing human exposure to the substance as accurately as possible, based on data concerning the levels of the substance to be found in cer tain foods and statistics relating to the consumption of those foods .In addition, the contribution of other possible sources is also taken into consideration. Accurate information about the consumption of certain foods,and especially the distribution of consumption among the various populationgroups, is essential. Based on this information, any exceptionally sensitive or vulnerable groups (such as the children or the elderly) can also be iden tified .In determining exposure via food, the national Food Consumption Survey is an indispensable instrument. Sub 4.Once the exposure of the population (or sections thereof) has been adequately established, the fourth phase - characterizing and evaluating the risks of thatexposure - can be under taken. This involves comparing the exposure and its distribution to the est ablished threshold limit value of safe intake (ADI or TDI). Where necessar y(and possible) the result scan be differentiated according to the various risk groups.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 151Admission policy Based on these risk assessments, the responsible authorities will take measures where- bythe risks posed by the presence of the substance in food can be rendered control- lable. This is the focus of the 'admission policy', which applies to all substances whichare deliberately added to food products or are used during the production process.Increasingly, the form and content of the admission policy are determined at Euro-pean level. In practice, it will be possible to ban the use of a certain substance (such asillegal growth promoters in cattle), or to establish upper limits for the maximum per-missible level of the substance in or on various foods and food products (product stan- dards). In most cases, control systems will be linked to such measures (Benford, 2001). Establishing the ADI and TDI intake standards As described above under sub 2, the ADI or TDI for a particular substance is derived from the dose-effect relationship of that substance: at what dosage does a certaineffect appear? In practice, the dose at which no adverse effect is caused will be sought:the so-called 'No Observed Adverse Effect Level' (NOAEL). This threshold value is the starting point from which the ADI or TDI for that substance are derived. Because theNOAEL is usually est ablished by means of test son laboratory animals, and it remains uncertain how the results of such tests translate in terms of human exposure, so- called uncertainty factors are used when establishing the intake standards forhumans. These factors take into account the seriousness of the effect, and whether any par ticular groups are at higher risk than others .Over the years, considerable international consensus has been reached with regard to the establishment of intakestandards. The Scientific Panels of the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and for- merly the Scien tific Commit tee on F ood (S CF) provide advice about in take st andards on a European level. These intake standards serve as the basis for the product stan- dards set by the European Commission (see below). The Codex Alimentarius Commis - sion is a global organization which makes recommendations with regard to bothintake standards and product standards. The scientific basis of the Codex is provided by various expert committees, including the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) and the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Addi- tives and Contaminants (JECFA). The ' threshold value' approach is not used in the case of genotoxic carcinogens. This is because, in theory, just one molecule of these substances can damage DNA to suchan extent as to cause uncontrolled cell growth, resulting in the development of atumour. Based on this hypothesis (which is however not universally supported), there is therefore no dose for genotoxic carcinogens at which no effect can be obser ved, whereupon the threshold value approach is inapplicable. Accordingly, the 'Virtually Safe Dose' (VSD) concept has been adopted for these substances, being the dose atwhich the incidence of cancer remains restricted to a level which is generally consid-ered to be acceptable. The Dutch government has defined the Virtually Safe Dose asthe dose at which the lifelong exposure of 10 6persons would lead to one additional case of cancer (the 1:106lifelong additional risk norm ;VROM, 1989). In the Nether- lands ,the VSD is calculated using a linear extrapolation model ,the input for which4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 152are the results of carcinogenicity studies on laboratory animals, with the substance concerned being administered at varying doses throughout their entire lifetime(Janssen & Speijers, 1997). From intake standard to product standard Aproduct standard indicates the maximum quantity of a substance (residues of pesti- cides or veterinary medicines, food additives, contaminants, etc.) which is permittedto be present in a certain food or food product. The product standards are based onintake standards (ADI of TDI) alongside such considerations as: The average consumption of the product in question. Extremes in the consumption of the product (there may be 'devotees' whose con- sumption far exceeds the average). Vulnerable groups. The presence of the substance in other products, i.e. the distribution of the intake standard between various food products. Anumber of technical and social considerations must also be taken into account when est ablishing the product st andards ,such as : Controllability and enforcement opportunity for the set product standard. Good agricultural/veterinary/industrial business practice. Culture, eating habits, traditional foods (ingredients). Cost-effectiveness and advan tages (the 'cost-benefit' ratio). Economic interests: the situation in the EU and neighbouring countries, important trading partners. Consumer risk perception . In some cases ,the product st andard may represent a level of protection which is more stringen tor more lenien tthan that of the in take st andard due to these practical con- siderations, the difference being considered acceptable and/or unavoidable in terms of policy. Clearly, product standards play an important part in (international) trade. Indeed, the Codex Alimentarius has a major influence on the activities of the World Trade Organization (Codex Alimentarius, 2003). The development of standards over time Knowledge of the harmful effects of substances will increase over time, whereupon it becomes appropriate to modify those standards. For example, the standards for mer-cury have now been divided into two categories: inorganic mercury for which rela- tively high in take st andards now apply, and the far more toxic organic mercur y, which is subject to a much lower intake standard. Similarly, as knowledge of the toxi- cological effects of dioxins increased, the intake standards were adjusted accordingly,along with the product standards which are based not only on the intake standards,but also on the consumption patterns that are subject to change over time too. Another example is the ar tificial sweeteners used in many so-called 'light' products, especially sof tdrinks .As consumption of these products increases (i.e. by children),OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 153sooner or later a consumption level will be reached at which the ADI is exceeded. In this eventuality, the product standard must be lowered accordingly. When standards are exceeded Intake standards (ADI, TDI) are threshold limit values and are defined as the maxi- mum quantity of a particular substance (expressed in micrograms (\u00b5g) or milligrams(mg) per kg bodyweight per day) that a person may ingest daily during the whole ofhis or her live without experiencing any adverse health effects. In the case of sub-stances which have a harmful effect only after prolonged exposure, and for which the intake standard is derived from the most sensitive effect after long-term administra- tion, a short-term and relatively minor exceedance of the intake standard will have no immediate adverse effects. Dioxins form a good example, being extremely persistentin the body and having effects which become manifest only once a certain body bur- den has been reached. However, there are also substances whose adverse effects areapparent after single or short-term exposure. Examples include cyanide and somephycotoxins (see appendix 9 ). Exceeding the standard for this type of substance can therefore have an adverse health effect. In general, it is desirable to make an assess-mentof the possible risks of ever yinstance of in take in excess of the standard. In prac- tice however, given the above-mentioned considerations regarding the chronic and acute effects, it will be necessary to assess on a case-by-case basis whether a specificexcessive intake can actually lead to adverse effects and, if so, whether measures are required to mitigate or obviate those effect s. The process of deriving product standards from intake standards is usually based on 'worst case scenarios '(overestimation) with regard to assumptions about diet arypat- tern and about the level that, as a result of using the substance, can occur in the prod- uctconcerned .By doing so ,in effect, an additional safety margin is incorporated. This also means that in ,most cases ,ashort-term exceedance of the product st andard will not result in any adverse health effects. However, the fact that standards are being exceeded is an indication that something has gone wrong in the production chain, and that appropriate measures should be taken. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1544.3.4 Factors which influence chemical food quality Production/import/processing/distribution Column 5 of the tables presented in appendices 9 and 10 shows how the chemical food quality for each type of substance can be maintained, and where responsibility fordoing so lies (see also chapter 5 ). In general, primary responsibility for the quality of agricultural products (arable or livestock) rests with the individual manufacturer orfarmer. In addition, the food industry bears considerable responsibility with regard tomonitoring the levels of health-threatening substances in products of animal or veg- etable origin, regardless of whether those substances occur naturally or not. This is, of course, also true of imported products, for which an effective 'tracking and tracing' system is essential in order to determine the source of any potential problem. A con-stant concern for quality, with continuous quality management throughout the food manufacturing chain (\"from farm to fork\") is therefore absolutely indispensable. For-tunately, we may state that, partly due to the application of the various hygiene codes(GAP, GVP, GMP and HACCP 1,the various parties in the food manufacturing chain are fully aware of their responsibilities. In recent years, they have implemented self-regu-lation systems and measures in order to provide the highest possible assurance of food safety. (For further details, please refer to the websites of the various Product Boards.) In practice, the various actors will fulfil their quality control responsibilities in differ- entways .The farmer, for example, must ensure correct usage of pesticides. A thor- ough inspection of raw materials by importers and processors can prevent contamina-tion with substances such as DON, dioxins or PAHs. The reduction or elimination of process con taminan tssuch as acr ylamide is primarily the responsibilit yof the food - processing industry. Regulation and enforcement Inacomplex society such as that of the Netherlands, in which food manufacturing is almost entirely anonymous, it would be foolish to believe that all actors involved in food manufacturing will comply with all rules at all times. Moreover, it is inevitable that less scrupulous people will occasionally seize the opportunity to pass on raw materials ,'semi-finished' products or foods without worrying unduly about the possi- ble adverse health effect sof contamination. It therefore remains essential to maintain close supervision of the entire food production chain. The central government is responsible for passing the necessary laws and regulations, and is also responsible for ensuring compliance with that legislation .Given the huge number of foods and food products that are imported, produced and consumed in the Netherlands every day, it is physically, logistically and economically impossible for theregulatory authorities to inspect every single product. They must confine themselvesOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 1551GMP/GAP/GVP: Good Manufacturing/Agricultural/Veterinary Practice HACCP: Hazard Analysis Critical Control Pointstotaking random samples. Moreover, most foods are perishable: they have a limited shelf life. Many chemical analyses require a certain amount of time to complete,whereupon the results often will become available only after the batch of food con- cerned has been distributed or - worse still - consumed. The government has delegated responsibility for inspection and enforcement to the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA). At the level of primary produc-tion, the General Inspectorate (AID) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and FoodQuality also has an important part to play (see chapter 5 ). The consumer In addition to the clear responsibility borne by the food manufacturer (in the broadest sense of the term) with regard to the quality and safety of the products supplied, the consumer also has a clear responsibility in terms of responsible food handling, storageand preparation practice. Education and upbringing are important in this regard.Apart from observing necessary (and largely self-evident) hygiene precautions (see also section 4.2 ), the consumer should be aware of various food-related facts. For example ,it is not sensible to eat any green par tsof a pot ato, because this indicates the presence of the toxin solanine. Similarly, consumers should be aware that barbecuing meat or fish introduces a far greater number of potentially harmful substances (suchas PAHs and other products of combustion) than any veterinary medicines adminis- tered during the production phase . An additional complication of calling the 'consumer' to account for food safety is the way in which the cultural and demographic make -up of the Netherlands is changing due to the influx of ethnic groups. Some groups have different eating habits and demand product sother than those traditionally available on the Dutch market. 4.3.5 The main chemical substances in food in terms of potential health gain Section 4.3.2 presen ts an overview of the wide range of substances, of extremely diverse origins ,which can occur in food and which have a potential adverse health effect. Sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4 describe the Dutch system of admission, setting stan- dards and inspection which, in principle, offers a high degree of protection againstexposure to such harmful substances in food. In this section, we address the question of whether there are cer tain groups of subst ances which demand extra at tention in view of a disproportionately high level of risk. The assumed risk is based on actual health effects observed in the past, or on levels of exposure which are so high as tomake such effects 'not improbable'.4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 156Inorder to render the wide range of possible effects more manageable, we distinguish between: (1) acute effects, (2) carcinogenic effects, (3) other chronic effects and (4)allergenic effects. Acute effects are relatively easy to recognize, particularly where they are specific or where an incident of group exposure is involved. The carcinogenic effects can rarely be traced back to a single source, although in some cases it is theo- retically possible to calculate an effect. The other chronic effects are also difficult to attribute to a particular source, but in theory will only emerge after considerable,long-term exposure in excess of the established standards. Allergenic effects can usual- ly be traced to a source, which will often be a common food. Here, the effects vary between individuals far more than in the other three types. The remedy is therefore for the person concerned to avoid the food in question. When the stated criteria - 'actual health effects' and 'not improbable health effects' - are applied to the substances listed in section 4.3.2 and the effects are then classified according to the four categories mentioned above, we arrive at table 4.8 .Health effects observed in an industrialized country other than the Netherlands have also been included in this overview. In a number of cases, the table also presents an estimate of the potential health gain which could be achieved if exposure were to be reduced to zero. This health gain isexpressed in DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years) so that the various types of health effect (disease ,intoxication, death) can be grouped together and compared. (For a full description of the DALY concept and the calculation method used, please refer to appendix 12 .) Textbox 4.11 describes how DALYs are calculated for the main substances and groups of subst ances. However, in most cases, it is not possible to give more than a very approximate estimate of the number of deaths and disabilit yyears for which these subst ances accoun t. Weighing factors rely on analogy with conditions with a broadlyOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 157Table 4.8: Substances and groups of substances presenting additional risks: type of effect(s) and potential health gain through avoidance of exposure.

Mycotoxins Aflatoxins Aflatoxin B1< 1 Phycotoxins Nitrosamines PAHs 5-10; Acrylamide 300-700comparable profile in terms of seriousness and duration. Accordingly, the figures should be seen as 'order of magnitude' estimates and are presented as such. Neverthe-less, it thus becomes possible to compare the effects of various substances, the results of such a comparison being presented in table 4.8 .4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 158Textbox 4.11: Calculation of DALYs shown in table 4.8. Allergenic substances 2% of the (adult) Dutch population suffer from some form of food allergy. Let us suppose that10% are unaware of the cause, cannot thereforeavoid it, and have more or less permanent symp-toms of illness. This gives the total of 32,000 dis-ability years (0.2% of 16 million). The chosenweighing factor is 0.03 (for light-to-moderateasthma). The health loss is therefore 0.03 x32,000 = appr ox. 1,000 DALYs. Mycotoxins DON: In 2004, it was calculated that 95% of one- year-old children may have suffered a (tempo-rary) growth retardation of <9%. Ten percent isregarded as being on the critical limit. Fewerthan 5% could therefore be above that limit. Theeffect is small, and cannot be quantified in DAL Ys using the current method. Aflatoxin B 1:The average daily intake of aflatox- in B1in the Netherlands is approximately 0.03 ng/kg bodyweight per day .In theor y,this will result in one additional case of cancer every sixteen years. Assuming premature death repre-senting an average loss of five life-years, this isthe equivalent of approximately 0.3 DALYs. Phycotoxins The ASP incident in Canada has been taken as the reference. There were three deaths repre-senting, say ,an average loss of twenty life- years = 60 DALYs. There were 105 acute intoxi- cations. Given serious but temporar yeffects (comparable to a serious transitory disease such as pneumonia), we can apply a weighingfactor of 0.1 to the year profile. This gives ahealth loss of 0.1 x 105 = 10.5 DALYs. Phytotoxins The 'Star anise' herbal tea incident has been taken as the reference. There were no fatalities.Assuming 30 intoxications and a weighing factorof 0.01 (comparable to one episode of influenzawithin one year), the health loss is then 0.01 x 30=0.3 DAL Ys.Nitrate/nitrite Nitrosamines: Based on conservative estimates, combined exposure to vegetables which arerich in nitrates and fish can result in tens toapproximately one hundred additional cancercases per year. Assuming premature death withan average loss of 5 life-years, the resultanthealth loss is approximately 100 to 500 DALYs. Growth promoters The clenbuterol incident has been taken as the reference. There were no deaths, but therewere a number of hospital admissions due tocardiac arrhythmia and neurological symptoms.Assuming ten cases and a weighing factor of 0.1(comparable to a serious transitory diseasesuch as pneumonia) the health loss thenbecomes 0.1 x 10 = 1 DAL Y. Process contaminants Acrylamide. Based on extrapolations from ani- mal experiments, the cur rent exposur elevel in the Netherlands may lead to an additional 75-130 cancer cases each year. Assuming that eachcase will r esult in pr emature death and an aver- age loss of five life-years, the health loss can be calculated as 375-650 DAL Ys. PAHs. Based on animal experiments to establish the increased cancer risk posed by benzo(a)pyrene, the current oral exposure toPAHs in the Netherlands could account for one or two cases of cancer per year. Applying the same criteria as for acr ylamide (above), this represents a health loss of 5-10 DALYs. Other environmental contaminants 8% of the Dutch population exceed the intake standards for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, asset by the EU and the WHO. No health ef fects are to be expected. 5% of the Dutch population are exposed to non- dioxin-like PCBs (indicator PCBs) at levelswhich may cause health ef fects (immunological effects) in the cur- rently insuf ficient infor mation quantification. Interms of DALYs, the allergenic substances and some of the carcinogenic substances, such as acrylamide and the nitrosamines, stand out. In the case of acrylamide andnitrosamines, however, only premature deaths have been calculated. The other dis- ability factors have been disregarded, being deemed to be of far lesser significance.The estimates relating to these carcinogens are extremely approximate and may betoo high, since they have been extrapolated from the results of animal experimentsbased on conservative hypotheses. Moreover, as previously noted, there is no accuratedata regarding the possible mitigating effect of diet and vitamin C on nitrosamine for-mation. De Hollander et al.(1999) calculate the health loss in terms of neurocognitive devel- opment deficit caused by lead in drinking water to be 7950 DALYs (5th-95th percentile1,000 - 19,000) based on the situation in 1990. At the time, this estimate was regarded as particularly high, while the replacement of lead water pipes in old town centreswill serve to reduce the figure yet further. Given the current uncertainties surround-ing this estimate and the prospect of all health effects being obviated from January 2006, lead has not been included in table 4.8 . In order to place the estimated DALYs in perspective, we present the figures calculated for several diseases in the Netherlands. According to the most recent estimates (for2000, published in Van Oers, 2002) the list is led by coronary heart disease at approxi- mately 350,000 D ALYs. Other conditions causing health loss include rheumatoid arthritis (approx. 70,000 DALYs), schizophrenia (approx. 20,000 DALYs) and urinarytract infections (approx. 10,000 DALYs). What interventions will result in health gain? In the foregoing sections ,we have at tempted to give an approximate estimate of the possible health loss caused by subst ances which occur in food ,expressed in D ALYs. The health loss due to incidental episodes of contamination with phycotoxins and phyto- toxins may seem negligible, but is based on actual observations in humans. The calcu- lated health loss due to carcinogenic substances is greater (a few hundred to approxi- mately one thousand DALYs), but so is the degree of uncertainty surrounding these figures .The highest number of DALYs attributable to effects which have actually been obser ved in humans (approximately 1,000) is accounted for by the allergenic food constituents. The health loss is, by definition, also the health gain that can be achieved if adequate measures are implemen ted.What are those measures? Acute effects: Continuous monitoring of the levels of known contaminants (such as phycotoxins) in products. Research into unknown substances and the illegal use of known substances such as grow th promoters. Alertness with regard to clustered intoxications. Information and education of the medical profession and the public .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 159Carcinogenic effects: Continuous monitoring of the levels of known contaminants (such as mycotoxins, PAHs, acrylamide) in products. Greatest possible reduction in the levels of these substances. Monitoring of preparation processes in both domestic and commercial settings (acrylamide, PAHs). Other chronic effects: Continuous monitoring of the levels of known contaminants (such as mycotoxins, PAHs, acrylamide) in products. Allergenic substances: Alertness on the part of the medical profession and the individual consumer. Information and education of the medical profession and the public. It is clear that effective enforcement and the prompt identification of problems will be the key to minimizing the health loss due to the presence of chemical contaminantsin food. Responsibility in this regard rests with the government and the food produc- er. The fact that the calculated health loss shown above is not much higher indicatesthat curren tenforcemen tpractice is reasonably effective .At the same time ,we know that various uncertainties exist. Little is known about various (new) substances such as brominated flame retardants. Moreover, it is usually difficult to establish any clearconnection between the less specific chronic effects and substances in food. 4.3.6 Summary and conclusions The Dutch government has already implemented an effective set of measures to ensure that no hazardous concen trations of subst ances can occur in food products. The system includes a) prior evaluation to ascer tain whether a subst ance should be allowed ('admitted') onto the market (particularly relevant for food additives, pesti- cides and veterinary medicines), b) standard setting which establishes the maximum quantity of a substance allowed in foods (usually calculated on the basis of risk assess- ment), and c) inspection and enforcement activities. Moreover, the producer must con- trol raw materials and processes to ensure that no inadmissible levels of con taminants occur in food product s. The consumer is able to avoid the consumption of hazardous substances by making careful choices and by applying correct food-handling prac- tices. As far as can be est ablished ,the curren tsystem of admission ,setting standards and inspection has resulted in health risks due to chemical substances in food in the Netherlands being no more than a marginal consideration. Given the sheer number ofpotential contaminants and the diversity of the possible effects, the situation couldhave been very different without the policy now in place. Never theless, there remain a number of points for attention with regard to chemical food safet y.In terms of potential health risk, and hence also the possibility of achiev-4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 160ing health gain, the main substances and groups of substances are: Certain mycotoxins in cereal crops, phytotoxins in herbal preparations, phycotox- ins in shellfish and some growth promoters. These will generally account for acute effects. The possible health gain is in the order of 10-70 DALYs. Substances such as nitrosamines (formed from nitrate/nitrite and amines in fish), some mycotoxins on plant-based products, and some process contaminants (PAHsand acrylamide), for which the potential health gain is between a few hundredand approximately 1,000 DALYs. Allergenic substances, particularly in foods such as shellfish, fish, nuts, milk and wheat. The possible health gain with regard to these substances is estimated to be approximately 1,000 DALYs. In order to maintain safety with regard to chemical substances in food and to achieve future health gain, a number of actions must be taken: Maintain the current system of admission, setting standards and inspection, making further improvements where necessary. Extra attention should be devoted to substances with a particularly small margin between exposure and actualeffect s.This is impor tant in view of the globalization of world trade, which makes the situation even more delicate. Continue research into hitherto unknown substances and into improved risk assessment methods (particularly the use of the 'Benchmark' approach and proba- bilistic exposure and effect estimation). Improve the dissemination of information about potentially hazardous food con- stituents, food allergies and intolerance, and about proper domestic food prepara- tion methods . 4.4 FOOD SAFETY IN PERSPECTIVE C.F. van Kreijl, A.H. Havelaar # Shifts in focus Public and political at titudes to food safety have been somewhat variable in recent decades. This is particularly true with regard to chemical food safety. In the 1970s and1980s, for example, there was a certain 'chemophobia', largely caused by improvedtechnology which enabled us to detect even very low levels of various hazardous sub- stances in our ever yday environmen t. Especially, the presence of carcinogenic sub - stances caused considerable commotion. It was later established that such hazardous substances could also occur in the food we eat, perhaps further to the contaminationof raw materials, the production process or the environment. It became necessary toset up an effective system of monitoring and control to ensure chemical food safety,and to reassure the public that the governmen twas indeed taking steps to do so. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 161#With con tributions by F .van Knapen ,M.P.G. Koopmans and J.H.J. ReimerinkInthe late 1980s and early 1990s, concern for chemical food safety seemed to decline as the media and the general public shifted their focus to various foods which werepurported to be beneficial for health. This development also permeated politics and public health policy for a long time. However, the series of food-related incidents andcrises which occurred over the past five years, served to return chemical food safety toaprominent place on the agenda. The result was a general feeling of insecurity on the part of the consumer, who lost confidence in the food industry and in the govern-ment's effectiveness as the guardian of food safety. This was one of the factors whichprompted the foundation of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA), following the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It is interesting to note that (micro-)biological food safety considerations seem to have attracted rather less public attention (with a few exceptions such as BSE). AlthoughDutch government policy recognizes microbial food infections as a persistent, recur-rent and serious problem, the public does not appear unduly concerned. This compar- ative indifference is not justified by the figures expressing the resultant health loss, aspresen ted in this chapter .It is clear that consumer risk perception is an impor tant fac- tor here. The realistic threat of a food infection today is, apparently, regarded as less serious than the theoretical risk of cancer at some point in the distant future. Therationale and mechanisms underpinning this perception are explained in chapter 8 .If the consumer 's attention is to be drawn to microbial food infections, the risks they present and - in particular - what the consumer can do to avoid those risks, the gov-ernment must devote due attention to these aspects in its public communication. Is our food now safer than ever before? Exper tsfrequently state that our food is indeed safer now in 2004 than at any time in the past. However ,we must ask whether this asser tion is suppor ted by the fact spre- sented in this chapter. A summary of the current situation with regard to microbiolog- ical food safety is given in section 4.2 ,while section 4.3 presents that for chemical food safety. In each case, we have attempted to quantify the actual health loss (or the potential health gain) as accurately as possible. The combined disease burden and mortality are expressed in DALYs per annum, thus rendering the outcomes compara- ble with each other or with the health loss at tributable to other diseases. The overall annual health loss attributable to microbiological food infections involv- ing known gastro-intestinal pathogens is in the order of 1,000 to 4,000 DALYs. Com- pared to other infectious diseases ,microbiological food infections are therefore in sev - enth place on the list of the causes of health loss in the Netherlands, between AIDS and bacterial meningitis (see table 4.5 ). If we also include the unknown gastro-intesti- nal pathogens and the non-enteric pathogens, the health loss is approximately threetimes greater, at 3,000 to 10,000 DALYs. The 'ranking' is then fifth place, comparableto infections of the upper respirator ytract. Chemical food contamination accounts for an estimated health loss of approximately 2,000 D ALYs per year (see table 4.8 ). The total estimated health loss for both t ypes of food contamination is therefore of the4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 162same order of magnitude, and therefore more or less comparable. However, a number of reservations apply, as mentioned below. An important difference between the information relating to microbiological food safety and that concerning chemical food safety is the degree of uncertainty involved.The 'uncertainty factor' applies to both the manifestation of actual health effects (dis-ease, death) and the reliability of the calculations. In the case of microbial food infec-tions, the health effects are usually acute and their cause is readily identifiable bymeans of clinical tests. Moreover, the effects are an integral feature of the general population, and are not isolated incidents. Here the uncertainties are mainly those of the food-attributable fraction, the degree of under-reporting (not all persons affected will seek medical attention) and the contribution of as yet unknown foodbornepathogens to the 4.5 million episodes of gastroenteritis occurring each year in the Netherlands. The calculation of the health loss is therefore based on limited microbio-logical information, whereby it is likely to be an underestimate. In the case of chemical food safety, the situation is clearly very different. Firstly, the association bet ween clinically obser vable health effect sand the consumption of con t- aminated food is often far more difficult, or even impossible, to ascertain. In fact, it has only been demonstrated for a limited number of substances which are known tocause acute effects, such as the allergens occurring in food (which are estimated to accoun tfor health loss of approximately 1,000 D ALYs), some naturally-occurring tox- ins and residues of certain veterinary medicines (fewer than 100 DALYs combined). Ofthese, only exposure to food allergens is a persistent and perhaps growing problem in the population ,while extreme exposure to other subst ances causing acute effect sis likely to be short-term and incidental, usually resulting from standards having been exceeded (whether acciden tally or deliberately) or to unusual climatic conditions. No actual effects have been measured for the remaining chemical substances listed in table 4.8 in terms of food contamination, but there is a theoretical risk. In most cases the risks are long-term, such as an elevated likelihood of developing cancer or other chronic conditions. Although the estimated theoretical health loss is again approxi- mately 1,000 D ALYs, (total 400-1,200 DALYs), the uncertainty surrounding the degree of exposure and the dosage -effect calculation is usually very high. With the exception of the consumption of nitrate-rich leafy vegetables and fish, exposure mainly involvesfood incidents in which the standards are exceeded temporarily. It is useful to remem-ber that the standards are based on chronic exposure. Similarly, the calculation of the cancer risk posed by genotoxic carcinogens (such as nitrosamines ,PAHs,aflatoxin and acrylamide) is somewhat conservative (due to the hypotheses applied) and may there- fore represent an overestimate of the actual risk. We must conclude that the actual health loss due to microbiological contamination of food differs from that at tributable to chemical contamination of food, even though losses as expressed in D ALYs are, at first sight, similar. While actual health effects that are structural in nature have been underestimated in the case of microbiological foodOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 163infections, they are relatively low in the case of health effects due to chemical conta- mination (which are mostly due to the allergenic substances). Moreover, the calcula-tions are mainly based on food incidents involving short-term exposure, whereby the theoretical risks (of cancer and other chronic effects) are likely to have been overesti- mated . It is no simple matter to determine whether current levels of microbiological contam- ination of food and the related health effects can be described as 'safe' or 'unsafe'. Theproblem is persistent, and the health losses are substantial. Nevertheless, clear improvements have already been made in some areas, such as the occurrence of Sal- monella in animal products, Toxoplasma in pork, and the monitoring of (the absence of) a number of pathogens in Dutch livestock. It therefore seems justified to concludethat our food has become slightly safer in recent decades. If we further consider the relative scarcity of effective refrigeration systems in the past and the generally lowerstandards of hygiene that once prevailed, it is not unreasonable to state that our foodis now safer than ever before, at least from the microbiological perspective. However, further action is still required, recommendations for which are made in section 4.2 and chapter 10 . We may also conclude that our food is safe in terms of chemical constituents. Whether it is actually 'safer than ever before', as so frequently claimed, is difficult to establish without access to comparably accurate st atistics from past eras. However, the falling levels of certain chemical food contaminants measured in recent decades sug-gest that this is indeed the case. It seems hardly necessary to state that this is largely due to the curren tsystem of admission ,setting st andards and inspection and enforce - ment. It is therefore all the more regrettable that the food-related incidents which do occur from time to time ,while seldom any threat to public health ,have eroded the impression of chemical safet y.The social disquiet seen when an ' inciden t' escalates into a 'crisis' could be expected to reduce consumer confidence in food safety. Howev- er, recent research has shown that there are no indications of any persistent or grow- ing lack of consumer confidence in food safety (Timmers & De Jonge, 2004). Never theless, food-related incidents do serve to demonstrate the vulnerability of our food supply .The globalization of food manufacturing and sales markets continues to render the food manufacturing chain longer, more complex, more difficult to control,and hence more susceptible to incidents. The impact of those incidents will alsobecome greater, in direct proportion to the new global level of scale, and will there- fore threaten consumer confidence to a comparable degree .Accordingly, the curren t system of admission, setting standards and inspection and so on must not only be maintained, control of the entire food chain must be improved and expanded. Thiswill demand better knowledge of the various food flows and of the circumstancesunder which food is produced. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 164Controversial issues Anumber of issues frequently associated with microbiological and/or chemical food safety have not been covered in sections 4.2 and 4.3,because to date they remain con- troversial. The topics falling under this heading include the alleged health risks posedbyphytoestrogens in plant-based food products, the effects of organic farming in terms of food safety, and the so-called 'hygiene hypothesis'. We conclude this chapterwith a brief consideration of these topics. Phytoestrogens There are certain substances which occur naturally in fruit and vegetables and which are known to have a hormonal effect. They may therefore influence human hormone levels when consumed. These substances are known as phytoestrogens. The two mainchemical classes into which they fall are the isoflavones and the lignans. Both show a close structural similarity to natural oestradiol, and can therefore bind to the humaneoestradiol receptor (Adlercreutz & Mazur, 1997; Kuiper et al., 1998). This can cause both antagonistic (inhibitive) and agonistic (stimulatory) effects. Accordingly, both health-promoting and health-threatening effects have been ascribed to the phytoe-strogens ,and indeed both t ypes of effect have been suppor ted in par tby epidemio- logical research as well as in vitro and in vivo studies (Adlercreutz et al., 1992; Adler- creutz, 1995; Welshons al., 1987). A recent report (Bakker, 2004) summarizes the possible 'benefits and risks' of phytoestrogens to human health, with particular reference to osteoporosis ,thyroid function ,menopausal symptoms, fertility, the immune system and cancer. In most cases however, the effects are far from clear. Forexample, phytoestrogens have been claimed to protect against breast cancer in humans .However ,both an tagonistic and agonistic effect shave been noted in labora - tory animals (Bouker & Hilakivi-Clarke, 2000; Luijten et al., 2004). Given that the binding of phy toestrogens to the oestradiol -receptor displays a much lower affinity than that of natural oestradiol (up to one thousand times lower, depending on the exact substance concerned) the possible effect would not appear to be particularly marked. However, some concern has been caused by the fact that the plasma-values of phytoestrogens, as measured after consumption of foods rich in isoflavones (e .g. soy) or lignans (e.g. linseed), can be many times greater than that of natural oestradiol .Anumber of fertility problems have been noted in sheep which have been exposed to high levels of phytoestrogens in their diet. To date,however, no hard evidence of adverse effects in humans has been produced, but nei-ther has any convincing (clinical) evidence of beneficial effects (RVZ/RIKILT, 2001; Bakker ,2004). Organic farming Organic farming involves the avoidance or reduced use of pesticides, and a style of livestock husbandry that allows animals to range freely in the open air. Although itwould not be appropriate (or possible) to examine all the supposed advan tages and disadvan tages of organic farming in this report, there are aspects of food safety which are relevan tto the topics addressed (see textbox 4.12 ). Only ver ylimited informationOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 165concerning the safety of biological products is available, and it is therefore not possi- ble to reach any firm conclusions. The hygiene hypothesis Increasingly, a connection is made or inferred bet ween the reduction in the number of microbiological infections achieved through bet ter environmen tal hygiene ,and the increase in sensitivity to food allergens. This connection goes by the name 'the hygiene hypothesis' (see textbox 4.13 ). When discussing the hygiene hypothesis, however, it is essential to avoid any confu- sion with the notion that we should deliberately expose children to infections ,per- haps by refusing to have them vaccinated ,refusing antibiotics, or applying less strin- gent standards for microbiological food safety. Further research is needed to ascertainthe exact mechanisms at work, the extent to which the immune system is influencedand how the results of such research can be applied in practice. 4 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 166Textbox 4.12: Organic farming. Many individual consumers and societal groups advocate a transition from the current forms ofintensive livestock farming and crop productionto 'organic farming'. Their motives are many andvaried, ranging from concern for animal welfareto that for the environment. The policy document'Organic Farming 2001-2004' (Ministry of Agricul-ture, Nature and Food Quality) states the ambitionof having approximately 10% of all farmlandworked according to biological methods by theyear 2010. It is often suggested that organic farmingincreases the risk of environmental contaminants, mycotoxins and phytotoxins entering food prod-ucts of vegetable and animal origin, and will alsoincrease the risk of food intoxications due to microbiological contamination. This argument is based on the r educed use of pesticides and vet - erinary medicines, and the fact that animals are allowed to range freely in the open air. One example which illustrates the potentialmicr obiological pr oblem is the risk of Toxoplasma gondii .Based on serological population research, Kortbeek etal.(2004) conclude that the immunestatus of young Dutch people has been lowered substantially following the complete exclusion of Toxoplasma gondii from its primary source, pork. If pigs are once again kept outdoors, they willonce again become infected (Kijlstra etal., 2004). Pregnant women form the group at highest risk ofserious effects from an infection. They now havefar lower acquired immunity to toxoplasmosis.This indicates an increase in the incidence ofcongenital toxoplasmosis in the coming years ifpigs are allowed to range freely. However, thereare other risk factors implicated in toxoplasmosis,including gar dening without gloves or travelling to countries with a high infection rate, such asthose of southern Europe. An example of a potential chemical contaminationproblem is that the reduced use of crop protec-tion agents during the pr oduction and storage of grain will encourage fungal growth, which maycause increased levels of mycotoxins. Moreover,the avoidance or sparing use of pesticides in cropproduction could lead to higher infection or pr e- dation rates, and hence to higher levels of phyto- toxins further to the 'stress response'.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 4 167Textbox 4.13: The hygiene hypothesis. Allergies form an increasing public health prob- lem in the western world. A propensity to thedevelopment of an allergy ('atopy') is now seen inapproximately 30% of the western population, buttoafarsmaller degree in the non-industrialized countries. Although genetic factors go some waytowards explaining susceptibility to allergies (inabout 30% of cases), genetic factors clearly can-not explain the rapid rise in allergy-related condi-tions in the wealthier countries which has beenseen during recent decades. The 'hygiene hypoth-esis' therefore assumes a connection betweenthe increased sensitivity to allergic conditions onthe one hand, and the decrease in the incidenceof micr obiological (food) infections on the other, due to our living environment becoming more andmore hygienic. Although not all studies are in fullconcordance, the majority of epidemiologicalstudies tend Nevertheless, the hygiene hypothesis remainscontr oversial, and the mechanism underlying this possible effect has not been explained. It was originally postulated that a cer tain phase in the maturation of the immune system of young chil - dren was the deciding factor: the development of amixed Th1/Th2 response. At birth, the immune system is immatur e, and develops mostly type-2 helper cells (Th2). During the first two years oflife, the development of type-1 helper cells (Th1) is stimulated by exposure to bacterial, mycobac-terial and viral infections. If many of these infec-tions are avoided entirely through improvedhygiene, vaccinations and the use of antibiotics, itis assumed that the Th1 response will not be ade-quately stimulated. The development of a Th2response will continue unimpeded, with the relat-ed production of IgE and the likelihood of allergicreactions thereafter. This hypothesis appears tobe contradicted by the observation that countrieswith a high standard of hygiene have seen a sub-stantial increase in not only the Th2 diseases(allergies), but also in the Th1-related auto-immune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, ar thri- tis and multiple sclerosis over the past decades.However, a significant contribution to understand-ing the underlying mechanisms has recently beenmade by Y azdanbakhsh etal.(2002), who have dis - covered a new cell type: the regulatory T-cell or Treg.This cell type can act as a sort of natural 'brake' on both Th2 and Th1 diseases, such asallergies and multiple sclerosis. This finding wasrecently confirmed by the RIVM using a mouse- model (Reimerink et al ., in pr eparation). A r ela- tively harmless virus infection contracted at a very young age was shown to protect against thedevelopment of aller gy in later life.

Veldhoven, the Netherlands: 2004.5 WHAT IS THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT DOING TO ENSURE SAFE FOOD ? M.C.M. Busch 5.1 Introduction The Dutch government regards it as an important public task to ensure that the food products available in the Netherlands are safe. The consumer must be confident that food products meet high standards of safety. The responsibilities in this regard are arranged as follows. The government 1creates the preconditions for the private sector by means of laws and regulations, including the setting of standards, and conducts supervisory activities. Within the bounds of these preconditions, the private sector bears primary responsibility for food safety. As the final link in the chain, the con- sumer is expected to handle food in a responsible manner (LNV & VWS, 2001). This chapter examines the relevan tinitiatives and activities under taken by the Dutch government in recent years, and how these activities relate to the developments and problems described in chapter 4 .This chapter focuses on the efforts made by national government, which are placed in the context of international food safety policy wher- ever possible .The effor ts and activities relating to food safety of other actors (such as product boards, industry and trade federations, the Dutch Consumers' Association,research institutes, municipal or regional health services, etc.) are not considered in detail here ,and are men tioned only where relevan ttonational polic yand it simple - mentation. The con tentsof this chapter are largely based on parliamen tary documents, including policy documents, progress reports and letters (see table 5.1 ).Section 5.2 sets out the government's policy objectives and priorities. This is followed by a brief account of the instruments and measures used to achieve these objectives in section 5.3 .Section 5.4 then examines the activities undertaken by the State Inspectorate concerned with food safet y, while section 5.5 considers the exten tto which government efforts address the main threat sdescribed in chapter 4 .The final section ( 5.6)presen ts the summary and conclusions.OUR 1731Governmen tresponsibilit yfor food safet ymatters is shared equally by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport(VWS) and the Ministr yof Agriculture ,Nature and Food Quality (LNV). The Ministry of Health, Wel- fare and Spor tis responsible for consumer protection and hence for the safet yof product s,general hygiene requiremen ts,legislative requiremen ts for the chain as a whole, and for the control of zoonotic diseases which pose a threat to human health .The Ministr yof Agriculture ,Nature and F ood Quality is responsible for the requiremen tscovering the production phase ,the qualit ymanagement arrangements of individual companies ,inspection of veterinar yhealth and welfare ,and for the con trol and inspection of product sand processes (F olber t&Dagevos, 2000).5.2 Policy: objectives and priorities Food safety is an important policy objective of the Dutch government. This section examines in more detail the objectives and priorities which have been stated in policydocuments and official letters during the past twenty years (see table 5.1 ). 1983-1999: building the safety system The governmen t's 1983 polic ydocument on nutrition (see also section 3.1 )was con - cerned with all aspect sof food safet yand a healthy diet in the Netherlands .With regard to safety, the document stated that the consumer is dependent upon both the government and the manufacturers for the safety of his or her diet, and that adequate policy measures in this area are, and will remain, of great importance. The document went on to state that, in the light of the food safety incidents which occur from time to time ,there is no justification for any easing of active government control. However, the priorit yat this time is to promote good eating habits, since it is thought that this approach will achieve the greatest health gain. \"The safety aspect often receives a dis-proportionately large share of publicity, which distracts attention from the majorimportance of the individual's choice of food in terms of health,\" the policy document stated (here in translation ;see also chapter 3 ). 5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 174Table 5.1: Most important policy documents on food safety published in the past 20 years2.

However, because the descriptions in the annual reports are somewhat general and arethemselves based on the policy documents (to which they refer), it has been decided not to include thesereports as a separate source. A number of other letters and reports on food safety matters have been sub-mitted to parliament, particularly in recent years. Because these relate to specific matters rather thangeneral policy, they too have been omitted from the table.Two subsequent Progress Reports presented the results of the policy efforts and announced new developments. The First Progress Report, like the original policydocument, acknowledged that the food products available in the Netherlands meet stringent safety standards, singling out only the chance of infection with harmfulmicro-organisms as a problem. Protection against such contamination was thereforegiven high priority. Policy remained geared towards measures which would reduce orprevent food contamination wherever possible. The Second Progress Report onceagain expressly stated that Dutch food is safe. This was attributed to an improvedregulatory infrastructure in which the set standards and effective inspection activities were in balance. Afew particular aspects were to be given extra attention. On the subject of chemical contaminants, and more specifically the veterinary medicines residues policy, these include the subjects of antibiotics and growth promoters, and the subsectors of milk,poultry and fish farming products. In the latter half of the 1990s, policy focused on reducing microbiological contamina- tion.In 1997, following the iden tification of t wo cases of B SE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, popularly known as 'mad cow disease') in the Netherlands, this problem also became a spearhead of policy. 1999-2002: revision and updating of polic ydue to food inciden ts The 1999 dioxin affair in Belgium led to food safety being placed at the top of the Dutch political agenda (and indeed that of the European Union). The Dutch govern- mentcommissioned a repor tof the dioxin inciden t(Berenschot ,1999), which explored opportunities to improve coordination and communication. The report stat- ed that the curren tlaws and regulations and the arrangemen ts for inspection, detec- tion and communication were complex ,afinding endorsed by the governmen t(VWS et al., 2000). However, the government did not consider the report's conclusions to justify any reassignment of public sector responsibilities, and produced a response which stated that the food products available to the Dutch consumer demonstrated a 'high level of quality and safety'. Nevertheless, because this standpoint was not in line with general public opinion ,it was acknowledged that communication between the governmen tand the public would present challenges for the foreseeable future. The Berenschot report did lead to a number of measures intended to improve workingprocesses, coordination and communication 3.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 5 1753Measures included the est ablishmen tof a 24-hour repor ting organization, offering direct contact with a repor ting st ation at the Ministr yof Health, Welfare and Sport and one at the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and F ood Qualit y. These ministries and the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environ- mentset up depar tmental food safety commissions, responsible for ensuring an adequate response in both normal and crisis situations .An in terdepartmental committee with representatives from all three min- istries was also formed to improve the coordination of existing structures and approaches with regard tofood and food safet y.This committee was also expected to monitor relevant trends, and ensure an appro- priate response on the par tof their respective organizations .The Netherlands Nutrition Centre was asked to devise and implemen talong-term communication programme on the topic of food safety.There then followed three policy documents in quick succession, each devoting con- siderable attention to the safety aspect. The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and FoodQuality's Kracht en Kwaliteit ('Strength and Quality') document of 1999 emphasized the vulnerability of the agro-food sector in terms of falling consumer confidence. Theconsumer's demands on food were becoming ever more exacting, with regard to bothsafety as well as specific aspects of the production process such as animal welfare andenvironmental effects. In many cases, the consumer's expectations exceeded the leg-islative requirements. The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality wished toaddress this situation by developing integrated quality systems for the food industry, which would cover all critical phases of the production process and which would result in standards of safety higher than those provided by the statutory minimum standards. Given its vulnerability, extra attention was devoted to the meat industryand specifically to animal feed which forms a critical link at the beginning of the pro- duction chain. Alongside the aim of protecting the consumer against food contamina-tion, the government also made the restoration of consumer confidence an explicitaim. The various topics were fur ther elaborated in the vision documen t Voedsel en Groen ('Food and Greenery'), published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality in 2000. This document describes the ideal situation of a 'sustainable' Dutchagro-food complex which is a fully integrated part of society and which leads the way in Europe .Here ,'sustainable' entails taking into account the health and safety of humans, animals and ecosystems. The dimensions are therefore product safety, sus-tainable production methods and the sustainability of the production setting (the landscape). This documen talso announced the formation of a ' Netherlands F ood Authority' (the present Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority), an organiza- tion which would provide independen tscien tific the policy. Amore det ailed accoun tof the work of the F ood and Consumer Product Safet y Authority (VWA) is given in section 5.4 . In 2001, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality published the joint policy document Veilig voedsel in een veranderende omgeving ('Safe food in a changing setting'), presenting proposals for governmen tpolicy for the period 2001 to 2004. This document states that the objec- tive of food safety policy is \"to maintain and enhance a high level of consumer healthprotection by means of clear food safety standards\". The primary aim was to ensurethat the consumer can be confident that the food products available meet high safety requiremen ts.However ,it was acknowledged that it will not be possible to achieve the 'zero risk' situation, a fact that calls for clear and transparent communication with and information to the consumer. The document went on to promise further efforts inthis regard during the years to come. It announced action in terms of policy and orga-nization pertaining to food safety, with particular regard to improvement of riskassessmen tand the setting of standards, coordination of laws and regulations and greater oppor tunity for emergency measures to be implemented (especially in the pri- maryproduction sector), the updating of the ' chain guarantee systems' and, as previ-5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 176ously mentioned, the establishment of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Author- ity. These proposals were incorporated into a joint Action Plan for both ministries andare examined in further detail in section 5.3 . In 2002, the ministers of Health, Welfare and Sport and of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality produced an official response to the Health Council's advisory report onfoodborne infections ( Gezondheidsraad ,2000). The ministers proposed addressing the problem of foodborne infections 'on a broad front', with the focus on the effectivereduction of pathogens in food products of animal origin throughout the production chain. Although it was acknowledged that it will never be possible to eliminate pathogens entirely, a tightening of existing measures was announced with regard to such aspects as the detection of pathogens at various points in the production chain.The measures are listed in section 5.5 . In summary, we may state that a clear shift in policy was apparent in the late 1990s, with the government's responsibility for food safety being reaffirmed. Prior to this, although the importance of ongoing efforts was acknowledged (particularly withregard to microbiological con tamination), top priorit ywas given to promoting healthy eating habits. At the time, the government was satisfied with the outcome of its efforts in the field of food safety (VWS, 1998). It was the Belgian dioxin crisis thateventually led to the realization that policy had to be made yet stricter and that the relevan torganizational structure had to be modernized .Alongside effective con- sumer protection, good communication with the public became a key objective offood safety policy. 5.3 Measures targeting food safety This section offers a general description of the measures and instruments which the Dutch government has applied over the past twenty years to address its policy objec- tives and priorities (see foregoing section). In particular, we consider the measures announced in the 2001 policy document 'Safe food in a changing setting'. Van der Doelen 's classification of instruments as 'legislative', 'communicative' or 'economic' has been applied (V an der Doelen, 1993; see also chapter 3 ). Legislation has always had a key role Laws and regulations are the main instruments at the government's disposal with regard to consumer protection in general ,and with regard to food safet yin par ticu- lar. The First Progress Report further to the policy document on nutrition (1987) notes that, \"the interests of ensuring food safety are of such importance that the instrumentof legislation must play a key role; primary responsibility rests with the government,for whom regulation remains essential. Self-regulation and information will play asecondar yrole in this area.\" OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 5 177Over the years, an extensive system of laws and regulations has been developed to address matters of food safety. Since the Netherlands became a member of the Euro-pean Union in 1957, almost all national legislation in this area has been based on European directives. There is now a considerable degree of harmonization through-out the European Union, which means that the member states are required to observeEuropean statutes 4.In this context, it is important to mention that the so-called 'Gen- eral Food Law' came into effect on 21 February 2002. This European Parliament andCouncil regulation, which was adopted on 28 January 2002, establishes the generalprinciples of both European and national food-related law. Member states were given until 1 January 2005 to modify their national regulations accordingly. Acomplex set of laws and regulations were developed and are now in place. The 2001 policy document 'Safe food in a changing setting' notes that it is the very complexity of the laws and regulations, whose development was partly influenced by Europeanregulations, which hinders the effective application of food safety supervision. Besidesthe Warenwet (Commodities Act), which is the key legislative instrument, there are several other relevant statutes: the Gezondheids- en Welzijnswet voor dieren (Animal Health and W elfare Act), the Vleeskeuringwet (Meat Inspection Act), the Destructiewet (Dry Rendering Act), the Bestrijdingsmiddelenwet (Pesticides Act), the Landbouw- kwaliteitswet (Agricultural Produce Quality Control Act) and the Kaderwet Diervoeders (Framework Act on Animal Feeds). A brief description of each is given (in Dutch) on the website of the Netherlands Nutrition Cen tre at www .voedingscentrum.nl .There is also a considerable body of legislation which establishes how these various statutesare to be implemented in practice 5.The 2001 policy document cites optimization of legislative coordination as one of the spearheads of polic y.Legislation covering food and food safety will therefore be further streamlined and integrated, with due regard for developmen tsin European regulations. Another 'sticking point' identified by the 2001 policy document is that legislation does not provide adequate measures for use in a crisis situation. Accordingly, creating greater opportunities for emergency measures to be implemented, particularly in the primary production sector, is cited as a further spearhead of policy. The intention is that emergenc ymeasures in the primary phase should have a firm legislative basis, whereby they will be est ablished as a public sector responsibility. This will entail some modification to the existing arrangements in cases where product boards have someresponsibility. The legislation will also ensure that emergency measures become effec-tive immediately, once they have been announced in the media. The 'Framework Act on Animal F eeds'(LNV & VW S, 2003b) is an example of recen tlegislation which has been framed around these intentions. The act provides a facilitative 'framework' for5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1784As a member state of the European Union, the Netherlands does of course have a say in the matter, and thus contributes to the development of European policy. 5Government responsibility for regulation can also be delegated. For example, the government has given product boards and professional organizations (representing a certain sector or a certain professionalgroup) the status of a 'public law professional organization' (PBO), which entitles them to impose bindingregulations for products or production methods within the relevant sector.further national regulations covering animal feed products, whereby responsibility for all related interests may be exercised by the government. In addition to the regu-laradministrative measures (such as administrative enforcement), it will also be possi- ble to implement emergency measures, subject only to an announcement in themedia. The Act therefore also represents a re-assignment of responsibilities withregard to animal feeds, between the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Qualityand the Product Board for Animal Feed. Setting standards: the development of intake, product and process standards The establishment of set standards represents an extremely useful instrument at the disposal of the government. \"[The system of standards] offers a clear framework with- in which the private sector can exercise its own responsibility with regard to safeproducts\", according to the 2001 policy document 'Safe food in a changing setting'. In most cases, the standards are based on risk assessment, i.e. an estimate of the healthrisk to consumers at various levels of exposure to a chemical substance or a micro-organism 6(see also chapter 4 ). Many chemical substances are now subject to intake standards which state the quantity of that substance which may be ingested, based on an 'accept able'or 'tolerable' daily intake. The standards are themselves based on a scientific interpretation of toxicological data. There are also product standards, which determine the maximum quantity of a certain chemical substance which is permittedin a given product. These standards are based on the applicable intake standards and adefined diet arypattern. In establishing product standards, policy objectives will often be taken into consideration. Product standards play an important part in termsof international trade, and have long been established at the international level, either by the European Union or by the Codex Alimentarius Commission7.Most food safety incidents either involve incidents where standards were exceeded, or the com- plete lack of any product st andard . In the case of microbiological safety, the main instruments are the process standards, which play an important part in controlling the growth of pathogenic micro- organisms. Examples include the various hygiene requirements and HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points; see section 4.2 ). Due to the increasing complexity and scope of some processes ,random sampling and inspection of the safety of a product is no longer enough .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 5 1796In addition to the setting of standards, there are other measures which the government can apply where a risk has been established, in order to regulate the safety of food products throughout the chain. It can, for example, impose an outright ban on the use of certain substances, whereby the problem is addressed at its source. 7The Codex Alimentarius Commission was founded in 1962 by two United Nations organizations, the FAO and the WHO. It is an intergovernmental organization which has 167 member countries (at January 2003),including the Netherlands. The European Commission is one of the official observers. Among the objec-tives of the Codex are to protect public health and to promote fair trade in food products. Its main task,however, is to develop and maintain regional and global standards, guidelines and recommendationswith regard to food safety and hygiene, processing and storage, quality, labelling and packaging. Since itsfoundation, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has produced thousands of standards which have beenadopted worldwide.The 2001 policy document 'Safe food in a changing setting' stresses the importance of thorough risk assessment in maintaining food safety. It goes on to concede that thereremain several sticking points with regard to the setting of standards, criteria and risk assessment procedures. With regard to the setting of standards, the document statesthat product standards will be extended, both nationally and internationally. Effortsto control Salmonella will focus on pork and eggs, while STEC O157 in beef and Listeria monocytogenes will also be subject to greater attention. Mycotoxins will be controlled by means of standards applying to both food products and animal feeds, with theimmediate focus on ochratoxin, tricothenes (including DON), zearalenon and fumon- isin. In addition to the product standards, process standards will also be extended. The government wishes to expedite the introduction of HACCP at all stages of the produc- tion chain, including the primary sector and slaughterhouses. The importance ofHACCP as a process standard is to be discussed further at European level. Some mem- ber states have yet to be persuaded of the value of HACCP in de primary sector. Communication and public information given greater attention following food incidents The governmen tis responsible for risk communication .It is expected to inform parlia - ment and the general public (consumers and the industry) about the risks identified and its response to those risks. The official report examining the Belgian dioxin crisis(see section 5.2 )noted that poor communication was one of the sticking points with regard to food safet y.This prompted various initiatives intended to improve commu- nication and thus restore consumer confidence. The ministries of Health, Welfare andSport, Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, and Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environmen tmade agreemen tsconcerning the coordination of their communica - tions in the event of an incident, and about who would act as spokesman to the press and public .It was decided that special communication channels - telephone helplines and In ternet sites - would be opened to the public in the even tof an inciden t. Various other activities were commenced with a view to strengthening the lines of communi- cation between the government and the consumer. The Nutrition Centre was asked to implement a long-term communication programme and has since started several communication projects. The question of whether it is possible to provide consumers with information about the origins and processing histor yof a product by means of barcodes is being investigated .The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality has set up a consumer consultation platform in order to increase consumer involve-ment in policy matters 8.The creation of this platform is further to agreements at5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1808The platform was founded in 2002 further to the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality's desire to gain a better understanding of the concerns and preferences of consumers, information which is essen- tial in formulating effective policy. The platform comprises twenty members and meets three times a yearto discuss topics selected by the members themselves. Each topic is subject to a public opinion survey. Themeetings have resulted in several creative suggestions for new policy. A the time of writing, the platformhad discussed six topics: where does my meat come from; opting for fruit and vegetables; genetic modifi-cation and food; fish, but only if it is safe; the price of sustainable food production and food in ten yearstime. The topics scheduled for discussion in 2004 were: risk perception; from sustainable production toconsumption; and natural quality. After each meeting, the ministry selects a number of suggestions forpossible inclusion in policy. For further information (in Dutch), see www.minlnv.nl/consumentenplatform.European level, whereby the public is to be more closely involved in formulating poli- cy on food from 2005. The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA; see section 5.4) has also been given an important part to play with regard to communication about food and foodsafety. In late 2003, the Authority entered into a cooperative agreement with theNutrition Centre which sets out the responsibilities of each party concerning commu-nication about safety. The purpose of the resulting partnership is to ensure that theconsumer receives full, clear information, whereby the approaches adopted by the two organizations will be mutually supported. The VWA's main concern is the protec- tion of public health, while that of the Nutrition Centre is consumer education about diet and nutrition. The VWA advises the government, and many of its communicationactivities concern actual research results and proven high-risk products. The commu- nication activities of the Nutrition Centre are concerned with aspects of both healthand safety and are often designed to address the individual consumer. They explainthe consequences of food safety problems and make recommendations for the actions that can be taken, including food preparation behaviour in the domestic setting. In addition to consumer information about the importance of good hygiene when storing and preparing food, the government also uses information to promotehygiene and good production methods on the part of the private sector and those who prepare food professionally, whether in commercial outlet sor in hospit als, schools, staff canteens, etc. Subsidies and financial incen tives Besides laws and regulations (including the setting of standards) and communication (education and information), the governmen talso has access to economic polic y instrumen tswhich can assist in regulating food safet y.The governmen t's 2001 policy document 'Safe food in a changing setting' announced financial incentives to encour- age the private sector to take part in a supply chain quality management system. Companies requiring additional inspections because they do not form part of a certi- fied supply chain quality management system will be charged for the work involved. Asystem of administrative fines is to be in troduced for breaches of the Commodities Act,regardless of whether the company concerned forms part of a supply chain quali- ty management system (see also section 5.4). The government also intends to implement measures with regard to infrastructure, research and information provision .In recen tyears ,for example ,funds have been devoted to improving the monitoring system for food safety. Implementation of the enhancements commenced in 2003. To summarize, we may state that the national food safety policy relies for the most parton laws and regulations, including set standards. In recent years, however, the governmen thas also made increasing use of communications and economic instru- ments. The list of legislative orders and bans, together with the financial incentives,OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 5 181are directed mainly at the production, distribution and processing industries, while information is targeting distribution, processing and the consumer. Dutch nationalpolicy is increasingly in keeping with European policy on food and food safety. 5.4 Supervision of food safety Supervisory function enhanced by creation of Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) The government is responsible for drawing up guidelines, standards and regulations, and is also responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations on the part of the private sector. Traditionally, this has always been a State Inspectorate's task. Today,the public body responsible for supervision and regulation is the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA), established in 2002 by merging of the former Inspec-torate for Health Protection and Veterinary Public Health (KvW) and the NationalInspection Service for Livestock and Meat (RVV) 9.The VWA monitors, inspects and controls the entire production chain and all production processes. Their controllersand inspectors visit abat toirs,fish auctions ,factories ,catering establishments and other organizations on a daily basis, conducting on-the-spot product inspections, tak- ing samples for further analysis and inspecting lots of meat and fish. The InspectionService for Livestock and Meat is also concerned with the prevention and control of veterinar ydisease .The tasks and responsibilities of the inspectorates are established by national and international laws and regulations. From 2005, for example, the EU'sGeneral Food Law renders the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority responsi- ble for the traceabilit yof product s.The in tention is that the t wo divisions will merge and will eventually work as a single regulatory authority. The creation of the F ood and Consumer Product Safet yAuthorit y(VWA) was the Dutch government's response to a number of incidents in the late 1990s, and to the creation of the European Food Safety Authority10.By merging the former food inspectorates and by integrating supervision, research and recommendations, the government aims to enhance the supervisory function. The VWA should conduct its public tasks from a central position, being responsible for all supervision, research (risk assessment) and communication (see also the preceding section). The F ood and Consumer Product Safety Authority's purview is that of human and veterinary health protection and5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1829There are three further public inspectorates: the Algemene Inspectiedienst (General Inspectorate) and the Plantenziektenkundige Dienst (Inspectorate of Plant Health) which form part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, and the Inspectie Milieuhygi\u00ebne (Inspectorate for the Environment) which forms part of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment. There are also a number of private sector organizations to which regulatory tasks have been delegated. These include the Kwaliteitsdienst Diervoeders (Product Board for Animal Feed) and the Centraal Orgaan voor Kwaliteitsaangelegenheden in de Zuivel (Controlling Authority for Milk and Milk Products). The activities of these organizations are subject to government supervision. 10The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was founded in 2001. The EFSA has an authoritative, coordi- nating role with regard to risk assessment, research and risk communication activities. Its creation pro-vides uniformity in the interpretation and action further to food risks on the part of the European Unionmember states, each of which was required to set up a national food safety authority.product safety and encompasses entire production chains, the use of the end product, and all intermediate processes. The Authority forms part of the State Inspectorate ofHealth and, in addition to ensuring compliance with legislative ordinances, must also research and advise on situations which pose a (potential) hazard to health. The objec-tives of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority are stated as: \"to make a realand demonstrable contribution to the reduction and/or proactive management ofhealth and safety risks, and to maintain and/or restore public confidence in the safetyof food and other consumer products\" (VWA, 2002, here in translation). Although itremains necessary to exercise close control of the entire chain, it is seen as increasing- ly important to ensure the reduction of the known existing dangers and risks. Strengthening the independent status of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority In 2003, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) was transferred from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport to become an agency of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Nature and Food Quality. The two ministers justified this move in a letter to the Lower House, stating that the organizational position of a control apparatuscovering the en tire chain is more appropriate to the responsibilities of the Ministr yof Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, which is also concerned with the chain as a whole (LNV & VWS, 2003a). The letter went on to state that a functional separationbetween supervision (i.e. inspection tasks) and risk assessment (i.e. advisory and research t asks) was considered essen tial in order to ensure the independent position of the Authority's advisory role. This would further emphasize the fact that researchundertaken by the Authority is conducted entirely without influence on the part of ministers or inspection ser vices .However ,close cooperation bet ween the various units of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority would remain essential. A draftbill was scheduled to be presen ted to parliament in the first half of 2004, to establish the legislative position of the independen tadvisor yand research roles . Private sector responsibilities One principle of current regulatory practice is that companies themselves will accept greater responsibility and will implement certain self-regulation measures. The Food and Consumer Product Safet yAuthority would then become the 'supervisor of supervi- sorysystems'. The strategic spearheads are: supervision of the entire production chain in addition to the inspection of individual companies, imported products presentingspecific risks, the individual branches of chain organizations lacking an adequateinternal food safety policy, and those parts of the sector in which hygiene codes have not yet been implemen ted,or have been implemen ted only recen tly (VW A, 2002). The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority has various sanctions at its disposal. Where shortcomings are found, the Authority can issue a formal warning, impose afine, or can implement legal proceedings. If an immediate danger to public healthexists, the Authority can order a company to recall products which have already been sold.However, unlike its counterparts in some other countries, the Food and Con- sumer Product Safet yAuthorit ycannot shut down a company 'on the spot'. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 5 183Long-term vision of VWA, 2004-2007 In late 2003, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority published its 'long- term vision' for the period 2004-2007. This document provides the outline for the Authority's activities during the years ahead, and states the following strategic princi-ples: Risk assessment is to address both the facts and consumer perception Prevention and a proactive policy are encouraged as a means of achieving risk reduction Rights and responsibilities are to be re-evaluated The document goes on to list many topics which are to be given priority. They include potential new risks such as new zoonotic and veterinary diseases, new mycotoxins and phytotoxins, and new allergens. Specific attention is also to be devoted to animalfeeds, foodborne infections and intoxications, import, tracking and tracing, enhance- ment of the position of the supervisory function within the policy cycle, effectivenessincrisis situations, and the development of risk communication. To summarize: measures to ensure that the private sector complies with the require- mentsof food safet ylegislation have been in place for many years .Various develop- ments and incidents have made it clear that the government must also invest in risk assessment and communication. The prompt identification of potential hazards isextremely important, and there must be proactive measures as well as repressive mea- sures .The F ood and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) was set up further to European policy, and combines the familiar supervisory tasks with those relating torisk assessment and risk communication. It will continue to strive to become a thor- oughly authorit ative organization in all spheres . 5.5 Efforts targeting the main threats to food safety 5.5.1 Microbiological hazards As we saw in chapter 4 (section 4.2), foodborne infections remain a persisten tproblem in the Netherlands ,with Salmonella, Campylobacter, the noroviruses and Clostridium perfringens jointly responsible for over 50% of food-related illnesses. However, further to integrated food safety policy, it is considered important that the government doesnot restrict its attention to these pathogens alone. Government concern for microbiological hazards to food safety is long established. Both progress reports further to the Nutrition policy document of 1983 state thatmicrobiological hazards should be treated as a matter of priority. The measures imple-mented in the 1990s were largely concerned with improving hygiene within the pro-duction process (such as the in troduction of HACCP). Both the 'Food and Greenery' documen tand the food safety policy document of 2001 propose further measures to preven tfoodborne infections .During the past few years, investments have been made5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 184inrisk assessment models focusing on Salmonella in poultry and eggs, Campylobacter in chicken meat, STEC 0157 in beef and Listeria in pre-prepared ('chilled') products. In its response to the Health Council's advisory report (2000) on foodborne infections, the government stated that the problem should now be tackled 'on a broad front'(VWS & LNV, 2002). Priority would be given to Salmonella in eggs, poultry and pork,Campylobacter in poultry, Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk products and other products, and E. coli in beef. The measures implemented included a ban on the supply or trading of any eggs contaminated with Salmonella ,while various hygiene codes were revised to preclude the use of raw eggs in uncooked products such as bavarois and tiramisu. A (temporary) warning was issued with regard to poultry. At the time of writing, the introduction of decontamination methods (techniques which kill bacteriain raw products before they reach the shops) was under consideration, subject to cer- tain conditions. The government has also been actively involved in formulating offi-cial 'food safety objectives' (FSOs), based on thorough risk analyses. These would serveto reduce the risk of infection via raw foods of animal origin. The Dutch government intends to produce a set of food safety objectives for Salmonella in poultry and porksome time before 2010 (the t arget date set by the European Union), whereby the objectives will include Campylobacter. The response to the Health Council's report also promised further funding for research, since too little is known about the spread,incidence, health effects and costs of food contamination. The results of this research will be used to formulate fur ther in tervention strategies. The policy document 'Living longer in good health' (2003) announces a ban on the sale of poultr yinfected with Salmonella or Campylobacter ,effective from 2007, pro - vided this can be reconciled with EU legislation. Tosummarize ,we may st ate that the Dutch governmen tis fully aware of the impor - tance of efforts to counter microbiological hazards, and has indeed implemented var- ious measures and initiatives to reduce the incidence of food infections. It has done so as part of general policy, and with policy targeting some specific pathogens, includ- ing Salmonella and Campylobacter (see also chapter 4 ). 5.5.2 Chemical hazards Asstated in chapter 4 (4.3) ,the incidence of death and disease which can be directly ascribed to chemical food con tamination is relatively low compared to that due to microbiological contamination. Nevertheless, it is essential that there be a continuing focus on preserving an adequate maintenance level with regard to the chemical risks.Additional attention should be devoted to allergenic substances. Concerning food -related allergy, the Dutch government mainly targets the consumer, who should be thoroughly and objectively informed about food constituen ts which can provoke an allergic reaction .The Netherlands Nutrition Cen tre is responsible forOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 5 185consumer information concerning hypersensitivity to food and product composition, and has compiled lists of products which may contain components to which the con-sumer is sensitive or allergic. This information is based on the 'ALBA' database of aller- gens which is maintained by the Netherlands Organization for Applied ScientificResearch (TNO) and funded by the government. (At the time of writing, the future ofthis database was uncertain). The policy document Langer gezond leven ('Living longer in good health') (2003) also devoted attention to food allergies and food intolerance. The increased prevalence of such conditions prompted the government to request the Health Council to produce an advisory report. In addition, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority was scheduled to produce a report in 2004 on ways in which EU labelling legislation couldbe better enforced, thus ensuring that product labels provide more complete informa- tion to consumers with an allergy. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport will alsoproduce an integrated action plan with regard to food allergies and intolerance(VWS, 2003). In short, the Dutch government's policy documents devote considerable attention to the topic of food hypersensitivity. 5.6 Summary and conclusions Examination of the polic ydocumen ts studied for this report allows us to draw the fol- lowing conclusions: Food safet yhas always enjoyed governmen tattention.Many laws and regulations have been passed, and many standards established. However, following a number of inciden tsin the late 1990s, it was acknowledged that policy should be made yet more stringen t,and that the organizational structure with regard to food safet yregulation was in need of reform. The emphasis would then be placed on food safety throughout the entire production chain, rather than only that of the end product. Alongside con- sumer protection, open communication with the general public was established as a key objective. National policy is increasingly being developed in line with that at Euro- pean level ,and is indeed increasingly determined by the European Union. The gov- ernmen tbelieves that supervision will be rendered yet more effective following the establishment of the national Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA). In recent years, the Dutch government has implemented various measures and initia- tives addressing the main problems in terms of microbiological and chemical food contamination, as listed in chapter 4 .It has done so in its general policy, aimed at reducing foodborne infections, and by means of policy targeting specific pathogenssuch as Salmonella and Campylobacter, two of the most important pathogens in theNetherlands. In terms of chemical hazards, the main focus has been on food hypersen- sitivity ,i.e. allergenic food constituents. 5 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 186Acomparison of the policy documents in terms of their attention to a healthy diet on the one hand, and food safety on the other, leads to two notable findings. Firstly, wesee that the two aspects were addressed in tandem during the 1980s, but increasingly became seen as two separate issues. Secondly, the relative importance attached tothese aspects has fluctuated over the years. In the early 1980s, for example, thegovernment called for greater attention to be devoted to a healthy diet, while in thelate 1990s, the focus was on food safety. Although we can state that the Dutch government has shown clear and systematic concern for both a healthy diet and food safety, this does not answer every possible question about its policy. For example, the documents say little about the effective- ness of past policy measures, nor do they state clear results with regard to the pro-posed measures. Similarly, it is not yet clear whether current policy takes sufficient account of likely future developments (see chapter 9 ). This aspect has not been addressed in this chapter.

Jansen # 6.1 Introduction There is a category of food products which demand special attention in terms of their alleged health-promoting effects and their safety aspects: so-called functional foods and dietary supplements. Given increasing consumer interest in the relationship between diet and health, such products have been gaining popularity for some time.The industry has taken advantage of this trend by offering an ever-larger range of products which are claimed to have a beneficial effect on health. Within the generalgroup of functional foods and dietary supplements, we can distinguish between tradi-tional foods with a modified composition, and products offered in a pharmaceutical form i.e. pills, potions, capsules, drops and powders. As yet, no uniform terminologyapplies to such product s,nationally or in ternationally .The former products are known under such names as functional foods, specific health promoting foods or food products with health claims .The latter are also described as nutraceuticals, health prod- ucts or dietary supplements with health claims. For the sake of convenience, we shall use the terms ' functional foods 'and 'health products'. In this report, functional foods will be defined as 'traditional foods or beverages that contain certain ingredients orcomponents of ingredients to a greater or smaller extent, on the basis of which the manufacturer claims that the modified product has cer tain positive effect son the user's health which surpass the nutritional health effects of the original product' (after VW S, 2002). Examples of functional foods include milk with added calcium, yoghur twith added bifidobacteria ,and margarine with added plan tsterols .Health products may be defined as products which are usually offered in pharmaceutical form or in a form emulating that of pharmaceutical products, but which are not clas- sified as a prescription drug. Manufacturers market these products with a wide range of claims stating or implying potential positive health effects (VWS, 2002). Health product sinclude such products as dietary supplements and herbal preparations. An important question with regard to both categories is whether they do indeed have any beneficial health effect and whether they can achieve any health gain. Equallyimportant is the question of whether they are safe. In many cases, the positive effect of such product shas yet to be (adequately) demonstrated .Moreover ,the use of these products may represent certain risks, such as overdosing when the consumer ingests several products on a daily basis, each containing the same health-promoting ingre-dient.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 189#With con tributions by M .I.Bakker and A .G.A.C.KnaapThis chapter seeks to answer these questions. Section 6.2 lists some of the functional foods and health products currently available in the Netherlands. Section 6.3 examines the regulatory legislation in place. We then examine the potential health gain repre- sented by these products ( section 6.4 ), the potential health risks ( section 6.5 )and the use of functional foods and health products containing vitamins and minerals in theNetherlands ( section 6.6 ). Chapter 7 goes on to present a qualitative comparison of the likely health gains and health risks of some selected functional foods and health prod-ucts. The criteria applied in making this comparison are described in section 6.7. The current chapter closes with a summary, conclusions and recommendations ( section 6.8) .6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 190Table 6.1: Overview1of the main categories of functional foods currently available in the Netherlands.

These products were first made available in the 1960s. Dur-ing the 1980s, one of the recommendations of the (then) Dutch Nutrition Council wasto reduce fat consumption and particularly that of saturated fats ( Richtlijnen Goede Voeding [Guidelines for ). This prompted the develop- ment of other food products in which some of the fat or carbohydrate (sugar) content had been replaced by ingredients that provide less energy, or none at all: the 'light' products. In the 1990s, Asian (and particularly Japanese) influences prompted the western world to consider the health-promoting effects of individual foods. The term'functional foods' was introduced. Manufacturers then started to add bio-active substances and bacterial cultures with an (alleged) positive health effect to their food products. At the same time, a growing number of vitamin and mineral tablets and herbal preparations were introduced,each claiming to have a beneficial effect on health . Tables 6.1 and 6.2 provide an overview of the various product groups currently available in the Netherlands. It seems likely that sales of functional foods and health products will continue toincrease in the years ahead, and that the range of products will also increase in scope (see also chapter 9 ).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 191Table 6.2: Overview1of the main categories of health products currently available in the Netherlands Categories of health Intended health Examples of products products promoting effect2 Dietary supplements that 'Optimal' intake of vitamins and Preparations containing contain one or more vitamins minerals, prevents deficiencies vitamins and/or mineralsand/or minerals Boosts resistance -Carotene, vitamins E and C: antioxidant effect3 Prevents diseases Stimulates bodily functions Dietary supplements that Stimulates bodily functions Preparations containing contain other well defined Prevents diseases creatine, carnitine, alpha-ingredien tsor bio -active Promotes weight loss lipoic acids, subst ances Promotes recovery following illness conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) Dietary supplements that are Stimulates bodily functions Preparations containing partly or entirely biological Prevents diseases oils, (including fish oils), in origin ,or that are derived Strengthens the immune system garlic, brewer's yeast, from biological sources fibres, flavonoids Herbal preparations Stimulates bodily functions Preparations containing Strengthens the immune system Saint John's Wort, Ginkgo Improves memory biloba, Ginseng 1The above overview is for the purpose of illustration, it is not comprehensive. 2The intended health promoting effect as claimed by the manufacturer. 3Antioxidants neutralize free radicals (particles with an unpaired electron) that are formed during normal metabolism, thereby preventing them from causing damage.6.3 Legislation 6.3.1 Functional Foods The legislation under which a functional food falls depends on the exact nature of the product in question. Does it contain a new substance? Has it been enriched with vita-mins and/or minerals? Is it a food product to which another known substance hasbeen added? Different legislation applies to each of these three groups. Legislation for 'novel foods' Foods and food ingredients (thus also including functional foods) which are deemed to be 'new' (under the criteria established for this purpose) are known as 'novel foods'and since 1997 have fallen under European Regulation 258/97 (see textbox 6.1 ). The best-known example of products that fall under this regulation and are currentlyavailable in the Netherlands is the margarine with added plant sterols, 'Becel ProActiv'. Legislation for foods enriched with vit amins and minerals Manufacturers of food products enriched with vitamins or minerals must observe the current provisions of the national Warenwetbesluit 'Toevoeging micro-voedingsstoffen aan levensmiddelen (Commodities Decree on the Addition of Micronutrients to Foods; see textbox 6.2 ). Before any such product can be offered for sale in the Netherlands ,it must be registered with the Voedsel en Waren Autoriteit (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority). A European regulation for enriched products is currently in prepa- ration (see textbox 6.2 and table 6.3 ).6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 192Textbox 6.1: EU Regulation 258/97 on 'novel foods'. European 'concerning' novel foods and novel food ingr edients' came into effect in 1997. Under the ter ms of this legislation, the manufactur ers of food pr oducts containing ingredients which have never previously been available on the Eur opean market ar eobliged to demonstrate the safety of those pr oducts prior to any market intr oduction in Europe. The 'novel foods' concerned are mainly those with specificbio-active components and the exotic foods.Since April 2004, products that have been pre-pared using genetically modified organisms andproducts that consist of genetically modified organisms fall under a separate regulation. With regard to the safety aspects, manufacturers arerequir ed to submit an application in the for mof a dossier prepared according to EU guidelines. Thisdossier can be submitted for assessment in anyof the member states, whereupon the EuropeanCommission and all other member states will beinformed of the results of the safety assessment.The 'novel food' If one or mor emember states does not accept the assessment and the recommendations of the assessing member state,the Eur opean Commission will seek the scientific opinion of the Eur opean Food Safety Authority (EFSA; see: www .efsa.eu.int). This provision has been in place since April 2003, prior to which the'second opinion' was provided by the EU Scientif-ic Committee on Food (SCF). In the Netherlands, the EU legislation promptedthe establishment in 1999 of the Committee on theSafety Assessment of Novel Foods as part of theHealth Council of the Netherlands. This commit-tee comprises exper ts in various fields and is charged with assessing the applications for novel food marketing authorization submitted in theNetherlands. Its official recommendations arethen submitted to the responsible person, beingthe Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport (seealso www .gr.nl).Legislation for foods enriched with substances other than vitamins and miner- als Health-promoting substances which were already being added to products available in Europe prior to 1997 are deemed to be 'known' substances. Manufacturers may add such subst ances (excluding vitamins and minerals) to the traditional products, and may market these product swithout any prior safety assessment or registration. Euro- pean legislation covering foods to which amino acids, trace elements, essential fattyacids and/or dietary fibre have been added is currently in preparation. The Nether-lands currently operates a policy which permits enrichment with amino acids, which is based on the Health Council 's advisor yrepor t Veiligheid van aminozuursuppletie (The Safety of Amino Acid ( Gezondheidsraad ,1999).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 193Textbox 6.2: Legislation covering foods enriched with vitamins and/or minerals. The Commodities Decree on the Addition of Micronutrients to Foods has been in force in theNetherlands since 1996 and applies to foodsenriched with vitamins and/or minerals. Under theprovisions of this legislation, the following vita-mins and minerals may be artificially added to afood product \"in such quantities as to render thetotal content at least 15% and no more than 100%of the recommended daily intake of the nutrient inquestion\": vitamin (as carotenoids), vitaminsB 1,B2,nicotinic acid, magnesium, phosphor, chromium, molybdenum,sodium, potassium and chloride. The addition ofother vitamins (vitamin A as retinoids, vitamin D,folic acid) and minerals (copper, zinc, selenium,iodine) is pr ohibited. Fur ther to European harmo- nization, the Dutch Commodities Decree on Mar- garine was repealed in 1999, whereupon therewas no longer any legal requirement to add vita-mins A and D to margarine products. However,the industry has since entered into a voluntaryagreement to add vitamins A and D on a voluntarybasis. Since May 2003, it has also been per missi- ble to add vitamin D to yellow lipid-based spreads, pr ovided the resultant content is no morethan 50% of the r ecommended daily intake for the elderly, and that the product in question carries a statement that it is suitable for personsaged over 60 ( Staatscourant ,2003). In the case ofiodine, the regulation makes a specific exception for salt used in bread and in the conservation ofcertain (meat) products. The proposed European Regulation on EnrichedFoods (262/2003) currently in preparation seeks toharmonize the member states' individual legisla-tion with regard to the addition of vitamins, miner-als and certain other substances to foods. A listof 'approved' substances has already been com-piled, although the permitted minimum and maxi-mum content had not yet been established at thetime of writing this report. At the request of theEuropean Commission, the Scientific Committeeon Food (SCF) has established certain safe maxi-mum limits, known as the 'Tolerable Upper Levels'(UL), for a number of vitamins and minerals,based on scientific risk assessment (see table 6.3). The UL is the level of daily intake (via the regular diet, functional foods and supplements)above which undesirable effects may occur. TheEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which isnow responsible for providing scientific advice onfood-related matters, is to undertake a similarassessment for other vitamins and minerals.Together with certain other parameters, the ULswill then be used to establish the maximum levelsto which vitamins and minerals may be added tocertain specified foods to ensure that consump-tion of those foods as part of a varied diet willpresent no risk to the consumer .6.3.2 Health products Dutch legislation for health products is available for vitamin preparations through the old Commodities Regulation on Vrijstelling vitaminepreparaten (Exemption for vitamin preparations), the new Commodities Decree on Voedingssupplementen (Dietary Supple- ments), and the Commodities Regulation on Voedingssupplementen (Dietary Supple- ments). Vitamin preparations must contain at least 20% of the recommended dailyintake. Maximum levels are imposed for vitamins A and D. Products which complywith the old regulation are permitted to remain on the market until 1 August 2005. Afurther Commodities Decree exists for Kruidenpreparaten (Herbal Preparations). In general, the main requirement is that preparations must not contain amounts thatwill be harmful to public health. The definition of 'harmful to public health' is further specified in the text of this legislation in the form of comprehensive lists of prohibitedingredients and plant species. Since 1 January 2003, the manufacturer or distributorof herbal preparations must be able to substantiate any health claims made using objective data obtained from scientifically accredited sources. While all health prod-uctshave the appearance of medicinal preparations ,they are not permit ted to include any ingredient or constituent which is registered as a 'medicine'. The first steps towards European harmonization of legislation covering dietary sup- plemen tshave been made by means of Directive 2002/46/EC, which requires certain amendments to be made to individual member states' legislation in this area. At pre-sent, the directive covers only vitamins and minerals. Like that for enriched food prod- ucts(see textbox 6.2 )the E Uregulation est ablishes which vit amins and minerals are permitted (see table 6.3 )and in what chemical form. However, the minimum and max- imum doses to be permit ted have yet to be est ablished. Further European legislation is being prepared to cover supplements which contain ingredients other than vitamins and minerals (e.g. trace elements, essential fatty acids, dietary fibre, amino acids, herbs and other biologically active substances such as garlic and brewer's yeast). With regard to herbal preparations, the directive on Tra- ditionele Kruidengeneesmiddelen (Traditional Herbal Remedies) (2003/63/EG) is of par- ticular significance .Itis intended to simplify the registration process for traditional herbal preparations. With regard to supplementation with amino acids, and until such time as European legislation t akes effect ,the Netherlands will obser ve the recommendations of the Health Council in its report Veiligheid van aminozuursuppletie (The Safety of Amino Acid Suppletion) ( Gezondheidsraad ,1999). All other products which do not fall under specific regulations or decrees will remain, like 'common' foods, subject to the provi-sions of the Commodities Act. This means that such health products will also be sub-ject to commodities decrees such as Bereiding en behandeling van levensmiddelen (Preparation and processing of foods) and Etikettering van levensmiddelen (Labelling of foods).6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 1946.3.3 Claims As explained in the foregoing section, functional foods and health products are covered by the Dutch Commodities Act. This expressly prohibits claims of any medical effect being made for these product s.It is therefore illegal to st ate that a food product or supplement can prevent, treat or cure any disease or condition. However, claims relating to nutrient content and nutrient function are permitted, as are health claims(De Roos & Katan, 2003; see also textbox 6.3 ). Dutch legislation with regard to claims Legislation covering the claims made on behalf of functional foods and health prod - uctshas led to some confusion ,due to the distinction drawn between medical claimsOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 195Table 6.3: List of vitamins and minerals which are permitted to be added to foods (EU Regulation 262/2003) and dietary supplements (Directive 2002/46/EC), with 'Recommended Daily Allowance' (RDA) and 'TolerableUpper Level' (UL).

'Not derived' means that insufficient data is available for a value to be derived. 2UL (tolerable upper level) = the level of daily intake above which there is a risk that undesirable effects could occur, as derived by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). Opinions on Tolerable upper intake levels for vitamins and minerals, updated April 2003: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/out80_en.html.

This composite measure, as also used by the Health Council of the Netherlands, was adhered to for nicotinic acid. The UL defined by the SCF is divisible into two measures: 10 mg for free nicotinic acid and 900 mg for nicotinamide, fthe UL applies to the synthetic form of folic acid, gthe UL was only derived for the amount of magnesium added to foods.

It is permissible to state that a product or supplement will maintain or promote (general) health, but it is not permissible to state that it will help to pre-vent illness or disease. Claims regarding disease prevention are currently classified as medical claims. The distinction is vague and often difficult to understand. In order toestablish where the boundary between permissible claims and impermissible claimsactually lies, there are two systems of self-regulation in place in the Netherlands. How-ever, both have some shortcomings (see textbox 6.4 ). The Health Council has produced an advisory report on this topic ( Gezondheidsraad ,2003). According to the Health Council, it is difficult to make a scientifically grounded distinction between medical claims and health claims because there is no clear difference between 'the promotion and maintenance of health' and 'the prevention of illness or disease'. Similarly, according to the Health Council, the distinction between functional foods and dietarysupplements on the one hand, and medicines on the other is also indistinct. Both types of product can positively influence the risk factors of disease, which is much thesame thing as reducing the risk of disease. The Health Council is therefore of the opin-ion that, if the consumption of a product will reduce the risk of developing a disease or condition, it is preferable that the risk reduction be expressly stated. It has there-fore recommended that claims relating to risk reduction should be permit ted for functional foods and health products, provided such claims can be scientifically sub- stantiated, and that the current form of general health claims should be abandoned. Alongside the lack of clarit ywith regard to the distinction bet ween health claims and medical claims, there is also doubt concerning the validity of the health claims.Which are true (scientifically proven) and which are not? The Commodities Act does not lay down any rules for the subst antiation and assessmen tof health claims .In 1998, however, the Netherlands Nutrition Centre took the initiative regarding the adoption of a Gedragscode (Code of Conduct) based on the definition of health claims given in the notes which accompany the Act. This volun tarycode est ablishes the man - ner in which alleged health effects should be subject to scientific appraisal, and offers manufacturers the opportunity to submit their products for testing (in order to assess specific health claims) at cost price. To date, few manufacturers have taken advantage of this scheme because they are still not allowed to state on the product itself that the claims made have been scien tifically assessed. As a result, the consumer still lacks information regarding which product shave been scientifically tested and which health claims can be regarded as reliable. In its report, the Health Council advised thegovernment to devote attention to this matter. It considers it important for claims tobe subject to proper assessment, and that the assessment should be conducted by an independen tand impar tial organization . New European legislation The European Commission is preparing a draft regulation (165/2003) for nutrition and health claims made on behalf of functional foods and health products. It isexpected that this regulation will provide an adequate solution to the problems inher - entin the current Dutch system with regard to claims, as outlined above. The Euro- pean regulation will permit t wo types of claims: nutrition claims and health claims6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 196OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 197Textbox 6.3: Permitted and prohibited claims for food products. Textbox 6.4: Systems of self-regulation to distinguish between permissible and impermissible claims for functional foods and health products.Current situation Current Dutch legislation permits three types of claim to be made for foods: Nutrient claim Ageneral statement indicating the quantity of aparticular nutrient to be found in the product (e.g. 'low fat', 'high in fibre'). Nutrient function claim Astatement of the quantity of a nutrient in the product, together with an explanation of thefunction of that nutrient in the body (e.g. 'richin calcium, which is required for the develop-ment of bones'. Health claim Astatement which asserts, or which aims to create the impression, that a food product hasspecial properties likely to promote or maintaingood health (e.g. 'helps to reduce cholesterol';'promotes mobility of the joints'). Medical claims are not permitted: Amedical claim is a statement or suggestion of the product's ability to prevent, treat or cure ahuman disease, illness or condition, or whichalludes to such ability. The use of such state-ments and suggestions is prohibited under theCommodities Act.Future situation The proposed new European Regulation (165/2003) covering nutrition and health claimsmade on foods, deals with the following types ofclaim: Nutrition claim Any claim which states, suggests or implies that a food has particular nutrition propertiesdue to (a) the energy (caloric value) it 'pro-vides', 'provides at a reduced or increasedrate' or 'does not provide' and/or (b) the nutri-ents or other substances it 'contains', 'containsin reduced or increased proportions', or 'doesnot contain'. Health claim Any claim that states, suggests or implies that arelationship exists between a food category, afood or one of its constituents, and health. Reduction of disease risk claim Any health claim that states, suggests or implies that the consumption of a food catego-ry, a food, or one of its constituents significant-ly reduces a risk factor in the development of ahuman disease. The Dutch food industr yhas implemented a sys - tem of self-regulation in the form of the Leidraad Code Aanprijzing Gezondheidsproducten (Guide- line Code for the Pr omotion of Health Products; CAG), compliance with which is supervised by an independent council (see www .koagkag.nl). Under the code, health-r elated claims made for functional foods or health pr oducts ar epermitted only where 'there is absolutely no question of a claim which directly or indirectly asserts or infersamedical ef fect'. The CAG includes a list of almost one thousand health-related statements which serve as a guideline for preparing advertis-ing content. The list is intended to establish theboundary between permissible and impermissibleclaims. However, from the consumer's point ofview, it remains difficult to distinguish between'for good blood pr essur e' (not allowed) and 'good for the blood pressure' (allowed). Furthermore, a second form of self-regulation exists in the form of the Nederlandse Reclame Code (Netherlands Code of Adver tising). Anyone who believes that an adver tising statement con- travenes this code may lodge a complaint with the Advertising Code Commission. Among itsmany provisions, the code states that 'advertisingmust be legal, decent, honest and tr uthful'. Accordingly, the Advertising Code Commission may investigate whether a statement contra-venes the legal pr ohibition of medical claims under the Commodities Act. (seetextbox 6.3 ).Claims relating to reducing the risk of disease will be regarded as health claims, and will be permitted as well under certain conditions. The mostimportant factor is that claims may only be made if they are supported by adequate scientific evidence. The scientific testing of the claims has been delegated to the Euro-pean Food Safety Authority (EFSA). 6.4 Potential health gain 6.4.1 Who is likely to benefit from the use of functional foods and health products ? In general, healthy consumers who adhere to the Richtlijnen Goede Voeding (Guidelines for Good Nutrition) will have no need for functional foods or health products, the con-sumption of which will result in little or no health gain for these consumers. However,in certain situations and for specific groups the use of functional foods and health products may represent health gain. An account of these situations is given below,whereby a distinction has been made bet ween ' suppletion of a sub -optimal micronu - trient status' and 'the reduction of disease and of disease burden'. Suppletion of a sub-optimal micronutrient status There are some groups of the Dutch population for whom the ever yday diet does not provide the desired quantity of micronutrients. Additional intake of a specific vitaminis therefore advised for these groups (see table 6.4 ). In addition, it is standard practice to add iodine to baker 's salt ,cooking salt ,table salt and pickling salt in order to ensure an optimal intake of iodine by the general population by means of the con- sumption of bread ,bread replacers ,and certain meat products. Additional micronu- trien tsmay also be useful for those who lack a properly balanced diet. Elderly people represent one group which is acknowledged to be at particular risk, especially thosein long-term residential care (see chapter 2 ), largely due to poor appetite which leads to insufficient intake of food and nutrients. In terms of energy supply, the effects will not be particularly marked, since the group has a generally inactive lifestyle and hence a lower energ yrequirement. However, the requirement for micronutrients remains the same ,whereupon there is a higher risk of suboptimal nutritional status. Similarly, disease and/or long-term use of prescription drugs can increase the require-ment for certain micronutrients. Other possible at-risk groups include vegans, thosefollowing a macrobiotic diet and others whose intake of animal products is extremely low (Dagnelie ,2003). They are exposed to various risks ,such as a vit amin B 12deficien - cy. Heavy drinkers are also seen as a high-risk group, since they generally have a lessvaried eating pattern. Moreover, alcohol restricts the absorption of vitamin B 1in the intestines. Both elderly people and ethnic women who rarely venture outdoors runthe risk of vitamin D deficiency due to lack of sunlight. Finally, those persons whoavoid cer tain foods due to allergy or who follow a strict weight-reduction diet may develop a deficienc yof certain micronutrients. 6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 198Reduction of the risk of disease and of disease burden Nutrition can influence both the likelihood of developing certain diseases and the dis- ease burden at tribut able to those diseases. Further to the Health Council's conclusions with regard to the claims which may be made for food product s(see section 6.3.3 ), 'reducing risk' means the same as 'maintaining and/or improving health'. The use ofcertain functional foods or health products may indeed reduce the risk of (chronic) diseases. For example, products containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, products con- taining reduced levels of trans fatty acids, and products enriched with plant sterols and st anols have been shown to improve serum lipid status, thus reducing the risk of coronar yheart diseases. Research is currently being conducted into the effects of spe- cific food constituents in terms of the development and/or prevention of chronic dis-eases. Good examples include the studies on the effects of folic acid and flavonoids inreducing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and the studies on the stimu- lating effect sof prebiotics and probiotics testine function .Recen tly, prebiotic fibres have been added to baby food preparations in order to render the intestinal flora of bottle-fed babies closer to that of their breastfed counterparts, thisbeing considered more optimal. Another recent development is the addition of inulin,adietary fibre, to bread. This is also believed to have a positive effect on intestinal flora .Indeed, this claim has successfully withstood an assessment based on the Nutri- tion Cen tre's Gedragscode (Code of Conduct), accordingly the Cen tre accepts that the health -promoting effect has been satisfactorily proven .An example of the way inOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 199Table 6.4: Micronutrients for which supplementation in certain groups of the Dutch population is currently advised.

The dose is dependent on age and gender.which disease burden can be reduced is the effect of certain probiotics on the dura- tion of an episode of acute diarrhea in young children. Meta-analyses reveal a proven,albeit minor, reduction of one day (Van Niel etal.,2002). Unfortunately many functional foods and health products are promoted by means of claims which have not been scientifically proven, with regard to their ability tocounter a number of common health problems. For example, foods are marketed thatare claimed to improve resistance, reduce overweight, and cure insomnia, fatigue ormemory loss (see textbox 6.5 ). In many cases, such claims are misleading for the con- sumer. 6.4.2 Health gain in practice The degree of health gain that can actually be achieved in practice is likely to differ somewhat from that suggested by the results of the research phase. This is due to a number of reasons: Dosage and usage In clinical studies ,the dosage, frequency of use, and the period of use for any func- tional food or dietary supplement are carefully controlled. In the everyday situation,consumers are free to use the products as and when they wish, and it is possible thatthey will not do so in strict accordance with the instructions or recommendations pro- vided regarding the dosage ,frequenc yand period of use .This may result in any health gain being reduced or obviated. An initial indication of this effect is given by the post-launch monitoring study conducted by Unilever into the user profile of itsmargarine products enriched with plant sterols. The study, ordered by the EuropeanCommission (SCF, 2002), revealed that consumers regularly use less margarine than isrecommended .As a result, the effect on the LDL cholesterol level may also be lower than expected .6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 200Textbox 6.5: Examples of claims made for specific ingredients in health products, found in free local papers. Specific ingredient Claim Chromium 'Chromium helps you resist sweets' 'Lose weight without a struggle' and gums may promote health helps relieve 'At last - a r emedy for cold hands and feet ' 'Improved sexual performance' 'Now it is possible to r estor eyour weak memory'Interindividual differences Other important factors that will affect the final health gain are the differences between individuals in terms of lifestyle (e.g. amount of regular exercise taken), nutri- tional status and habitual dietary pattern. It is possible that various compensatorymechanisms will be seen in practice (perhaps a person will start eating greater quan-tities of other foods). In a clinical trial situation there will either be controls for thesemechanisms or they will play a less prominent part due to the greater uniformity ofthe study group. Due to these interindividual differences, the degree of health effectwill vary from person to person. Accordingly, a positive health effect resulting from the use of certain products and as established in clinical trials, may not be seen in practice. Consumer information In order to achieve the greatest possible health gain, it is essential to ensure that the target group is reached. The consumer must receive good information, so that theproduct is known and is recognized as being of potential benefit by the intended tar- get group. Moreover, efforts should be made to ensure that the product is not used bythose who do not belong to the in tended t arget group ,while it is similarly impor tant to ensure that consumers do not lose sight of the importance of traditional healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, wholemeal bread and traditional dairy products. 6.5 The converse situation: possible risks to public health In addition to the poten tial beneficial health effect s, the consumption of functional foods and health product scan also bring risks .These are set out below . Health risks of high doses often unknown The bio-active substances currently being added to functional foods and health prod- ucts are also found in the traditional diet. In most cases they occur naturally in foods, at low levels .Certain herbal ingredients included in health products have also been used for many years .Given that the traditional diet is generally regarded as safe, it may be assumed that exposure to these substances is also safe. However, this is notnecessarily the case if the functional foods and health products which have beenenriched with these specific substances are consumed in addition to the regular, tradi- tional diet. Consumers may then be exposed to considerably higher doses .Simult ane- ous use of several products containing the same bio-active substance(s) can result in a higher dose being ingested, the effect known as 'accumulation'. It could also be thatthe dose per product is higher. Health product sin particular may contain (extremely) high levels of certain sub- stances. The question then arises as to whether the ingestion of such high doses is safe.Toanswer this question requires systematic research into the toxicity of the sub-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 201stances in question, whereupon the safe upper level can be established. To date, most herbs and bio-active substances have not been subject to such research and hence nosafe upper levels are derived (the exceptions include a number of vitamins and miner- als: see table 6.3 ). The possibility of adverse health effects further to the consumption of products which contain these substances therefore cannot be excluded. A goodexample is provided by the herbal preparations containing ephedra-alkaloids, whichare marketed as slimming pills, as natural 'pep pills' or as a 'smart drug'. Ephedra-alkaloids are known to affect the functioning of the central nervous system. The inges-tion of even small quantities increases the risk of hypertension, stroke, heart attack and psychoses. Simultaneous use with other stimulants, such as caffeine, may repre- sent an undesired hazardous combination. The Dutch government has banned the sale of herbal preparations containing ephedra-alkaloids. Such preparations are nowsubject to the regulations governing medicinal products (VWS, 2004). Risk of overdose The risk of overdose is currently greatest in the case of vitamins and minerals. This is partly because the range of functional foods and dietary supplements which containvitamins and minerals has increased greatly, and par tly because there are diet arysup- plements available to consumers which contain extremely high levels of vitamins and minerals (see table 6.5 ). In order to assess the risk of overdosing on vitamins and min- erals due to the consumption of functional foods and dietary supplements, the follow- ing section presen tsan estimate of the intake of these nutrients in the regular diet, in functional foods and in dietary supplements. The overall intake is then compared tothe safe upper levels (UL) which have recently been established for a number of vita- mins and minerals (see table 6.3 ). In the future ,plantsterols and st anols may also pre - sent a risk of overdose, since the range of products containing these substances has recen tly been expanded to include cholesterol -lowering yoghurt and milk. Not all health products meet legal requirements Amajor problem attaching to health products is that of the availability (and hence consumption) of uncontrolled, banned products obtained via the Internet. Most of these products are supplied from overseas. Imports through the normal channels, by companies based in the Netherlands ,are subject to supervision by the Food and Con- sumer Product Safet yAuthority. However, this is impossible in the case of direct sales via foreign websites. Consumers mistakenly believe that products from, say, the Unit-ed States will have been tested there. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesnot concern itself with products intended for export and not actually consumed in the United St ates.Consumers face an unknown risk in this situation .In 2001, the Dutch Inspectorate for Health Protection and Veterinary Public Health conducted a study of suppliers of health products being offered on the Internet (Van Korven, 2001). Thestudy identified 153 suppliers and went on to examine 3644 preparations beingoffered by 62 companies. Many did not meet the legal requirements in place in theNetherlands .Approximately 10% of the vitamins was dosed in too high levels. Of the herbal preparations examined ,118 were classified as 'high-risk', with 16 actually banned outright in the Netherlands .High levels of zinc and selenium were also found6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 202insome products. Forty-six percent of the 62 companies studied made medical claims which are prohibited in the Netherlands. Other problems with health productsinclude the contamination of these products with for instance heavy metals and poly- cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Risk of interactions The use of high doses of certain substances in functional foods and health products can affect the absorption and metabolism of other nutrients or prescription drugs. Aphysiological imbalance may also occur. Examples of effects on the absorption include the reduced absorption of \u00df-carotene (resulting in a lowered serum \u00df-carotene level) further to the ingestion of plant stanols and sterols, and the mutual interaction of minerals and trace elements (iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium) during theprocess of absorption. If functional foods and health products are used simultaneous- ly with certain prescription drugs, there may be interactions at the metabolic level.This may cause the effect of the drug to be reduced or perhaps even enhanced. Oneexample is Saint John's Wort, which is known to interfere with the effect of prescrip- tion anti-depressants. Physiological imbalance may occur following the doses of an tioxidan tssuch as \u00df -carotene and vitamins C and E. This high intake can disrupt the antioxidant process, and the component in question can actually begin working as a pro-oxidant. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in twolarge-scale trials, the ATBC trial and the CARET study, in which high levels of \u00df- carotene were administered to smokers (Omenn et al., 1996; A TBC, 1994). Both studies were halted prematurely because the combination of smoking and high \u00df-caroteneintake was found to result in an increased incidence of lung cancer and death among smokers . 6.6 Consumption of functional foods and dietary supplements containing vitamins and minerals in the Netherlands As may be seen from sections 6.4 and 6.5,the positive effect son health offered by functional foods and diet ary supplements with extra vitamins and minerals can be accompanied by potential risks in terms of an overdose of vitamins and minerals. It isimportant to gain an understanding of the possible extent of overdosing and the riskto public health if we are to arrive at a balanced consideration of the potential health gain of these product s,versus their poten tial health loss (see chapter 7 ). Tothis end ,it is therefore necessary to quantify the Dutch population's consumption of vitamins and minerals via functional foods, dietary supplements and the regular diet. In the case of functional foods and dietary supplements, no suitable recent intake datais available. In principle, the national VCP ('Dutch National Food Consumption Survey') ought to be able to provide data regarding functional foods and dietary sup- plemen ts. However, the most recent full survey was held in 1997/98, at which time theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 203enrichment of products with vitamins and minerals had only recently been autho- rized (in 1996). It seems probable that the intake of vitamins and minerals hasincreased markedly in recent years, due to the emergence and burgeoning popularity of functional foods and dietary supplements. A national VCP was conducted in late2003, but was restricted to persons aged between 19 and 30. At the time of writing,the results of this survey were not available. However, studies conducted by TNS NIPO,NIVEL and Consumers' Association panels do provide some more recent informationconcerning the frequency with which the public make use of functional foods anddietary supplements (Van de Pol & Duijser, 2003; De Jong et al., 2003). Based on the available information, we present below an estimate of the intake of a number of vita- mins and minerals, both in the regular diet and by means of functional foods and dietary supplements. We also examined which vitamins and minerals exceeded thesafe upper level (UL). The results should be regarded as indicative. 6.6.1 Functional foods containing vitamins and minerals Supply Between July 1996 and December 2001, the Inspectorate for Health Protection and Veterinary Public Health registered 288 food products to which micronutrients hadbeen added. The majority (52%) had been enriched with B vitamins, followed by those with added vit amin C (12%), vit amin E (9%), calcium (6%) and iron (4%). In 15% of cases, the resulting content was greater than the recommended daily intake, particularlythat of vitamin C. A considerable number of products had been subject to the addition of subst ances which ,at that time ,were not permit ted in the Netherlands :71 con - tained additional folic acid, 15 contained vitamin D, 17 contained zinc, 8 contained copper and 5 con tained added selenium. There were sixteen registrations for which it was not clear whether the added vit amin A was in the form of \u00df -carotene or retinoids (Konings, 2001). Because manufacturers do not 'de-register' products when they arewithdrawn from the market, it is not known whether all the products concerned are still available on the Dutch market. In 1998, almost 4% of the 1199 coded products examined by VCP-3 (third Dutch National Food Consumption Survey; 1997/98) fell intothe category 'enriched products'. A further investigation conducted by the RIVM in July 2002 found 145 ar ticles in a major national supermarket chain to which one or more micronutrients had been added (Jansen et al., 2004). The B-vitamins (together 46%) and vitamin C (16%) were found most frequently, followed by calcium (12%), vita-min E (10%), and iron (8%). Consumption According to VCP-3 (1997/98), almost 7% of the total Dutch population consume one or more enriched food products. The lowest level of consumption was noted amongthose aged 50 and above (4%), with the highest level among children from 1 to 12years of age (14%). The product group most widely consumed is that of the for tified cereals ,followed by beverages with added vitamins. On average, the enriched prod- uctsprovide consumers with 5-20% of the recommended daily in take of calcium, iron,6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 204andvitamins A, B1,B2,B6and C in the diet. If the data on consumers is extrapolated to the level of the entire population, this means that enriched products in 1997-1998contributed between just under 0.5% and over 1% to the overall intake of vitamins and minerals (Anonymous, 1999). 6.6.2 Dietary supplements containing vitamins and minerals Supply In 2002, the Dutch Consumers' Association made an inventory of the vitamin supple- ments (both with and without minerals) available in the Netherlands. Supplements containing only minerals were not included. A total of 369 products were identified.The levels of the vitamins and minerals in dietary supplements was found to vary enormously per unit. Table 6.5 shows the percentage of dietary supplements in which the dose per unit exceeds the UL. The percentage is highest for vitamin B6(16%). The dosages of several other vitamins and minerals also exceed the UL. The degree to which the UL is exceeded varies markedly. High, or extremely high, excesses werefound in diet arysupplemen tswhich contain minerals: selenium (up to 11 x UL) and molybdenum (83 x UL). Excess levels ranging from slight to substantial (up to 5 x UL) were noted for the vitamins. All supplements in which the unit dose exceeds the ULcan, if consumed daily, present a health risk. For example, consumption of selenium in excess of the UL can result in selenium -intoxication, with damage to the peripheral nervous system, and deformities of the nails, teeth and hair. Intake of vitamin B 6in excess of the UL can result in neurotoxic effects.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 205Table 6.5: Percentage of the dietary supplements available in the Netherlands in 2002 which were found to contain levels of vitamins or minerals in excess of the UL, and the extent to which the UL was exceeded.

Therefore, for some vitamins and minerals, the next highest dose is given between brackets.Consumption The various VCPs (Dutch National Food Consumption Surveys) reveal that the propor- tion of the Dutch population taking dietary supplements increased from 20% in 1992 to 24% in 1998. According to the 1997/98 survey, young children mainly take vitaminAand D supplements. Consumption is lowest among young people aged 10 and 16: if they take a dietary supplement at all, it is most likely to be a multi-vitamin prepara-tion. Overall, women take dietary supplements more often than men (20% womenagainst 14% men). Elderly people tend to do so more often than those aged between22 and 50 (Voedingscentrum, 1998). In 2000, 20% of the respondents on the NIVEL/Consumers' Association panel used a multivitamin preparation on a daily basis. Within this panel it was found that women take dietary supplements more often than men, and age was shown to be a determinant of the usage of some products, findingsconfirmed by a survey of the TNS NIPO respondents panel (Van de Pol & Duijser, 2003; De Jong et al., 2003). Two realistic 'worst case' scenarios In order to determine the possible extent of (over) exposure to vitamins and minerals, we now presen ttwo realistic ' worst case 'scenarios, based on the current availability of functional foods and dietary supplements with vitamins and minerals in the Netherlands. 1) In take via regular diet, functional foods and dietary supplements by adult Dutch males The first scenario has been worked out for men in the age group 22 to 50, because this group represen tsthe 'biggest consumers 'in terms of quan tity.The calculations rely on information taken from three different database sources. The average daily intake established by the 1997/98 F ood Consumption Survey has been taken as the starting point. Tothis,we have added the information derived from the R IVM supermarket investigation of functional foods enriched with vitamins and minerals (Jansen et al., 2004). For the most commonly occurring vitamins and minerals in enriched products, all of the common products from the 1997/98 Food Consumption Survey have been replaced by a similar functional food product if that product was found in the super- market in question .One example is the substitution of the product 'acid drops' by fruit-flavoured sweet senriched with a number of vitamins. A so-called realistic 'worst case' scenario approach has been applied; all acid drops have been replaced byenriched sweets, while products targeting only children were excluded from the cal-culations. Also, the intake of dietary supplements has been estimated using the infor- mation derived from the 2002 Consumers 'Association study (Consumen tenbond , 2002), in which the average quantity of a vitamin or mineral per unit (tablet/capsule) was established. The estimate is based on the assumption that consumers will takeone unit per day. The results are shown in table 6.6 ,which also compares the intake levels to the recommended daily intake and the safe upper level. The table revealsthat the con tribution to the total intake made by dietary supplements is (far) greater than that of the functional foods .In all cases, the total average intake from (ordinary and enriched) foods and supplemen tsis higher than the recommended daily level,6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 206particularly in the case of the B vitamins and vitamin C. However, the ULs are not exceeded. 2) Intake via regular diet and dietary supplements by the Dutch population As may be seen from table 6.5 ,anumber of diet arysupplements contain extremely high levels of vit amins and/or minerals .Toestablish whether the UL is exceeded when taking such supplements in addition to the regular diet, and if so by how much, we have worked out a second scenario. Here, the total intake (via the regular diet and one dietary supplement) of a number of vitamins and minerals included in the Con- sumers' Association study has been calculated for the entire Dutch population. The calculation is based on the daily consumption of a diet ary supplement with an aver- age dose or a high dose (90thpercen tile of all dietary supplements containing the par- ticular vitamin/mineral, as included in the Consumers' Association survey) in combi-nation with the regular diet (see table 6.7 ). Unlike table 6.6 ,table 6.7 does not consider the functional foods since their contribution to overall intake is small. Moreover, the information presen ted in this t able relates to the en tire Dutch population ,rather than only men aged 22-50. (Although this group has the greatest overall consumption, it also has the lowest intake of dietary supplements). The total intake of vitamins andminerals by the Dutch population, assuming daily consumption of one dietary supple-ment with an average or high dose (90th percentile) per unit alongside the regulardiet,is expressed as a multiple of the RDA and the UL. As shown by table 6.7 ,the tot al intake of vitamins through the regular diet in combination with a dietary supplement exceeds the RD Ain all cases ,with the exception of folic acid. The degree of excess isOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 207Table 6.6: Average daily intake of several specified vitamins and minerals (Dutch men aged 22-50) via the regular diet, functional foods (based on a realistic 'worst case' scenario) and dietary supplements (one unitper day). The intake is calculated using information derived from the 1997/98 Food Consumption Survey, aninventory of functional foods in a Dutch supermarket, and a Consumers' Association study of dietary sup-plements. The total intake is expressed in mg/d and is shown in comparison to the recommended dailyallowance (RDA) and safe upper level (UL).

Studies of these vitamins suggest that the intake levels calculatedhere are unlikely to give rise to any adverse health effects. However, in the absence ofsystematic toxicity studies, undesired health effects cannot be completely discounted,particularly when taking high-dosage dietary supplements. The RDA of minerals isexceeded in half the cases, although the degree to which this is the case (up to twotimes the RDA) is much smaller than for the vitamins. The UL for minerals is not exceeded. 6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 208Table 6.7: Total daily intake of vitamins and minerals by the Dutch population, assuming daily use of one dietary supplement with an average or high dose (90thpercentile) per unit, in addition to the average intake by means of the regular diet.

In order to determine an actual health gain, we must establish a direct relationship between the product underconsideration and one of the health outcomes (as indicated by the red arrow in figure 6.1), or an indirect relationship between the two (the blue arrows). This can only be achieved by means of adequate research. For functional foods and health products, this direct or indirect relationship has not been satisfactorily demonstrated in most cases .Chapter 7 provides an accoun tof a few 'sample' foods, dealing with the extent to which such relationships have been subject to research in the past. The relationship between a product and a health outcome(whether directly, or indirectly by means of an effect on a health intermediary) is assumed to have been adequately investigated and est ablished only when there is 'convincing' or 'reasonable' evidence, as defined by the World Health Organization.According to the WHO, it is possible to distinguish the following types of evidence based on studies in humans (WH O,2003): 1) Convincing evidence: the results of several epidemiological studies, including prospective obser vational studies and ,where relevant, randomized double-blind clinical trials ,all poin tin the same direction .These are studies in which the health effect of the product is tested with sufficient distinguishing power, over a suffi- ciently long period, among a group of volunteers and/or patients in controlled conditions. Such studies should be conducted among populations which represent the intended target group of the functional food or health product being tested. Moreover ,the relationship between the product and the health outcome must be biologically plausible . 2) Reasonable evidence: the results of various epidemiological studies point in much the same direction, although there may be a number of grey areas due to too fewstudies having been conducted, a lack of distinguishing power, or too short a dura- tion,etc.Here too ,relationships must be biologically plausible . 3) Possible evidence: the only information available has been derived from cross-sec- tional or case control studies. 4) Insufficient evidence: the results of a few studies suggest a relationship, but further research is required. When weighing possible health gain against health risk ,it is also necessary to know the dosage range of the active ingredien t(and the corresponding quan tity of theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 209product) which is likely to have an effect on health: the intended effective dosage range .This information is necessar yto determine whether there is any overlap between the intended effective dosage range and the range at which health risks will emerge. 6.7.2 Health risks Aweighing of health gain against health risk will also require information about any toxic effects and the dosage at which such effects will become apparent. To arrive at such information requires investigations to est ablish the acute toxicit y(the level at which a single dose is toxic in the shor tterm) and chronic or semi -chronic toxicit y (the degree to which the substance is toxic when administered over a longer period). With this information to hand, it is possible to establish the safe upper level of intake (such as the UL for vitamins and minerals). The UL is calculated using a method com- parable to that used to calculate the acceptable daily intake (ADI) (see section 4.3.3 ). Information derived from human studies is more frequen tly available to support the calculation of the UL ,accordingly the uncertainty factor applied is usually smaller than that used in establishing the ADI. The UL of a vitamin or mineral is the maximumquantity that a person can ingest every day for his or her entire lifetime without expe-riencing any adverse health effects. An intake in excess of the UL could result in health risks ,whereby such an in take is defined as the ' at-risk dosage range '(see chap- ter 7, figure 7.2 ). In the case of food constituents such as vitamins and minerals, there isalso a second 'at risk dosage range', being that below the RDA, at which adverse effects may appear as the result of deficiencies (see chapter 7, figure 7.2 ).6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 210 product containing specific ingredient intake in accordance with recommended dose reduction of risk factor promotion of bodily functionreduction of morbidity and/or mortality improvement in functioning and/or quality of lifehealth gaineffect on intermediairy effect on health outcome well demonstratedrelationship sufficientlyrelationship sufficiently sufficiently well demonstratedrelationshipwell demonstrated relationship sufficiently well demonstratedrelationship sufficiently well demonstratedFigure 6.1: Illustration of relationships between product, intermediary and health outcome which must be adequately proven before there may be any question of health gain. 6.7.3 Pitfalls Anumber of considerations must be taken into account when weighing the possible health gain against the possible health risk offered by functional foods and healthproducts. The literature frequently considers the effect of a specific nutrient or non-nutrient with regard to a specific health outcome, as in the case of dietary fibre and fat.However, it is difficult to ascribe the health effects observed to one particular prod-uct. Rather, they are due to the overall dietary pattern and thus the total intake of fat and fibre. It is therefore difficult to quantify the health gain represented by a specific functional food or health product, as is the case for products enriched with linoleic acid or additional dietary fibre. Data to support 'convincing evidence' is not always available. In many cases, the clinical studies conducted examine the effect of the products on intermediary indi-cators, and not on health outcomes such as death and disease. This is the case forstudies into the effects of plant sterols, which have been shown to have a clear effect on serum LDL cholesterol levels (effect on intermediary indicator, see figure 6.1). However ,there have been no studies examining the effect of plan tsterols on coronary heart diseases (the health outcome, see figure 6.1 ). Because several other studies conclude that there is indeed a direct relationship between serum LDL cho-lesterol and coronary heart diseases (i.e. the relationship between intermediary and outcome), it is assumed that the consumption of ,say, margarines enriched with plant sterols will indeed reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, andthat there is therefore a relationship with the health outcome. In the ideal situation ,research in to the effect sof an ingredien tof a product should take into account its bioavailability (the degree to which the active ingredient is actually absorbed in to the body), as is already the case in clinical trials of pharma - ceutical product s.Bioavailabilit ycan var ysubst antially between products, where- upon the amount of the active ingredient that enters the body will also vary. As a result, the situation can arise in which two products (e.g. milk and breakfast cereals) contain equal doses of the same substance, yet one may be effective, and the other less so or not at all (Clifton et al., 2004). In practice, this aspect is rarely considered. Alongside these matrix effects, the dosage level and the combination of added nutrien ts must also be considered. Added ingredients can indeed result in poten- tial health gain, but some products contain such small amounts that they will havelittle or no effect. Combining nutrients, or failing to do so, may also limit theireffects. Some minerals 'compete' with each other in the intestines, and the addi- tion of for example extra calcium to a product has lit tle poin tif vit amin D is the limiting factor. Finally, it should be noted that some positive effects will be experienced only by specific subgroups, as in the case of functional foods containing plant sterols. Theconsumption of such products is only useful for those with an elevated cholesterollevel ,and is certainly not relevant to the population as a whole. In fact, undesirable effect scould occur, such as in this case a reduction in the serum \u00df-carotene level, the long -term consequences of which remain unknown .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 6 211See chapter 7 for details of the weighing of health gain against health risk in some functional foods and health products. 6.8 Summary and conclusions This chapter addresses functional foods and health products, including the dilemma between health and safety. The interaction between the consumer and the foodindustry have placed functional foods and health products in the spotlight. The con- sumer has shown interest in food products which are both convenient and healthy. The industry has addressed this interest by developing products which promote good health. It seems likely that the sales of functional foods and health products will con-tinue to rise, and that an even greater range of such products will become available. Clear legislation and further research in this field are therefore required in order toprotect consumers. Various types of product claims are currently permitted in the Netherlands. However, inmany cases there is insufficien tevidence on which to base a clearly formulated claim, whereupon consumers can be misled. In addition to positive health effects, which will usually be confined to specific target groups, the consumption of theseproducts can also bring certain health risks. Take, for instance, various high-dosage dietarysupplements that are currently on the market. Moreover, interactions can occur in some cases. New European legislation regarding functional foods and diet arysupplemen tsis cur - rently being prepared. Under current proposals, health claims may only be used if they have been scien tifically proven .Aconsistent assessment methodology must be developed for this purpose .Safe upper levels for vit amins and minerals are now being established to prevent excess intake (overdose). At present, little is known about theactual consumption of functional foods and health products. This renders it difficult to assess the health effects at population level. In order to elucidate this situation, recent quantitative consumption data for ordinary food products, functional foods and health product smust be obtained. Accordingly, it is extremely important that the functional foods and health product sare included in future food consumption sur- veys. Wherever possible, this information should be compared to that relating to therespondents' nutritional and health status, and to other lifestyle factors. Only then willit be possible to establish by means of intake calculations whether the safe upper lev- els are indeed being exceeded ,and whether any specific health risks have arisen for the Dutch public as a whole, or by certain sub-groups. This chapter concludes with an account of the criteria to be observed when making any qualitative assessment of the positive effects (health gain) versus possible negativeeffect s(health risk) of functional foods and health products. The criteria for establish- ing a health gain include sufficien tevidence for a positive effect on a given health outcome .The in tended effective dosage range must also be known. Systematic toxici-6 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 212tystudies are required to determine the health risk, and a safe upper level of intake should be derived.

REFERENCES7 HEALTH GAIN AND HEALTH LOSS: Healthy diet and safe food in a broader context 7.1 Introduction: what questions are to be posed ? As the preceding chapters make clear, there are various fronts on which health gain can be achieved through a better diet. Chapter 2 examined the composition of the Dutch diet (with regard to five important dietary factors relating to the intake of fatty acids and the consumption of fruit and vegetables). Chapter 4 considered microbiolo- gical and chemical contamination, while chapter 6 focused on specific health-promot- ing foods ('functional foods') and health products. Where possible, the potential health gain to be achieved was calculated or estimated in quantitative terms. (In chapter 2 it was possible to do so, in chapter 4 it was only par- tially possible to do so; in chapter 6 it was not possible at all). To be more accurate, these chapters usually presented a calculation of the health loss currently experi- enced ,compared to the ideal situation ,for example the mor tality or incidence of dis- ease directly attributable to the fact that a large proportion of the Dutch population eat less than the recommended quantity of fruit and vegetables. The health loss isassumed to be equivalent to the health gain which can be theoretically achieved given appropriate in terventions. In some cases ( section 2.4 ), various in tervention scenarios were formulated: one for the maximum theoretical health gain ,and one for the realisti- cally feasible health gain ,which is usually smaller. The quantifiable health loss or health gain is usually expressed in various ways: The number of new cases of a disease (' incidence ') attributable to the factor. The number of deaths at tribut able to the factor . The number of DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years), derived from the figures for incidence and mortality (see appendix 12 ). This is also referred to as the 'total health loss'. In most cases ,these figures are presented on an annual basis. In the case of some impor tant dietary factors (and other lifestyle factors: see section 7.4 ), we have also cal - culated the overall effect over a period of twenty years, or the effects on life-expectan-cy over an even longer period. These approaches are more realistic, in that they takethe 'replacement effect' into account. If one cause of death is considerably reduced through in terventions ,the probabilit yof the people thus 'spared' becoming ill or dying from another cause gradually increases. A more detailed explanation of this phenomenon is to be found in chapter 2 and appendix 12 . This chapter places the calculated health loss and potential health gain figures in a broader perspective .The following three questions are posed: 1.Where a particular food or food product (e.g. fish) has both a beneficial health effect (such as a favourable fat tyacid composition) and a potential risk (dioxin con-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 215tent), how do these two effects compare to each other? 2. How do the calculated effects of dietary factors compare to the mortality and dis- ease caused by other lifestyle factors? 3. What is the overall picture with regard to the health loss due to an unhealthy diet, unsafe food and other causes? To answer the first of these questions, we elaborate a number of examples in section 7.2.In section 7.3, we examine a number of functional foods and dietary supplements (see also chapter 6 ), in an attempt to weigh the health promoting effects against the risks. The second question is addressed by comparing the health effects of a number of important dietary factors (as presented in chapter 2 )against those of other lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption ( section 7.4 ). Final- ly, section 7.5 deals with the third question by comparing the effects presented in chapters 2 and 4with each other and with the total health loss caused by major dis- eases in the Netherlands. 7.2 Health versus safety in common foods P.G.N. Kramers, F.X.R. van Leeuwen # 7.2.1 Approach As described in section 2.2 ,recommendations have been formulated for the optimum intake of fat tyacids ,fruit and veget ables ,and wholegrain product s.Advice is also pro- vided with regard to breastfeeding. These recommendations are based on the benefi- cial health effect sof these foods and food constituen ts. However, these 'healthy' foods can also con tain subst ances which may be threat sto health .As stated in chapter 4 ,the levels of microbiological and chemical contaminants in foods are minimized bymeans of legislation and inspection. However, food producers do not always manage to remain within the stated maximum limits. If people adopt a healthier diet (more fruit and vegetables, wholegrain cereal products, fish, breastfeeding) there is also a greater riskof ingesting the undesirable con taminants. How are we to arrive at an appropriate balance bet ween health and risk? One way of doing so is to make a quantitative comparison of the positive health effects of eating healthy foods and the health risks posed by the contaminants they may con tain.This quan tification is no simple under taking, for several reasons: (1) The nature of the health effects varies considerably, from acute illness and intoxi- cations to long-term chronic disease. (2)The certainty with which a food factor can be directly associated with a particular health effect can vary greatly. In general, the effects calculated on the basis of epi-demiological studies are seen as ' harder' than those extrapolated from animal tests. 7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 216#With contributions by A.J. Baars, A.H. Havelaar, Y.T.H.P. van Duynhoven, F.M. van LeusdenNevertheless, we shall attempt to make a quantitative comparison here. In doing so, we use the concept of 'Disability Adjusted Life Years' (DALYs), being the total of life-years lost due to a given cause and the life-years spent with a disease, weighed accord- ing to the severity of the disease (see appendix 12 ). Using this method, it becomes pos- sible to bring together adverse health effects of very differing nature under oneheading. In chapter 2 ,the health loss attributable to a series of dietary factors is expressed as 'DALYs to be regained', while a similar exercise for a number of microbio-logical and chemical contaminants is undertaken in chapter 4 . Apart from the technical problems involved in making any accurate quantitative esti- mates, there are also differences regarding the question of who is responsible. For ex- ample, the risk attached to low consumption of fruit and vegetables is largely theresponsibility of the consumer, being a matter of personal choice. However, the con- sumer has no influence over the levels of nitrate or dioxins in food products. Accord-ingly, it is the aspect of safety for which the government has developed comprehen-sive legislation. The objective is to ensure that public exposure to avoidable contaminants is reduced to such a level as to render the health risks negligible (seealso chapters 4 and 5). The perception of risk is also relevan there:risks that individuals consciously choose to accept are regarded as far less serious than those over which one has no personal influence ( chapter 8 ).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 217Table 7.1: Examples of foods for which increased consumption is recommended, with their associated health risks.

The examples are derived from the top-ics and recommendations described in chapters 2 and 4,and are shown in table 7.1 . 7.2.2 Results of the comparison Table 7.2 shows the possible health-promoting and health-threatening effects which may occur in association with the consumption of each of the four example food products, according to the recommendations. Fish The health gain to be achieved in terms of avoidable illness and mortality from cardio- vascular disease if everyone in the Netherlands were to eat fish at least once a weekhas been calculated to be approximately 82,000 DALYs (see chapter 2 ). This is compa- rable to the total health loss due to road traffic accidents or breast cancer (see table 7.5 ). The health-threatening risk factors attaching to the consumption of (oily) fish are the environmental contaminants dioxins, PCBs and organic mercury (see chapter 4 ). It was not possible to estimate the actual health loss attributable to any of these contami- nantsin DALYs. However, qualitative indications can be given. Exposure of the general population to dioxins and PCBs mainly takes place via the diet, and most especially in product sof animal origin .On average ,the consumption of fish contributes approximately 16% to the total intake of dioxins and approximately 27% to that of P CBs.However, there is considerable deviation: the oily fish varieties such as herring ,eel,salmon ,mackerel and tuna ,contain extremely variable levels of dioxins and PCBs, and in some cases these levels can be quite high (Leonards et al., 2000). Moreover, the level of fish consumption also varies considerably. The real 'afficiona- dos' who eat fish at least twice a week (approximately 6% of the population), may have adioxin intake which is one-and-a-half or two times the average intake derived from aregular diet (calculation based on :Freijer et al., 2001; Bakker et al., 2003). The appli - cation of product norms to fish result sin only a limited reduction in dioxin intake (2 to 8%, assuming fish consumption once per week; Hoogenboom et al., 2001). Asstated in chapter 4 ,approximately 8% of the population exceed the intake norms for dioxins and P CBs on a longer -term basis .However ,because the effect sof dioxins and related substances will only become manifest following long-term exposure at a level well above the intake norm (which incorporates a substantial safety margin), eventhose who eat fish more frequently are unlikely to experience any marked adversehealth effects (see also textbox 7.1 ). Recent years have seen a reduction in the average intake of organic mercury in fish, bringing the level well below the international norm .7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 218The conclusion is therefore that the health risk posed by possible con tamination of (oily) fish is marginal when compared to the subst antial health gain which can be achieved through regular consumption. Fruit and vegetables First,we consider the health gain (in terms of avoidable illness and mor talityfrom car - diovascular diseases and various types of cancer) that can be achieved were everyone to consume the recommended quantity of fruit and vegetables (200 grams per day ofeach). This health gain is calculated to be approximately 95,000 DALYs for fruit and47,000 DALYs for vegetables. This is in the same order of magnitude as the health lossdue to insufficien tconsumption of fish (see section 2.4 and table 7.2) .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 219Table 7.2: Comparison of possible health gain and possible health loss for four groups of foods.

As in section 7.5, the figures used here for the DALYs from chapter 2 are those for the maximum scenario, since these correspond to the total disease burden attributable to the factor in question.There are four groups of health-threatening substances which can be found in or on fruit and vegetables: the phytotoxins, the phytoestrogens, nitrates and pathogenic micro-organisms (see chapter 4 ). In the case of phytotoxins and phytoestrogens (the latter can also have a protective effect), it has not been possible to arrive at any estimate of thehealth risk in terms of DALYs. It is assumed that any effect will not be particularly great. In the case of nitrate in leafy vegetables (particularly spinach ,endive/chicor yand let - tuce), there are two possible effects: (1) the effects of nitrite in babies (methaemoglo- binemia ,or 'blue baby syndrome') and children, and (2) those of the carcinogenic nitrosamines ,formed when nitrites combine with amines derived from fish . Methaemoglobinemia is now extremely rare in the Netherlands. A provisional esti-mate (involving a high degree of uncertainty) of the health loss attributable to nitrosamines is approximately 100-500 DALYs. The risk of foodborne infection with pathogenic micro-organisms is greatest when con - suming fruit and veget ables which are subject to minimal preparation, such as washed and sliced lettuce, bean shoots, fruit salads and fresh herbs. Micro-organismscan be transferred to such products during the application of manure, and are noteradicated by means of further processing (heating; see textbox 7.2 and section 4.2 ). In 2000, an episode of gastroen teritis could be traced to the con tamination of t aug\u00e9 seeds with a rare strain of Salmonella. In England and Wales, 4.3% of cases of food- related gastroenteritis over a seven-year period were attributed to unprocessed fruitand vegetables. In the Netherlands, 5.5% of outbreaks of foodborne infections report-ed in 2003 were attributed to this cause (see textbox 7.2 ). Assuming that this repre- sents an average of 5% of all cases of gastroenteritis, the health loss is approximately 50-200 D ALYs (being 5% of the total of 1,000 to 4,000 DALYs lost due to gastroenteritis caused by known foodborne pathogens :see chapter 4.2 ).7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 220In an article in Science (January 2004), Hites etal. describe the presence of persistent organic pollu-tants (POPs) in wild and farmed salmon fromEurope, North and South America. The authorsconducted extensive research, analysing somesix hundred individual samples. Their conclusionwas that farmed salmon generally contains higherlevels of POPs than the wild equivalent, and thatfarmed fish from Europe is more heavily contami-nated than that from the Americas. In weighingthe beneficial effects of consumption of oily fish(due to the presence of the n-3 fatty acids)against the negative health effects attributable tothe presence of POPs, the researchers focusedon dioxins, PCBs, toxaphene and dieldrin in par-ticular. Based on the American EnvironmentalProtection Agency's risk estimates with regard to the possible development of cancer, and theassumption that such risks are cumulative, theresearchers recommended that farmed salmon should not be eaten more than once or twice amonth. This recommendation has come under fire from various quarters. The World Health Organizationstated that the article provides no reason torevise its standpoint on the consumption of fish. InFebruary 2004, the European Food Safety Authori-ty pointed out that the finding of the study (i.e. thatfarmed salmon contains higher levels of POPs) isnot new and that the levels of contaminationdescribed in the article remain below the currentlegislative norms. The EFSA also concluded thatthe article was misleading and that the riskassessment procedure used, and in particular itsfocus on cancer ,was not in keeping with the approach generally applied in Europe. Textbox 7.1: Organic pollutants in farmed salmon.The conclusion is therefore that the positive effect sof eating fruit and veget ables far outweigh the potential risks. Nevertheless, the Netherlands Nutrition Centre advises against feeding veget ables rich in nitrates to children under six mon ths of age, and further advises that such veget ables should not be eaten more than t wice a week by people of any age. It recommends that fish should be eaten with vegetables other than those rich in nitrates (such as those with high levels of vitamin C). Wholegrain cereal products The health -promoting and health-threatening effects related to the consumption of wholegrain cereal product sare shown in table 7.2 .Here, we assume the recommend- ed daily intake of no less than 3 grams of fibre per MegaJoule energy, which is approx-imately 30 grams per day. The consumption of dietary fibre, for instance via productsas brown bread and breakfast cereals, is known to have a protective effect against obe- sity, diabetes mellitus t ype 2 and cardiovascular diseases (see chapter 2 ). This is over and above the health-promoting properties of the nutrients and macronutrients inbread and breakfast cereals. A provisional estimate of the health gain to be achievedwere the entire Dutch population to consume the recommended level of dietary fibreis in excess of 10,000 DALYs (see appendix 12 ). The health-threatening factors attaching to cereal products are the mycotoxins pro- duced by fungal grow th,of which DON (deoxynivalenol, see also section 4.3 )recen tlyOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 221In addition to artificial fertilizers, the production of fruit and vegetables (whether in the open field, ingreenhouses or using hydroponic methods)involves the use of organic manure, combinedwith irrigation. This can result in infection withpathogenic micro-organisms. The plants haveantimicrobial substances on their surface, but anydamage (as in pre-sliced products) will negatethis natural resistance whereupon there is agreater likelihood of bacteria growing within theproduct, even during the chilled storage phase. Dutch hygiene codes contain instructions for the use of manure and organic fertilizers which great-ly reduce the likelihood of contamination with harmful micro-organisms from animal or humanreservoirs. Moreover, there are clear instructionswith regard to personal and commercial hygieneprecautions, helping to prevent contaminationafter har vest and during transpor t. However, a substantial proportion of the fruit and vegetables consumed in the Netherlands is imported fromabroad, both from EU member states (52%) andfrom developing countries (48%). In many of thesecountries, legislation and hygiene codes may beless stringent. As yet, no suitable disinfectionmethod is available. Between 1992 and 1999, a total of 1408 food-relat- ed outbreaks of gastroenteritis were reported inEngland and Wales. Of these, 4.3% (n=60) wereattributable to the consumption of salads, fruitand vegetables. A rising trend is also to be seen inthe Netherlands. In 2002, salads, fruit and vegeta-bles were implicated in 5.5% of the outbreaksreported to the Inspectorate for Health Protectionand Veterinary Public Health (Van Duynhoven et al., 2003). One notable vegetable-related food infection was recorded in 2000, involving an epi-demic of a rare strain of Salmonella identified dur-ing routine weekly analysis of Salmonella isolatesby the RIVM's National Salmonella ReferenceLaborator y. At the same time, the Inspectorate for Health Protection and Veterinary Public Healthfound the same strain of Salmonella - S. enteri- tidis phagotype 4b - during a routine quality inspection at the premises of a Dutch beansprouts pr oducer. The most probable cause was infected seeds (Van Duynhoven et al ., 2002). For a more comprehensive account of pathogenic micro-organisms and other infectious agentswhich can occur in food, refer to chapter 4, sec- tion 4.2 .Textbox 7.2: Foodborne infections caused by minimally processed fruit and vegetables. has become the most prevalent. In 1999, elevated levels of DON were found in grain samples. The most sensitive effect attributable to DON is probably delayed childhoodgrowth. During the period in question, the consumption of cereal products led to the intake standard (TDI) of DON to be exceeded by an estimated 80% of children agedone year. However, partly due to the reasonably short period of exposure, it has beenconcluded that a possible retardation of growth is not expected to lead to permanenthealth effects (Pieters et al., 2002). It is difficult to quantify such an effect in DALYs. The conclusion is that, given current practices, the advantages of consuming cereal products far outweigh the negligible harmful effects of contamination by mycotoxins, even for young children. This nevertheless implies that those responsible for control and inspection in all phases of production must remain alert, and that adequate mea-sures be taken to reduce fungal growth during production and storage. This matter is now being addressed by European Union legislation. Human milk and breastfeeding The beneficial health effects of breastfeeding are well documented. Under normal cir- cumst ances ,human milk con tains all the macronutrients and micronutrients required by the infant, and contains them in exactly the right proportions. According- ly, mothers are advised to continue exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first sixmonths (WHO, 2001). Breastfeeding helps in the optimal development of the immune system and the cen tral ner vous system. It protects infants against various illnesses and conditions, including inflammation of the middle ear and lower respiratory tractinfections. It also promotes cognitive development. Moreover, breastfeeding protects the mother against pre -menopausal breast cancer (Anderson et al., 1999; Hanson et al., 2003; see also chapter 2 ). A provisional estimate of the health gain in terms of the avoidance of asthma and inflammation of the middle ear is in the order of 1,000 to2,400 D ALYs(see appendix 12 ). The health-threatening factors attaching to breastfeeding are the same as those for fish: the fat-soluble environmental contaminants such as dioxins and PCBs. It has not been possible to make an estimate of the health loss in terms of DALYs for any of these contaminants. A further risk factor is HIV transmission. Asstated elsewhere, dioxins and PCBs have lipophilic properties and are therefore stored in fat tissue in the body. They are not degraded (to any marked degree) and arenot excreted. Accordingly, like other highly lipophilic compounds, they are to be found in human milk. During the past 10 to 15 years ,the concen trations of dioxins in human milk have declined by approximately 50% in various Western European coun- tries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany) (Van Leeuwen & Malisch, 2002). Thismay be ascribed to the falling concentrations in the regular diet, and is a trend whichis expected to continue (Zeilmaker et al., 2002; Freijer et al. ,2001; Bakker et al., 2003). Various studies indicate that exposure of infants to relatively high concentrations of dioxins and P CBs in human milk is associated with lower scores in tests of neurologi- cal and cognitive developmen t(Koopman -Esseboom, 1995; Vreugdenhil, 2003). How-7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 222ever, the effects are not marked and may be regarded as being of little clinical rele- vance. Moreover, children who are breastfed still score better in these tests than thosewho were bottle-fed (Vreugdenhil, 2003). Vertical transmission of HIV seroprevalence can occur through human milk, as well as during childbirth itself. Some 10 to 20 HIV+ babies are born in the Netherlands eachyear, usually to mothers from the HIV-endemic regions. Screening during pregnancyand simple interventions can reduce this number to (almost) zero (Op de Coul et al., 2003). We may therefore conclude that, although it is not possible to fully quantify the com- parison, the positive effects of breastfeeding do exceed the negative effects. What lessons can be drawn from these examples ? Adirect comparison of the health-promoting and health-threatening aspects of the same foods provides some interesting information. Overall, the conclusion is that the health-promoting effects in terms of health gain are very much greater than the risks.Only the estimates relating to the risk of foodborne infections from raw veget ables and from nitrosamines (formed in the stomach from nitrite in vegetables and amines in fish) are in any sense substantial, but remain very much lower than the calculatedhealth gain. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to make one final remark regarding this quantitative comparison. The health-promoting aspects largely rely on a personal choice of food product s,and all aspect sthat influence that choice .The health -threatening factors generally involve constituents over which the consumer has no influence, and for which the governmen thas t aken responsibility for control in order to provide the highest possible level of protection .From this perspective ,it is hardly surprising that the quantitative 'risk aspect' is very much lower than the 'health-promoting' aspect. The general conclusion must therefore be that the consumer who eats healthy foods in the recommended quantities need have no concerns about the risks posed by con- tamination. In order to maintain this situation, the government must ensure ongoing controls and inspection activities, adapted as necessary in the face of changing cir- cumstances. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 2237.3 Health versus safety in functional foods and health products C.J.M. Rompelberg, N. de Jong Criteria for a balanced comparison This section examines several categories of functional foods and health products in terms of the potential health gain versus the potential risks. Contrary to the previous sections, here, it is not possible to make any quantitative comparison, since the infor- mation required to do so is not available. An outline framework for a qualitative approach, which is illustrated with a number of examples, is set out below. In the ideal situation, both the health-promoting properties and risks factors (or absence thereof) would be documented for all functional foods and health products.Due to the lack of adequate legislation, this is often not the case. Figure 7.1 presents a classification of the various functional foods and health products, based on thestrength of the scien tific evidence of any beneficial health effect or health risk. F or both the beneficial effects and the risks, a distinction is drawn between those which have been subject to systematic research and those which have not. Where researchhas established an effect, this effect may be related to a health outcome, or to an inter- mediar yfactor (see also section 6.7 ). Wethen arrive at a matrix with t welve cells. In each cell or group of cells, the result of the comparison of health gain against healthloss can then be represented as follows: Green: a positive balance. The beneficial health effect (on one health outcome) and the absence of any risk has been adequately established Red: a negative balance. No beneficial effect but some risk has been adequately demonstrated . Yellow: a positive or negative balance. Both some beneficial effect and some risk have been established. The result of the comparison will largely rely on the quanti- tative assessment. If the risk is deemed to be acceptable in proportion to the bene- ficial effect, the scales tip in favour of the positive. White: a neutral balance. No relationship with a health outcome or in termediary factor has been est ablished, but neither has any risk been shown to exist. For the remaining cells, no such balanced comparison is possible .Here, various situa- tions can be identified: Light grey: arelationship with an intermediary health factor has been established, but no direct relationship with a health effect. There may or may not be some risk. Dark grey: the health gain and/or the health risk have not been investigated. Examples of each category are given below.7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 224The green cell In the ideal situation ,afunctional food or health product would fall in to the green cell. However, only a few products actually do so. Examples include health products which con tain folic acid, intended for women who wish to become pregnant and expect antmothers (par ticularly in the early st ages of pregnanc y). The ability of these products to protect against neural tube defects in the foetus has been adequately demonstrated (Czeizel & Dudas, 1992; MRC Vitamin Study Research Group, 1991). A safe upper level (UL) of 1 mg/day has been set for synthetic folic acid (see chapter 6, table 6.3 ). With an in take of folic acid supplements in line with the recommended dose of 400 \u00b5g/day (see chapter 6, table 6.4 ), it may be assumed that the total intake remains within the effective and safe range (see figure 7.2 ). The possibility of overdose remains low, since the addition of folic acid to foods is not permitted in the Netherlands (although it does seem to take place regularly in practice; see chapter 6 ). The red cell This cell includes such products as the vitamin and/or mineral supplements which contain a dose per unit which is at or above the UL. In this dosage range, there is noincrease in the health-promoting effect (which is only to be seen for doses that are justadequate to preven tdeficiency disorders), but there could be some adverse effect. Such subst ances would be grouped on the right of figure 7.2. Examples include the supplemen tscontaining vitamin B6in dosages above the UL of 25 mg/day .It is fre -OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 225 Health risk Health gainSystematically investigated no risk risk presentNot systematically investigated Systematically investigated relationship ingredient - health outcome established++/-?

Some examples are discussed in the text. quently claimed that additional vitamin B6,taken in combination with extra folic acid and vitamin B12,will result in a lowering of the homocysteine levels, and hence a reduction in the risk of vascular diseases. Clinical trials, however, have produced con- flicting result son this poin t(HLTC, 1998). In terms of the toxicity of vitamin B6,clinical trials indicate that sustained intake of 100 mg/day can lead to minor neurologicalsymptoms, while doses in excess of 500 mg/day can result in severe neurological effect s(SCF,2000). Sust ained ,long-term use of supplemen tscontaining doses higher than the UL therefore pose a realistic risk of neurotoxic effects, and that risk is exacer- bated if ,in addition to the supplemen t, functional foods containing vitamin B 6are also consumed . The yellow cell The consumption of functional foods enriched with plant sterols and stanols has been shown to have both a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is that of a reduction in serum LD Lcholesterol levels, which reduces the risk of coronary heart diseases .This effect is now considered to have been adequately proven, although the evidence is indirect. (There is sufficient evidence to support the relationship betweenthe ingredient and the intermediary factor of serum LDL cholesterol level on the onehand, and similarly hard evidence to support the relationship between serum LDL cholesterol level and the incidence of coronar yheartdisease on the other ;Katan et al., 2003; Law, 2000). The effect is of particular significance to those who have an ele- vated cholesterol level. The exact effective minimum intake remains unknown, but anintake of 1 g/day has been shown to be effective. The negative effect sinclude a reduction in the serum -carotene level ,this reduction being in direct propor tion to the quantity of the products consumed. Although the long-term effect sare currently unknown, this finding has led to the recommended7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 226 Recommended UL Daily Allowance Intake too lowEffective and safe intake range intake too high Health gain Health lossFigure 7.2: Intake of vitamins and minerals in relation to health effects. In the event of sub- optimal intake (below the recommended daily allowance), suppletion up to the green intakearea will result in health gain. Higher intakes (above the UL) result in health loss.upper limit for the daily intake of plant sterols and plant stanols being set at 3 g/day. An intake above this level does not result in any further reduction in the serum LDLcholesterol level, but does further reduce the serum -carotene level. We may therefore conclude that, for individuals with an elevated cholesterol level, the effect on serum LDL cholesterol level confers such benefits that a daily intake of 1-3gwill result in a health gain which outweighs the health risk (reduction of serum - carotene levels). The white cell The products which can be placed in this cell include the functional foods to which artificial sweeteners such as cyclamate, aspartam, saccharine and acesulpham K havebeen added. Despite considerable research, no consensus has yet been reached with regard to the relationship between these substances and their intended beneficialhealth effect, i.e. the prevention of overweight and/or dental caries. The safety ofthese products has been subject to systematic investigations and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been established. Provided intake remains at or below the ADI, therewill be no health effect sand the balance of health gain versus health risks is therefore neutral. The light grey cells These cells represen tthe product sfor which a clear relationship between the active ingredient and an intermediary health factor has been established, but (as yet) nodirect relationship with a health outcome. In such cases, it is not yet possible to arrive at a balanced consideration of health gain versus health risk. Examples include dietary supplements containing -carotene . These supplemen tshave been shown to reduce oxidative damage .However ,no posi - tive effect on a health outcome, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or infectious diseases, has yet been proven (Fairfield & Fletcher, 2002; Lonn & Yusuf, 1999; Vivekananthan et al.,2003). On the other hand, intake of high doses of -carotene can indeed lead to adverse health effects. Two large-scale studies examining the effects of ahigh in take of -carotene (20 mg per day as a supplemen t) by smokers resulted in a higher incidence of lung cancer and mor tality: the very opposite effect to that expect- ed (Omenn et al., 1996; ATBC, 1994). No UL for -carotene has been established. The dark grey cells The product sfalling in to these cells have been subject to no systematic investigations , whether in terms of efficacy or safety. A balanced comparison is therefore not possi- ble. The products concerned include various herbal preparations .The increasing sup- ply of such products in shops or via internet websites, together with the lack of ade-quate legislation, gives rise to an undesirable situation. An additional problemrelating to the herbal preparations is their possible con tamination with PAHs (poly- cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and other pollutants. Some other products in this cate- goryhave been shown to have some beneficial health effect ,but have not yet beenOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 227subject to proper safety assessment. They include the probiotics containing certain lac- tobacilli, which have been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea episodes inyoung children (Van Niel etal.,2002). However, one of the questions that remains to be answered is whether they increase the risk of opportunistic infections (Borriello et al.,2003). Conclusion Based on the scientific literature currently available, we may conclude that some func- tional foods and health products do indeed represent a potential health gain, without any (considerable) risk. However, the converse is true of other products: there is no evidence of a tangible health benefit, but health risks can occur. For many functional foods and health products investigations have been limited to substantiating a positive or negative health effect (or to confirming the absence of thelatter), or they have failed to substantiate either effect. In order to arrive at a balancedcomparison of potential health gain versus potential health risk, particularly in the case of the latter category, it is therefore necessary to require manufacturers to prop-erly subst antiate both the efficac yand the safet yof their products. In addition, more information concerning the intake of these products is required. To ensure that any potential health gain is actually realized, the consumer must be given adequate information about which product sare available and which are appro - priate for use in his or her individual situation. It is important that consumers be pre-vented from using functional foods, and more especially dietary supplements, that are in tended for other t arget groups .Furthermore ,consumers should be preven ted from losing sight of the importance of a healthy and varied traditional diet. 7.4 Healthy diet compared with other lifestyle interventions W.M.M. Verschuren, R.T. Hoogenveen, P.G.N. Kramers, D. Kromhout, M.C. Ock\u00e9 In chapter 2 (section 2.4 )we examined the health gain that could be achieved through improvements in the consumption of five dietary factors (saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, fish, fruit and vegetables) and through the reduction of overweight. In this section, we compare the results presented in chapter 2 with calculations relating to three other lifest yle factors :smoking ,physical activit yand alcohol consumption . 7.4.1 Calculations for three lifestyle factors Scenarios and health outcomes As in the method adopted in section 2.4, the health effect sof smoking, physical activi- tyand alcohol consumption are calculated for three 'scenarios': the reference sce- nario ,amaximum (' Utopian') scenario and a middle scenario. The reference scenario7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 228reflects the current situation. The maximum scenario describes the health loss that can theoretically be attributed to unhealthy behaviour, and hence the health gain thatcan - in theory - be achieved if the entire Dutch population were to adopt the healthi- est possible behaviour. The middle scenario calculates the health gain that could be achieved through interventions which are considered realistic and feasible. The char-acteristics of each scenario are shown in table 7.3 .Afull list of the initial age range and gender distribution by risk factor category, together with the relative risks used(RRs), is given in appendix 12 .Parallel to section 2.4, the results are presented as (1) the directly attributable health loss, per annum, in terms of disease, death and DALYs; (2) the cumulative health loss over a 20-year period, and (3) the effect in terms of total life expectancy and disease-free life expectancy. For further details of the input statistics, the calculation method, the mathematical model used and the units in which out-comes are expressed, please refer to section 2.4 and appendix 12. In the case of smoking ,the initial distribution (smokers, ex-smokers, non-smokers) used in the reference scenario is based on the statistics published by STIVORO in 1998. In the maximum scenario, no one smokes. In the middle scenario, 20% of smokersbecome ex-smokers ,and 20% of the ex-smokers achieve the equivalen tstatus of ' never smoke'. This scenario is based on the objective stated in the Ministry of Health, Wel- fare and Sport's policy document Langer Gezond Leven ('Living longer in VWS, 2003a), a reduction in the number of smokers from 31% to 25% of the total population by 2007 (see table 7.3 ). The 20-year modelling incorporates ' transition probabilities', whereby some people may stop smoking (reference scenario and mid-dle scenario), while others take up the habit (reference scenario only). As a result, the prevalence of smokers declines during the period considered by the model (see appendix 12). In the case of alcohol consumption ,the initial distribution used in the reference sce - nario is based on the POLS health survey conducted by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) in2001. In the maximum scenario, all drinkers will become teetotal, while in the middle scenario all drinkers will become 'light' drinkers. This middle scenario is still very 'Utopian' compared to the objective stated in the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport's annual budget for 2004 (VWS, 2003b), which calls for a reduction in 'problem drinkers 'from 9% to 8% of the population. The precise effects of alcohol consumption are less clear cut than those of the other factors. Complete abstinence (the maximumscenario) is likely to reduce the incidence of cancer, but increases the risk of cardio-vascular diseases compared to 'moderate consumption' (the middle scenario). Accord- ingly, the maximum scenario does not necessarily represen tgreater health gain than the middle scenario, as is the case in all other factors. Alongside the physical healtheffects of alcohol consumption considered here (cardiovascular diseases and cancer), the psychological and social effects of problem drinking also have a major impact onpublic health (alcohol dependency, alcohol-related accidents). Such aspects arebeyond the scope of this repor t. For physical activity ,the initial distribution used in the reference scenario is based onOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 229statistics published by the Prevention and Health division of the Netherlands Organi- zation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO-PG) in 1998. The maximum scenario assumes that everyone meets the standard of minimum thirty minutes' moderate to intensive physical activity at least five times a week. In the middle scenario, the pro-portion of the population which is 'inactive' (i.e. takes no exercise at all) is reduced by 4percentage points compared to the reference scenario, while the proportion meetingthe standard is increased by 10 percentage points. This is in line with the policy objec-tive stated in the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport's annual budget for 2004 (see table 7.3 ;VWS, 2003b). The 20-year modelling incorporates transition probabilities whereby people can either become more active (reference scenario and middle sce- nario) or less active (reference scenario only). We then see a slight increase in the num- ber of 'inactives' in the reference scenario, and a decrease in the middle scenario (see appendix 12 ). The directly attributable health loss Figure 7.3 shows the health loss that is, in theory, directly attributable to the three lifestyle factors (maximum scenario), and the realistic health gain which could beachieved (middle scenario). The figure represen tsincidence (new cases of disease) and mortality for both the maximum and middle scenarios, concerning the three diseases7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 230Table 7.3: Summary of the assumptions in the three scenarios and of the diseases for which a relationship has been calculated, for lifestyle factors such as smoking, ph ysical activity and alcohol consumption.

For more detailed statistics, please refer to appendix 12 . First of all, we see that incidence is approximately three to four times higher than mortality, except in the case of smoking. With regard to the latter, the difference issmaller because cancer is an important component and most forms of cancer have ahigher mortality than cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. For cancer a less than two-fold difference between incidence and mortality is observed in all cases. With regard to both smoking and physical activity, the difference between the maxi- mum and middle scenarios is approximately a factor of 5. This means that, given the basic principles adopted for each scenario, only some 20% of the attributable diseaseburden could be avoided in practice. The effect of these two lifestyle factors is broadly comparable, particularly in terms of new cases of disease (approximately 30,000 in themaximum scenario and 6,000 in the middle scenario). In the case of alcohol consumption, the picture is more complex. In the current situa- tion,the gains are 16,000 cases of disease and 5,000 cases of mor talityrelative to a sit- uation in which everyone is abstinent. The situation in which everyone drinks moder- ately (middle scenario) is more favourable than the current situation, and very muchmore favourable than the maximum scenario.

When we calculate the combined effect, the three lifestyle factorsappear to be responsible for approximately 15% of the total mortality (see appendix 12 for detailed statistics ). The cumulative health loss over a 20-year period As explained in section 2.4 ,this approach is more realistic than the directly attribut- able health loss approach, since it takes the dynamics over time into account. Figure 7.4 presents a summary of the statistics calculated by this method. Acomparison of the directly attributable health effect with the 20-years cumulative effect shows that in the maximum sce nario (on the left of the figure), the incidence over twenty years is slightly higher than the directly attributable health loss multi-plied by t wenty, but mor tality is somewhat lower. This is comparable to the findings for the five dietary factors, as presented in section 2.4 .The higher incidence reflects the ageing of the modelled cohort, while the lower mortality rate indicates that deathwill generally occur after a variable number of years with the disease in question. 7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 232 0102030405060 Diabetes CVD Cancer x1,000 I=incidence, M = mortality lifestyle factors lifestyle factors1year 20 years 1 year 20 yearsIM I M I M I M maximum scenario middle scenarioFigure 7.4: Health loss or health gain to be achieved for smoking, ph ysical inactivity ,and alco- hol consumption together ,in the maximum scenario and middle scenario respectively ,as directly attributable and cumulative over 20 years. The figures over the 20-year period havebeen divided by 20, for the purpose of comparison. Incidence and mortality are shown as thenumbers of cases in three disease groups. Inthe middle scenario ,the picture is slightly different. Here, the health gain after twenty years is greater than twenty times the gain obtained using direct attributioninterms of mortality avoided, but even more so in terms of incidence. This also indi- cates that the fraction of the maximum calculated loss (in the maximum scenario)which in practice seems avoidable (according to the middle scenario) is morefavourable over the 20-year period: approximately 45% compared to approximately30% over the one-year period. The effects on life expectancy and calculated DALYs When we consider total lifespan, we find that if the levels of all lifestyle factors were as defined in the maximum (utopian) scenario ,the average life expectancy for all Dutch adults aged 40 would increase by 1.7 years, and the disease-free period by 3years ( table 7.4). The latter refers to the diseases included in the model. This extension of (healthy) life expectancy is relatively modest because mortality and diseases thatsubstitute for the prevented diseases come to play a more significant role over time. Inthe middle scenario, life expectancy rises by one year, and the disease-free period by 1.6 years. The impact of smoking is greater than that of the other two lifestyle factors.This difference is greater than that shown in figure 7.3 because the calculation of over - all life expectancy and DALYs also includes chronic lung disorders (Chronic Obstruc- tive Pulmonary Disease; COPD). The calculated D ALYs on an annual basis are also shown in table 7.4 .These figures are based on the incidence and mortality figures derived using the directly attributableapproach. Therefore it is in line with the expectations that the health gain in the mid- dle scenario is only some 20% of the health gain/loss in the maximum scenario (for smoking and physical activity, but not for alcohol consumption: see figure 7.3 ). 7.4.2 Comparison of lifestyle factors with diet and BMI Figure 7.5 presents a comparison of the results for the above lifestyle factors with the analysis of the five dietary factors and overweight (BMI) as discussed in chapter 2 .In the maximum scenarios, we see that the total incidence of disease is broadly compa-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 233Table 7.4: Calculated effect, in DALYs, and effect on life expectancy and disease-free life expectancy of Dutch adults aged 40, in the maximum and middle scenarios.

In the case of mor tality, the differences are greater .The combined lifestyle factors are the most common cause of death, followed by the combined dietaryfactors, then BMI. The number of deaths is proportionally higher where cancer is a significan tcontributor ,as in lifest yle factors (primarily smoking). This is because cancer is the most fatal of the three types of disease considered. In the middle scenar- ios comparison, it is the combined dietary factors which offer the greatest potential gains. As previously stated, the difference between the attributable health loss (maxi- mum scenario) and the health gain considered realistically feasible through interven- tions (middle scenario) is approximately a factor of t wo in the case of the dietary fac- tors,while for the lifestyle factors and BMI it is in the order of a factor 4 to 5. Accordingly, assuming that the assumptions in the middle-scenario are correct, wecan conclude that smoking, insufficient physical activity and overweight remain moreobstinate problems than a sub-optimal diet. The overall aim is, of course, to live for as long as possible in good health. The figures in table 7.4 demonstrate that the three lifestyle factors together account for the great- est gain or loss of (disease-free) life expectancy, followed by the five dietary factorstogether, and then overweight (BMI). Only in the middle scenario, and only in terms ofDALYs, are the lifestyle factors and dietary factors more or less comparable. This once again indicates that a relatively large propor tion of the theoretical health loss can be negated by appropriate in terventions targeting the dietary factors. 7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 234 0102030405060 Diabetes CVD Cancer x1,000 I=Incidence; M = Mortality max = maximum scenario; middle = middle scenariomax middle max middle max middleIM IM IM IM IM IM three lifestyle factors togetherfive dietary factors togetherBMIFigure 7.5: Health loss and health gain to be achieved for three lifestyle factors together, five dietary factors together and overweight (BMI), in the maximum and middle scenarios respec-tively, directly attributable. Incidence and mortality are shown as the numbers of cases in threedisease groups. 7.5 DALYs lost through dietary factors and other causes P.G.N. Kramers In section 7.4 ,we set the dietary factors discussed in chapter 2 alongside other lifestyle factors, using the same model-based approach. Here, we once again adopt a broaderperspective and compare all the health effects quantified in this report against eachother, placing the results of such a comparison in the perspective of the total healthloss in the Netherlands. In doing so, we restrict ourselves to a single unit of measure, i.e. the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). As further explained in appendix 12 ,the DALY is extremely useful in enabling various sorts of health effect to be brought under asingle heading, and thus rendered directly comparable. The components of mortali- ty and disease (where due to the same cause) are combined within this summary mea- sure. Analogous to the presentation used by the Public Health Status and Forecasts (Van Oers, 2002), table 7.5 offers a semi-quantitative account of the number of DALYs lost to various causes .The second column shows the estimates for the five diet aryfactors considered in chapter 2 .Each is the estimate attaching to the maximum ('Utopian') scenario, being the loss of DALYs which is directly attributable to the factor concerned.Columns 3 and 4 show the figures relating to the microbiological and chemical conta- minan tsdiscussed in chapter 4 .The fif th column shows estimates for the other lifestyle factors, as set out in section 7.4 ,once again assuming the maximum scenario. Column 6 shows some estimates relating to environmental risks to health, after De Hollander & Melse (2004) and V an Oers (2002). F or the purposes of comparison ,the rightmost column presents the figures (in DALYs) relating to some of the 52 diseases listed in the 2002 Public Health St atus and F orecasts (Van Oers, 2002). This column therefore presen tsthe overall disease burden due to ,say, coronar yheartdiseases, while the other columns show the disease burden which is attributable to the specific risk factor concerned, e.g. overweight. This attributable disease burden can then be divided among various diseases: overweight, for example, can contribute to coronary heart diseases, diabetes and various forms of cancer. The final column of table 7.5 clearly illustrates the major differences in the disease burden due to the most prevalent diseases (which usually also account for high mor- tality, although this is not always the case: see, for example, depression), and thosewhich are less prevalent at population level. The pattern presented by the various risk factors in the other columns is par ticularly in teresting ,in that the tot al for the diet ary factors, as well as the totals for the lifestyle factors smoking, physical activity and BMI, are all in the highest category of 'more than 100,000 lost DALYs.' This may be expect-ed, since these factors clearly contribute to many of the diseases which themselves areto be seen in the two highest categories. In the range of 10,000 to 100,000 lost D ALYs, we see the individual dietary factors (in column 2), the con tribution of each of which is in the same order of magnitude as that of,say, road traffic acciden ts, breast cancer and schizophrenia.

The disease bur- den of over weight is modelled using B MIas the indicator. Overweight is also caused by insufficient physi- cal activit y, which falls under ' other lifest yle factors' in this table. 4In the lifest yle column ,the result for alcohol is that of the middle scenario .This is because, with regard to the modelled diseases ,this scenario will yield the highest gain (drinking moderate amoun tsof alcohol is more beneficial in terms of cardiovascular diseases than tot al abstinence). In addition ,'alcohol depen- dence 'is included in the last column .This means that ,in terms of DALYs, the somatic and psychosocial repercussions of excessive alcohol consumption involve a large health loss .This loss is even larger than the health loss due to ' sub-optimal consumption 'with regard to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. 5The number of D ALYs lost as a result of Campylobacter in food is less than the total stated in chapter 4, PartB. (Chapter 4 addresses Campylobacter from all sources). 6HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus; AIDS: foodborne infections, the contribution of which is therefore in the same order of magnitude as some of the more common infectious diseases such asupper respiratory tract infections (excluding influenza) and HIV/AIDS. With the excep- tion of allergens, all chemical food contaminants fall (far) below the 1,000 DALY limit.Allergenic substances must be considered as a separate group due to their markedindividual quantitative effect. As shown in the sixth column, there are some environ-mental factors which contribute more to health loss than food contaminants do. Asstated, columns 2 to 6 present the total disease burden which is attributable to a specific risk factor or determinant, which is therefore equivalent to the health gain which could, in theory ,be achieved by means of effective interventions targeting that risk factor. As stated in chapter 2 and section 7.4 however, this is not always the health gain that is realistically fea sible. Moreover, the picture presented here is somewhat simplified in that no account is taken of the long-term effects of diseases that substi-tute for the prevented diseases. Accordingly, table 7.5 is intended as a general overview which enables a direct comparison of the order of magnitude of the various effects on an annual basis. 7.6 Summary and conclusions The most impor tant message emerging from this chapter is that the (theoretical) health loss due to an unhealthy diet is many times greater than that caused by unsafefood. We can quantify this assertion as follows (based on DALY calculations): The health loss due to unfavourable diet arycomposition (the diet aryfactors together: 245,000 DALYs) and overweight (215,000 DALYs) is in each case two orders of magnitude greater than that at tribut able to microbiological food conta- mination ,which is no more than 4.000 D ALYs. The latter is higher still than the total health loss due to chemical contamination, which is no more than approximately 2,000 DALYs. The greater proportion of this health loss is attributable to allergens and to theoretical calculations of cancer risks, which may well have been overestimated. The health loss at tributable to an unhealthy diet (the five dietary factors plus a pos- itive energ ybalance) is comparable to that caused by smoking. The health loss due to unfavourable dietary composition and to overweight is in each case in the sameorder of magnitude as that calculated for other important lifestyle factors, such aslack of exercise. It is also in the same order of magnitude as the health loss due to a number of major diseases ,including coronar yheartdiseases ,lung cancer and depression. The health loss due to microbiological food contamination is in the same order of magnitude as that calculated for a number of other important infectious diseases,and also for some environmental factors such as passive smoking. The conclusion that the health aspect is of far greater impor tance than the safety risks continues to apply when examining a single food or food product, such as dioxins in fish or nitrates in veget ables .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 7 237The relatively minor health loss due to unsafe food is at least partially due to the long tradition of effective food safety policy in the Netherlands. A crucial factor has been the government's direct involvement in the improvement of food safety as a matter ofpublic responsibility, often in collaboration with the food industry itself. This has ren-dered the process of improving food safety far easier than that of improving eatinghabits, in which the choices to be made largely fall to the individual consumer. The conclusion that the health loss due to an unhealthy diet is many times greater than that due to unsafe food is confirmed by Rougoor et al.(2003) in a report pub- lished by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. Moreover, that report devotes considerable attention to the 'hygiene hypothesis' which assumes a linkbetween the increase in allergic conditions (including food allergies) and immune- system-related disorders on the one hand, and the decrease in exposure to infectiousagents in food and the environment on the other. Rougoor et al. ,therefore state that we should not strive for 'maximum' food hygiene, but rather for 'optimum' food hygiene. Whether this view is indeed founded, and what it will actually mean in prac-tice,should be est ablished by means of fur ther research (see also section 4.4 ). Based on the current health loss, government policy must prioritize the promotion of ahealthy diet. Here, 'healthy' refers to both composition and quantity, the latter of course with regard to energ yuse and combating the developmen tof overweight. If we look at current developments alongside the calculated health loss, overweightemerges as a particularly conspicuous and unfavourable trend. As elaborated in sec- tion 2.4 ,acontinuation of the curren ttrends in the five diet aryfactors and in over - weight will eventually lead to a fall in life expectancy (assuming that all other factors remain unaltered). Subst antial and effective action is therefore required to turn the tide.Food safet ypolic ywill clearly t ake second place, and besides enforcement will involve measures to address new trends and to achieve 'optimization', with the emphasis on reducing microbiological contamination. 7 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 238Anderson JW, Johnstone BM, Remley DT.

For the foodsin question, an attempt was then made to assess these two aspects cohesively, and to weigh one against the other as effective as possible, in quantitative terms. Another important factor which must be considered in the context of healthy diet and safe food is that of the consumer's own perceptions. The consumer's own beliefs with regard to food safety will influence his or her eating behaviour (a healthy orunhealthy choice of foods). Conversely, eating behaviour (e.g. food preferences) willinfluence the perception of food safety. Therefore, if we wish to arrive at useful rec- ommendations in both areas, we must also examine the relationship between eatingbehaviour and consumer risk perception . This chapter sets out the underlying theories and mechanisms which determine (eat- ing) behaviour ( section 8.2 )before going on to consider the specific elements of risk perception which are relevan tto food safet y(section 8.3 ). A number of conclusions and recommendations, based on a more integrated consideration of the two areas,are presented in the concluding part of this chapter ( section 8.4 ) 8.2 The consumer and the determinants of eating beha viour J. Brug 8.2.1 What determines behaviour ? The reasons people have for eating a par ticular type of food - or choosing not to do so -are termed the 'determinants of eating behaviour'. An understanding of these deter- minants is essential if we are to develop interventions designed to alter eating behav-iour (Meertens et al., 2000). Section 8.2 presents a summary of current knowledge about the determinan tsof eating behaviour .Eating behaviour is complex behaviour . We do not merely eat 'food', but a very wide range of foods and food products which we select from an almost endless range of alternatives, combining and preparingthem in various ways. This combination of 'sub-behaviours' eventually determines oureating behaviour, and each sub-behaviour has its own determinants. The determi-nants can vary according to the type of food (e.g. fruit versus dairy produce), by gen- der or demographic group ,by location (at home or in the workplace) and even by the time of day (breakfast or evening meal). OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 241Nevertheless, the determinants of behaviour can be grouped into a few general cate- gories. The following summary is based on a broad model of the determinants ofhealth behaviour, the 'Theory of Triadic Influence' (Flay & Petraitis, 1994). This theory distinguishes three levels, or 'tiers' of determinants: proximal, distal and ultimate.'Proximal' refers to factors which are personal to the individual and which have adirect influence on behaviour. 'Distal' primarily refers to the specific social and physi-cal context in which the behaviour arises. 'Ultimate' refers to the preconditions atgreater distance, like the more general socio-cultural environment. These categoriescan also be seen in the conceptual model included in chapter 1 ,figure 1.2 .Here, the proximal determinants are termed 'personal and 'social the ultimate determinants are shown as the 'autonomous developments'. The remainder of this section explains the determinantsof eating behaviour using this Triadic theory classification. 8.2.2 Proximal determinants Our eating behaviour is most directly influenced by the so -called ' cognitions ': inten- tions and motivations, beliefs, feelings and perceptions. Of these, 'behavioural inten- tion' is the most direct cognitive determinant of behaviour. According to the mostwidely accepted socio-psychological theories, behavioural intention is influenced by four categories of sub -determinan ts: attitudes, perceived social influences, perceived behavioural control and personal norms (Brug, 2000; Armitage & Conner, 2000). Inaddition, awareness and knowledge can also determine the behavioural intentions. Attitude Attitude is ' the way that people think and feel about a given topic'. Investigations have shown that ' attitude 'influences diet arychoice (Brug & Van Assema, 2001). Taste and hedonistic considerations are probably the most important elements. Studies by Westenhoefer and Pudel (1993) demonstrate that eating is one of the most pleasur- able activities: only sex and parties are higher on the 'pleasure list'. People tend to eat things that they consider to have a pleasant taste and avoid things they expect not to taste good. There is some natural, innate preference for sweet flavours, but all other tastes are almost entirely acquired and can therefore, in theory, be 'unacquired'. How- ever, some tastes are more easily acquired than others. We are generally quick toappreciate flavours which are associated with high-calorie foods (Birch, 1999). Expla-nations for this phenomenon may be found in terms of evolution: a preference for energ y-rich food will increase the chances of sur vival in times of food shor tages. It is somewhat less easy to develop a preference for vegetables. Apart from the aspects of taste and enjoyment, other elements of 'attitude' play a part here: expectations andpreconceptions concerning cost, ease of preparation and similarities to the diet towhich one is accustomed (Glanz et al., 1998; Brug & Van Assema, 2001). Eating is largely characterized by habitual behaviour (V erplanken & Aarts, 1999; Verplanken & Faes, 1999). In the Netherlands, for example, people opt for a typical Dutch breakfast of a few slices of bread with cheese or jam ,aglass of milk and a cup of tea ,with no8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 242reconsideration of how their choice of breakfast tastes, or of what further repercus- sions it might have. Expectations regarding the effects of certain foods on health andrisk perceptions may also influence attitude (Baranowski etal.,1999; see also section 8.3). Health considerations are of particular importance if the expected (perceived) health consequences are severe, likely and can become manifest in the short term. Attitudes are thus determined by a consideration (rational or otherwise) of the pros and cons of certain behaviours. Attitudes can, however, be changed, for example bymeans of targeted information or advertising which (a) presents new expectations regarding the benefits to be derived from a certain product, (\"Our low-fat cheese was already healthy - now it is tasty too!\"), (b) reinforces the perceived positive aspects (\"New improved flavour\") or (c) attempts to rebut the perceived disadvantages (\"Ourlow-fat cheese no longer has a low-fat taste\"). Perceived social influences The social influences experienced by the individual can be classified in three cate- gories: 'subjective norms', 'descriptive norms' and norms are the assumed expect ations of others that we consider impor tant: if, for example, someone believes that his partner or parents expect him to eat less fat, it is more likely that he will indeed try to do so. Descriptive norms are determined by what we think that other people who are important to us would do. If a person believes that his par tner or paren ts eat low fat diets, it is more likely that he will do likewise or at least try to do so. Finally, people are also more inclined to eat healthily if they feel thatthey are being actively encouraged to do so: the phenomenon known as social sup- port. Research in to various t ypes of eating behaviour reveals that people's actual behaviour is more closely related to descriptive norms than to subjective norms (Brug et al., 1994, 1995). In changing eating behaviour, social support seems to be important. Information and advertising generally rely on influencing descriptive norms: public information brochures and videos will often present 'role models', with stories or pic- tures of people who have, for example, opted to eat more fruit. The role models in adver tising are often celebrities: actors, sports personalities and pop stars. However, research has shown that people are far more likely to model their own eating behav - iour on those in their own immediate social setting, such as friends and family (Oene-ma & Brug, 2003). Peer education, in which health information is presented by peoplewithin the target group itself, makes use of this phenomenon (Kalampakorn, 2000). Perceived behavioural control Perceived behavioural control is the assessment of one's own abilities and opportuni- ties to adopt or change a certain behaviour. People are motivated to do somethingprovided they believe that they will be successful. For example, those who do notthink that they can manage to eat less in order to lose weight will be far less likely totryin the first place. Perceived behavioural control is often context specific. People who experience a low level of perceived behavioural con trol find it difficult forOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 243instance to eat less fat when at a party, when eating out, at weekends, or when eating alone. Research has shown that the level of perceived behavioural control is an important determinant of various types of eating behaviour (Conner & Armitage, 2002). Informa-tion and advertising often address perceived behavioural control in that they empha-size the ease of a certain course of action. However, perceived behavioural control canalso be facilitated by making healthy eating habits an easier option in practice, forexample by clearly labelling healthy and less healthy choices (Kreuter et al., 1997) or by improving the availability of healthy foods, as in programmes which distribute free fruit to school children (Klepp et al. ,2005). Personal norms Behaviour which includes a certain moral or ethical component is influenced by both social norms and personal norms (Armitage & Conner, 2000). This also applies to cer-tain eating behaviours. Some people may, for example, become vegetarian, others may decide to eat only biological produce, while personal moral considerations willcause a third group to deliberately avoid genetically modified product s.Campaigns which promote these types of eating habits generally appeal to the individual's per- sonal norms. Sometimes, this coincides with expectations concerning health (seeunder 'attitudes', above). Awareness and knowledge In addition to the factors mentioned thus far, awareness of one's own eating behav- iour seems to be an impor tantdeterminan t(Brug et al., 1998). Most people do not know exactly what they eat. Some 90% of the Dutch public, for example, believe that they do not eat too much fat ,while in practice a considerable majorit yeat more than the recommended levels (Brug et al., 1998). This lack of awareness regarding one 's own consumption results in there being little motivation to change one's eatinghabits. Studies have shown that creating awareness about one's own consumption is the first essential step in the process of behavioural change. Information and educa- tion campaigns attempt to increase awareness by such means as simple question-and- answer test swith which a person can evaluate his or her own eating behaviour. The main aim of ' computer-tailored nutrition education' is also to raise awareness of per- sonal eating habits (Brug et al. ,2003). Knowledge is rarely cited as a separate determinant of eating behaviour. Studies reveal that knowledge alone is generally regarded as a weak determinan tof behav - iour (Meertens et al., 2000). However, it is important that people acquire accurate knowledge about such things as the risks of an unhealthy diet, the fat and fibre con-tent of foods, the recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables to be consumed, orlow-fat methods of preparation. Such knowledge can be essential for a balanced con-sideration of the pros and cons of cer tain food choices (attitude), or if the skills required to eat healthily are to be acquired (behavioural con trol). In the complex field of diet and nutrition ,however ,the process of acquiring such knowledge has been ren-8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 244dered more difficult by the sometimes contradictory messages regarding the health and safety aspects of foods (see also chapter 7). Another specific point for attention here is knowledge about preparation methods. As the popularity of pre-prepared meals and 'fast food' increases, knowledge of preparation methods may decline. 8.2.3 Distal determinants What we eat is not only determined by what we want to eat, based on taste prefer- ences and other cognitions, but also by the environment in which we live (Booth et al., 2001). A distinction can be made between the physical environment and the social environment. Physical environment The availability and accessibility of foods is an important determinant of eating behav- iour. The range offered in the local supermarket, or the menu of a staff restaurant or school canteen, will determine what is eaten. Studies indicate that, because fast foodchains and sof tdrinks manufacturers have gained access to schools in the United States, they have had a clear influence on the eating and drinking habits of students. Price is also an important factor in this context. Food that is inexpensive is more read-ily accessible. 'Environmental interventions' can help to promote a healthier choice of food and diet. For example, a wide range of affordable healthy products can be made available, or the healthy foods can be made more recognizable by means of labelling in supermar - kets, staff restaurants and school canteens. The physical an impor tantpartin determining habitual beha v- iour since habits are often triggered by environmental cues. One possible strategy to induce habit change involves the formation of an 'implementation intention' (Ver- planken & Faes, 1999). Implementation intentions are specific action plans on when, where and in what circumstances one would like to consume a healthy food product (e.g. 'on weekdays, during the morning break, I will buy and eat an apple'). In this way, people in troduce new environmental cues (i.e. the coffee break) to induce a spe- cific action (i.e. eat an apple). Social environment Alongside the physical environmen t,the social en vironment is also of impor tance .This is perhaps most evident in the case of children, who often have less autonomy in choosing what to eat. For example, studies have shown that rules about what may andwhat may not be eaten in the family situation partly determine the food choices ofchildren and adolescents (Fischer & Birch, 1999; De Bourdeaudhuij & Van Oost, 1996).Recen tstudies also demonstrate that the more general (i.e. not food specific) parent- ing st yle may also influence the eating behaviour of children (Kremers et al. ,2003). Children from households with a so -called authorit ative approach to child rearingOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 245(characterized by emotional support, a reasonable degree of autonomy, and clear two-way communication) have been shown to eat more fruit than those raised in theauthoritarian style, as well as those raised in the 'laissez-faire' way. In this context, social economic status (SES) is also relevant (Droomers, 2002). The SES is usually determined by such factors as education, income and profession. In theNetherlands, as in many other countries, clear differences in nutrition behaviourshave been observed between different SES groups. Lower SES groups are more likelyto have less favourable diets. People of lower SES tend to eat less fruit and vegetables, for example, and are more likely to be overweight. From distal determinants to proximal determinants The Triadic theory assumes that the distal determinants influence eating behaviour via the cognitions. For example, in an environment in which fruit and vegetables areexpensive or difficult to obtain, this could negatively influence attitudes with respectto fruit and vegetables. In such a situation, other people will also be less inclined to eat fruit and vegetables, which in turn will affect the descriptive norms. Moreover, iffruit is difficult to obt ain,this will have an adverse influence on the perceived behav - ioural control (Wardle et al., 2004). Lastly, certain dietary rules and parenting styles within a family can lead to the development of subjective social and personal norms. The influence of SE Son eating behaviour is also likely to be indirect ,working via such factors as the availability and accessibility of healthy foods (e.g. price), knowledgeregarding a healthy diet, and perceived social influences. In recent years, the public health researchers and practitioners in the Netherlands and elsewhere have devoted increasing at tention to the influence of environmental fac- tors on individual health and risk behaviour ,and hence on public health (Booth et al., 2001; Ernsberger & Koletsky, 1999; Wooley & Garner, 1991). Efforts to prevent over- weight provide a good example. For many years, health education focused on influ- encing risk behaviour by means of interventions targeting the individual. However, since society is evolving in such a way as to present many more opportunities for the consumption of energ y-dense foods, with fewer opportunities and incentives for exer- cise,the situation calls for other types of intervention that include more than just edu- cation and information. Such a broader approach was most probably a key successfactor in efforts to counter smoking, whereby a combination of health informationdirected towards smoking prevention and cessation, pricing policy, and legislation on smoke free areas ,with cooperation bet ween health institutes ,the governmen tand academia. A similar strategy and the involvement of the food industry may be needed to stop the obesity epidemic. 8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2468.2.4 Ultimate determinants Our choice of food is ultimately restricted by biological factors, and by the cultural and economic structure of the country in which we live (Capaldi, 1996). The biological factors determine what is actually edible, for example which plants are suitable for human consumption. They also determine our innate preference for sweet flavoursand our aversion to bitter flavours. Within these biological boundaries, cultural factors determine what is regarded as edible (e.g. raw herring in the Netherlands, raw fish in Japan, whale meat in Iceland), and which types of taste preferences are prevalent (e.g. curry in India, chilli peppers with tomato in Mexico). Finally, macro-economic factors determine the type and quantity of food available. The ultimate determinants of eating behaviour are generally non-modifiable, or can be changed only with extreme difficulty. Accordingly, they offer no direct point ofdeparture for interventions designed to encourage healthy eating. However, interven-tions must take the ultimate determinants into account, and the ultimate determi- nants can indeed help in defining which interventions are to address which targetgroups .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 247Table 8.1: Determinants of behaviour and possible interventions.

Ultimate Economic factors Trade policy8.2.5 Conclusions with regard to interventions The foregoing discussion of behavioural determinants has considered various types of intervention. These interventions and the relevant principles for policy are summa-rized in table 8.1 ,arranged according to the type of determinant concerned. The actu- al consequences in terms of policy targeting a healthier eating behaviour are dis-cussed in section 8.4 ,in the light of existing knowledge about, and the consequences of, risk perceptions of food safety. Moreover, in chapter 2 (section 2.5 )an attempt is made to translate this knowledge into everyday practice, as faithfully as possible, with the emphasis on the main dietary and nutrition problems and the relevant recom- mendations. 8.3 The consumer and the perception of food safety M.A. Koelen, S. Lijklema 8.3.1 Introduction Viewed objectively, food in the Netherlands and in neighbouring coun tries is possibly safer today than it has ever been (see chapter 4 ). However, the consumer does not always seem to share this view. This is hardly surprising given that food quality has regularly at tracted negative media coverage :Salmonella in eg gs,hormones and antibiotics in meat, dioxin in milk and poultry, and BSE in beef cattle. On the one hand ,such coverage can lead to panic reactions ,as in the Belgian 'toxic cola affair' of 1999. On the other ,asuccession of similar inciden tscan give rise to complacenc y.In every case, it is a question of how the consumer perceives the health risks related to food, and the extent to which he or she accepts those risks. Perception is largely a mat- ter of the degree to which citizens see the risk as a substantial threat, while accep- tance is more a question of whether or not they consider the existence of the risk to be accept able. The two terms overlap, and what they have in common is that they are determined by many more factors than a mathematical risk assessmen talone. For example: can we influence the risk? Do we know what uncertainties are involved? Dowe derive any pleasure or advantage from the activity to which the risk attaches? Thissection considers the way in which these and other questions influence our percep- tion and accept ance of risks . 8.3.2 'Objective' risk assessment The Health Council of the Netherlands defines risk as \" the possibility of harmful effect sto human health, the environment or property, in combination with the nature and exten tof those harmful effect s\" (Gezondheidsraad, 1995). Technical risk8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 248analyses can produce 'calculations' of a greater or lesser degree of accuracy which reveal the statistical probability of a certain severe or less severe (health) effect actual-lyoccurring. The principles used in such calculations are discussed in chapters 4 and 5. Risk perception begins with the afore-mentioned two elements of risk: probability and effect. In the best case scenario, the probability can be quantified and a firm figure established (e.g. a 1 in 100,000 probability that a certain food will cause gastroenteri-tis). In most cases, the probability is small or extremely uncertain (e.g. the risk ofdeveloping vCJD (variant Creutzfeld Jacob Disease) from BSE-infected beef, or that of developing colorectal cancer due to the consumption of nitrates in vegetables). In terms of the effect ,it is the severity of that effect which is an important factor in deter- mining perception. Cancer and BSE are both very much more severe or frighteningthan a bout of gastroenteritis. The uncertainty regarding the probability and severity of any possible effect strongly determines the perception and acceptance of risk(Rogers, 1983; Janz & Becker, 1984; Milne et al., 2000). Various studies have shown that people are inclined to overestimate those risks with a low probability but with very severe effects (Combs & Slovics, 1979; infection seems small, but vCJD is an extremely serious and fatal condition. 8.3.3 Other characteristics of risks There are various other characteristics of risks which determine their perception and accept ance .These aspect shave mainly been investigated by means of psychometric studies. A review study conducted by Powell (1998) reveals numerous risk characteris- tics,anumber of which are listed below .(See also table 8.2 for a summar yof the main factors). Catastrophality is a term coined to describe situations in which the effects are con- centrated in time and place: an epidemic, an aircraft crash, or a Legionella out- break such as happened at a flower show in Bovenkarspel in 1999. The term also reflect sthe severity (life-threatening) nature of the effects. A risk with a high 'disas- ter factor 'is perceived as very severe. Controllability of the risk relates to the degree in which a person feels able to con- trol the risks or its consequences. The risk itself may be extremely high, but if theperson believes himself able to control that risk it is perceived as less serious. A risk over which one has absolutely no personal con trol (such as con taminan tsin food) is perceived as very severe. Here, we must also mention the tendency for people to assess risks as being somewhat lower for themselves than for others ( 'unrealistic optimism' ; Weinstein, 1980, 1987, 1989; Sparks & Sheperd, 1994; Frewer et al., 1998). Voluntariness: risks are perceived as less severe and more accept able if exposure is of one 's own free will. Star (1969) concludes that people who voluntary undertake ahazardous activit y(such as skiing) are willing to accept a risk that can be calcu -OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 249lated to be one thousand times higher than when exposed to a risk involuntarily (as in food contamination). Risks related to a hazardous lifestyle are also perceivedtobe far less serious than those presented by, say, technological hazards. Reversibility: risks are perceived as less serious if the effects can be reversed. Advantages of 'high-risk' activities .Frewer (1999, 2000) states that people will be more readily inclined to accept risks, or will perceive them as less serious, accord-ing to the advantages or pleasure linked to the activity concerned. Such advan-tages must be enjoyed by those who are exposed to the risk, or must accrue to theenvironment, rather than being restricted to the private sector, individual compa- nies or certain demographic groups, except where the latter are disadvantaged in some way. Investigations have revealed that there is generally an inverse relation between perceived risk and perceived advantage (Alhakami & Slovic, 1994). To summarize, we see that each (food-related) risk will have its own specific character- istics which account at least in part for risk perception and acceptance. The consump-tion of too much fat, for example, is controllable and voluntary. It is regarded as plea- surable, and the consequences are not immediately perceived as fatal. The BSE risk, onthe other hand ,is ver ydifferen t. Although the ' calculated risk' of developing a fatal disease through a foodborne infection is much smaller than through eating too much fat, it is nevertheless perceived as much more serious. 8.3.4 Characteristics of risk observation In addition to the characteristics of the risks themselves ,there are various aspect s related to the observation of risks which affect perception and acceptance. People are exposed to a large amoun tof information ever yday. According to Tversky and Kahne- man (1973) they apply a number of simple criteria (heuristics) to render this informa - tion manageable, but there is always a degree of personal selectivity. In assessingrisks, the extent to which one can imagine an incident or the extent to which associa- tions or examples can be brought to mind, will be important (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973; Uitdewilligen et al. ,1993). This is related to the characteristics of the risk itself (see above) and also the exten tto which the information ties in with earlier observa- tions (confirmation), or the frequenc ywith which the risk is brought to the con- sumer's attention (e.g. by means of extensive media coverage). The literature cites var-ious other characteristics of observation which affect this process. These are listedbelow and also summarized in table 8.2 : Positive and negative messages ('framing'). Studies reveal that negative information ('this is dangerous') is regarded as more reliable than positive information ('there isno risk'). This may well be due to the fact that in an evolutionary context, informa-tion about risks is more important in terms of survival (Siegrist & Cvetkovich, 2001). State of mind .If the recipien tof the information is in a negative state of mind, he is likely to process information in a more analy tical and systematic way. He will adopt a more critical approach ,attaching greater weight to the negative aspects.8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 250With a more positive state of mind, the recipient will be more inclined to process the information in an intuitive manner, with greater attention for the positiveeffects. Knowledge about the risk. Here, 'knowledge' refers to both the recipient's personal knowledge and his estimation of the knowledge offered by scientists and otherexperts. If the scientific knowledge is regarded as 'good', the sense of anxiety andconcern will be mitigated. However, scientific knowledge with regard to variousfood-related topics is subject to uncertainties, and the information available maybe incomplete or even contradictory, at least in the eyes of the consumer. For example, many people are concerned about genetically modified foods. They are unable to form an overall view of the consequences, either today or in the future, and believe that science has so far failed to conduct adequate research into theeffects. Studies also reveal that experts assess risks in much the same way as any- one else. That they sometimes arrive at different conclusions, with a lower assess-ment of risk, can be due to a personal interest in the technology, and a more posi-tive view of the controllability of risks (Sj\u00f6berg, 2001; Rowe & Wright, 2001). Trust in the organizations responsible for risk management will also influence the perception and accept ance of risks 2001). This trust is based on assumed competence and objectivity, the degree to which the source of the information takes account ofthe interests of the immediate stakeholders (fairness), and the consistency of the information provided (Frewer ,1999; P oortenga et al., 2000; Bier ,2001). T rust is, however, fragile. It is built gradually, but can be completely destroyed by a singleincident. Once mistrust has taken hold, it will often increase by itself (Slovic, 1993). Frewer (1999, 2000) concludes that developmen tor loss of trust in a source of information is largely a question of whether the information provided later proves to be true or false .Trust in an organization or source of information is particularly impor tantif the recipien tsof the information have little personal knowledge con- cerning the risk (Siegrist & Cvetkovicz, 2001). In terms of the perception and acceptance of risks, exposure to information about the risk is usually seen as the most important factor. The media and the way in which the information is ' framed' are crucial here. This can lead to 'social amplification' (Kasper- son et al., 1988), whereby a combination of the risk at tributes described above and extensive media coverage can elevate risks, that are objectively estimated or calculat-ed to be relatively minor, to the status of a 'crisis' accompanied by considerable socialdisquiet. This effect can be exacerbated if the feeling exists that the current situation is merely a forerunner of some new and unknown threat. Sometimes this is accompa - nied by serious economic losses. The instances of the incidents cited in the introduc-tion to this section are good examples. Furthermore, a study conducted by Frewer et al.(2002), revealed that the risk perception of the British public with regard to geneti- cally modified foods was more negative in times of extensive media coverage. .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 2518.3.5 Individual differences in risk perception Anumber of studies provide information about the link between demographic factors and risk perception. In general, women appear to assess risks to be greater than men do (Flynn et al., 1993; Slovic, 1987; Frewer, 2000; Frewer et al., 2002). Jussaume and Judson (1992) found that people with children under 18 are more inclined to pur - chase 'residue-free' foods. Certain ethnic groups, individuals belonging to the lower social-economic status groups (assessed by education and occupation) and those withabelow-average income also sometimes assess risks to be more serious than do others. According to Frewer et al. (2002) this effect may be due to the fact that these groups are generally less involved in the decision-making processes regarding risks. In thiscontext, K\u00e4llmen's investigations (2000) into personal characteristics is also interest- ing.People whit low anxiet ylevels ,who have an in ternal ' locus of con trol'(the per - ceived ability to influence ones own situation) and have a high degree of perceived self-efficac y, tend to assess both personal and general risks lower than others do. Moreover, individuals have different experiences with risks, which may either increase or decrease concerns. This is partly related to the question of whether prior exposure to a hazard was voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary risk activities tend to increase concern. For voluntary activities no significant relationship between experience and the level of concern has been found .People generally are less concerned about volun- tary risks which, moreover, are more often associated with certain (expected) advan- tages. It may also be that a person has undertaken a voluntary activity precisely because he or she was less concerned about the risks (Barnett & Breakwell, 2001). 8.3.6 Cultural factors According to the 'cultural theory risk' (Knox, 2000; Bouyer et al., 2001), socio-cul- tural factors also determine which risks are given greater or lesser attention. Forexample ,the consumption of meat has a different meaning in certain cultures: Jews and Muslims are not permit ted to eat pork, while Hindus do not eat beef. In the west- ern culture ,attitudes to meat are influenced by opinions regarding the way in which8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 252Table 8.2: Summary of the factors which play a role in risk perception (as described in the text). Factor A risk is perceived as being greater and less acceptable if: Catastrophality The consequences are more severe, and are more concentrated in time and place Controllability Control is out of the individual's hands Voluntariness Exposure is involuntary Reversibility The effects are irreversibleObserved benefits No benefits are attached to the riskFraming There is more negative information about itState of mind The state of mind is more negative Knowledge, understanding, familiarity The risks are unknown, both to the individual and to experts Trust People are less inclined to trust the informationhumans should interact with nature and the environment. The intense response to crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and fowl pest may be seen asanexpression of growing resistance to the large-scale bio-industry and animal feed cycle (Miles & Frewer, 2001; Vis & Koelen, 2002). In other words, concern is by nomeans always about personal health risks. 8.3.7 Conclusions with regard to risk communication The characteristics of risks and risk observation listed in this section demonstrate that the overestimation or underestimation of risks is a phenomenon which will be diffi- cult to avoid in practice. Clearly, risk perception and acceptance rely on a far greaternumber of factors than a calculated figure alone. Moreover, we must note that the cal- culations themselves are subject to varying degrees of accuracy and will alwaysinvolve subjective choices, such as the specific health effect being considered (Slovic,2001). Figure 8.1 presents a schematic representation of the influence of the various factors on risk assessment and risk perception. Risk communication can be used by governments or food manufacturers to influence the public's perception and acceptance of risks. It can be used to counter the undesir-able (e.g. economic) consequences of certain risk perceptions. The immediate objec-tives of risk communication include:(1)Raise trust in the government or other actors (2)Awareness raising, providing information and education (3)Encouraging responsible ,safe behaviour OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 253 Obje ctive risk (calculated) -chance -effect of obse rvation -framing Appraisal of the th risk perception.Communication is, however, interactive. For instance, one objective might be to gain an understanding of people's motives for adopting given positions, thereby arriving atajoint approach for further communication. In any event, effective risk communica- tion requires sound understanding of the factors discussed above. For a comprehen-sive account of the guidelines for risk communication in general, we refer to Powell(1998), Bier (2001), and Lundgren & McMakin (1998). We examine a number ofaspects in detail below. Raising trust Communication is pointless if there is no trust in the communicator. For example, if public concern about food safety increases, while at the same time there is a decrease in confidence that the government and the industry have technological develop-ments under control. In such a situation, negative risk perceptions will be reinforced. Communication can only enhance trust and confidence under certain conditions.Trust in the sources of information is bolstered by the suggestion of competence,objectivity, justice, consistency and openness. The sources are seen as least trustwor- thy when they overstate or misrepresent the information, if they have a clear vestedinterest ,orif their motives appear to be those of self -protection . Awareness, information and education Assuming that trust and confidence exist, or can be created, the next step in the risk communication process is that of providing factual information and awareness rais - ing. A number of guidelines for effective risk communication can be summed up asfollows (Powell, 1998): Be truthful, open and complete. The information must address the nature of the risk , the advantages and disadvantages, possible alternatives, the choices that have to be made and the degree of scien tific uncer tainty that exists. It is important into accoun tthe differences bet ween exper tsand the general public in terms of perception and wording. Be proactive .Provide information from the earliest possible moment. Assume that perceptions are realistic .Use the feelings and concerns of the public as one of the starting points of the discussion. Take concerns other than those related to risk ,such as ethnic objections, into account. Place the risk in its social and polit- ical con text (Frewer, 1999; Miles & Frewer, 2001). Provide specific and personally relevant information. Information which is too gener- al will easily give rise to distorted perceptions. People may then feel more at riskthan they really are, which will lead to panic reactions. Alternatively, the phenom- enon of ' unrealistic optimism 'may occur ,whereupon the risk will be ignored because people consider themselves to be at less risk than others. Tell people what they themselves can do .If people realize that preventive action can be taken and will be effective, there is a greater likelihood that they will act accord-ingly. 8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 254Encouraging safe behaviour If the purpose of risk communication is to encourage safe behaviour, the determi- nants of behaviour have to be taken into account (see also section 8.2 ).Whether and how people display preventive behaviour or change behaviour in the face of a risk is described in the 'Protection Motivation' theory (Rogers, 1975, 1983; Neuwirth et al., 2000; Milne et al.,2000). Protection motivation is a behavioural intention which is regarded as a good indicator of subsequent behaviour. According to the theory, thedecision to adapt one's behaviour in the face of a risk will depend on two appraisalprocesses: (a) threat appraisal and (b) coping appraisal in which the options to dimin- ish the threath are evaluated. The process of threat appraisal involves all the elements discussed in sections 8.3.2 to8.3.6 ( see also figure 8.2) .The process of coping appraisal is afunction of three simultaneously occurring assessments. The first considers the per- ceived effectiveness of preventive behaviour (response efficacy), the second considers the person's self-efficacy to perform that behaviour, and the third relates to the costsin terms of money, time and effort (response costs) that will be involved in doing so.Each of the various elements within these processes can form a barrier to effective behavioural modification by means of risk communication. For example, 'unrealisticoptimism 'may lead a person to trivialize his or her own susceptibilit yto the risk :\"let other people be careful, I don't have to.\" This may form a major barrier to effective risk communication. Some strategies for influencing behaviour are presented in sec- tion 8.2 .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 8 255Figure 8.2: Risk communication, risk perception and (eating) behaviour. Proximal -protective intentionDistal determinants Risk -personal e ffectiveness -cost, e ffortEating behaviour rvation -framing Appraisal cultu re8.4 Conclusions and recommendations Eating behaviour Eating behaviour is complex behaviour which is very difficult to change for the better. As described in section 8.2 ,eating behaviour is determined by personal factors (the proximal determinants), of which behavioural intention is the most direct. Behaviour-al intention is determined by factors such as attitude, which is the result of a balancedconsideration of the expected advantages and disadvantages. Expectations in terms oftaste, enjoyment, convenience and cost are the most important factors, alongside 'force of habit'. Expectations of beneficial health effects will also influence attitude, but this effect is less marked, and decreases if more time will elapse before the benefi- cial health effects become apparent. Furthermore, 'convenience' plays a major part inperceived behavioural control, another important sub-determinant of behavioural intention. The physical environment (distal determinants) has at least an equally important influence. This influence is mostly indirect, via the personal determinants. Issues suchas the availabilit yand accessibilit yof foods will help to determine people 's attitudes. These issues, in addition to habits, will therefore allow interventions addressing the above-mentioned aspects, such as taste, enjoyment, convenience and cost. The socialenvironment (setting) can be important as well, particularly for children and the lower SE Sgroups . Modifications to the food supply can therefore influence both important environmen- tal factors (availabilit y, accessibilit y) and ,indirectly, the main personal factors (behav - ioural intention, attitude). The purpose of doing so should be \"to make the healthy choice the easy choice \". Success in such an under taking is most likely to be achieved by means of improvemen tsin taste,convenience and pricing ,whereby the products should preferably fit within existing eating habits. Some examples of this are, in part, previously observed changes to eating behaviour with regard to products such as brown bread, semi-skimmed and low-fat dairy produce and 'light' versions of many foods and beverages. The chance that such in terventions will be successful can be further enhanced by pos- itively influencing other individual determinants such as awareness and knowledge atthe same time, by means of education and information. This is important in terms ofenabling people to assess their own eating behaviour, and to gain a better under- standing of the shor t-term and longer -term health effect sof various foods .Both aspects will help determine a person's willingness to change his or her eating behav- iour. Here, the assessment of negative health effects forms a link with the aspects ofrisk perception and acceptance, as described in section 8.3 . Risk perception and risk communication As we saw in section 8.3 ,the perception and acceptance of a risk does not rely on a cal- culated st atistic alone ,but on many other factors. It is almost inevitable that the con-8 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 256sumer will overestimate or underestimate the risk, based on both the characteristics of the risk itself and the characteristics of the observation. The observation of the riskwill depend in part on the same personal characteristics which also determine eating behaviour. With regard to the characteristics of the risk itself, it seems that an extremely severe health effect ('catastrophality') tend to be more important than a low statistical proba-bility. Other factors, such as controllability, voluntariness and expected advantagesalso play an important role in this respect. With regard to the characteristics of obser- vation, the context ('framing') of the message is the main factor, although individual differences and cultural factors may also play some part. It is said that the expectations regarding negative health effects of food products only have a limited influence on eating behaviour as well (see section 8.2 ). Only where the (perceived) health effect is extremely severe (as in BSE or cancer), or in the case ofacute health effects (foodborne infections, food allergies), is behaviour likely to be modified to a great extent. However, this is not a 'black and white' distinction, partic-ularly with regard to the effect sthat will only become apparen tover a ver ylong peri - od of time. The presence of carcinogens in food products, if subject to enough media coverage, can decimate the sales and consumption of those products and can give riseto a 'food crisis'. By contrast, excess consumption of unhealthy fats, despite represent- ing an equally severe (objective) health risk and being subject to equal media cover - age, continues unabated. Is, in the latter case, the perceived severity of the effect notso great, or do other characteristics of the risk and/or its observation play a greater role here? Risk communication with the consumer is one of the most impor tant means by which such phenomena can be understood. Good risk communication must be in teractive and public perceptions must be t aken seriously. Good risk communication can be used to create or to restore trust and confi- dence in the government or other actors, and can also be used to ensure better infor- mation and consumer education. Raising awareness and increasing the consumer's knowledge can have a positive effect on eating behaviour, given that both aspects help to determine at titude, the main determinant of behavioural intention. Risk management Good risk communication is also an important instrument in risk management. The report Nuchter omgaan met Renn ,2002) provides a framework for effective risk managemen t. This framework , also known as the 'risk ladder', sets out a number of different strategies for discussion and decision-making to be used when dealing with increasing levels of uncertaintyregarding the risk involved, and with increasing levels of social complexity.

C.T.M. van Rossum, M.C. Ock\u00e9 # 9.1 Introduction Foregoing chapters have discussed how healthily Dutch people eat and the status of food safety in the Netherlands. But what will the future bring? To answer this ques- tion, interviews with sixteen experts in various fields were held (see appendix 3 ). The experts were asked about their expectations with regard to changes in eating behav- iour and to the food supply during the coming five to ten years. They were then askedto indicate which factors underlie these changes and what the effects will be on the safety and the health-promoting aspects of our diet. Finally, where possible, theexperts stated how these changes would eventually influence public health. The inter-views were conducted according to a set structure (shown in figure 9.1 ), in which the developments in eating behaviour and food supply were of pivotal importance.Depending on the specific exper tise of the in terviewee ,greater or lesser attention was devoted to each aspect. A summary of the interview was presented to each intervie- wee for assessment. The summaries of all interviews, the main conclusions and thepossible principles for policy were later discussed by the same experts during two workshops .This chapter describes the result sof the interviews and the workshops, using the structure of the model shown in figure 9.1 . This is followed by the recom- mendations for policy and finally the summary and conclusions. 9.2 External factors Many factors which are beyond the direct influence of the manufacturer or individual consumer are reflected in developments in eating behaviour or the food supply. This involves developments in a variety of fields, both in the Netherlands or on a larger scale, such as socio-demographic, socio-cultural, economic and scientific develop- ments, as well as changes to legislation. The external factors described in this section were explicitly cited by the exper ts as explanations for changes in eating behaviour or the food supply. Incidentally, it cannot be claimed that any single external develop-ment will have a specific effect on one certain development in eating behaviour or thefood supply. The reality is usually more complex because many factors influence each other .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 261#With con tributions by C .F.van Kreijl ,M.C.M.Busch9.2.1 Socio-demographic factors The changing composition of the population will undoubtedly have an effect on the future demand for foods .One change which is particularly conspicuous is the increased represen tation of seniors and ethnic groups in society. According to the forecast s,in 2009, 15% of the Dutch population will be 65 years or older, being almost9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 262 Healthy diet -Fruit and vegetables -Energy intake -Saturated/ European or global level -Etc.

This diagram is basedon the conceptual model from chapter 1. 2.5 million people (CBS, 2003). Moreover, approximately 12% of the population will be of non-western ethnic origin, compared to 10% in 2003 (CBS, 2003). 9.2.2 Socio-cultural factors The increase in employment participation on the part of women will also be reflected in eating behaviour. In 2003, 55% of couples formed two-income households (CBS,2003). The expectation is that this number will continue to increase. Another socio- cultural development which will play a role is individualization. In addition, the great demand for information and the availability thereof in society will lead to an increase in the quantity of information provided about food. This will not just affect the information that is currently printed on packaging, but also infor-mation about production methods (e.g. 'animal friendly'), health-promoting proper-ties, origin, etc. The importance of this information will increase because there is an ongoing development whereby eating is increasingly seen as a signal of identity; theimmaterial aspect sof food will therefore become more impor tant. It is also expected that the 'distance' between consumers and food will become larger. This is the consequence of the presence of food being taken more for granted, the greater physical dist ance to the production of foods ,and decreasing knowledge about food and nutrition. Most information about nutrition now reaches the consumer viathe media in the form of food industry advertisements, and this situation is expected to con tinue .These adver tisemen tswill of ten encourage greater consumption of ener - gy-rich foods. A decreasing amount of information about diet and food will come from such in termediaries as paren ts, teachers or information officials who endorse a more responsible diet ,whereupon children in par ticular will be more susceptible to new influences and the advertised products. This development will have an effect oneating behaviour. Acultural shift is expected within the food manufacturing companies. The large com- panies in par ticular increasingly become aware of the requirement to do business in a socially responsible manner .Sustainability and, in particular, health will become important aspects which will be used in the profiling of the products. 9.2.3 Legislation/Policy More legislation will be established at European level and less at national level. It is anticipated that this will have both positive and negative effects for the Netherlands.Apositive effect is that matters will now also be addressed on a larger scale. A possible negative effect ,according to the experts, is that harmonization of legislation with regard to food componen ts could result in higher permissible levels than those cur- rently allowed in the Netherlands .In this type of decision, the Netherlands could actu-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 263ally become a guiding country. The formulation of legislation at the European level will, however, proceed very slowly. This may pose a danger to public health withregard to the emergence of 'new' threats, because the legislation will lag behind the developments. Aspecific change which is currently being prepared by the European Union concerns legislation relating to health claims (see also chapter 6 ). This legislation will ensure that claims may only be made if they are subject to scientific evidence. This is expect-ed to lead to greater acceptance of specific health-promoting foods (also called 'func- tional foods' by many experts), because it will then be possible to 'separate the wheat from the chaff'. Another important regulation which seems to be forthcoming is a European law which permits certain (new) methods in the food production process,such as decontamination. Of course, the policy of the national government will also have an influence on the food supply and on eating behaviour. On the one hand, a number of experts believe that the government will reduce its direct involvement yet further, whereupon theresponsibilit yof the manufacturers and of the citizen will become more impor tant. If this trend continues, the short-term effects will be limited according to the experts. In the longer term, however, it will have major consequences, as illustrated by the epi-demic of overweight which has already begun. The experts do not believe that gov- ernmen twithdrawal will have a major effect on the aspect of food safet y, because this will be partly compensated by the food companies themselves. After all, manufactur-ers do not wish to suffer any damage to their image. On the other hand, some experts believe that the governmen twill actually involve it self more in food and nutrition . The expectation is that priorities in government policy in the field of food safety will, in future ,be determined more by worldwide problems than by those only seen in the west. 9.2.4 Macro-economic factors The exper ts believe that the expansion of scale and globalization of food production will con tinue. This could have an effect on food safety in particular (see section 9.4.2 ). The manner in which the economy will develop in the years ahead, currently an uncertain factor, will also have an influence on eating behaviour and the food supply. 9.2.5 Science Developments in science will also influence our diet and its health effects. Greater knowledge will become available about the health-promoting aspects of dietary pat-terns and of specific food componen ts. This knowledge is expected to prompt further discussion about whether an adequate in take of a certain bio-active substance can be achieved by means of the ' normal 'diet, or whether certain foods should be enriched9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 264with the substance. If so, which foods? An example of a substance for which this dis- cussion is already ongoing is folic acid, but it is conceivable that further bio-activesubstances will be subject to discussion in the future. In addition, knowledge about the health-promoting aspects of diet will be applied in the production and promotionof foods. The importance of diet in terms of health is also beginning to penetrate themedical world, resulting in more prevention activities targeting eating behaviour. Apart from more knowledge about the health-promoting aspects, we may expect greater knowledge about the harmful effects of the substances contained in our diet. For example, an increasing number of hazardous chemicals will be identified and detected (in smaller quantities). This will affect the setting of standards with regard to admissible quantities in foods. In the context of scientific developments, many experts cite the growing knowledge about the human genome and its relation to nutrition. This knowledge will lead tocustomized nutritional advice, to the development of functional foods which are tai- lored to persons with a certain genetic profile, and to risk evaluations which takegenetic sensitivit yinto accoun t. However ,this is not expected to have any role in eat- ing behaviour or the food supply during the coming five to ten years. In addition, more knowledge will emerge concerning the practical applicability and effectiveness of possible (new) preser vation techniques and decon tamination meth- ods. All these new preservation methods, technologies, etc. could, the experts believe,potentially contribute considerably to improving the safety and health-promoting proper ties of our diet. Whether this will actually be the case depends on consumer acceptance, which will be influenced by the degree to which the consumer is involved from the st artin the introduction of a new method or technique. 9.2.6 Miscellaneous factors Two developments of entirely different kinds are climate change, which can affect the ecolog yof microorganisms, and increasing hygiene. It has been claimed that improved hygiene result sin too little stimulation of the immune system, which may lead to an increase in disease burden due to conditions such as food allergies (see also section 4.4 ).OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 2659.3 Developments in the food supply and eating behaviour The experts expect that current trends in the food supply and in eating behaviour will continue over the coming five to ten years. Although supply and demand have amutual influence, many experts are of the opinion that the influence of the supplyside on eating behaviour is greater than that of consumer demand on the supply. Thefollowing sections discuss the developments in the food supply and eating behaviour separately. 9.3.1 Developments in the food supply During the years ahead, a number of developments may be expected, both within the food industry and within the food supply. New techniques will be used in the produc- tion of foods, and there will be a larger range of food products which address con-sumer food choices .There will also be changes in terms of the provision of consumer information and in the locations at which the food supply is made available. Production methods Alongside the manufacture of new product swhich may en tail new production meth- ods, ensuring the safety and quality during the production will become a more impor-tant aspect within the organization and its control systems. Related to this are the changes expected in preser vation and decon tamination .Reasons for these changes include the consumer's preference for products containing fewer preservatives, the expansion of scale and consequen tlonger production lead times ,and forms of micro- biological con tamination which cannot be coun tered using the existing methods . First of all, efforts will be made to use lower doses of the traditional preservatives. Moreover, greater use will be made of alternative preservation techniques. The appli- cation of alternative natural preservatives does not yet seem possible, given that most of those that have currently been investigated either have an extremely selective effect or adversely influence the sensor yqualities of a product. However, the use of new milder preser vation techniques such as ultra-high pressure, electron radiation ('e-beam') and 'pulsed-electric-field' (PEF) is expected to increase, as a replacement forpasteurization treatments. The main motivation for applying these techniques is notsomuch food safety, but the desire to improve freshness and sensory quality, as prod- uctswill no longer have to be heated .Because these techniques are ,in general , expensive, the experts believe that in the short term they will only be applied to the more expensive products. Until recently, decontamination methods could not be used without special dispensa- tion.The experts anticipate that their use will soon be permitted in order to kill some or all of the pathogenic microorganisms ,particularly those in primary animal prod- ucts,such as Campylobacter and Salmonella in poultry. These techniques will primar-9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 266ily be used on the surface of raw products. Examples of decontamination methods include the application of lactic acid, acetic acid, peroxides, high-intensity light pulses(HIL) and UV light. The last two mild decontamination techniques will primarily be used on products with relatively smooth surfaces. Range of products The range of foods which fit in with a healthy dietary pattern or which have a healthy image is expected to increase in size. This development is due in part to the trendscited above, that more knowledge will become available with regard to the health- promoting aspects of the diet, and that more large companies are aware of the requirement to do business in a socially responsible manner. This latter trend will con- tinue within all food sectors, since no one wishes to be 'bottom of the class'. In thesnack sector, for example, there is already a discussion about improving and/or reduc- ing the fat content of products. If there is increasing societal pressure to take greateraccount of the sustainability or health aspects of foods, there will be greater motiva-tion for doing business in a socially responsible manner. This will lead to an increased supply of products which are appropriate to a responsible dietary pattern. However,the exper tsdo not expect the range of unhealthy product sto decrease in size .The market for 'healthy' products will remain limited, largely due to the high level of investment required and the higher prices which must then be passed on to the con-sumer. At the same time, the 'unhealthy' products will continue to offer companies large profit s.So, doing business in a socially responsible manner will become more important, but the maximization of profits will remain the main objective. On the one hand ,the increase in the number of ' healthy 'product swill involve a rise in the number of existing products whose nutritional composition has been improved ,such as pre -prepared meals with larger portions of vegetables than is now usual .Onthe other hand ,an increase in the range of functional foods is expected , both those targeting specific conditions (such as high blood pressure and overweight) and those addressing specific target groups or situations. According to one expert, however, the market for functional foods will be severely restricted once the draft text of the legislation governing health claims is ratified, since this precludes claims for 'general health or well-being, behavioural benefits, psychological benefits or weight managemen t'. There may also be an increase in the range of functional foods due to the inclusion of the same bio-active substance in several types of products. Competi-tors will copy and market successful products more quickly, a phenomenon known asthe 'me too' trend. Another important expectation with regard to the range of products is a further growth in the number of different products available. An increasing number of prod-ucts from all over the world will come within reach, while the range of (partially) pre-prepared meals will be expanded to include 'world cuisine dishes'. Moreover, therewill be greater variation within one and the same product group .The supermarket dairysection has recently undergone an enormous expansion. This development will also be seen within other product groups .It is therefore expected that there will beOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 267many more products on the market which contain a high quantity of salt and/or sugar or artificial sweeteners. The range of products with a particularly pronounced flavour,which are either energy-rich or prompt greater consumption, will therefore increase. Anumber of experts believe that there will be less variety in various basic products. One example is the number of apple varieties available, which has declined in recentyears. Two developments are identified with regard to packaging and serving units. There is atrend whereby portion sizes, particularly those of energy-rich products, are increas- ing. Similarly, products are packaged in such a way that the consumer is more inclined to consume larger quantities. This trend is partly due to the fact that, further to expansion of scale and globalization, multinational companies operating in Europewill adopt the marketing strategies which have proven successful in the United States. Atthe same time, there is also a trend towards smaller packaging units, such as small packets of crisps and pre-sliced vegetables for one person. Consumer information The consumer has a growing need for information about the foods he or she con - sumes. The improved control systems of the manufacturers ensure that some of this information is available, and information technology makes it possible to communi-cate that information to the consumer. However, the form of the communication must be designed within a join tprocess involving the governmen t, the consumer, retailers and manufacturers. Options include information on product labels, information pro-vided via the internet, or by means of specific logos or special in-store displays. Location of supply In recen tyears ,it has become ever easier to obtain food practically anywhere and at almost any hour of the day .The exper tsbelieve that this trend is not likely to con tinue at the same rate in the decades ahead. However, there will be an increase in the num- ber of larger supermarkets, prompted largely by the desire for the convenience of 'one-stop shopping'. Regional products will also be available in these new outlets. As the counterpart to these large-scale supermarkets, there will also be a trend towards the purchase of food in local ,small shops (including non-western speciality retailers) or directly from the source ,such as a 'hobby farmer'. The non-western shops will be particularly popular among the ethnic population, given that the large companies donot yet address this market. The desire for more convenience when purchasing foods will also lead to a slight increase in the supply of food products via the internet, and deliveries to the door(mobile shops and frozen products). Finally, a slight increase in the number of shopsselling only one brand is expected. 9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2689.3.2 Developments in eating behaviour Animportant, general development in eating behaviour is that consumers will dis- play several, disparate behaviours. Previously, consumers could be placed in clearlydefinable 'pigeonholes'; in future they will be less consistent in their behaviour. Forexample, there will be consumers who eat fast food one day, but who prepare anextensive sit-down meal the next. It is also expected that the favourable changes ineating behaviour will be very gradual. This is because eating behaviour is difficult tochange for the better, as illustrated by the effects of current education campaigns, and because the Dutch are creatures of habit (see also chapter 8 ). Nevertheless, there will be developments in eating behaviour which will not apply to the entire popula- tion, but which will be of greater or lesser importance in terms of health within cer-tain groups. They include changes in the eating moments and the choice of foods. Eating moments It is expected that eating moments will not be confined to the main mealtimes. Because food is available practically everywhere and at any time, a greater number ofconsumers will eat throughout the day, a phenomenon known as ' grazing '. However , this will not be at the expense of the three main meals: the majority of the population (at least 75%) will adhere to the traditional mealtimes. Among the lower socio-eco-nomic status groups, it will however be more common for people to skip breakfast. In combination with other risk factors ,this practice can have an additional adverse effect within these groups. Another trend is that not all members of the householdwill sit down to the table together at mealtimes or for between-meal snacks, particu- larly on weekdays .Further to the ongoing individualization of societ yand the increas - ing number of two-income households, eating will become a much more individual under taking, with each member of the household eating at whatever moment suits him or her best. Food choice In terms of food choice, several contradictory trends may now be observed which will continue in the future. For example, there will be more biological foods and more arti- ficial foods ,aswell as more fast food and more slow food. However, the experts cluster the main trends together as a tendenc ytowards more convenience, health, variety and enjoyment. In addition, force of habit is cited as the fifth main influence on eat-ing behaviour: clearly, this factor stands in the way of rapid changes. The price-quali-ty ratio will also continue to play a role, certainly if the economic recession continues. The trend towards healthy food products will manifest itself in various ways, includ- ing increased consumption of functional foods and increased use of liquid fats ratherthan hardened fats. However, a further decrease in the consumption of vegetables isexpected, particularly among young people. The choice of healthy foods is a particu-larly impor tant point for elderly people who are more concerned about their health. Alongside the traditional healthy product s, their food choice will rely more on func- tional foods and enriched product s.Nevertheless, although the trend towards greaterOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 269consumption of functional foods will continue, their use is not expected to become a 'hype'. It is predicted that the majority of the Dutch population will remain reason-ably traditional in their eating habits, and will only turn to functional foods where a specific health problem exists. The high price of these products means that their pur-chase is largely confined to those from the higher socio-economic groups. One expert stated that post-war generations will be more open to the use of function- al foods. Because this generation of consumers has, in general, experienced few greatsetbacks in their lives, such as a war, their attitude is that they are entitled to every- thing, and hence also to solutions to all their health problems. However, this stand- point was not endorsed by the other experts. The desire for more convenience will lead to more consumption outside the home and, as stated in the section examining food supply, to increased purchase of productsdemanding little preparation time. This trend is primarily attributable to the group oftwo-income households, who have little time to prepare meals but who have more money to spend. The tendency towards convenience is also expected to be seenamong other groups ,such as senior citizens and singles . The trend towards greater variety is partly due to the increasing penetration of non- western foods as a standard part of the 'Dutch' dietary pattern. This may be ascribed to the increase in the number of citizens of ethnic origin ,as well as the increasing propensity to travel and globalization. The desire for greater enjoymen twill lead to increased consumption of high -qualit y products, particularly at weekends when there is more time to prepare an extensive meal .It will also lead to greater consumption of product swith an extremely distinct taste:verysweet ,verysalty, more fried than boiled. This trend will be particularly marked among children and young people, often prompted by advertising. The trends towards health, convenience, variety and enjoyment will also be combined within the same food choice of the same consumers. This will manifest itself, for example, in more 'healthy' convenience food. 9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2709.4 Effects on public health During the coming five to ten years, both major and minor changes are expected in terms of food supply and eating behaviour. What will be the effects of these changeson the health-promoting aspects of the diet, on the safety of food, and eventually onpublic health? 9.4.1 Will the Dutch diet be healthier ? Some of the expected developments in food supply and eating behaviour will have favourable effects on the Dutch diet. This is true of the increase in the number ofproducts with improved nutritional quality. In view of the increasing consumption of convenience foods, changes to the composition of these products will also have afavourable effect on the quality of the diet. The increased range of functional foods, and the resultant increase in the consump- tion of health -promoting bio -active subst ances may have a favourable effect on the diet of some specific target groups. However, the experts expect these foods to be con- sumed by only a minority of the population, and for a limited period. Wemay therefore speak of a positive developmen tin that there will be a larger range of foods which are appropriate to a responsible dietary pattern. However, un-favourable developments in the food supply and eating behaviour are also expected: developmen tswhich ,furthermore ,are likely to have a greater effect for the majorit y of the population. These developments are discussed in the following paragraphs. Although there is an increasing range of convenience food which is appropriate to a responsible dietary pattern, it is unlikely to have any favourable effect on publichealth unless extra efforts are made by the government and the private sector. When using convenience food, people eat less vegetables than recommended. Moreover, most convenience food contains relatively low quantities of dietary fibre and has a high salt ,fat or sugar content. In general, the range of flavoursome and, above all, energy-rich products (with little fibre) is increasing, and this is reflected in the consumption of such products. In addi-tion, portion sizes are becoming larger. This, together with a lower energy require- mentresulting from decreased physical activit y, means that ,apartfrom the nutrition - al quality of the food, the energy intake is too high. Much of the food consumed by children, teenagers and members of the lower socio-economic status groups in partic-ular is energy-rich and has a pronounced flavour, such as very salty, very sweet, morefried than boiled. Another reason to expect a less healthy eating pattern is theincrease in ' grazing' behaviour. This in itself need not have a negative effect provided 'healthy' products are consumed. However, it is expected that grazing will entail the consumption of more ' unhealthy 'products. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 271The consumption of energy-dense products will increase particularly in times of eco- nomic recession. The consumer will then switch to less expensive products. Within anumber of food groups, these are the 'unhealthier' foods, such as products with little fibre or with a high content of saturated fats. Because recessions are, in general, tem-porary in nature, the health effects are estimated to be slight. 9.4.2 Will food become safer ? The majority of experts expect that objective safety, measured using the standards currently in place, will either remain constant or will improve. However, the improve- ment will at best be marginal, given that food is already considered safe. One argument in favour of greater food safety is that manufacturers devote increas- ing attention to this aspect and, as previously stated, have or will implement a greaternumber of control systems. Companies which fail to do so will be less able to justify their existence. The control systems enable contaminations or situations in which thestandards are exceeded to be iden tified earlier ,whereupon in terventions can serve to limit the damage. The increasing attention for control systems will not be confined to the production processes of the companies concerned, but will also entail qualityrequirements for suppliers. Not all products will be checked but, based on business confidence ,an increasing number of qualit ycontracts will be entered into between manufacturers and their suppliers, involving random checking only, with the supplierdoing whatever is necessary to guarantee quality. The experts agree that this system will not provide a 100% guaran tee of product safet y.Past inciden tsshow that even cer - tified companies might be involved. Incidents can continue to occur in future due to (human) error or a deliberate breach of the rules .However ,these systems and the improved detection methods will render problems visible at an earlier st age,which may allow these problems to be tackled more quickly in future. Alongside these control systems, the use of decontamination techniques will also help to increase food safety. It is expected that this will enable the number of contamina- tions of poultr ywith Salmonella and Campylobacter to be greatly reduced. After all, if product ssupplied to the catering industry or to the consumer at home, for example, contain fewer microbiological contaminations, or none at all, then there will be fewercross-contaminations or food borne infections. Because companies increasingly devote at tention to food safet y, an increase in con - sumption outside the domestic situation and greater purchase of pre-prepared meals will improve food safety. With regard to the storage and preparation of food at homehowever, no favourable developments are expected, and food safety will remain aproblem (see section 4.2 ). This is particularly due to the fact that the consumer's knowledge about food and safet yis diminishing, due to a general decline in the trans- fer of knowledge about food and nutrition .Communication and the transfer of infor- mation will be essen tial in the con text of food safety, certainly with regard to new9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 272techniques. For example, where a food is packaged in a tin but does not have a partic- ularly long shelf life, this packaging method demands clear information to the con-sumer because the consumer will assume that the shelf life is similar to that of other canned products. Alongside these generally favourable developments in food safety, a number of experts expect some critical points to remain, and some new problems to emerge. Thelarge-scale nature of the food industry may lead to micro-organisms previouslyunknown in the Netherlands being imported, and may result in a longer average lead time of products which will increase the probability of the growth of undesired micro- organisms. There will also be products imported from countries which have a lower level of food safety control. However, due to the development of better control sys-tems which accompanies the expansion of scale, it must be possible to limit the conse- quences of these developments, for example by imposing more stringent require-ments on suppliers and by carrying out a greater number of checks. There may also be an increase in the number of new infections with viruses and bac- teria .New preser vation techniques and the reduction in preser vatives will lead to better quality (improved texture, nutrient content and sensory properties). However, the majority of new preservation techniques, like the conventional techniques, areconcerned with the bacteria responsible for decay. Little is currently known about how these techniques can con trol viral infection .Given that, in general, viruses do not survive well outside body cells, this is not seen as a major future problem. A num-ber of experts believe that a potential risk attaches to the storage in the shop of pre- prepared meals which have only to be warmed up at home .This is par ticularly the case if the temperature during the chilling and storage phases is not optimal, for example because the product sare held in open con tainers. In the United States, this situation has already led to an increase in the occurence of Clostridium perfringens .It is also conceivable that the milder preservation techniques will occasionally be insuf-ficient to counter pathogenic bacteria. Finally, climate change may also be respon- sible for an increase in fungal growth, with a danger of the formation of mycotoxins. The consumption of these mycotoxins can lead to liver damage and cancer (see sec- tion 4.3 ). One expert believes that an increase in the number of biological products will have no influence on food safety. In these products, some problems will occur less often, whileothers will occur more often, but the overall effect will remain similar to that of the regular product s. For the group of people using functional foods, the larger range of these food prod- ucts may result in too high a dose of a certain bio-active substance being consumed.In fact, the same danger may occur with natural flavourings, because these are alsoincreasingly added to foods beyond the usual natural matrix. The expect ation and hope is that this can be addressed by means of legislation requiring a reduction in thepermit ted dose ,or a reduction in the number of products to which the bio-active sub-OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 273stance may be added. However, while no such legislation is in place, this situation may cause problems (see also chapter 6 ). The increase in the use of functional foods may also create problems which are not always directly realized. The addition of a certain bio-active substance can, for exam-ple, alter the pH, and hence encourage the growth of bacteria. One example is orangejuice with extra calcium. To date, the problems associated with bio-active suppletiondo not appear to be serious. One point for attention further to these developments in food safety is that of con- sumer confidence. Increased knowledge, control systems and the large-scale market will render potential threats or incidents more visible. The large-scale nature of the(prevented) incidents makes them particularly newsworthy to the media. Consider- able media attention devoted to threats or incidents which have been promptly iden-tified and effectively resolved, can positively influence perception with regard to foodsafety. However, most experts expect that media attention will represent a negative influence for the time being. 9.4.3 Effects on public health Asstated in foregoing sections ,there will be a larger range of products which are in keeping with a healthy diet. The large supply and consumption of products which areless appropriate to a healthy diet, having high energy content, high salt and/or sugar content,too lit tle fibre and too few veget ables ,will however result in the diet of many Dutch people becoming 'unhealthier' (see textbox 9.1 ). This dietary pattern, in combi- nation with the trend towards less physical activit y, will have an unfavourable effect in terms of the preven tion of chronic diseases ,such as cardiovascular diseases and dia - betes. Accordingly, it is expected that the downwards trend in chronic diseases will continue to level out in future. Even in the short term, the effects of this dietary pattern, involving the wrong choices from the large range of product savailable, portions which are too large and little awareness of what one is eating ,will result in a high energy intake against an ever decreasing energy requirement due to decreasing physical activity. This will becomevisible as a marked increase in overweight within the population. A number of groupsare at higher risk in this regard, notably teenagers and young children. In addition, the group of elderly people, which is becoming larger, may also be identi- fied as a risk group. At a very advanced age, the sense of taste is reduced, which maylead to reduced overall consumption. This, together with a decrease in the absorptionof nutrients, can lead to inadequate nutrition in this group (see also chapter 2 ). Will the larger range of ' healthy' products have absolutely no effect? Examples from the past ,such as the in troduction of semi-skimmed dairy products, have made a posi-9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 274tive contribution to public health, the experts believe. It is quite conceivable that there will be more of this type of product modifications or substitutions in the future,further to the food industry's application of new knowledge about the relationship between diet and health. The improvement of nutritional quality without requiring amajor change to eating behaviour could therefore have a major effect on public health. However, whether this actually happens depends in part on consumer demand, and on the extent to which the government can exert pressure on thisdemand and/or on the supply side. The expected effects on public health of the increase in the number of functional foods available will, the experts believe, be limited due to the fact that the majority of the Dutch population will not quickly adopt the use of the new functional foods .The consumption of these products will largely remain restricted to persons with a higher socio -economic st atus. As a result, and because other healthy products in a number of food groups are more expensive ,there is a risk that socio -economic health differences could become greater. It is expected that the functional foods will also be used by the'trend followers'. However, these people are likely to find a new trend to follow quite soon, so they will not be long-term users. The exper ts also state that, within the group of functional food users, the consump- tion of the bio -active substance will indeed produce a favourable effect on a particular risk factor, but that the use of the functional foods will not necessarily result in longerlife expectancy. This is because little or no research has been carried out into thelonger-term effects of functional foods. Another reason for this observation is that some of the users will combine the consumption of functional foods with poor eating habits. Accordingly, little positive effect on public health is expected. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 275Textbox 9.1: Important developments in eating behaviour and the food supply which will determine whether diet becomes healthier or unhealthier. + More products in which the nutritional quality has been improved (e.g. in terms of amount and type of fat) + More functional foods + More healthy convenience foods - Greater supply and consumption of energy-rich products- Larger portion sizes- Greater consumption of convenience foods (very salty, very sweet, few vegetables)- More 'grazing' - More people who skip breakfast (including low SES groups) Teenagers, children and persons with a lower socio-economic status (SES) form a risk group due to their high consumption of energy-rich products and products with a pronounced flavour.Another impor tantconclusion is that our food will remain as safe as it is today, or will become slightly safer, whereupon any additional public health benefit from extra efforts in this area will be minimal (see textbox 9.2 ). Points for attention remain micro- biological contamination in the domestic situation, and possible new threats. One of these new threat sis the accumulation of a bio -active substance. It is not possible to state exactly what the effects of this accumulation will be in terms of public health.That depends on the added bio-active substance in question. Little scientific research has been carried out in this field . It is expected that these new threat s,such as the accumulation effects of contamina- tions due to the impor tofproduct sfrom abroad ,could possibly have an influence on food safety in the short term, but that these effects will eventually be mitigated by leg- islation and regulation, provided these are put in place. The group most at risk from microbiological contamination is that of the elderly. The generation which wen tthrough the Second World War is more inclined to save left- overs from the meal .In addition, resistance decreases with age, and the pH of the stomach alters. This group is therefore at greater risk of serious consequences fromintestinal conditions due to microbiological contamination. The increase in the num-ber of elderly people means that, in absolute terms, a greater number of problems associated with microbiological con tamination may be expected . An area which remains relatively unexplored, but which may be important to public health, is the role of viruses. The majority of viral infections result from transfer fromperson to person. However, due to globalization and perhaps also new preservationtechniques which may not always kill viruses ,viruses can easily spread across the entire world.

Especially young children, teenagers and persons with a lower socio-eco-nomic status form a risk group in this regard. To a lesser degree, the elderly also formarisk group in terms of possible inadequate nutrition and problems due to microbio- logical contamination. 9.5 Principles and recommendations for policy Compared to the public health problems which the current food policy is designed to address (see chapters 3 and 5), the experts do not foresee any major new public health problems or new risk groups. The future developments outlined above therefore donot reveal any major hiatus in food policy. However, it is necessary to consider whether current policy should be intensified, and if so, how. The experts attending one of the workshops assigned priority to the potential diet- related public health problems and the relevant principles for policy which arise fromthe projections made (see appendix 11 ). The discussion concluded that greater priority should be given to promoting a healthy diet than to food safet y, since food safet yis already considered to be very high. Eighty percent of all points were given to healthydiet. However, this does not detract from the necessity of efforts designed to maintain the curren tlevel of food safet y, nor from the fact that new problems demand an active response. In terms of healthy diet, the most important problem was seen to be an unfavourable energ ybalance .This was followed by an unfavourable fatty acid composition ,and a low consumption of fruit and veget ables ,with the resulting low intake of fibre. With regard to food safety, the problems cited were (in order of assigned importance): microbiological contaminations, consumer confidence and the accumulation effects of vitamins, minerals and bio-active substances in functional foods or dietary supplements. With regard to the principles for polic ylisted in appendix 11 ,major effect sare gener- ally expected from policy geared to changes in the food supply. However, this does notmean that policy measures should be restricted to this area. Indeed, a combinedapproach addressing both behaviour and the supply - and taking external factors such as the socio -cultural and economic set ting in to accoun t-has the greatest likeli - hood of success. For this reason, the importance assigned to principles for policy on the supply side and those on the behaviour side was almost equal. The principles and instruments for policy are described in greater detail below. First, the principles and instrumen ts with regard to the promotion of a healthy diet will be discussed ,followed by those targeting food safety. Finally, the principles with regard to consumer confidence are considered .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 2779.5.1 Healthy diet: principles for policy addressing supply One of the principles for policy is the improvement of the nutritional composition of products. This applies to the energy content, to the quantity of fruit and vegetablesincorporated in the product, and most importantly to the fatty acid composition. Theincreasing knowledge concerning diet in relation to health can be further applied inthe food production sector. Amajor effect on public health can be expected if the knowledge concerning diet in relation to health is applied to improve the composition of 'existing' products. Here, we may think of the reduction of the amount of added salt, the reduction of portionsizes, and the increase in the quantity of vegetables in each serving unit. The effect of these measures requires little behavioural change, and the entire population can bereached - including the lower socio-economic groups, elderly people and young peo-ple. An example from the past in which a similar approach had an effect on public health is the replacement of trans fatty acids in table spreads; without any change in behaviour on the par tof the consumer ,the in take of trans fattyacids was reduced (see section 2.5 ). In the future, the improvement of convenience food can be an important strategy since the consumption of such products will, after all, increase. Measures mayinclude increasing the quantities of fruit and vegetables included in these products and the use of improved fat t ypes in fried product s. Although there are already initia- tives to improve the composition of products, extra pressure on the food industryfrom the government and from society is required to stimulate such initiatives fur- ther.The governmen tcan do so volun taryagreemen tswith the vari- ous parts of the food sector, i.e. manufacturers, the catering industry, etc. The consumer 's food choice can also be favourably influenced by lowering the price . By means of subsidies in certain settings, such as in schools or workplace canteens, theprice of, for example, high-fibre products or fruit and vegetables could be lowered in order to favourably influence the fibre intake. When asked whether it would be appropriate to recommend increasing the price of 'unhealthy' products, the experts differed in opinion .There could be a good effect, but it also raises various objections such as practicalit yand ethical justifiability. In order to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables, the experts recommend various measures, including ensuring better availability, and developing products which are more convenien tto use .Solutions must be sought for the aspect swhich the consumer experiences as an obstacle, such as the inconvenience of preparing unwashed, unpeeled and unsliced fruit and vegetables, and the poor image ('notcool') that the consumption of fruit has compared to that of snacks. 9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 2789.5.2 Healthy diet: principles for policy addressing behaviour Asstated above, policy with regard to the promotion of a healthy diet must not only target the food supply, but must also address individual food choice. To allow the con-sumer to select more nutritionally adequate food in future, a number of principles forpolicy can be illustrated. Firstly, attention could be devoted to increasing knowledgeabout nutrition. The current trend is that children's knowledge about nutrition is pri- marily derived from advertisements. To counterbalance this, schools should offer more education about nutrition. Nevertheless, knowledge alone will not result in a different choice of food. This requires a broader approach. Changes must also be made to the nutrition information provided. To date, we have seen that communication with the consumer about healthy nutrition is extremely dif-ficult, and has done little to bring about the desired changes in eating behaviour. It is necessary to seek other forms of information, for example less complex informationmessages ,more positive coverage ,less traditional st atemen ts, a more accessible approach, and a move towards customized information via new channels. In doing so, new knowledge regarding behavioural change must be applied. Education can also be offered with simple information on packaging ,for example stating whether a product is appropriate to a healthy diet or not. Such an approachcould be used to offer the consumer some 'handholds' in his or her food choice. An additional effect is that the food industr ywould be encouraged to make healthy foods available on the market. 9.5.3 Safe food: principles for policy addressing supply Possible principles for policy to promote food safety, are the 'weak points' in the chain. Examples include the limited control of products which are directly imported from abroad ,microbiological contamination of products of animal origin, and conta- mination due to the use of new production methods .The task of the government could be to conduct research into such matters, and then implement measures inorder to resolve these weak points. Of course, inspection will remain important inorder to guarantee safety. 9.5.4 Safe food: principles for policy addressing behaviour Alongside changes on the supply side, changes in eating behaviour can be used to pro- mote food safet ytoo. Because a greater quantity of convenience food will be consumed, it is likely that in the future greater gains can be made with education concerning thestorage of food rather than with education about the risks during food preparation .OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 2799.5.5 Perception Apoint for attention within policy addressing food safety is consumer perception. The expectation is that the activities geared towards making food safer and healthier willalso have a favourable influence on perception, particularly if the processes are moretransparent and the information more honest. It will however be necessary to takeaction with regard to the manner in which information about food safety, as well asthat concerning a healthy diet, is communicated to the consumer (see also chapter 8 ). 9.6 Summary and conclusions The experts expect that the current trends in food and nutrition will continue over the next five to ten years. Despite an increase in the number of products that fit in ahealthy dietary pattern, such as foods with a better fatty acid composition or a specif-ic health-promoting component, the overall range of foods will not be any healthier. Assuming a further decrease in energy requirement, people will eat too often and,more especially, too much .Convenience will also play a major role ,leading to the more frequent selection of products with short preparation times, and to an increase in eating outdoors. One result of the preference for convenience food, without anychanges to its composition, will be a less healthy diet, especially given the excess intake of salt and sugar, with too few vegetables. If both the government and society exert extra pressure on the food sector as a whole to make convenience food health-ier, this unfavourable development can be reversed. In addition, our food is expected to remain as safe as it is today, or possibly slightly safer ,largely due to bet ter control systems and the use of decontamination techniques on product sof animal origin .However ,(microbiological) con tamination will remain a point for attention. This is related to incorrect storage and preparation habits on the part of the consumer, and to potential new threats, such as accumulation effects or the import of (new) contaminants in products from abroad. The new threats may emerge more often in the short term. However, it is expected that the amendment of legislation and stricter super vision will eventually reduce the risks. However, unbal- anced (media) coverage of the risks could have a negative influence on the perception of food safety. The developments in the dietary pattern outlined above, in combination with an ongoing lack of physical activit y, are expected to have a negative effect on public health, especially in terms of the number of people with overweight and chronic dis-eases. Teenagers, young children and persons with a lower socio-economic status are at particular risk. The expected developmen ts do not reveal any great hiatus in the current dietary poli- cy. According to the experts consulted, policy can however be intensified, especially with regard to the energ ybalance ,the fatty acid composition of the diet, and the con-9 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 280sumption of fruit and vegetables. In terms of food safety, action must be taken to address the threats which already exist and those which will emerge in the future. Ingeneral, the greatest effects on public health are expected from policy geared towards modifications to the food supply, such as the nutritional composition of foods. How-ever, a combined approach addressing both the food supply and eating behaviour hasthe greatest chance of success. Taking all expected developments into consideration, there is a major challenge for the government, the food industry and the consumer in the Netherlands. They must join forces to make the diet healthier and the food safer. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 9 281REFERENCE CBS. 2003; http://statline.cbs.nl.10 GENERAL SUMMARY AND H. Verkleij, A.G.A.C. Knaap The foregoing chapters have provided a detailed overview of current knowledge with regard to healthy diet and food safety in the Netherlands. Separate analyses of thehealth and safety aspects of diet and food were given, along with a consideration ofthe coherence between the two. If we now look back on all the information presented, anumber of questions are raised. Where are we now, and where are we going? What are the priorities for policy and action? Where do the opportunities lie? What has the government done, and what has it not done? What is still needed? This concludingchapter attempts to provide critical answers to these questions ( sections 10.1 to 10.5 ). Finally, section 10.6 lists a number of significant lacunae in current knowledge, with recommendations for further research. 10.1 Where are we now and where are we going ? a. Healthy diet: ... where are we now ? Chapter 2 revealed that our current eating habits are predominantly unhealthy. Not only do we eat too much (and therefore become over weight), but also the composi - tion of the diet is still too far removed from the recommended healthy diet. The mainproblems in this regard were identified as: 1. Overweight and obesity as a result of an improper energy balance (energy intake too high with respect to energ yexpenditure). Obesit yis an important risk factor for diabetes mellitus t ype 2, but also for cardiovascular diseases ,gall bladder dis - eases, disorders related to impaired mobility and various forms of cancer. More- over, the trend is currently unfavourable, whereby the increase in prevalence among young children is the greatest cause for concern. 2. Unfavourable fatty acid composition of the diet. This increases the risk of cardio- vascular diseases .Despite product improvements by the manufacturers and an increase in fish consumption ,only 5% of the Dutch population adheres to the recommended fatty acid composition. 3. Insufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables. This increases the risk of coro- nary heart diseases, stroke and some forms of cancer (lung, breast and stomach cancer). Here too there is an unfavourable trend ,with a 15-20% reduction in con - sumption over a ten-year period. An unhealthy diet accounts for considerable health loss: Overweight and obesity contribute approximately 50% to both the incidence of, and mortality due to, diabetes mellitus type 2. An unfavourable dietary composition is responsible for approximately 25% of the incidence and mor tality due to cardiovascu- lar diseases .Among the adult Dutch population aged t wenty and above, the totalOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 283annual health loss due to overweight and unfavourable dietary composition (calculat- ed separately for each factor) is approximately 40,000 new cases of late onset diabetes,cardiovascular diseases and cancer (40,000 new cases due to overweight as well as 40,000 new cases due to unfavourable dietary composition; the distribution of dis-eases differs between both factors). Unfavourable dietary composition contributesapproximately twice as much to the total mortality as overweight: 10% against 5% ofthe annual deaths in the Netherlands. If disease and mortality are considered in com-bination, using a weighing factor for the severity of the disease, the health loss due tooverweight and obesity is 215,000 DALYs, while that due to unfavourable dietary com- position is 245,000 DALYs. In addition to this directly attributable health loss, the contribution of the five dietary factors (saturated fats, trans fat, fish, fruit and vegetables) and overweight was also calculated by means of a dynamic model in which a 20+ population is simulated intwenty yearly stages. The results of this calculation confirm those of the 'directlyattributable health loss' approach, particularly with regard to the incidences of dis- eases .The mortality attributable to the five dietary factors and overweight is some- what lower ,mainly because this dynamic calculation provides for a number of years ' delay (depending on the disease) between incidence and death. A third calculation method used was the translation of disease burden and mortality in terms of lifeexpectancy. The effect on the average life expectancy of all Dutch people who are fortyyears of age, is a loss of 1.2 years in the case of unfavourable dietary composition and 0.8 years in the case of overweight. In calculating the tot al health loss due to an unhealthy diet ,the figures cited above for overweight and unfavourable dietary composition cannot simply be added together. Over weight is caused in par tby a lack of physical activity, while the diet-related com- ponen t(excessive energ yintake) par tially overlaps that of dietary composition. The exact extent of this overlap is unknown. Of the five modelled dietary factors, fruit and vegetables can help in weight reduction due to their high fibre content and low ener- gy density. The consumption of an excess quantity of energy-rich food is, however, not included in the modelled diet scenarios. Other investigators have recently published high mor tality figures (23,000 per year) attributable to 'all factors of an unhealthy diet' (Rougoor et al., 2003). The authors have based their findings par tly on data pub- lished by the RIVM (Van Oers, 2002), which have since been adjusted downwards inthe current report, particularly with regard to saturated fats (see also chapter 2 ,section 2.4). Moreover, the high mortality figures have to be regarded with a degree of scepti- cism in the light of the overlap bet ween the health factors and diet aryfactors used by the authors, as well as that between overweight and unhealthy dietary composition as awhole. Health gain to be achieved, in theory and in practice: The health loss is also the health gain that can be achieved ,in theory, if the entire Dutch population would suddenly achieve a normal body weight (B MI <25) and adhere to all the recommendations for a good diet. However ,even a par tial reduction10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 284inoverweight and partial improvements to the diet can yield a substantial health gain in practice (see chapter 2 ,section 2.4) .The results of small-scale intervention experi- ments targeting overweight and obesity reveal a health gain matching the middle scenario: a loss of 3 kg of body weight, being 1 BMI unit. This represents a health gainof approximately one quarter of the total incidence and mortality (56,000 DALYs)attributable to overweight. Dietary interventions matching the middle scenarios (alsoproven feasible based on small-scale interventions) can reduce the incidence of dis-ease and mortality attributable to dietary composition by one half (128,000 DALYs).Overweight seems a more difficult problem to resolve than that of suboptimal dietary composition, given the unfavourable trend and the more limited health gain to be achieved. b. Healthy diet: ... and where are we going? Current and future trends: The trends in fish consumption and the intake of saturated and trans fatty acids have been favourable in recent years. In the case of fat intake, this is largely due to product modification by the private sector. However, the trends in the consumption of fruitand veget ables have been unfavourable .When we look to the future ,the expect ation of the experts ( chapter 9 )is that the current developments in the food supply and in eating behaviour will continue during the coming five to ten years. Despite the fore-cast increase in the number of products which are appropriate to a healthy dietary pattern (e .g. products with better fatty acid composition and fewer energy-rich prod- ucts), the overall range of foods available will not become any healthier. This is due toanumber of factors, including the consumer's increasing preference for 'convenience' food,which does not yet meet the recommendations for a healthy diet. It is also expected that the prevalence of overweight and obesity will increase yet further. Given the curren ttrend, a 50% increase in obesity by 2020 seems likely, whereby this will remain the fastest growing diet-related public health problem .If the cited trends continue, life expectancy based on our calculations for forty-year-olds (assuming thatall other factors remain unaltered) will start to fall for the first time in many years. Functional foods and dietary supplements: Although semi -skimmed, low-fat and 'light' products have helped to improve our diet during recen tdecades, the functional foods containing specific bio-active ingredients are not the solution to the problems of an unhealthy diet. The consumption of func-tional foods and dietary supplements can only lead to a limited health gain for specif-ic risk groups such as children or elderly people with a suboptimal micronutrient sta- tus ( chapter 6) .Moreover ,the consumption of this t ype of product also raises a realistic probability of health loss due to the intake of an excess quantity of the bio-active ingredient, for instance via products in which doses are too high or through thecumulative effect of using various products simultaneously. Furthermore, the expertsexpect only a limited increase in the consumption of these products, partly due to thehigher price and par tly due to the smaller target groups (see chapter 9 ). OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 285c.Safe food: ... where are we now? From the information presented in chapter 4 ,it may be concluded that our food is cur- rently relatively safe and that it has indeed become demonstrably safer in a number of respects during the past decades. This can be ascribed in part to the successful policyof the government and the private sector. Accordingly, there is only a limited addi-tional health gain to be achieved in quantitative terms, as described in chapters 4 and 7.The most important problems remaining are: 1. Microbial foodborne infections. Each year, there are hundreds of thousands, and probably more than one million, cases of gastroenteritis attributable to contami- nated food. Foodborne infections caused by known pathogens are also responsible for several hundred cases of severe disease, such as toxoplasmosis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, with between 20 and 200 people dying from the consequences of afood infection each year. 2. Food allergies. It is estimated that 2% of the adult population suffer from some form of food allergy, while the figure rises to 6% among children. Most cases involve allergenic constituents in common foods such as shellfish, milk, fish,wheat ,peanut s,etc.It remains unclear whether the number of people with a food allergy is increasing, and to what extent the prevalence is influenced by a cleaner human environment (the hygiene hypothesis). The health problems caused by foodallergies can be rendered reasonably controllable by means of adequate labelling of foods . 3. Food incidents. Adequate risk assessment and risk communication with the con- sumer are the main problems. For good risk communication, an understanding of the consumer 's perception of risk is essen tial,and that perception must be t aken seriously. Moreover, good risk communication can serve to maintain or restore consumer confidence . Unsafe food accounts for limited health loss: Expressed in DALYs, the estimated health loss due to foodborne infections involving known pathogens is approximately 1,000 to 4,000 per annum. This is comparable to the health loss caused by AIDS or bacterial meningitis. However, this figure is probably an underestimate ,given the difficulty of quantifying the contribution made by food to the large number of gastroen teritis cases involving unidentified pathogens. Arough estimate of the annual health loss attributable to food allergies is 1,000 DALYs.However ,allergies must be regarded as a special case, given the specific target group involved. The effects are partly genetically determined, and hence vary consid- erably between individuals. They can also be avoided by means of a careful choice offoods. In the case of many other chemical constituents or contaminants in food, thehealth effect is not directly observable, and is therefore mainly theoretical in nature.Moreover ,the theoretical risk is frequently an overestimate, because exposure in excess of the norm will generally be only shor t-term, and due to the safety factors and/or conser vative method of risk assessmen tused (the latter is particularly relevant10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 286inthe case of genotoxic carcinogens). The estimated theoretical annual health loss attributable to chemical substances is therefore approximately 500 to 1,000 DALYs. The food incidents which have taken place in the Netherlands in recent years caused little or no health loss. However, each eroded consumer confidence in the govern-ment as the guardian of our food safety, and also eroded confidence in the integrity ofthe food industry. Contrary to some suggestions, there are no indications of any per-sistent or increasing lack of consumer confidence in food safety (Timmers & De Jonge,2004). Disquiet is greatest during food crises, and even then is partly due to poor com- munication. Better assessment of the actual health risk, together with more open and transparent communication of that risk to the consumer, can reduce or prevent any erosion of confidence. Unfortunately, however, adequate methods of risk assessmentare not always available, and the consumer's risk perception remains a more impor- tant factor within risk communication than the objectively calculated risk itself. d. Safe food: ... and where are we going? The experts' general expectation is that our food may become slightly safer than it already is ( chapter 9 ). This will be mainly due to fur ther improvemen tof the food chain control systems in all sectors, and to the expected application of microbial decontamination methods to products of animal origin. However, the experts do notexpect any decrease in microbial foodborne infections due to improper storage and preparation practice by consumers in the domestic situation .Rather ,it is assumed that the consumer's knowledge of food preparation and hygiene standards willdecrease. In addition, new threats may emerge due to the globalization of food production and sales market s.These new threats will continue to demand attention. Food safety will therefore become more vulnerable .The visible effect scould be new inciden tswhich will not be of any greater frequency, but which will be of greater volume. These inci- dents will give rise to an even greater requirement for adequate methods of monitor- ing and risk assessment, and for effective risk communication with the consumer. Risk communication must not only prevent any erosion of consumer confidence, but must ensure that the governmen tgains or regains the public's trust by remaining alert to inciden ts and by communicating openly and honestly about them. 10.2 Where do the priorities lie ? The priorities for policy will be determined by several factors, such as the potential health gain to be achieved, the current trends and expectations for the future, the fea-sibility of interventions, a well-considered balance between measures targetinghealthy diet and those targeting food safety, the costs of the measures, etc. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 287Potential health gain: If we consider the diet as a whole, the annual health gain to be achieved through improvements to the diet is many times greater than that possible through further improving food safety ( chapter 7) .In terms of favourable dietary composition alone, i.e. disregarding overweight, the maximum achievable health gain is approximately40 to 100 times greater than the total health loss due to unsafe food (245,000 against2,500-6,000 DALYs). Even the dietary interventions which are considered feasible willresult in a health gain which is many times greater (middle scenarios: 128,000 DALYs). This considerable difference also applies at the level of individual foods, as investigat- ed for fish, fruit and vegetables, wholegrain cereal products and human milk (breast- feeding). The health gain achievable at consumption levels which meet the currentnutrition recommendations (maximum scenario) varies from approximately 1,000 to 2,400 DALYs (for breastfeeding) to almost 100,000 DALYs (fish, fruit). Compared tothese figures, the risks presented by known contaminants, where quantifiable, are inmost cases a factor of 100 lower or totally negligible. For specific health-promoting foods (so-called functional foods) and dietary supplements, it is in most cases not yetpossible to make this t ype of quan titative comparison .This is mainly because the pos- itive health effects (health claims) have often not been proven, and because in most cases there is insufficient information concerning the possible negative effects of over-consumption. Moreover, the current consumption levels of products of this type in the Netherlands have not yet been clearly est ablished . The comparison presented in chapter 7 shows that the health loss due to unhealthy diet is similar to that due to smoking .Regarding unfavourable diet arycomposition (the five dietary factors together), this is in the same order of magnitude as that accoun ted for by positive energ ybalance (dietary factor for overweight) and too little physical activit y.Expressed in D ALYs, the descending order is: lifestyle (three lifestyle factors together: 445,000), smoking healthy diet (350,000 and 300,000-400,000), dietary composition (five dietary factors together: 245,000), positive energy balance (215,000), and insufficient physical activity (150,000). Trends, forecasts and the feasibility of interventions: The curren ttrend in overweight and obesity is unfavourable, while the trends in dietary composition, depending on the factor under consideration, are bothfavourable and unfavourable. If we assume that these trends will continue unabatedin the future then, like the middle scenarios, they can be projected to provide a calcu- lation of the achievable health gain (for the favourable trends) or health loss (unfavourable trends). Such a calculation would provide a more accurate indication ofthe potential health gain or health loss if policy remains unaltered. This calculationhas not been made in the context of this report, but it would provide useful supple-mentary input for future decision-making with regard to priorities for policy. At pre-sent, the prioritization incorporates current and future trends, mainly in a qualitative sense ,together with the results of the dietary interventions considered feasible (mid- dle scenarios). 10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 288Priorities for policy: Based on the above, but disregarding aspects such as the costs of interventions for the time being, the main priorities in terms of healthy diet and safe food can be identified as follows: Priority 1: The promotion of a healthy diet, with two sub-priorities: Reduction of overweight and obesity The calculations presented show that the maximum health gain which can be achieved through reducing overweight is not greater than the maximum health gain to be achieved through a healthy dietary composition. Nevertheless, the reduction of overweight is currently of the highest urgency, for various reasons.Firstly, the trend is unfavourable. Overweight and obesity continue to rise, and the increase is greatest among children and young people, which portends an evengreater increase in overweight-related problems in the future. Secondly, the seri-ousness of the obesity problem has not been adequately recognized for some time, despite warnings of a rising trend having been issued by the scientific communityas long ago as the early 1980s .Only in the last few years has obesit ybeen subject to attention at the international and national political level. The World Health Orga- nization (WHO) has recently declared obesity a global spearhead of policy, partlyinrelation to diabetes. Thirdly, the health loss which can be regained through fea- sible weight in terventions is relatively minor (25%). Great social efforts are there- fore required to ensure that the extent of the overweight problem in the Nether-lands does not increase further, and to prevent the American or British situation becoming a realit yhere too . Promotion of a health ydietary composition It would not be appropriate for diet arypolic yto focus solely on reducing over - weight. A good fatty acid composition, regular consumption of fish and adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables can prevent just as many cases of cardiovascular diseases and cancer as efforts to attain a good body weight. When we look at the health gain considered feasible in small-scale experiments, the effect of a good dietary composition (all five dietary factors together) is actually more than twice as great as that of reduced over weight. Some of these factors (saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids and fish consumption) now show a favourable trend, while the consumption of fruit and vegetables remains a cause for concern. In addition,there are a number of vulnerable groups for whom specific dietary problems demand at tention:the promotion of breast feeding for infan ts, and the problem of undernutrition and vitamin deficiencies among the very elderly, for example. Priority 2: The maintenance and, where necessary, improvement of the current high level of food safety It is clear that - based on the curren tsituation - the health loss due to unsafe food is many times smaller than that due to an unhealthy diet ary pattern. This is largely because an effective system of measures and con trol addressing food safet yhas beenOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 289developed over the past few decades. Clearly, this system must be maintained. How- ever, it is legitimate to ask what level of maintenance effort will be required in thefuture, in the light of current and new problems. Priority 3: Better risk assessment methods and better risk communication with the consumer Food incidents of greater or lesser extent will continue to occur in the future. Mal- practice ('villains'), human error ('idiots') and new surprises ('mistakes by MotherNature') will always be with us, whereby the zero-risk situation is unattainable. How- ever, in order to limit the impact of incidents, a better assessment of the actual health risk is required, as is better communication to and with the consumer about the risks. As the uncertainty regarding knowledge of the risks and the degree of social com-plexity (number of conflicting interests involved) increases, a more open social discus- sion will be required. 10.3 Where do the opportunities lie ? Having identified the priorities, we must then ask what the most promising strategies to address these priorities will be. This will largely be determined by our knowledge ofthe factors which influence the dietary problems concerned, the relevant principles for polic ythat can be derived from this knowledge ,the feasibility and returns of the measures, the costs involved, etc. Here, we must take into account the successes andfailures of the past, as well as scientific knowledge about behavioural change and risk perception . The approach to a healthier diet will be differen tto that in tended to prevent smoking According to the modern views on health promotion, prevention is more effective when an integrated approach is adopted. Such an approach not only addresses people directly about their behaviour, but also alters the physical and social environment in such a way as to support or discourage certain types of behaviour. This kind of inte- grated strateg ywas probably the success factor in the United States' approach to the smoking problem .Here, it was decided to adopt a combination of health education designed to help people stop smoking, pricing policy, measures restricting smoking inpublic places, legislation, and a modification of social norms. This involved coopera-tion between health institutes, the government, the private sector and the scientific field,with in terventions t argeting the settings which are important to both children and adults (e.g. schools and the workplace). Much can be learned from the interventions to counter smoking, but there are also marked differences between smoking and diet. In the case of smoking there is a clearand unequivocal message :smoking is bad for the individual and for others in the vicinit y. While overweight can occasionally cause inconvenience for others, perhaps due to increased absen teeism from work due to illness or greater pressure on medical10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 290and nursing resources, the main consideration with regard to our eating behaviour is that eating remains essential to survival, and will rarely if ever cause any damage tothe health of others. Accordingly, the government's relationship with the private sec- tor is different. In the case of smoking, the health-promoting government is opposedto the economic interests of the tobacco industry. In the case of food and diet, thehealth-promoting government needs the private sector to produce healthy productswhich are appropriate to a healthy dietary pattern, while the same government alsohas to contend with an industry producing and promoting unhealthy food products.Moreover, the healthy diet message is more complex than the non-smoking message, because the consumer must choose from a large and diverse range of foods which may have both favourable and unfavourable health effects. Nevertheless, the compar- ison with smoking does demonstrate how intensive and creative the investments inhealthy diet will have to be in order to bring about successful changes. Principles for a healthier diet Chapter 8 demonstrates that policies addressing a healthy diet should focus on factors which influence eating behaviour on the one hand, and factors that influence thefood supply on the other .In the case of eating behaviour this involves personal factors like attitudes to food and the perceived influence of the social environment. In the case of the food supply, the main factors are the diversity and quality of the range offoods produced, as well as their availability and accessibility. These two categories of factors are not unrelated. The food supply and other environ- mental factors appear to have a (largely indirect) influence on eating behaviour, via people 's attitude to cer tain foods .This at titude result sfrom a consideration of the assumed advantages and disadvantages, with expectations regarding taste, enjoy- ment,convenience and cost, and existing eating habits, being by far the most impor- tantdeterminan ts.Modifications to the food supply can therefore influence impor- tant environmental factors (availability, accessibility) and at the same time indirectly influence major individual factors (attitude). The most promising approach to achieve this seems to be by means of improvements to the aspects of taste, convenience and price, preferably in a way which is in keeping with existing eating habits. Examples are provided by the changes to eating behaviour achieved in the past with regard to brown bread ,semi-skimmed and low-fat dairy produce, and the 'light products'. The likelihood of such interventions proving successful can be further enhanced by using information and education to simultaneously address other personal factors, such as awareness ,knowledge and skills .This is impor tantin enabling the consumer to make an accurate assessment of his or her own eating behaviour, and to gain a bet- ter understanding of the short-term and long-term health effects of certain foods.Both will help to determine the willingness to alter eating behaviour. Principles for safer food Here ,the accent will be primarily on factors which influence the safety of the food supply, but some at tention must also be devoted to the consumer's eating behaviourOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 291(storage and preparation practice). In terms of the safety of the food supply, the entire food chain is important, from the raw material to the consumer product offered in theshops. The most promising approach is to increase food safety in the animal food chain, for example by including germicidal treatment methods, by good hygiene inthe primary production phase and in the last phase of processing or preparing thefood. In addition, improved quality control of (new) raw materials and productionchains provides the best opportunities for further improvement of food safety. With regard to storage and preparation practice, important opportunities are offered by greater knowledge and safety-awareness on the part of both professional food providers and consumers. Here too, information and education will therefore form important supplementary instruments for a successful approach to improving foodsafety. Translation into promising strategies for each priority, and consequences for the relevant actors The next question is how the optimum principles for policies regarding both eating behaviour and the food supply, as iden tified above ,can be translated in to promising strategies addressing the previously mentioned priorities concerning healthy diet and safe food. Of course, it must also be asked what the consequences for the relevantactors will be. First of all, it appears that each of the previously mentioned policy principles is impor- tant, to a greater or lesser degree, to the priorities stated, as is made clear by the brief explanation of each priorit yoffered below .The main differences are in the way they affect each of the various actors. After all, the private sector, the consumer and the governmen teach have a specific role in promoting healthy diet and safe food .Suc- cessful strategies must t ake this in to accoun t,and will therefore demand differen t activities on the part of each actor. This is examined in greater detail in section 10.5 . Reduction of overweight and obesity: Efforts to counter overweight and obesity must seek to encourage physical activity and reduce the consumption of foods (energ y-rich foods). The current trends under- line the impor tance of physical activity. On the diet side, three changes are required to ensure the success of this strategy: (i) modifications to the product supply, (ii)changes in temptation originating from the environment (setting), and (iii) a radicalchange in the attitude and eating behaviour of the consumer. Promoting a healthy dietary composition: Here, the principles for a successful strategy are mostly on the food supply side, but some also relate to the consumer's choice of food. The greatest opportunities seem tobe in terms of a healthier food supply which is also tasty and affordable, and whichmatches existing eating habit sas closely as possible. The 'healthy choice' can then be made the ' easy choice'. In doing so, the same three changes required to tackle obesity (cited in the previous paragraph) will be required .Pressure from the social environ -10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 292ment must bring about a change in attitude whereby unhealthy eating habits are seen as 'not done'. Maintaining and, where necessary, improving the current high level of food safety: Here, the emphasis is more on a safer food supply. In particular, the reduction of microbiological contamination of foods of animal origin and better hygiene practices in the preparation of food can result in substantial health gain. In addition, betterinformation about foods can enable the individual consumer to make an appropriatechoice, whereupon the intake of allergens and other harmful substances will be avoid- edor reduced to the greatest possible extent. Better risk assessment methods and better risk communication with the consumer: Alongside adequate protection measures, better risk assessment and risk communica- tion will form the cornerstone of a successful policy geared towards risk managementand crisis management, particularly in (future) food incidents and crises. The furtherraising of safety standards has little relationship with the existence or restoration of consumer confidence. Rather, effective risk communication is based on two-way traf-fic,and at tempt sto win trust by being open and honest. In this process ,the feelings and concerns of the public must be taken seriously, and the action that people them- selves can take must be explained (see chapter 8 ). 10.4 What has the government done and what has it not done ? Health ydiet As long ago as the 1980s ,the Dutch governmen tacknowledged that the diet arypat- tern has a marked influence on public health, and set itself the objective of encourag- ing a healthy (or healthier) choice on the part of the consumer. Dietary policy was pri- marily geared towards the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. At the time, the priority was on the role of fatty acids in the development of cardiovascular diseases .Investments were made in a regular Food Consumption Survey, and guide- lines for good nutrition were produced .The general aim (to encourage a healthy choice) has since been further defined to form quantitative policy targets for the gen-eral population, and since the mid-1980s for specific demographic groups as well. Based on the realization that the consumer must be allowed more or less complete freedom of choice from the range of foods available, the role the government hasadopted for itself is primarily that of creating preconditions, and providing informa-tion and encouragement. It wishes to 'seduce' the consumer into making a healthychoice, and has ever more emphatically chosen to do so in cooperation with otheractors including the private sector .It has been increasingly emphasized that the final responsibilit yfor making the healthy choice lies with the consumer himself or herself. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 293Itis only since the publication of the policy document Langer gezond leven ('Living longer in good health') in 2003 that there has been any explicit policy with regard tooverweight and obesity. Investments are now being made in research and knowledge development, and a national campaign has been launched. Since the latter half of the 1990s, various measures have been implemented and ini- tiatives launched to increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables and high-fibre prod-ucts. However, the campaign Goede voeding wat let je ('Good nutrition - what's stop- ping you?') did not lead to increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. On the contrary, a reduction in consumption has been seen. The promotion of breastfeeding has been part of dietary policy for many years, but until recently there was no quanti- tative target or public campaign. Safe food Food safety has always been subject to government attention. Partly in a European context, a considerable body of legislation has been passed and numerous standards have been adopted. Further to a number of incidents in the late 1990s, it wasacknowledged that polic ymust be made yet more stringen tand that the regulator y organization should be modernized. The emphasis was then shifted to the safety of the entire food chain, rather than that of the end product alone. Alongside consumerprotection, open communication with the consumer as well as reversing the erosion of consumer confidence became the main objectives .National polic ydevelopments are increasingly in line with European policy, by which they are very strongly influ-enced. The Dutch government further complied with European developments by establishing the F ood and Consumer Product Safet yAuthorit y(VWA), thus rendering supervision more effective while also improving communication with the consumer. With regard to microbiological food safet y, the general polic yof recen tyears has been concerned with reducing foodborne infections, with specific policy targeting a number of selected pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. In the field of chemical hazards, particular attention has been devoted to food hypersensitivity (allergenic food constituents). Relative effor ts directed to a healthy diet as against food safety Ifwecompare policies addressing a healthy diet to those targeting food safety, the first observation is that the two topics were addressed in tandem during the 1980s,but much less so in later years. The two areas of policy became more or less indepen- dent. The second obser vation is that the governmen tcalled for greater at tention to healthy diet in one period (e.g. the early 1980s), and to food safety in another (e.g. in the late 1990s, partly under pressure from recent incidents). The exact degree to which policy addressing a healthy diet has been effective remains unclear ,but it has certainly been less effective than that targeting food safety. In recen tdecades, food safety policy has been reasonably successful. It is now justifiable to ask what level of regulation and effor tis required to main tain the current high10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 294level of protection. However, it is not yet clear whether current food safety policy is adequately prepared for all future developments (see chapter 9 ). What has the government not done, or not done well enough ? The analysis in this report leads to the conclusion that the promotion of a healthy diet (i.e. prevention of overweight and encouragement of a healthy dietary composition)deserves a higher priority than has hitherto been the case. However, this must not beat the cost of the current protection level for food safety. While healthy dietary com-position has been a feature of government policy for some time, obesity has become an explicit priority of prevention policy only in the government's most recent policy documents. However, by adopting this prioritization, the government now runs the risk that the considerable influence that a healthy dietary composition has on chronicconditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer is in danger of being overlooked. In the area of obesity (and healthy diet) the government has now opted for a preven- tive approach, working alongside a broad coalition of stakeholders, to address bothlifest yle and environmen tal factors which encourage a good diet and sufficien tphysi- cal activity. In the discussions with parliament, the emphasis has been firmly on the consumer's personal responsibility and on the voluntary cooperation of the privatesector. This is contrary to the causal analysis of the experts, who place a strong emphasis on the physical and social environmen tincluding factors such as the exces - sive and omnipresent food supply, and the social pressure exerted by advertising andthe individual's direct personal sphere. The consumer is in effect confronted by an environmen twhich encourages unhealthy eating behaviour ,and which therefore pre - sents a message diametrically opposed to that of the government. It remains unclear what strateg ycan be used to make the consumer more resist ant to these influences. The governmen tcould and should do far more in this regard ,perhaps by imposing conditions for a healthy diet in a more explicit manner. 10.5 What is still needed ? What is now required in order to address the four priorities successfully, and what is the role of the three parties most closely involved: the private sector, the consumer and the government? 1. The private sector The private sector must do more in terms of healthy and safe food. This is possible by such means as: Healthier food supply and less advertising for unhealth yproducts: The cause of the increase in obesit yis, in addition to insufficient physical activity, the excessive supply of (energ y-rich) food in shops, school and workplace canteens, andOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 295advertising for unhealthy foods. Convenience, taste, price and habit are the main fac- tors which determine the consumer's eating behaviour, and which the private sectorcan use to promote a healthy diet. The recently revised policy of the Federation of Netherlands Food Producers (VAI/FNLI, 2004) and the accompanying code of conductwith regard to advertising and promotional activities, does not do enough to addressthese points and can therefore be improved: The private sector should be (even) more restrained with regard to advertising (particularly that targeting children) and in the sale of unhealthy products inshops and especially in school, workplace and sports club canteens. At the same time, the private sector should do more than has hitherto been the case to ensure better availability of foods which are appropriate to a healthy dietary pattern, and having portion sizes which are not too large. Healthy foods should be cheaper, or in any event no more expensive than existing products, when introduced onto the market in order to reach large groups of con-sumers. In particular, ways should be sought to reduce the price of fruit and veg-etables and other high-fibre products such as wholegrain cereal products. Improved product composition and innovative product modifications: There are many opportunities to make the 'healthy choice' the 'easy choice' by means of product modification, without requiring the consumer to make drastic changes toeating habits or choice of foods. Indeed, some product modifications require absolute- ly no change in consumer behaviour .Examples from the past include the addition of iodine to salt and the modified fatty acid composition of margarines. The consumer'schoice need not be restricted, but there are excellent possibilities to offer a varied package of foods to appeal to ever ytaste. Examples for the future include the addition of more vegetables to convenience foods (such as pizzas and pre -prepared meals) and to the menus of rest aurants, the use of improved fat t ypes for fried product s,and the developmen tof functional foods and dietary supplements for specific risk groups. Improvement of food safety, partly in the light of new circumstances: Two aspects will be of particular importance in the future: the enhancement of food safet yin the animal food chain (by such means as good hygiene in the primary pro- duction phase and in the final preparation phase) and improved qualit ycontrol of (new) raw materials and production chains. Manufacturers of animal products must do more to reduce contamination with pathogens. Alarge propor tion of foodborne infections can be preven ted by good storage prac - tice and hygienic preparation of animal products in professional kitchens. The pre- vention of cross-infection between animal products and other food types is of par-ticular importance. Raw materials and food ingredients should be traceable throughout the entire pro- duction chain ,in order to enable the cause of any incident or calamity to be identi- fied as quickly as possible .Fruit and vegetables may present a particular challenge in this regard ,due to globalization .10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 296New technological developments which will improve food safety, such as the decontamination of foods of animal origin to reduce foodborne infections, shouldbeintroduced as quickly as possible provided they have been shown to be effective and to be free of any harmful side effects. The private sector should continue the policy line of removing food which is con- sidered unsafe from the shops as quickly as possible, and of communicating openlyabout such product recalls. Improved provision of consumer information: Clear information by such means as labelling addressing health and safety aspects can help the consumer to make a good choice, both from the point of view of a healthy diet and that of food safety (allergy). New and inventive forms of education, information and labelling are required to make it easier for the consumer to quickly obtain the desired information about afood. The current forms of labelling do not work as well as they could. The information and education should take the consumer's risk perception into account. 2. The consumer Consumers must become more aware of the advantages of a healthy diet, the disad- vantages of overweight and an unhealthy diet, and the importance of hygienic food preparation. Hereto, a considerable change in the consumer's attitude is required.This demands: A'cultural turnabout': The consumer and his or her en tire social environmen tmust become aware that health yfood can also be enjoyable ,and that an unhealth ydiet and overweight can be responsible for considerable health loss and inconvenience. Such a 'cultural turn-about' should not, however, be based on a stigmatization of people suffering from overweight. The consumer is personally responsible for his or her behaviour and, taking per- sonal health in to account, must actively choose to avoid overeating and to engage in sufficien tphysical activity. In doing so, the consumer can adopt a number of simple rules from the nutritional guidelines as the guiding principles (do not eat too much, eat a varied diet, useliquid fats in the kitchen, eat sufficient quantities of fish, fruit and vegetables, and wholegrain cereal product s). The consumer must also critically assess new health claims made by the private sector and new risk warnings from the scientific field. This will be facilitated if con-sumer organizations represent interests more directly, since the consumer actingalone will not be able to do so. The consumer must realize that 100% safe food does not exist, and that he himself forms the final link in the food safet ychain. The consumer is directly responsible for the obser vance of the safe storage periods for food ,good hygiene in the kitchenOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 297toprevent cross-contamination, and ensuring that animal products in particular have been adequately heated. Alongside awareness and information, skills are also important: The consumer can only take responsibility if he has sufficient knowledge about healthy diet and safe food. But knowledge alone is not enough, skills are also needed.Given the importance of diet to public health, investments must be made. For the consumer to be able to fulfil his role, he will have to acquire the skills required to put the knowledge into practice, including the ability to resist seduc- tive advertising or social pressure. Education, information, awareness and the pro- motion of confidence in one's own skills are required. This places a considerable emphasis on consumer and educational organizations, but also requires the market parties to provide clear, objective and comprehensive information about the composition, nutritional value and health effects of prod-ucts. Consumer organizations must remain alert to food safety aspects but must also place an equal, if not greater, emphasis on unhealthy diet and the manner inwhich the food supply, adver tising ,education and information ,the social and physical environment and the consumer contribute in this regard. 3. The government Healthy diet, efforts to counter obesity and the promotion of food safety are collective interests. The government therefore has a task to fulfil: Legislative measures can also be useful in promoting a healthy diet: Inthe area of healthy diet ,the governmen tis very much more restrained and leaves more to the social field of influence than in the area of food safet y.In food safet y, there is extensive use of legislation, sanctions, control and supervision. In the area of healthy diet, voluntary agreements and education are the preferred policy instru- ments. This can be explained in terms of the principle of health protection which applies to food safety, but the analysis in this report makes it clear that the promotion of healthy diet also requires strong pressure from the governmen tand society. If incentive policy instruments or voluntary agreements with the private sector provide insufficient returns, legislation can also be an essential resource, withregard to advertising targeting children for example, or the food supply availablein school canteens and public places. The approach used to counter smoking can provide an example . New safety risks demand a new approach: In the field of food safety, the government's attention is focused increasingly on the safety of the entire food chain, with responsibilities for all parties including the con-sumer ,and on crisis management. In addition, the maintenance of consumer confi- dence in food safet yhas been high on the political agenda in the last few years. The governmen tcannot limit it self to a strategy which is only concerned with increasing10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 298food safety by means of ever stricter standards and safety norms, but must implement abroader strategy in order to maintain consumer confidence in food safety. In the event that the health risks of certain microbiological or chemical contami- nants in food are extensive or uncertain, or where the social interests are great, itis important to conduct a broad social discussion. By involving the consumer moreclosely in the social decisions which must be taken, and by increasing the trans-parency of government policy, greater support for the food safety policy can beobtained. In order to provide greater substantiation for the health claims made for func- tional foods, and to protect the consumer against false claims, manufacturers must be required to provide more substantial evidence in future. European legislation in this regard is currently in preparation. The methodology for the quantitative com-parison of beneficial and adverse effects must also be further developed. In view of the globalization of food supply flows, better methods must be devel- oped to ensure the traceability of food sources. This is particularly so in the case ofimported foods, both from within and beyond the European Union. The govern- ment can expedite this process with incentive measures, legislation and adequatesuper vision . 10.6 Gaps in the knowledge and recommendations for monitoring and research Nutrition and food research in the Netherlands ranks highly at the in ternational level . This report was only made possible by the availability of a large number of informa- tion sources ,which allowed the main question regarding the positive and negative health aspect softhe Dutch diet to be answered ,at least in outline .However ,many questions remain unanswered, or only partially answered. This is due to gaps in the current knowledge and a lack of continuity in the provision of information on the one hand, and due to the scope of the report and new topics which will demand attention in future on the other. The large and increasing impor tance of diet in terms of public health demands an appropriate monitoring and research strategy. The guiding principle of the followingrecommendations is the question of which type of research is necessary to monitorthe current status of diet and health in the Netherlands, and which research can help to alleviate the problems iden tified in the field of unhealthy diet and unsafe food . The National Food Consumption Survey and related databases remain essential in keeping a finger on the pulse To implement an adequate dietary policy it is necessary to have information regard- ing the food consumption and nutritional st atus of the Dutch population as a whole, as well as those of cer tain demographic groups. Three National Food Consumption Surveys have been conducted in the past (1987-1988, 1992 and 1997-1998). WithoutOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 299theinformation gained in these surveys, this report could never have been written. In the light of changing policy requirements, socio-demographic developments, trendsineating habits and developments in research methods, a new food consumption sur- vey system is now needed. In 2003, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sportcommissioned a limited food consumption survey (NFCS-2003) as the first movetowards a new system. The results of this survey became available at the end of 2004.It is, however, unclear when and in what form the new food consumption survey sys-tem will be implemented. For the future, it is important that the food consumptiondata remain available on a regular basis. In this light, a number of revisions are also desirable: In order to investigate the causes of the current increase in overweight, the Nation- al Food Consumption Survey should devote greater attention to the monitoring ofbody weight and body fat. Efforts should also be made to establish whether it is possible to measure energy expenditure or the level of physical activity at the sametime. The scope of the National Food Consumption Survey should be expanded to include the topic of functional foods and health products. To date there has beenlittle or no insight in to the consumption of functional foods and (high dosage) dietary supplements. The risks involved are insufficiently known and the expecta- tion is that consumption will increase. As in the limited 2003 survey, future National Food Consumption Surveys should be adapted to render them suit able for examining issues of microbiological and chemical food safety. Special attention is required with regard to the origin,method of production and preparation of foods, and the number of days during which information relating to diet is collected . The food consumption of a number of specific demographic groups is not ade- quately known because some groups included in the previous sur veys are not rep - resen tative or are not adequately represen ted.Accordingly, there is a requiremen t for specialized consumption surveys among specific demographic groups such as ethnic minorities and expectant mothers. Monitoring, research and risk assessment rely on supporting databases such as the Netherlands F ood Composition Table (the 'NEVO table') and the databases of harmful chemical constituen micro-organisms in food (the KAP and KRIS databases). To make the best possible use of the information derived from the National Food Con-sumption Survey, it is necessary to ensure good coordination with these supportingdatabases, and the quality and continuity of these databases must be guaranteed. However ,the financing of these dat abases is curren tly problematic . Research into the relationship between diet and health: new spearheads The findings and policy recommendations of this report are based to a large degree on national and international scientific research into the effects of diet on health.However ,much remains unclear about the strength of the evidence for the health effect sof specific dietary factors. Continuation and encouragement of this research is therefore desirable .10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 300The influence of dietary factors and of physical activity on the energy balance is an important research theme in view of the increase in overweight. The influence of diet on health has not been subject to the same degree of research for all dietary factors; encouragement of this research can reduce current uncer-tainties (such as that concerning the influence of fruit and vegetables) and canidentify new food constituents which may have a positive or negative influence onhealth. Given the increasing knowledge of the genetically determined characteristics of humans, in the future further questions will be asked with regard to the individual validity of dietary recommendations. In terms of dietary policy, it is therefore important to have a knowledge of the interaction between dietary factors and genetic characteristics, and about their influence on health. Research into food safety: many questions remain unanswered There are still many gaps in knowledge in the field of food safety. Despite intensive research into microbiological food contaminations, the significance in terms of public health is not yet adequately clear. For example, the cause of two thirds of all cases ofgastroen teritis remains unknown ,as does the con tribution of food in this regard com - pared to that of other sources. Our understanding of the emergence of severe diseases and death due to foodborne infections is also fragmentary. Accordingly, furtherimprovement of surveillance is required, complemented by specific etiological studies .For the purposes of quantitative risk assessments, a broad overview of the inci- dence of pathogenic micro-organisms in the food chain is needed, particularly interms of the number of such micro-organisms in or on contaminated products and the degree of variation therein .Special at tention must also be devoted to the shif ts resulting from trends such as organic farming, climate change and technological developmen tssuch as mild preservation techniques. Given the complexity of the risk assessmen tswhich result sfrom the length and expanse of the food chain as a whole , the research strategy must focus on the most vulnerable parts of the chain, or on those parts in which considerable health gain can be achieved. Examples cited else- where in this report include: Various pathogenic micro-organisms such as zoonotic bacteria, viruses and toxino- genic bacteria . The zoonotic transmission of viruses. Quantity and safety of imported food. Risk management for unprocessed, raw foods and beverages. Risk perception and consumer behaviour in relation to hygienic food preparation. There are also gaps in the knowledge regarding chemical food constituents and cont- aminants. For example, there are many questions concerning the assumed increase infood allergies and food intolerances. These make a stimulatory research strategydesirable. Aspects such as the possible relationship between hygiene (lifestyle),immune st atus and food allergy should be addressed. In addition, the Health Council of the Netherlands is soon to issue an advisor yreport on food allergy. As in the case of the National F ood Consumption Sur vey, it is important to ensure the continuity of theOUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 10 301relevant databases, such as the allergens database ALBA, which plays a vital role in providing consumers with information about the presence of allergenic substances infoods. For some time, it has been acknowledged that better assessment of the actual health risks raised by food incidents and food crises is necessary. The use of the benchmark-ing approach could enable better use to be made of the available dose-effect infor-mation, and hence better risk assessment. Using the probabilistic exposure and effectassessment it will be possible to quantify both the uncertainties and the likelihood of effects becoming manifest among the population with a greater degree of accuracy. Research into the chemical contamination of food has thus far been almost exclusive- ly conducted on individual substances, while there is also concern about the cumula- tive effects of the contaminants in the total diet. This is a new - and expensive - line ofresearch which can only be conducted in the international context. Research into better detection methods to trace the current generation of genetically modified foods or ingredien tsis not so much desirable from the poin tof view of food safety, but is more important in terms of answering the consumer's demand for infor- mation about the presence of genetically modified organisms or derived ingredientsin foods. Research into the balance between positive and negative health effects is primarily of importance with regard to new foods, but also for recommended common foods In the case of new foods such as functional foods and dietary supplements, a balanced comparison of the positive and negative health effect sis difficult or impossible to achieve due to the paucit yof information .In the case of the recommended common foods, such a comparison leads to the conclusion that the health advantages outweighthe disadvantages many times over. However, a number of aspects remain which should be subject to further specific research: Research is required into the health effects and health risks of new foods, such as the bio -active ingredients in functional foods and dietary supplements. Certain recommended common foods can also have adverse health effects, partic- ularly for 'heavy users' or other vulnerable groups. A more accurate assessment ofthis phenomenon should be made. An in tegrated consideration of the health effect sof the diet demands improved mathematical modelling In this report, the health effects of a healthy or unhealthy diet, other lifestyle factors and intervention scenarios have been quantified using mathematical models. Boththe robustness of the input data and the modelling method itself should be improved.In any even t, the following should be subject to further research: How the selection of epidemiological information can be optimized. How the calculated result sof the intervention scenarios can be compared and10 OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 302interpreted more effectively How the uncertainty of the outcomes can be assessed and expressed most clearly. Research into the determinants of the consumer's eating behaviour and the food supply by the private sector and other actors should be given high priority Despite uncertainties and lacunae in the knowledge, much is known about healthy and safe food. Nevertheless, many people find it difficult to put the various messagesabout healthy diet and food safety into practice. Moreover, the number of people withoverweight continues to increase. Further research into the factors which influence eating behaviour is therefore essential in rendering dietary policy more effective and should be accorded high priority. The same applies to research into the possibilities (and impossibilities) for encouraging the private sector and other actors to offer ahealthier and safer range of foods. Research into the effectiveness and costs of dietary interventions falls outside the scope of this report but is nevertheless of major importance in terms of policy An exhaustive evaluation of the experimen tal,small -scale dietary interventions and of the cost aspects involved did not form part of this report's original terms of reference. However, aspects of the interventions and their costs are relevant in terms of policy. Further to this report, there is therefore a requirement for: An inven tory and analysis of successful interventions and experiments, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere, targeting overweight and healthy diet, together with an evaluation of the possibilities for implementing similar interventions on a larger scale . Research into the costs of interventions designed to promote a healthy diet and safe food (or the cost sof not implemen ting measures), so that these can be includ - ed in determining polic y.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH P .)

In drawing up the table, an attempt was made to restrict its contents to those symptoms and clinical disorders which cause the greatest disease burden. At the present time, it is not possible to provide quantitative evidence to support this selec- tion. However, the table does make clear that pathogens in food often give rise to gastroenteritis. It also shows that other, often severe, symptoms can also occur.

For further informa-tion, see textbox 2.5 and appendix 12 .In the Public Health Forecasting report for all infectious diseases, a distinction is drawn between diseases with a complicated course, and those with an uncomplicated course. The weighing factors applied are based on annual profiles, i.e. a year in which an episode of the disease is experienced. For con-ditions of the stomach and intestines, the duration of an uncomplicated episode is taken to be one week, while that of a complicated episode is two weeks. In derivingthe weighing factors, a year with one episode of uncomplicated course was assigned aweight of 0.00, while a year with one episode of complicated course was assigned a weight of 0.03. It is assumed that a complicated course is synonymous with a visit tothe general practitioner .As may be seen from appendix 6 ,there are approximately 25,000 medical consultations further to food infections and intoxications, represen- ting a disease burden of 750 DALYs per annum. The Centre for Public Health Forecas-ting report assumes that one death due to gastroenteritis will represent an average loss of 8.5 life years ,being the equivalen tof 170-1,700 DALYs per annum where the mortality rate is between 20 and 200. In total, the disease burden is therefore 1,000-2,500 DALYs per annum. The calculation method used in tables 4.5 and 4.6 deviates slightly from the method described above. Here, the derivation of weighing factors does not rely on annual pro- files but on the actual duration of the illness .This method has been used in various situations ,including the ' Global Burden of Disease 'study (Murray, 1994), and in an estimate of the disease burden due to environmental pollution published by the RIVM (De Hollander et al., 1999). The weighing factors in this approach are 0.066 for an uncomplicated course and 0.39 for a complicated course. Assuming the same dura- tions as stated above, the disease burden for an uncomplicated course is then 350-900 DALYs, while that for a complicated course is 380 DALYs, a total of 700-1,300 DALYs. If the disease burden due to mor tality is included, the estimate then becomes 900-3,000 DALYs. In fact, there are indications that deaths due to bacterial food infections occurat an earlier average age than suggested by the figures produced by Statistics Nether-lands (CBS). Mangen et al.(2004) calculate an average loss of 14.3 life years due to campylobacteriosis .This would result in a tot al loss of 290 to 2,900 life years ,plus 700 to 1,300 disease-year equivalents, or approximately 1,000 to 4,000 DALYs. There is therefore considerable uncertainty with regard to the disease burden due to food-borne infections and intoxications, partly due to methodological factors and partly tothe restricted information available (for relevant literature, see chapter 4 ).APPENDICES OUR FOOD, OUR 326Appendix 11: Prioritizing principles for policy List of possible principles for policy which has been ranked by experts according to priority.

Literature . 12.1 Calculation of the directly attributable health loss The directly attributable health loss (or gain) has been calculated for each disease by multiplying the so-called 'potential impact fractions' (PIFs; Gunning-Schepers, 1988) by the effect measure involved. The PIFs describe the proportional reduction in the number of new cases of a disease due to alteration of the risk factor distribution accor - ding to the alternative scenario (compared to the reference scenario). The formula used is: PIF = i(RRi-1) index over risk factor classes, pref(i), palt(i): prevalence fractions in risk factor classes according to the reference and alternative distribution respectively; RRi:relati- ve risks of incidence of the disease for risk class I with increased risk compared to theclass with normal risk (so, RR 1=1). When adopting the alternative distribution in which ever yone falls into the class with lowest risk (maximum scenario) the well- known formula for the P opulation Attributive Risk (PAR) emerges, whereupon the PIF becomes the P AR.The formula for calculating a PAR is: OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH APPENDICES 327PAR = [Pe(RR-1)] / [Pe(RR-1) + 1] where Peisthe fraction of the population within which the risk factor is present. In the case of attribution to a combination of risk factors, the prevalences are consideredtobe mutually independently distributed, and the relative risks multiplicative, i.e. no interaction. In the case of incidence, the effect measure chosen is the number of newcases of a disease, while for mortality the effect measure is the number of deaths, andfor DALYs it is the number of lost life years, adjusted for quality of life. Mortality figu-res are calculated by multiplying the incidence figures by the proportion of cases of the disease which later result in death. The adjusted life years are calculated by mul- tiplying the incidence figures by the sum of the lost healthy life years during the cour- se of the disease and the total number of lost life years following death. The durationof the disease and the remaining life expectancy at death are calculated according to the 'life table' method. All calculations are first carried out specified by age and gen-der. The age-specific attributable figures thus achieved are then aggregated acrossthe age categories. The division of the attributable figures by the total effect figures (new cases of disease, mortality figures and lost DALYs respectively) results in the pro-portional at tributions presen ted. In the attribution of health loss (or gain), the same model parameters are used as in the 20-year through-calculation of the Chronic Diseases Model (see section 12.2 ), i.e. the initial risk factor class prevalence fractions ,the one -year disease incidence frac- tions and the relative risks. These calculations do not use risk factor class transitionfigures as in the 20-year modelling. Other differences compared to the 20-year model- ling are that the risk for one par ticular disease is only dependen ton the presence of the risk factor, not on other diseases. For example, in the 20-year calculation, over- weight (B MI) has both a direct effect on coronary heart diseases and an indirect effect via diabetes mellitus t ype 2. In the at tribution ,only the direct effect is t aken in to account. Note: The supplementary DALY estimates for breastfeeding and childhood asthma pre- sented in section 7.2 do not present the attributable numbers of new cases of disease, but are based on the number of existing cases of disease (see appendix 12.7 ). 12.2 Description of the Chronic Diseases Model In the Chronic Diseases Model (Hoogenveen et al., 1998), a population group is distri - buted over the various risk factor classes, and according to whether or not the mem-bers of that group suffer from the diseases under consideration. These distributions are age and gender specific. The demographic composition used is based on statisticspublished by CBS(Statistics Netherlands); the initial prevalence rates and incidence rates of the diseases are based on the records and repor ts of general practitioners. Other sources have been used in the case of cancer :the IKZ(Comprehensive Cancer Centre South) for the initial distribution and the NKR (Netherlands Cancer Registr y)APPENDICES OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 328for incidence risks (see Van Oers, 2002). The initial distributions of the risk factors are specified based on the current prevalences within the Dutch population or on thebasis of the expected or desirable distributions. The initial distributions for all risk fac- tors are assumed to be independent (see appendix 12.4 ). The model covers a specified number of years, in this case 20 years. In each successive year, a proportion of the population will move from one class to another. Changes in the age classes occur because of ageing. Changes in the risk factor classes can be specified (based on knowledge of beha- vioural relapses or of changes related to ageing, for example). Changes in disease status (e.g. the change from being well to being ill) are depen- dent on disease-specific incidence risks in combination with the relative risks ofdisease for the various classes of the risk factor concerned. Both the presence of a certain lifestyle factor as well as the presence of a disease can be a risk factor. Thelifestyle factor can therefore increase the risk of disease both directly and indirect-ly. For example, consumption of fish influences the risk of acute myocardial infarc- tion and other coronary heart diseases. People suffering from another coronaryheartdisease have a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction .Due to this indirect effect, the relative risks in later life are, in some cases, slightly lower than those pre- sent at a younger age (see appendix 12.5 ). The disease-specific incidence risks are derived from general practitioners' reports and the cancer registries .The relative risks used are based on the literature (see appendix 12.5 ). Where relevant and possible, these figures are age and gender spe- cific. The relative risks used are assumed to be multiplicative, i.e. that there are no interactions .In the modelling ,no accoun thas (yet) been t aken of the ' lag times ' between a change in a risk factor and the incidence risks of diseases. For individuals suffering from one (or more) of the diseases under consideration, changes in vit al status are determined by disease -specific mor tality risks. In addi- tion, for all individuals, changes in the vital status are determined by mortality risks derived from other causes of death. The disease-specific mortality risks are derived in part from the literature and are in part calculated based on the course of prevalence figures by age. The mortality risks for the diseases considered are therefore indirectly dependen ton the risk factors, via the risk factor-dependent incidence risks ,and then via the disease-specific mortality risks. Accordingly, the effect of changes in the dietary factors on mortality is delayed. The health outcomes are the numbers of new cases of disease (incidences) and morta- lity, and the age -dependen tdisease and mor tality fractions. The latter can be used to calculate the (disease-free) life expectancy. For this calculation, the model must be run for the number of years until all members of the initial cohort have died. OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH APPENDICES 32912.3 Explanation of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) Invarious chapters of this report, the health loss due to certain diseases or risk factors is expressed in DALYs. The use of this unit of measure renders various types of healtheffects, and both disease and mortality, directly comparable. DALYs (Murray & Lopez, 1996; WHO, 2000, 2002) are made up of two components: the years lost due to premature death and the years spent with a disease. The yearsspent with a disease are weighed according to the seriousness of the condition, using weighing factors. This renders the years spent with a disease comparable with those lost due to death. For example, if a disease has a weighing factor of 0.5, this means that a year spent with this disease is considered equivalent to half a year lost due topremature death. In this way, the lost life years and the disease year equivalents are enumerated as DALYs. Lost DALYs can be calculated for various diseases using statisti-cal information about mortality rates and incidences/prevalences/seriousness, andcan also be calculated for the risk factors based on the fraction of one or more diseases which can be explained by that risk factor (or attributed to the risk factor). DALYs lostdue to a par ticular cause (disease or risk factor) can also be understood in terms of gain which is, in theory, possible through optimum intervention. In the Netherlands, lost DALYs have been calculated for 49 selected conditions (see www.nationaalkompas.nl). Here, the life years lost have been calculated by multip- lying the number of disease-specific deaths per year by the remaining life expectancyatthe age in question. The period of illness is expressed as 'disease year equivalents' and calculated by multiplying the prevalence of the disease by the weighing factor for its seriousness. The weighing factors have been determined as par tof a separate study, and have a value between 0 (no health loss) and 1 (maximum health loss, equivalent todeath)(Van der Maas & Kramers, 1997). The same procedure was used previously to calculate the DALYs lost due to eight risk factors which, with the exception of smo- king, were all diet-related (Van Oers, 2002). De Hollander & Melse (2004; see also Van Oers,2002) used a comparable method to calculate the DALYs lost due to a number of health -related environmental factors. Aspecific problem which is also of interest in this report is that of the weighing of short-term conditions. Because the DALY is based on disease years, it is logical to weigh chronic conditions as ' one year spen tin condition X'. In the case of shor t-term condi - tions, it is possible (a) to weigh the condition as if it were to last a full year, and then to correct the result according to the actual duration (as a fraction of a year), or (b) toadapt the weighing to represent 'a year which includes an episode of, for instance, influenza' (the 'year profile approach'). The first approach is used by Murray & Lopez (1996) and De Hollander & Melse (2004) for environmen t-related health loss, as well as by Mangen et al .(2004) for foodborne infections. It makes a more precise calculation possible .The second approach is that used by the Cen tre for Public Health ForecastingAPPENDICES OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 330(Van der Maas & Kramers, 1997) and CVZ(Health Care Insurance Board)(2003) and has the advantage that account is taken of the fact that the disease will be resolved relati-vely quickly.

Per-centages are also given, whereby the absolute figures are divided by the number of new cases of disease or deaths occurring in the reference scenario (x 100). The calcula - tions are based on the total of all the various forms of cardiovascular diseases or can- cer considered in the calculations, and not merely those diseases for which a rela-tionship with the relevant (dietary) factor exists. In the case of the cardiovasculardiseases, these are coronary heart diseases, stroke and heart failure, which togetheraccoun tfor approximately 75% of all cardiovascular diseases in terms of mortality.

With regard to total mortality, the absolute figures represent the sum of the figures for each of the separate causes of death for which calculations have been made. The per-centages are then calculated by dividing this figure by the mortality attributable to allcauses. The DALYs are calculated using the figures for disease and mortality. Thesepercentages therefore relate to the total mortality, but the disability component rela- tes only to the diseases included in the model. Unlike the directly attributable health loss, the modelling over a 20-year period takes the substitution effect of other causes of death into account: as the prevalence of a cer- tain cause of death is reduced, other causes will occur more often, and vice versa. The20-year results therefore sometimes include negative figures for diseases which are notrelated to the risk factor. For example, non-optimal dietary composition seems to result in a lower incidence and mortality due to diabetes, because a greater number of peop-le die from cardiovascular diseases and cancer .The result softhe 20-year calculation also clearly demonstrate that the average duration of disease due to cardiovascular dis- ease is longer than that of cancer: for the five dietary factors combined, the incidenceof cardiovascular diseases is approximately six times greater than the mortality rate, while in the case of cancer ,incidence is only approximately 1.5 times greater . Life expectancy figures include both the total life expectancy and disease-free life expect ancy, for which the number of years spen twith the modelled disease has been subtracted from the total life expectancy. The final t able in appendix 12.6 presen tsa'lifest yle factors ,Utopian mix'. This differs from the 'three lifestyle factors combined' in the other tables because it incorporates the most favourable situation with regard to alcohol consumption, being the middle scenario. Accordingly, the outcomes are in most cases even more favourable than those for 'five dietary factors combined'. 12.7 Some supplementary DALY estimates (substantiation of section 7.2 ) These are provisional estimates which must be regarded as 'order of magnitude' indi- cations. For the PAR formula, see 12.1 . Consumption of fibre and cardiovascular diseases: RR: per 10 gram/day increase (f) or 15 gram (m) there will be a 20-30% lower risk of cardiovascular diseases (Pietinen et al., 1996; Rimm et al., 1996; W olk et al., 1999; Mozaffarian et al., 2003; Bazzano et al., 2003).APPENDICES OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 352Simplified assumption: the upper 50% of the population in terms of intake will have an RR of 0.8. This means that the RR for the lower 50% will be 1/0.8 = 1.25. PAR = 0.5x0.25/((0.5x0.25)+1) = 0.11. The number of DALYs lost each year to cardiovascular disease is 347,100 (RIVM, 2004); 11% of this figure is approximately 35,000 DALYs. Because this is only a rough estimate, the text refers to 'more than 10,000 DALYs'. Breastfeeding and asthma in children: RR = 0.7 for three months exclusive breastfeeding against no breastfeeding (Gdale- vich et al.,2001). Prevalence three months exclusive breastfeeding = 32%, risk fraction therefore = 68%; 25% do not start breastfeeding. The risk fraction is therefore 25-68%. For PAR calculation, reciprocal RR = 1/0.7 = 1.43. PARmax = 0.68x(1.43-1)/(0.68x(1.43-1)+1) = 0.23. PARmin = 0.25x(1.43-1)/(0.25x(1.43-1)+1) = 0.10. Annual prevalence (RIVM, 2004) of asthma at 0-4 years of age (assumed to be the period during which the child is protected): 105 per 1.000, being an absolute figu-reof 105,000. 0.10-0.23 x 105,000 attributable to no breastfeeding = 10,500-24,150. With respect to the DALY calculation, the mortality proportion is small and has been disregarded. The weighing factor for asthma is 0.08. The number of DALYs is then 0.08 x 10,500-24,200 = 840-1,940, which has been rounded off to 800-1,900. Breastfeeding and inflammation of the middle ear: RR = 0.77 for middle ear inflammation for breast feeding versus no breast feeding (Uhari et al., 1996). Prevalence of breast feeding: see above. For PAR calculation ,reciprocal RR = 1.3. PARmax = 0.68 x 0.3/((0.68 x 0.3) + 1) = 0.17. PARmin = 0.25 x 0.3/((0.25 x 0.3) + 1) = 0.07. Annual incidence of Otitis media according to the second National Study (RIVM, 21,560-52,360. With respect to calculating DALYs, no mortality has been included. The weighing factor is assumed to be the same as that for infections of the lower respiratorytract: 0.01. The number of DALYs is then 0.01 x 21,560-52,360 = 216-524, which has been rounded off to 200-500.OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH APPENDICES 353APPENDICES OUR FOOD, OUR HEALTH 354Bazzano LA, He J, Ogden LG, Loria CM, Whelton PK.

Box 1 3720 BA Bilthoven The Netherlands www .rivm.nl/enOur food, our health Healthy and unhealthy diets receive a lot of attention nowadays, and there are good reasons for this. Each year, overweight and unfavourable dietary composition account for thousands of new cases of illness and unnecessary deaths. The number of young people and adults who are overweight is increasing. Foodborne infections and allergic reactions to food constituents also cause some health loss. This report addresses questions such as what is the health loss due to unhealthy diets and unsafe food in the Netherlands? What are the causes of this problem? What effects can we expect to see in the future? The report shows that, in the Netherlands, a substantial portion of health loss can be prevented by a healthier diet and safer food. This requires an integrated strategy, involving greater activity on the part of all those involved. The main opportunities are to be found on the supply side, i.e. in the hands of the private sector. But the consumer also has an important part to play, by making the proper choices in terms of health. The government must first create the necessary conditions, possibly followed by enforcement where appropriate. This report is a collaborative publication of the Nutrition, Medicines and Consumer Safety Division and the Public Health and Health Services Division of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). It is one of a series of reports on Public Health Forecasts in the Netherlands . The report was originally published in Dutch under the title Ons eten www.rivm.nl/en.
