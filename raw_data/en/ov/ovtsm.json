A Risk Assessment Code (RAC) is assigned to each step, to the risk that remains after controls have been applied (residual risk) . (1) Once this process has occurred, a RAC will be assigned to the activity as a whole (cannot be lower than the highest step RAC) . (2) Acceptance of risk . This residual risk must then be communicated to the proper authority for acceptance in order to proceed with the activity . (3) The names of the Competent Person(s) (CP) and Qualified Person(s) (QP) required for a particular activity (e.g., excavation, scaffolding, fall protection, or other activities as specified by OSHA and this manual) shall be identified and included in the AHA, as well as proof of their competency/qualification. (4) If more than one CP/QP is used on the AHA activity, a list of names and appropriate qualifications shall be submitted as an attachment to the AHA. Those listed must be CPs/QPs for the type of work involved in the AHA and familiar with current site safety issues. c. Work shall not begin until the AHA with RAC for the work activity has been accepted by the GDA and discussed with all engaged in the activity, including the Contractor, subcontractor(s), and Government on- site representatives at preparatory and initial control phase meetings. EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 1-10 d. AHA's are intended to be developed and used by the field crews/workers performing the work, with the assistance of others (SSHO, QC, Superintendent, etc) as needed . The initial, a ccepted AHA shall be provided to and used by the field crews/workers that are performing that activity . AHAs are to be considered living documents and are intended to be created in the field and updated by the workers as needed . e. The AHA shall be rev iewed and modified as necessary to address changing site conditions, operations, or change of CP(s)/QP(s). (1) If a new CP/QP (not on the original list) is added, the list shall be updated (an administrative action not requiring an updated AHA). The new CP/QP shall acknowledge in writing that they have reviewed the AHA and is familiar with current site safety issues. (2) If the initial RAC increases due to a change made to the AHA by the workers, the AHA shall be resubmitted to GDA for acceptance prior to work proceeding .

EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-3 g. Electrically rated aerial devices shall be tested yearly with approved test methods and equipment, in accordance with ANSI/SIA A92.2. 31.A.04 Equipment. a. Equipment shall be inspected, maintained, repaired, and used in accordance with manufacturers' instructions. b. Employees shall be instr ucted in the safe and proper use of all equipment provided to them. c. See Section 21 for Climbing Equipment Requirements. 31.A.05 Climbing lines shall not be used to lower limbs or other parts of trees or to raise or lower equipment, with the exceptio n of hand tools . 31.A.06 Tool handles shall be used when raising and lowering tools. 31.A.07 Tools used for cabling, bark tracing, cavity work, etc., shall be carried in a bag, belt, or sheath designed to hold tools and not put in the pockets or stuck in the top of a boot. 31.A.08 Elevating Aerial Work Platforms (AWPs) . a. AWPs shall be provided with fall protection anchor(s) meeting design requirements of the ANSI/SIA A92.2 on which to secure an approved system of personal fall protection (e.g., f ull body harness with an energy -absorbing lanyard), which shall be worn by the operator(s) whenever aloft . b. The operator may use a climber's belt and lanyard in place of a full body harness if he/she intends to transfer from the AWP to the tree . The employee shall be secured to the tree prior to removing the lanyard attached to the basket . Under no circumstances shall the employee perform any work while secured to both the tree and the basket . c. See Section 21.H for all other fall protection requir ements . 31.B Tree Climbing . 31.B.01 Tree Climbing Techniques. a. All tree work operations above a height of 12 ft (3.6 m), whether there are electrical hazards or not, shall require a second worker in the area. If climbing is being performed, the second worker shall also be a qualified climber, capable and knowledgeable of rescue techniques, including self rescue. EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-4 b. Use of Rope Access techniques should only be used where other means of accessing the tree or undertaking the work, such as aerial devices or pole saws, are not practical. > See Section 2 4 for recommended rope climbing equipment, techniques, and safety pract ices. 31.B.02 The climber shall inspect the tree and surrounding area for hazards and perform a risk assessment of the tree and work site. Some issues to be considered are: power lines, tree hangers or broken and dead branches, entanglement with adjacent or downed trees, shape and lean of the tree, tree damage from wind, lightning, disease, location of septic lines and tanks and other potential at -grade or below -grade utilities that could be impacted. a. Debris and other objects shall be removed from beneath the climber whenever possible . b. Weather conditions shall be assessed as well as location of adjacent structures. Adverse weather conditions may include light ning and thunderstorms in the area . 31.B.03 Where climbing is required, tree crews shall have a secondary climber who could assist in a rescue if necessary OR the crew shall be working in proximity to nearby crews with a climber who could assist in a rescue . 31.B.04 A climber shall have available a climbing line and at least one other m eans of being secured, on their person at all times ( e.g., climbing line and a work positioning lanyard, etc.) . a. The climber shall be tied in with an approved type of climbing line and safety saddle while ascending the tree, including when using climbing spurs/gaffs . b. The climber shall be tied in once the work begins and shall remain tied in until the work is completed and he or she has returned to the ground . c. The climber shall be secured when repositioning the climbing line . d. Work may be performed while standing on a ladder only when the worker is tied in or secured as required . 31.B.05 The climbing line shall be passed around the trunk of the tree as high above the ground as possible using branches with a wide crotch to prevent any binding of the safety line. The crotch selected for tying should be directly above the work area, or as close to such a position as possible, but located in such a way that a slip or fall would swing the climber away from any electrical conductor . The li ne shall be passed around the main leader or an upright branch, using the limb as a stop . Feet, hands, and ropes shall be kept out of tight V -shaped crotches . EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-5 Exception : Palms and other trees with similar growth characteristics that will not allow a climbing line to move freely . 31.B.06 The climber shall tie a stopper knot ( e.g., figure -eight knot) in the end of the line, particularly when the climber will be working at heights greater than half the length of the climbing line, to prevent pulling the c limbing line accidentally through the climbing hitch and possibly falling . 31.B.07 If it is necessary to re- crotch the climbing line in the tree, the climber shall re- tie in or use the safety strap before releasing the previous tie . 31.B.08 The climber working from a stem or spar without a suitable natural crotch shall select tie -in points or a tie- in method that positively prevent the climbing line from sliding down or up, or off the stem during climbing operations . a. Placing a climbing line around a stem in an area without a lateral limb is not acceptable unless the climbing line is cinched or choked around the stem or runs through a double- wrapped or adjustable false crotch, which is secured/cinched around the stem . b. The tie -in point selected shall be able to withstand the forces being applied during the pruning/removal operation . 31.B.09 Climbers shall not carry tools in their hands while climbing. Chainsaws and tools shall be raised and lowered one at a time by means of a line, except when working from an aerial -lift device or during topping or removing operations. 31.B.10 Chainsaws used aloft shall be secured against falling . Climbers may attach chainsaws weighing less than 15 lbs (6.8 kg) to themselves by means of a saw lanyard. 31.B.11 Climbers sh all carry a hand saw . When carried aloft, the hand saw shall be carried in a scabbard attached to the safety saddle . 31.B.12 Climbing of dead and dying trees shall only be performed where no other safe and feasible alternative exists for removal of the tree. Climbers shall not trust the capability of a dead branch to support his/her weight. If possible, dead branches should be broken off on the way up and hands and feet should be placed on separate limbs. 31.B.13 Climbing with tree spurs on live trees that are being pruned or otherwise maintained is generally not allowed, in accordance with tree care management standards found in ANSI A300 . a. Tree spurs used for thick bark trees shall have longer gaffs, such as 2 \u00be in (7 cm). Gaff lengths of 1 \u00be in (4.5 cm) are intended only for pole climbing . EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-6 b. Gaff lengths shall be suitable for the tree being climbed . 31.B.14 Climbing techniques. The climber may apply a variety of climbing techniques, but they must be approved by the G DA. a. Climbing without the use of tree spurs may be required. b. The most commonly used arborist rope climbing technique is the \" Advancing the Rope and Body Thrusting/Alternate Lanyard Technique\" . c. If the climber can remain near the trunk of the tree, he may use both the belt lanyard/ flip line and the Rope Advance (lifeline) technique. Otherwise, a single line access is permitted. If a lifeline (Access Line) cannot be set in the tree, then the use of two flip lines may be used. d. The use of auto- locking belay devices or tree climber's hitches is both permitted. e. Climbers shall not ascend above their tie in point. Tie-in points shall be well above the climber to prevent an uncontrolled pendulum s wing in the event of a slip. f. Once in the tree, climbers shall be tied off at two points while working or using the chainsaw, (this includes the primary support of the access line or climbing line, and secondary support with a second climbing line or th e flip line/lanyard/buck strap). (1) Climbers may ascend or descend from the tree using only the access line by using approved single rope techniques . (2) Once the worker is at the tie- in point, a secure climbing system shall be installed. (3) The climber shall disconnect from the access line only when a new tie in point has been established . g. Use of the three- point contact climbing is recommended if possible . Climbers may use ground personnel to help pull them up the tree . h. Tree climbers shall be medically cleared every 2 years by a licensed healthcare provider for unlimited tree climbing . The examination will have an emphasis on identifying and providing mitigating factors for prior heat/cold injuries, the ability to work at heights on uneven surfaces, and any environmental allergens . Additionally it will ensure that there are no medical conditions or medications which could affect balance, the ability to communicate with others, level of consciousness, extremity sensation, fine motor movement, gross motor movement, or the ability to physically lift or lower oneself . EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-7 31.C Felling. 31.C. 01 Prior to felling operations, the employee shall consider the associated hazards that may include, but are not limited to : a.

Location of any electrical conductors or other wires ; k. Tree cables, bracing, lightning protec tion, or other tree hardware ; l. Size and terrain characteristics or limitations of work area ; m. Potential for flying debris from tree impact ; n. Adequate retreat path ; o. Evidence of bees or wildlife habitation in tree ; p. Poisonous plants, water hazards ; q. Ability to control access to work site ; r. Authority to remove tree ; s. Quality of wood fiber in hinge area ; EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-8 t. Root mass stability ; u. Ice or snow load ; v. Throw -back or bounce- back potential ; w. Potential for spri ng poles ; x. Lodged trees or dead snags in area; y. Access to tools or resources required for task ; z. Lightning damage ; aa. Barber chair potential ; bb. Foreign objects, nails, wire fence, concrete, etc. in the tree . 31.C.02 Prior to felling operations, the work area shall be cleared to permit safe working conditions and an escape route shall be planned. Workers shall ensure that homes and structures are evacuated where trimming and felling operations are in close proximity . 31.C.03 Felling paths shall be at least twice the distance as the height of the tree (due to limbs and debris being thrown after hitting the ground. Where this distance cannot be maintained, limbing may be required. Power lines may also need to be dropped or de- energized. 31.C.04 Each worker shall be instructed as to exactly what he is to do. All workers not directly involved in the operation shall be kept clear of the work area. 31.C.05 Before starting to cut, the chainsaw operator shall be sure of his footing and must clear away brush, fallen trees, and other materials that might interfere with cutting operations. 31.C.06 A notch and backcut shall be used in felling trees over 5 in (12.7 cm) in diameter (measured at breast height) . No tree shall be felled by \"slicing\" or \"ripping\" cuts. a. The two cuts that form the notch shall meet at a point called the apex, and shall not cross that point or go beyond the point where they meet . b. The notch cut used shall be a conventional notch, an open- face notch , or a Humboldt notch . EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-9 c. Notches shall be 45 degrees or greater and large enough to guide the fall of the tree or trunk . d. Notch depth should not exceed one- third the diameter of the tree . The hinge width should be 80 percent of the tree's diamet er, as measured at the hinge . e. Saw cuts made to form the notch and back cut shall leave suitable amounts of hinge wood to adequately control the directional fall of the tree . f. With a conventional notch or Humboldt notch, the back cut shall be 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5 cm) above the apex of the notch to provide an adequate platform to prevent kickback of the tree or trunk . With an open -face notch (greater than 70 degrees), the back cut should be at the same level as the apex of the notch . 31.C.07 If sections of the tree are to be removed, sections shall be limited in lengths to one-third of the distance to the nearest structure [ e.g. If the tree is 30 ft (9 m) from the structure, sections shall be no more than 10 ft (3m) ]. Note: The discretion o f the chainsaw operator must be used. In some instances it may be safer to fell a large trunk away from the structure rather than to remove it in small sections, especially where the tree has grown very close to the house or structure. If this is done, a tag line shall be used to help guide the direction of the fall along with the use of proper notch and backcut. 31.C.08 The chainsaw operator shall work from the uphill side whenever possible. Tag lines may be used to help guide the direction of the fall provided the workers on the tag line are well clear of the fall path, such as twice the distance of the fall area . 31.C.09 Just before the tree of limb is ready to fall, an audible warning shall be given to all those in the area. All persons shall b e safely out of range when the tree falls. 31.C.10 If there is danger that the trees being felled may fall in the wrong direction or damage property, wedges, block and tackle, rope, or wire cable (except when an electrical hazard exists) shall be used. All limbs shall be removed from trees to a height and width sufficient to allow the tree to fall clear of any wires and other objects in the vicinity . 31.C.11 Special precautions shall be taken when roping rotten or split trees due to the potential for fal ling in an unexpected direction even though the cut is made on the proper side. 31.C.12 Persons shall be kept back from the butt of a tree that is starting to fall . EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 31-10 31.D Brush Removal and Chipping. 31.D.01 Brush and logs shall not be allowed to create a hazard at the work site. 31.D.02 Employees working with a brush chipper shall be trained in its safe operation.

Using the EM 385-1-1 as a guide, plans may include but not be limited to: Remarks (Any NO or Nov 14 B-1 APPENDIX B Emergency Operations 1. Safety and Health Requirements. During emergency operations, it is extremely important that safety and occupational health (SOH) requirements are implemented. Personnel often perform unusual, difficult, hazardous tasks while in a challenging environment, and these conditions may increase risk and the potential for accidents. Additionally, resources are in short supply, and the loss of any resource to a mishap reduces the USACE ability to respond. a. The SOH of USACE employees, Contractors, and members of the public exposed to USACE activities will be a primary concern during all USACE emergency operations. S OH Offices (SOHO) shall provide the necessary input to their Emergency Management counterparts to ensure that planning for SOH concerns (including hazard and risk analysis) is addressed prior to and during emergency operations. b. Contract Requirements. S OH program requirements shall be included in all Government and contract operations. FAR Clause 52.236- 13 shall be included in contracts and memoranda of agreement/understandi ng (MOAs/MOUs) for emergency operations and recovery assistance. c. Accident Prevention Plan (APP) and Activity Hazard Analyses (AHAs). In addition to the APP already submitted by the Controlling Contractor, activity -specific AHA s shall be developed and submitted to the on- site USACE SOH professional for review and acceptance prior to beginning any operation (debris removal, tree removal, blue- roof activities, leaners and hangers, etc .). Once accepted, t he AHA is considered a living/fie ld document that is intended to be updated in the field by the field crews so that it constantly reflects current equipment, personnel, conditions, PPE, etc. GDA acceptance of changes made to an AHA is not necessary as long as changes do not increas e original risk assessment code (RAC) level for the activity, as long as requirements are being met and a copy is made available upon request . d. Structural Demolition. For structural demolition activities, consideration shall be given to combine like- structures under a common engineering survey and demolition plan, see Section 23.A.01.a. For example, single- story residential structures that would pose no hazards to neighboring structures or personnel could be demolished using a common engineering survey and demolition plan, whereas multiple- story structures or others that would pose risks to personnel or other structures would have individual surveys and plans per Section 23.A.01. EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 B-2 2. Initial Response. A qualified SOH professional shall be immediately alerted of the disaster and shall be included in the planning and execution of response and recovery efforts. This individual shall assess SOH issues and shall assure precautions are taken prior to deployment of personnel. Issues to consider include: sanitation, drinking water, power supply, living quarters, driving conditions, environmental conditions, and health issues. 3. Staffing . SOHO in the Geographic District experiencing the disaster will be temporarily staffe d with additional safety, industrial hygiene, and medical personnel as necessary to ensure a comprehensive SOH program is administered for all emergency operations. If a Recovery Field Office (RFO) is established, SOH staffing is usually accomplished by use of SOH functional planning and response teams (PRT). If a RFO is not established, the Geographic District shall establish an emergency operations safety office (minimum staffing to include a safety manager and administrative support person) dedicated totally to emergency operations. Also, each Emergency Field Office established shall have a minimum of one SOH professional. a. Medical personnel shall provide medical assistance, assessments, and advice to USACE management and employees. b. SOH personnel shall: manage safety and health aspects of emergency operations; provide advice on SOH issues; provide SOH t echnical oversight for USACE employees, other Federal employees engaged in fulfilling the Corps' mission, and quality assurance for Contractor employees. c. Prime Contractors for emergency operations are required to have as a minimum a full-time, qualified SOH professional on- site. Qualifications of the SOH professional shall be provided to the GDA for review and acceptance. Additional Contract or personnel may be required as determined by the GDA. 4. Qualifications of Government Employees. a. All Government employees reporting for emergency recovery operations shall meet the medical requirements in the current A ll Hazards OPORD ( currently 2012- 11) and shall have a current medical clearance in ENGLink . This requirement shall be confirmed upon arrival during the check -in process . b. Employees with known pre- existing non- work -related medical conditions such as uncontroll ed diabetes, cardiovascular or pulmonary problems, back conditions, pregnancy or hypertension sh all not deploy to emergency operations sites unless specific medical clearance is provided by the USACE medical provider in conjunction with their personal physician(s) indi cating their current medical condition will not jeopardize their health or their ability to fully perform their duty assignments at deployment sites. EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 B-3 c. Employees may be returned to their duty station if during the course of duty they experience health problems that may endanger their well -being. d. Employees shall be notified that pharmacies and medical services may be limited at the emergency operations site. 5. Mobilization of USACE Personnel. USACE personnel will be provided the following prior to departing their home duty station for emergency operations: a. PPE consisting of, at a minimum , head, eye and f oot protection appropriate for the hazards of the field activities that they will perform (additional PPE that may be necessary will be provided at the emergency operations site) , and b. Immunizations appropriate for their field exposure (follow -up immunizations will be the responsibility of each employee's home duty station). Deploying USACE personnel shall obtain the immunizations as required by the current A ll Hazards OPORD . The USACE personnel will update their immunization data in ENGLink before departing their home station , provide a copy to a USACE nurse for verification , and carry with them their immunization record (USPHS Form 731) or immunization record which provides, type of immunization with lot and manufacture, date of immunization, and name and credential of provider . 6. Safety Orientation . SOH in-briefings and orientation shall be conducted as personnel arrive at the emergency area and prior to beginning work activities. 7. Communications. a. Two-way radios, cellular phones, computers and facsimile machines shall be used as needed to establis h and enhance communications. > See Section 18.C.01. b. SOH programs, documents, signs, tags, instructions, etc., shall be communicated to employees and the public in a language they understand. 8. Duty Schedule. a. During the first 2 weeks of an emergency response operation extended work hours are allowed. Supervisors shall monitor employees for signs of stress -related health problems and seek medical assistance as appropriate. b. For operations lasting longer than 2 weeks, USACE and contractor employees shall not work in excess of 84 hours per week. The duty hours an employee would be required to work during emergency operations are 12 hours per day, 7 days a week. Work and travel time must allow for 8 hours continuous rest between each work shift. EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 B-4 c. Employees who are working 12 hours per day, 7 days a week shall be provided the opportunity for 24 hours of rest after working 14 days and 48 hours of rest after working 21 days. Employees shall be required to take at least 24 hours off for rest after a continuous 30-day period of work during normal non- duty days (Saturday or Sunday) and shall be required to take at least 24 hours every 2 weeks thereafter. Supervisors shall monitor employees for signs of stress -related health problems and seek medical assistance as appropriate. 9. Machinery and Mechanized Equipment . > See Sections 16 and 18. a. Inspection of equipment is critical as mobilization can be extremely short and equipment may not be up to USACE safety standards. Whenever feasible, contract specifications shall provide adequate mobilization time to allow equipment to be inspected and brought up t o USACE standards. Equipment not meeting the requirements of this manual will not be used. b. Trucks hauling debris on public highways shall have physical barriers (covers and either tail gates or chain link fencing) to preclude debris from falling from the truck. Tail gates or chain link fencing shall cover the full area at the rear of the dump body . (1) Back -up alarms shall be provided. (2) The need for rollover warning devices shall be considered for long -bed end dump trucks. (3) Sideboards shall not be added to trucks to increase their capacity unless specific design specifications are provided to Contractors as part of the scope of work. Single or double boards added to trailers designed for normal operation with the additional boards are permi tted. Where sideboards are permitted, the tail gate or chain link fencing shall extend to cover the full area of the rear of the vehicle . (4) Trees, to include leaners and hangers, shall be cut into manageable size to place in the bed of a truck . All loads shall be secured so that any debris, dust -like emission, aggregate (gravel), soil, or stump cannot be ejected during transport to the final reduction site. After final reduction, tarping systems that prevent workers from being exposed to fall hazards greater than 6 ft (1.8 m) shall be required . All loads leaving the reduction site shall be secured and tarped. c. Prior to operation, Contractors shall develop written safe operating procedures (SOPs) for each brush chipper, shredder, and/or grinder. (1) SOPs shall incorporate the manufacturer's recommendations for safe operation of this equipment as well as the use of an exclusion zone (EZ) and fire prevention efforts. EM 385- 1-1 30 Nov 14 B-5 (2) Operations and maintenance manuals for chippers, grinders, and shredders s hall be kept on- site. (3) A minimum 200 ft (61.0 m) EZ is required for authorized persons during operation of chippers, shredders, and grinders unless documentation or actual practice indicates otherwise. Signs shall be placed at 200 ft (61.0 m) identi fying the EZ. (4) The public shall be kept a minimum of 300 ft (91.4 m) from all chipper operations. (5) Unauthorized personnel shall not enter the EZ while the chipper is in operation. (6) Front -end loaders , skid steers, knuckle booms , and other eq uipment working in debris reduction areas or feeding grinders, shredders or chippers shall provide protection to the operator as required in Section 18 . (7) Whenever chipper operations are shut down for any significant length of time (e.g., overnight or w hen the chipper will be left unattended), equipment walls, crevice drums, cutter heads and hammers, and drive mechanisms shall be cleared of all combustible materials by blowing, washing, and wetting down. (8) Any material contaminated by leakage of hydraulic fluids, oils, or fuel shall be immediately removed. Leakage shall be minimized through preventive maintenance. (9) Because piles of chipped wood are susceptible to spontaneous combustion, fire controls such as segregation, separation, and adequa te water supply shall be used. d. The number of workers in proximity to loaders, trucks, and other equipment shall be the minimum necessary to accomplish the job. (1) In restricted areas or areas with reduced access or visibility, special precautions w ill be taken to ensure the safety of workers on the ground. (2) Sequencing of work shall minimize equipment movement when personnel are in the work area. (3) Workers in the area of operating machinery or vehicular traffic shall wear high- visibility apparel, in accordance with Section 5.F. These workers include, but are not limited to flag persons, signalpersons, spotters, survey crews and inspectors. e.

Provision of any other requirements or standards addressing the requirement in question. It is incumbent upon the requester to research the literature to determine if any other requirement or standard exists addressing the requirement from which relief is being sought. If there is another standard(s), the requester must identify it and provide a copy. Requests for waivers/variances will not be processed until this requirement has been met; and i. A cover letter. 3. Requester shall work the action with the local USACE Safety and Occupational Health Office (SOHO) who shall cover package with their official signed memorandum requesting consideration and including their concurrence or non- concurrence with the request. Package is then sent via mail in hard copy or via e- mail with attached PDF file to HQ USACE -SO with a copy furnished to Division SOH Manager for concurrence or non- concurrence . 4. HQ USACE -SO will then coordinate with Division SOH Manager to evaluate the request. USACE -SO shall have at least 10 working days from date of receipt to consider the request and to render a written decision. 5. A waiver or variance will not be carried over to other operations unless the evaluator extends the s cope to include other times and operations. If warranted, HQ USACE -SO may issue a global variance based on an individual request , however a global variance/waiver normally indicates a flawed requirement and hence, the actual requirement may be in need of correction/change .
