You also asked whether the claimant was in full-time attendance (FTA). OPINION Trinity and AliYah are both recognized church-related schools under Tennessee law. However, while Trinity qualifies as a church-related school under Tennessee law, AliYah does not meet the Tennessee statutory requirements for a church-related school home schooling program and therefore does not qualify as an educational institution for Social Security purposes. The claimant was in FTA at both Trinity and AliYah. BACKGROUND According to the information provided, D~ (Claimant), resides in Tennessee, and was receiving CIB as a child under age eighteen on the earnings record of J~, the number holder. Claimant turned eighteen years old in May 2016. She has applied for a continuation of CIB as a full-time student. Claimant completed two Student's Statement Regarding School Attendance forms (Form SSA-1372). Claimant did not date the forms, but she apparently completed the forms after her expected graduation date, as she indicated that she was not currently in full-time attendance. Claimant reported that she had previously attended Trinity from August 2015 to May 2016. She indicated Trinity was a home school, which she attended twenty hours per week. She reported she attended AliYah from August 2016 until her expected graduation in May 2017. She indicated AliYah is a home school, which she attended twenty hours per week. P~, a guidance counselor at Trinity, completed the Certification by School Official page of Form SSA-1372 and confirmed that the information Claimant provided was correct according to Trinity's records. P~ indicated that Trinity's course of study was at least thirteen weeks in duration and the school operated on a yearly basis. She also noted that Claimant was no longer enrolled through in Trinity. According to its website, Trinity is located in Knoxville, Tennessee. See Trinity Christian Academy, http://tcaknoxville.org/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). Trinity has two programs, a homeschool co-op and an umbrella school. See id. Trinity describes the homeschool co-op as a parent-led program to \"assist home schooling parents to teach, train, and equip their children\" and that offers a variety of classes taught by pastors, parents, and others. Trinity Christian Academy, Homeschool Co-op, http://tcaknoxville.org/training-center/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). The homeschool co-op meets in North Knoxville on Mondays between the hours of 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. See id. The homeschool co-op appears to not require an immunization form. See Trinity Christian Academy, 2017-2018 Co-op Registration Information, http://tcaknoxville.org/training-center-registration/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). Trinity also operates as an umbrella school, a category IV church related school as defined in Tennessee Code \u00a7 49-50-801. See Trinity Christian Academy, Umbrella School, http://tcaknoxville.org/umbrella-school/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). Trinity's umbrella school webpage indicates that it holds a state membership in the Tennessee Association of Non-Public Academic Schools (TANAS). See id. The umbrella school is a ministry that offers support to those who have chosen home education; Trinity keeps track of the student's records and reports to the county so that the parents do not have to do the reporting. See id. Trinity also provides standardized testing services for grades 2-12. See Trinity Christian Academy, Testing, http://tcaknoxville.org/testing/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). Although Trinity offers a diploma, parents are responsible for developing the course of study for their children. See Trinity Christian Academy, Umbrella Registration, http://tcaknoxville.org/umbrella-registration/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). Students must provide a current official immunization form to enroll in the Trinity umbrella-school program. See id. The director of AliYah, K~, completed the Certification by School Official page of Form SSA-1372 and confirmed that the information Claimant provided was correct according to AliYah's records. K~ also indicated AliYah's course of study was at least thirteen weeks in duration and operated on a yearly basis. AliYah's website indicates that it is located in T~, Tennessee. See AliYah Academy, Contact Us, https://www.AliYahacademy.com/contact-us (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). AliYah's homepage indicates that AliYah's purpose is to support homeschooling and act as a liaison between parents and the State. See AliYah Academy, https://www.AliYahacademy.com/ (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). The website states that AliYah is recognized by the Tennessee Department of Education as a category IV church-related school and is a member of the Tennessee Alliance of Church Related Schools. See AliYah Academy, About AliYah Academy, https://www.AliYahacademy.com/about-us (last visited Aug. 23, 2017). The website also states that Trinity was \"founded as an umbrella for homeschoolers.\" Id. The website further explains that the parent/guardian is the teacher and \"a satellite school of AliYah.\" Id. The parent/guardian picks the courses, records the grades, and reports them to AliYah, which maintains those records indefinitely and provides official transcripts and diplomas to students at Aliyah. See id. AliYah, however, does not require any testing and does not require immunizations. See id. In addition, the Tennessee Department of Education classifies both schools as category IV schools. See AliYah, https://k-12.education.tn.gov/sde/DetailSchool.asp?bu_id=7811; Trinity, https://k-12.education.tn.gov/sde/DetailSchool.asp?bu_id=6620. DISCUSSION To be eligible for CIB on the earnings record of an individual who is entitled to old-age or disability insurance benefits, or of an individual who dies a fully or currently insured individual, an individual who is eighteen years of age or older and not disabled must be a \"full-time elementary or secondary school student.\" Social Security Act System 00205.001A.](../lnx/0300205001#a) An individual may qualify as a \"full-time elementary or secondary school student\" if he or she attends an educational institution, i.e., a school that provides elementary or secondary education (twelfth grade or below) as determined under the law of the state in which the school is located. See Act also may qualify as an elementary or secondary school student if he or she receives instruction in elementary or secondary education at home under the home school law of the state where he or she resides. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.367(a)(1); POMS [RS 00205.275A.](../lnx/0300205275#a) Educational Institution under Tennessee Law Because Trinity and AliYah are both located in Tennessee, we look to Tennessee law to determine whether either or both are schools that provide elementary or secondary education. See Act \u00a7 202(d)(7)(C)(i); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.367(a); POMS [RS 00205.200](../lnx/0300205200).A. Under Tennessee law, every child between the age of six and seventeen must attend public or non-public school. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-6-3001(c)(1) (West 2017). Tennessee law recognizes a \"non-public\" school includes a church-related school (CRS), home school, or private school. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-6-3001(c)(3)(A) (West 2017). A CRS is a school operated by a denominational, parochial, or other bona fide church organization that meets the standards of accreditation or membership in various associations, including TANAS and the Tennessee Alliance of Church Related Schools. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 49-6-3001(c)(3)(A)(i), 49-50-801(a). Tennessee law states that a CRS must be conducted for the same term length as a public school. See Tenn. Code. Ann \u00a7 49-50-801(d). Tennessee recognizes two hybrids of home schools and CRSs. In the first type, a parent teaching through a home school may associate with, and students may enroll with, a CRS, whereby the CRS's director supervises the home school and the CRS administers or offers standardized achievement tests. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-6-3050(a)(2)(A). In the second type, a parent-teacher may enroll the parent's home school student or students in a CRS and participate as a teacher in that CRS. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-6-3050(a)(3). Trinity is a member of TANAS and AliYah is a member of the Tennessee Alliance of Church Related Schools. See Trinity Christian Academy, http://tcaknoxville.org/umbrella-school/; AliYah Academy, About AliYah Academy, https://www.AliYahacademy.com/about-us. In addition, the Tennessee Department of Education classifies both schools as category IV schools. See AliYah, https://k-12.education.tn.gov/sde/DetailSchool.asp?bu_id=7811; Trinity, https://k-12.education.tn.gov/sde/DetailSchool.asp?bu_id=6620. Category IV schools are schools that are \"church related\" as recognized by associations mentioned in Tennessee Code \u00a7 49-50-801. See Tenn. Dep't of Ed., http://tn.gov/education/article/non-public-school-categories (last visited Aug. 24, 2017). Based on each school's membership in an organization identified in the statute and their categorization as category IV schools by the State of Tennessee, both Trinity and AliYah are CRSs under Tennessee law. To qualify for CIB based on instruction at home, Claimant's instruction had to be in accordance with Tennessee's home school law. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.367(a)(1); POMS RS 205.275B. As noted above, Tennessee recognizes two hybrids of home schools and CRSs: home schools affiliated with CRSs, and CRSs operating at home. See Tenn. Code Ann. 49-6-3050(a)(1)-(3); POMS [PR 07905.047A](../lnx/1507905047#a), PR 17-040 (Feb. 7, 2017). both Trinity and AliYah's umbrella programs are recognized CRSs and Claimant's instruction occurred at home, both schools' umbrella program appear to be a CRS operating at home. Tennessee allows for broad discretion in a CRS operating at home. CRSs operating at home are exempt from having to file notices of intent with local school directors, maintaining attendance records, requiring minimum parent/teacher education levels, or meeting standardized testing requirements. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-96-3050(a)(3), (b). CRSs under Tennessee law are also exempt from the State's curriculum regulation. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-50-801(b); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0520-07-02-.01(1)(d) (West 2017). Tennessee only requires such schools to ensure their students are vaccinated and report the names, ages, and addresses of their students to the superintendent of the public school system in which the student resides. See Tenn. Comp. R & Regs. 0520-07-02-.05(2)(d)-(e) (West 2017). Trinity complies with the requirements to ensure vaccination of the students and report the names, ages, and addresses of the students to the superintendent of the public school system. AliYah, however, does not require students to be vaccinated; therefore, AliYah does not comply with Tennessee law on CRSs operating at home. See AliYah Academy, About AliYah Academy, https://www.AliYahacademy.com/about-us. Therefore, while attendance at Trinity would qualify a CRS operating at home in accordance with Tennessee home school law for agency purposes, attendance at AliYah would not qualify as such due to its lack of a vaccination compliance. Full-Time Attendance You also asked whether Claimant is in FTA. A home schooled individual must meet the Federal standards for FTA and meet the home school requirements of the state in which the home school is located. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.367(b)-(c); POMS [RS 00205.275B.](../lnx/0300205275#b) Claimant reported on the Form SSA-1372 forms she completed that she attended classes through Trinity for twenty hours a week. K~, the director of Trinity, confirmed the information provided by Claimant and reported that Trinity's course of study was at least thirteen weeks in duration. Nothing indicates that Claimant took correspondence courses. Thus, the information provided indicates Claimant's instruction while affiliated with Trinity met the Federal FTA standards. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.367(b), (c); POMS [RS 00205.300C.](../lnx/0300205300#c) The evidence also indicates Claimant's instruction through Trinity met Tennessee attendance requirements because K~ certified that Claimant's attendance at Trinity was full-time presume that Claimant attended AliYah in FTA, the finding is irrelevant because of our analysis above finding AliYah to not meet all of Tennessee's requirements for a CRS operating home, namely the requirement to ensure vaccination. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.367(b); POMS [RS 00205.275](../lnx/0300205275).B. CONCLUSION Trinity is an educational institution under Tennessee law because it is a CRS in which Claimant's parent(s) taught her at home under the auspices of the CRS. AliYah, however, is not an educational institution under Tennessee law because it does not meet Tennessee's requirements for a CRS operating home, namely the requirement to ensure vaccination of the students. Claimant's instruction through Trinity met both federal and state standards for FTA, and whether Claimant's attendance at AliYah was FTA is not necessary to determine because the school does not qualify as an educational institution. Thus, the information provided establishes Claimant was a full-time secondary school student for determining her eligibility for CIB for the period from August 2015 through May 2016, but not thereafter.
