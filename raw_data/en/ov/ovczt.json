In 1896, Dr. Benedict Lust (MD) brought naturopathy to America and established the first naturopathic college (the Yungborn Health Institute in New Jersey). Based on a foundation of six principles, naturopathic medicine brings together modern, scientific and empirical methods to evaluate and treat a variety of acute and chronic health conditions. Naturopathic physicians work to identify the underlying cause of disease or dysfunction, by looking at the whole patient\u2014mind, body and spirit\u2014in addition to the presenting symptoms. This approach helps the naturopathic physician develop individualized care plans that seek to balance the least harmful course of treatment with the body's ability to return to optimal health. Foundational Principles of Naturopathic Medicine: First do no harm: A naturopathic medical treatment plan favors non-invasive but effective methods, with the goal of little to no adverse side effects. The healing power of nature: Naturopathic physicians facilitate the body's innate healing process by removing obstacles to cure, and identifying treatments that promote a return to health. Identify and treat the causes: Naturopathic physicians treat the underlying causes of illness\u2014not just the symptoms\u2014which are thought to be the result of an imbalance among the mental, physical and emotional aspects of being. Doctor as teacher: The Latin root of doctor is docere meaning \"to teach.\" The primary role of the naturopathic physician is to educate, empower and inspire patients to take actions that support good health. Treat the whole person: Naturopathic physicians focus on treating the patient first versus the disease or symptom. Treatments are tailored to the individual's symptom profile taking all aspects of the patient into account. Prevention: Preventing disease is more effective\u2014cost- and otherwise\u2014than treating an illness. Naturopathic medicine seeks to uncover patterns or vulnerabilities and work with patients on the lifestyle, nutritional or other changes to stave off disease. Key to naturopathic practice is the doctor-patient relationship. Naturopathic physicians typically spend 60-90 minutes during the first office visit to help uncover the root cause of health issues.
