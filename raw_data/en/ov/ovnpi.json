WHAT ARETHE RESEARCH NEEDS? WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2001 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:10 p.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Gilman, Morella, Shays, Lewis, Otter, LaTourette, Waxman, Owens, Sanders, Norton, Cummings,Kucinich, Clay, Watson, and Lynch. Staff present: Kevin Binger, staff director; David A. Kass, Mark Corallo, director of communications; S.

Mr. B URTON . Good afternoon. The quorum being present, the Committee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unani-mous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' written and open- ing statements be included in the record. And without objection, soordered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits and ex-traneous or tabular material being referred to be included in therecord. Without objection, so ordered. We are here today to look at comprehensive medical care for bio- terrorism exposure. There are several treatments suggested to pro-tect individuals who have been exposed to biological agents such asanthrax and smallpox. We have vaccines. We have antibiotics andother drugs. We also have complementary and alternative treat-ments and nutritional approaches that can supplement conven-tional treatments. This area has not been discussed very much. The medical community is now expected to be on the lookout for anthrax, smallpox and other possible biological terrorism agents.The public is looking for answers on what they can do to protectthemselves. People want more information than they are getting. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar turning to the Internet for answers about what to do to protect themselves and their families. There is a lot of very good information on the Internet. There 's also some very bad information on the Internet. It 's hard for the layman to tell the good from the bad. And that 's why it 's so impor- tant for people to get advice from their doctors and other qualifiedhealth experts. Some unscrupulous people have been advertisingalternative products on the Internet as a cure for anthrax. We havefound no evidence to support any of these claims. The leading die-tary supplement association has issued a statement to make it veryclear that there is no dietary supplement known to cure anthraxand it is illegal to make such a claim. I applaud them for doingthat. The vast majority of the supplement manufacturers have al-ways behaved very responsibly and this is another example of that. We want to clear up some of these issues today. We will be look- ing at how much we know about the safety and efficacy of all treat-ments of potential use in a bioterrorist attack. At the same time, there are complementary and nutritional ap- proaches that may help minimize some of the side effects of con-ventional treatments like antibiotics. There are also some nutri-tional approaches that may improve the outcome of the conven-tional treatments. There is research evidence in both of theseareas. This fall anthrax spores were mailed to several media outlets and congressional offices. As a result, four people have died andseveral individuals are ill from either inhalation or cutaneous an-thrax. We are fortunate that we have some very good antibioticsavailable and that doctors were able to save the lives of several an-thrax victims. Today as a precautionary measure thousands of indi-viduals are now on antibiotics, and it 's very important for those at risk to continue their antibiotics under their doctor 's care. All antibiotics can leave patients vulnerable for other infections, and some antibiotics have more severe side effects than others. Infact, Cipro has serious side effects associated with it. According tothe information provided on the Bayer Web site, that is the pro-ducer of the product, expected side effects include nausea, diarrhea,vomiting, abdominal pain, discomfort, headache, rash and restless-ness. In rare cases, Cipro may cause more serious side effects thanthese. Let me repeat, it 's important for patients who have been pre- scribed this antibiotic to follow their doctor 's advice. While these side effects are usually rare, patients need to be fully informed ofwhat they can expect when taking this or other products and whatthey can do to maximize the benefit while reducing the risks. Wewill be hearing today from Dr. Reg McDaniel and Dr. SherwoodGorbach, both experts in the area of nutrition and immunology. Vaccines are another area where the public needs more informa- tion. For instance, the Government Reform Committee has done ex-tensive oversight investigations about the Department of Defense 's anthrax vaccine immunization program. And I 'd like to thank Con- gressman Shays, who I think will be with us in a little bit, for hisdiligence in this area. We have all heard in the media the DOD talking about giving everyone in the country the anthrax vaccination. People who advo- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 't have all of the facts. In the military, the rate of ad- verse events from the vaccines has been very high. A few peoplehave been very seriously injured. The company that makes thisvaccine has a deplorable track record. There 's also many, many questions about the effectiveness of this vaccine. There are manydifferent strains of anthrax, and whether this vaccine would protectpeople from all of those strains is an open question. So I don 't want people to have a false sense of security thinking that the vaccinewould protect every one of them against these various strains. As we learned during vaccine investigations, there 's not always a lot of definitive science in vaccine development. Even the Insti-tute of Medicine agrees on this point. Every time the Institute ofMedicine has reviewed the body of research evidence on specificvaccines, their experts have pointed out significant shortcomings inthe evidence. Some of the information on the Internet recommends using ho- meopathic remedies to protect against biological terrorism. We willhear today from Dr. Wayne Jonas about the research he conductedat Walter Reed Army Research Center on homeopathic solutionsand biological agents. He has published several studies in thisarea. Because of his expertise in complementary and alternativemedicine and research methodology, Dr. Jonas was loaned by theArmy to the National Institutes of Health for 3 years to serve asthe Director of the Office of Alternative Medicine. While he is re-tired from the Army, Dr. Jonas is continuing his research as theDirector of the Samueli Institute for Information Biology. Dr. Jonasis also a member of the White House Commission on Complemen-tary and Alternative Medicine Policy. We have a lot of questions that need to be answered today. No. 1, what is the evidence base for safety and efficacy for various pre-ventative and post-exposure treatment options? What is the evi-dence base about nutritional support for the immune system andfor patients on antibiotics? What is the role of homeopathy, essen-tial oils, dietary supplements and other complementary and otheralternative therapies in biological terrorist prevention and recov-ery? Has our government embraced existing science and historicalcase studies and looked to maximize low cost, low harm immunesupportive theories? Has our government looked at other systemsof medicine for promising therapies? And where does the public goto find reliable information on these therapies? Three themes are crucial as we move forward from September 11. First, we must think outside the box. Second, we must work to-gether. And third, information is power. First, let 's think outside the box. Solutions to protecting the pub- lic from biological warfare cannot be found in any existing ''how to '' manual. We are not going to be able to develop vaccines to protectthe public against every possible biological threat. We need to knowhow to take care of those who have not been vaccinated. Second, we must put aside our differences and work together. We as a nation, as a world, must set aside our political differences. Wemust set aside biases against those whose ideas are different fromour own and work together to find safe, effective and available so-lutions to the challenges we face as a result of the evils of terror-ism. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 government and the research community must move away from attacking those who would use nutritional approachesand complementary therapies in healing and keep an open mindabout theories that we may be unfamiliar with. We must work to-gether to determine the existing level of evidence on both safetyand efficacy on all therapies and then move quickly to fill in theresearch gaps. And third, information is power. It is important to put good in- formation in the hands of the medical community and the public.How can we get answers quickly and with some measure of con-fidence? Dr. Richard Klasco is here today to talk about one possible solu- tion. As an emergency room physician, Dr. Klasco knows how cru-cial it is to have accurate information at your fingertips in unusualcircumstances. Micromedex is a company that markets the elec-tronic Physician 's Desk Reference [PDR], and numerous drug, toxi- cology and alternative medicine data bases. They have recently de-veloped a data base on bioterrorism. BioDex provides the full arrayof information needed by first responders and medical personnel forbiological terrorism agents. The data base will be Web accessible.It can be purchased on CD or loaded into hand-held ''palm '' com- puters as well. From the government, we are going to receive testimony from Major General Parker on behalf of the Department of Defense; alsoDr. Straus, the Director of the National Center on Complementaryand Alternative Medicine; and Carole Heilman from the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will be testifying. Wealso have Dr. Andrea Meyerhoff and Dr. William Egan from theFDA to answer questions. I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today, and the record will remain open until November 28. And with that Mr. Waxman, I will recognize you.[The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing today. It is critical that we take seriouslythe threat of biological terrorism. The list of biological agents thatcould be used as weapons is terrifying. Smallpox, a disease that was eradicated just over 2 decades ago, is highly contagious and fatal in about 30 percent of the cases. An-thrax, as we have recently seen, can cause fatal illnesses. Other po-tential biological weapons include botulism toxoid, Q fever, plagueand tularemia. We now know that threats are no longer theoretical. The possi- bility that there may be more cases of anthrax in the future or thatthere may be new attacks with different agents must be taken seri-ously and we must be prepared. These preparations involve makingsure we have adequate stockpiles of safe and effective treatmentsand vaccines as well as systems for distributing the drugs and vac-cines. Preparations also involve making sure that State and localhealth departments are well staffed and fully equipped to handlea chemical or biological weapons attack, and we have to ensurethat we have sufficient hospital capacity. We also need to make sure that people are informed about what to do in case of an attack and where they can go to get reliable in-formation. This includes, for example, an understanding of whethersomeone needs to take antibiotics or other drugs in the absence ofsymptoms without confirmed exposure to an agent. People alsoneed to understand what the side effects of these treatments couldbe. We do not have treatments or vaccines for every possible biologi- cal agent. It is clear that we need to continue to do research in thisarea to make sure that Americans will be protected against thesepotential threats. All possible treatments or preventions, includingpharmaceuticals, vaccines or dietary supplements, need to meetstrict scientific standards for both safety and efficacy. Americansdeserve the most effective, safest treatments science can produce. And I thank the witnesses for appearing today. I look forward to their testimony, and I do want to point out that we will be review-ing all the testimony that is submitted. Unfortunately my scheduleis in conflict because I have meetings going on at the same time,so I may not be here to hear your testimony. But rest assured thatmy staff is here and I will have an opportunity to review what wassaid as well as the written statements that will be put into therecord. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Do other Members have opening statements? Mr. S ANDERS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an important hearing. It seems to me that on one hand we certainly don 't want to frighten the American people, but on the other hand, we wouldbe irresponsible if we did not go through the dreadful exercise oflooking at worst case scenarios and seeing how can we best protectthe American people in the event of some terrible, terrible outrageagainst this country. Some of the concerns that I have, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Wax- man I think touched on it, is if we ran through some worst casescenarios where many millions of people might be made ill on agiven day, do we as a nation have the public health infrastructure VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar that? Now, can one just imagine the kind of panic and concern that would take place all over this country? People wantinginformation, people wanting medicine, perhaps vaccines. Where dowe get those? Do we as a nation have adequate stockpiles of that? We have heard, for example \u2014and this is not a criticism because I think, as the chairman indicated, we are into new territory. We 've never been there before. We are all trying to learn and do the bestthing, and I applaud the efforts of everyone who is trying to do theright thing. But I think even in terms of anthrax, I heard withina period of a couple of days several different analyses and descrip-tions of what is the proper thing to do. Some people say take Ciprofor 60 days. Some people say, well, take Cipro for 5 days anddoxycycline for the rest of the period. Some people say, well, takedoxyclcyline all throughout. So I think we have an obligation as a government to make clear to the American people what is the best course of treatment. Therewere some people that think, oh, I guess Cipro is good for thewealthy people. But if I 'm poor, we just get the lower-cost drug. I don't think that 's the case, but what is the case? What is the best and effective form of treatment for all people? Getting back to the issue of public health infrastructure, the truth is that in many ways our country is very advanced medically,but in other ways we are fairly primitive medically. We have 44million Americans who do not have health insurance. Others areunderinsured. Where are they going to get their medicine? Do theyhave to line up at a local drugstore? I was talking to somebody inVermont. We are a very rural State. And they said, the drugstoreswill be open. Sure, we have a town of 1,000 people and some elder-ly gentleman owns a drugstore. Do you really think that he isgoing to be able to deal with people besieging the drugstore? Doeshe have adequate supplies? Should we be dependent on pharmaciesto be distributing drugs or do we need a public health approach?Do we have adequate numbers of clinics? I don 't agree with President Bush on many things, but the Presi- dent has indicated his support for federally qualified health clinics,FQHCs. In fact, these are cost effective ways of providing healthcare to lower income people all over this country. I think we canagree that in the event of a national emergency, when millions andmillions of people need health care, you are not going to ask some-body, well, where is your Blue Cross/Blue Shield card? I 'm sorry, we can 't treat you. Every American has got to know that they equally, whether you are rich or poor, will get the same type of treatment. Are we pre-pared to do that today? Frankly, I don 't think we are. So I think we have to look at the health infrastructure, the public health in-frastructure, so that we can dispense the kinds of drugs and vac-cines that we need, give people the information, give people thetreatment. The difficulty here is, and it is a nightmarish issue sce-nario that we have got to look at, is that on a given day millionsand millions and millions of people may need medical treatment.Are we prepared to do that? I suspect we are not. Mr. Chairman, you and I disagree on many issues but I do ap- plaud you raising the issue of complementary health care and al-ternative health care. I think there is a lot to be learned from that, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar the same time I think we have got to make sure that we have available drugs. For example, I think the Secretary had comeup with \u2014what was it, Dustin \u201412 million people in terms of an an- thrax attack. Why 12 million and not 30 million? Who made thatdetermination? So I think what 's important today is to take a hard look at some very ugly, frightening circumstances and do our bestto make sure that the American people are as prepared as they canbe, and I thank you for calling this meeting, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Sanders. Further discussion? If not, I would like to invite to the witness table Major General Parker,Dr. Stephen Straus, Dr. Carole Heilman and Dr. Andrea Meyer-hoff. Would you please come to the witness table, please. And Dr.Egan, I guess you need to be sworn as well. Would you stand aswell? [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . I think we will go right down the table. Major Gen- eral Parker, is there an opening statement you would like to make,sir? STATEMENTS OF MAJOR GENERAL JOHN S. PARKER, U.S. ARMY MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUSDISEASES, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; STEPHEN STRAUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARYAND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; CAROLE HEILMAN, PH.D., DI-RECTOR, DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFEC-TIOUS DISEASES; ANDREA MEYERHOFF, M.D., DIRECTOR OFANTI-TERRORISM PROGRAMS, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS RE-SEARCH AND REVIEW, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION;AND WILLIAM EGAN, PH.D., DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF VACCINERESEARCH AND REVIEW, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRA-TION General P ARKER . Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of this committee. I am Major General John Parker and today I rep-resent the Department of Defense at this hearing. Sir, we submit-ted testimony to you for this hearing and I am concerned that itdid not address your questions of the committee. I received thosequestions yesterday morning, and I would appreciate the chair-man's indulgence and allow me to resubmit within the next 96 hours testimony that addresses your questions in a very specificmanner. Meanwhile, I will address your questions orally from mypersonal perspective as the Commander of the U.S. Army MedicalResearch and Materiel Command and Fort Detrick. The September 11th and the multiple anthrax attacks that oc- curred since then are only a small indication of the potential de-struction and harm that a biological agent can produce. Terrorism,specifically biological terrorism, is an immediate threat to our secu-rity both at home and abroad. As our Nation addresses this terrify-ing threat that has invaded our homeland, the Department of De-fense is prepared to assist and to support other Federal and civil-ian agencies as our capability permits. We can do this because we have already developed the force health protection program that includes not only acknowledgmentof the threat, but also development and implementation of a VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar to the medical management of bio- logical warfare casualties. I would now like to turn to the specific questions that were iden- tified in your invitation to this testimony. The question: Currentrecommendations for medical care for individuals both at risk forexposure and those suspected or known to have been exposed tothe most common biological agents. Several military publicationsprovide information on the medical management of biological war-fare casualties. These serve as guidelines and references for healthcare providers in handling biological warfare casualties. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues medical guidance in their weekly publication, Morbidity andMortality Weekly Report, and in special publications for variousevents. Pocket-sized handbooks designed to fit in the battle dressuniform pockets are routinely published and provided to militaryhealth care personnel as field expedient references in the manage-ment of nuclear, biological and chemical casualties. Some of theseinclude Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbookand Defense Against Toxin Weapons. In my testimony, I hope to send two tables to be included, one entitled Biological Warfare Agent Characteristics and the other en-titled Biological Warfare Agent Treatment. These are, in fact, ap-pendices from the Medical Management of Biological CasualtiesHandbook and address many of the questions identified. A field manual has been developed to provide detailed guidance to health care providers. The most recent addition of Field Manual8-284, titled Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties, was published in July 2000. This field manual provides in-depth in-formation for the management of these types of casualties. Themanual focuses on medical response to biological warfare weaponsused against military personnel during military operations. Agent-specific medical preventive and treatment regimens are offered forhealth care providers. On your second question, an analysis of research evidence on known treatments, including vaccines, antibiotics and other ap-proaches, the existing evidence on effectiveness of vaccines andantibiotics for prevention or treatment of disease caused by biologi-cal threat agents comes from two sources. The first is in the pre-vention or treatment of human disease in occupational or naturaldisease settings. As noted by the Centers of Disease Control andPrevention in their publication Biosafety and Microbiological andMicrobiomedical Laboratories, that publication has a number93A395, the use of vaccines has reduced the number of laboratory-acquired infections for a number of agents. They particularly notethat no laboratory-associated cases of anthrax have been reportedin the United States since the late 1950 's, when human anthrax vaccine was introduced. In the case of the anthrax vaccine, actual clinical field studies were conducted in which the efficacy of the vaccine in reducing cu- taneous anthrax in woolen mill workers was demonstrated. Thevaccine also appeared to reduce the number of pulmonary anthraxcases, but the numbers were insufficient to achieve good statisticalsignificance. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 to the antibiotic treatment, much experience has been gained over the years in treating natural occurrences of thedisease caused by various threat agents. For example, bubonicplague, tularemia and cutaneous anthrax occur routinely in hu-mans in the Midwest and western United States. Similarly the use of Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been tested clinically around the world with several viral hemorrhagic fevers,including Lassa fever and Congo Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Themedical community has experience in antibiotic and antiviral ther-apy of these disease presentations. In addition, the sensitivity of bi-ological threat bacteria to various antibiotics can be tested in vitroin the laboratory. Such testing can provide a good indication ofwhich drugs are likely to be effective in treating human disease. The second source of evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines and therapies comes from studies in animal models. In the laboratory,animals can be immunized with vaccines and then exposed to thebiological agent either by injection or by aerosol. Because the bat-tlefield threat is believed to be from an aerosol, large scale deliveryof a biological warfare agent, this is the critical route by whichtesting may be performed. It is almost the most difficult route, andvery few organizations have the facilities or trained personnel toaccomplish this type of research. Obviously, there are inherent limitations in what can be achieved in the laboratory, but in general we are able to challengeanimals with many hundreds or even thousands of lethal doses ofbiological threat agent and assess the protection afforded by a vac-cine. Protection against an aerosol challenge is one of the criticalrequirements of our vaccine candidates. In order to translate the results obtained in animal studies to the effectiveness in humans, we identify and develop surrogate mark-ers of protection that we can measure in humans and use as abasis for inference of protection. Animal models are also used toverify the effectiveness of antibiotics and antivirals that are identi-fied in vitro screening. This is the same standard practice that isused by the pharmaceutical industry. Sir, I have a long paragraph about our comprehensive list of DOD-funded research addressing vaccines, and I would like to sub-mit that testimony rather than read that. Mr. B URTON . That will be fine. Do you have quite a bit more in our opening statement, General? General P ARKER . I just would like to read our recommendations on research needed to fill the gaps, if that 's possible. Thank you for allowing me to do this. Recent events have certainly eliminated gaps in our knowledge of medical countermeasures for biological threat agents. In the con-text of chemical and biological terrorism, the Institute of Medicinein 1999 provided recommendations in their study, Research andDevelopment to Improve Civilian Medical Response, which are asrelevant today as they were then. The study identified needs for vaccines, effective drugs, diagnostic technologies, patient manage-ment paradigms and many other facets of the response to bioterror-ism. Many of these recommendations are being acted upon nation-ally, but progress takes time. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 become strikingly apparent as a result of the cur- rent situation, and that is for a national capability to test andevaluate emerging products, existing products, and new tech-nologies for their effectiveness in the prevention, treatment, detec-tion, diagnosis and decontamination of biological threat agents orthe diseases caused by them. As I mentioned earlier, a critical element in evaluation of any of the medical countermeasures is testing and evaluation in animalmodels, and in particular, the capacity to expose animals to the dis-ease-causing agent in the form of an aerosol. Our national capabil-ity to perform these studies and others that necessitate the use ofcontainment laboratories and handling of hazardous biologicalagents is extremely constrained. Rather than enumerate specificstudies that need to be performed sooner rather than later, I wouldlike to identify this shortfall in capability containment laboratories,certain species of animals, trained personnel and the funds re-quired to support them. This is a critical gap. Thank you very much, sir, for allowing me to read in the testi- mony. [The prepared statement of General Thank you, General. We have three votes pending on the floor, and I really apologize because it is going to take usprobably 25 to 30 minutes before we get back. We will stand in re-cess until the fall of the gavel and we should be back here a littleafter 2 o 'clock. So if any of you want to do something for about 30 minutes, make yourselves at home. We will be right back. Thankyou. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . The committee will reconvene. Other Members are on their way back from the floor, so we 'll get to them as soon as they arrive. Dr. Straus, would you like to make your opening statement?Dr. S TRAUS . Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I submitted fuller testimony. I 'll make some brief open- ing remarks and await your questions. As a physician who for the past 25 years I have specialized in the care of patients with severe and life-threatening infections andas a public health official, I fully support the current CDC rec-ommendations for managing potential exposure to and infection byanthrax. The success of current efforts to locate and disinfect con-taminated sites and dispense effective antibiotics to those exposedis evidenced by the small numbers of infected persons and the evensmaller numbers, fortunately, of serious illnesses or deaths thathave resulted from such exposures. The specific question you asked me to address today, Mr. Chair- man, in my capacity as director of the National Center for Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine [NCCAM] is whether thereare additional health tools and practices that could effectively serveas alternatives or as complements to those ones already imple-mented to prevent or treat diseases from biological weapons. Many of these alternative approaches were displaced by the emergence of evidenced-based medicine. Before the articulation ofthe germ theory of disease in the late 19th century and the subse-quent development of vaccines and antibiotics, people believed thatspecific rituals and selected herbal extracts and tonics would, incurrent parlance, eliminate the offending pathogens or boost one 's resistance to them. In fact, a characteristic shared by many of thetraditional healing systems of indigenous peoples, such asAyurvedic medicine, various forms of oriental medicine and themore recently developed systems, like Naturopathy, is an emphasison maximizing the body 's inherent capacity to heal itself. While augmenting one 's own natural healing powers may prove beneficial for some diseases and is the focus of much of the workfunded today by the NCCAM, there is no scientific basis to believethat this approach would be of value in the context of virulent dis-eases incited by biological weapons. From the perspective of contemporary immunology, diseases like anthrax, smallpox and tularemia exceed one 's innate immunity to control them and progress too rapidly for specific and protectiveantibody and lymphocyte responses to evolve. Simply stated, Mr.Chairman, they can kill us before we can arm ourselves fully to de-fend against them. Had the traditional healing rituals and natural products avail- able to pre-20th century man been truly effective, our history VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar different. Through the availability of clean- er water, uncontaminated foodstuffs and vaccines and antibiotics,human life span has increased by a greater proportion in the pastcentury than through all recorded history up to that time. Despite these impressive public health achievements, people still turn today to natural products, hoping for them to help mitigate in-fections. While these may be justifiable decisions as regards milderand more self-limiting conditions, we must discourage any assump-tion that these products can serve in lieu of proven drugs likeciprofloxacin or doxycycline for people exposed to anthrax bacilli. Itmay even not be prudent to combine such natural products withantibiotics because of the possibility that they would interfere withthe proper metabolism and action of drugs. For example, calcium supplements have been shown to reduce the body 's content of ciprofloxacin by over 40 percent. Even though there is some doubt that certain approaches involving herbs, home-opathic medicines, essential oils or colloidal silver could be effectivefor diseases like anthrax or smallpox, we cannot prove the claimsto be entirely specious. It would be unethical and dangerous towithhold drug and vaccines in order to see whether the alternativeremedies protect people who become exposed. Exploration of suchexposures should first involve careful studies in animals using con-temporary methodologies to discern whether they hold any promiseagainst diseases associated with biological weapons. In the interim,however, lacking any competent evidence that they work, theclaims about these products are dangerous both to the individualwho uses them and to the population in general who might becomeinfected if some others refuse standard treatments. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, in the instance of bioterrorism, the best approach is to manifest, as I do, an unwavering trust in thecurrently approved drugs and vaccines and not to dissipate our en-ergies or to distract the public by pursuing unproven remedies. Thestakes are simply too high at this time of national emergency todo otherwise. I would be happy to take any questions you may have about NCCAM 's responses to bioterrorism. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. H EILMAN . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the medical re-sponse to bioterrorism as well as current efforts by the NIH to fa-cilitate basic and clinical research related to the prevention andtreatment of bioterrorism agents. In just the past 2 months wehave witnessed the deliberate mailing of spores of anthrax, includ-ing the exposure of members of this esteemed body to this deadlybacterium. Federal health agencies have responded by evaluatingand accelerating measures to protect the public from the healthconsequences of such an attack. Today I will describe one component of the national effort. As part of the NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases supports research on the diagnosis, prevention and treat-ment of infections caused by a wide variety of pathogens, includingorganisms of bioterrorism such as anthrax, smallpox, plague, tula-remia, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and botulism. To meet the challenges posed by bioterrorism, especially to civil- ians, NIH supports research in the basic biology and disease-caus-ing mechanisms of pathogens, the development of rapid and sen-sitive diagnostic tools, the creation of new vaccines using both tra-ditional and novel technologies and the design of new therapeuticagents. To address the specific interest of this committee, I haveprovided you a compendium of NIH-funded research and a bibliog-raphy of published research articles related to vaccines and treat-ments of potential agents of bioterrorism in appendices A and B,respectively, of the written testimony. The current recommenda-tions for medical care of a wide variety of potential agents of bio-terrorism can be found in appendix C. Appendix D is a copy of theHealth and Human Services ' action plan on antimicrobial resist- ance. I would like to spend the remainder of my time providing exam- ples of the research efforts that have been initiated and acceleratedfor two bioterrorist threats of particular concern, smallpox and an-thrax. Smallpox is considered one of the most dangerous potentialbiological weapons, because it is easily transmitted from person toperson and because few people carry full immunity to the virus.Smallpox vaccine has proven to be highly effective in preventing in-fection and was an essential factor in the global eradication ofsmallpox in 1977. Vaccinations to prevent smallpox have not been required in the United States since 1972. In the near term, a bioterrorist attack in-volving smallpox would require the utilization of stores of the exist-ing smallpox vaccine to protect those at immediate risk. The cur-rent stock of Dryvax vaccine, approximately 15 million doses, clear-ly would not be enough to respond to a national smallpox epidemic. Last year, NIAID conducted a study to determine whether this vaccine had maintained its potency over the years. As a next step,we wanted to determine if a diluted vaccine, combined with an al-ternative vaccination schedule, could protect a greater number ofpeople than does the standard dose and regimen. Earlier thismonth, we initiated a new smallpox vaccine study that is designedto compare the use of a 1-to -5 dilution or -10 dilution in undi- revaccination schedule. This should VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 by January, which may help guide us on how to use the remaining stockpile of smallpox vaccine if needed, to pro-tect the general population. NIAID is also designing other protocols for clinical testing of Dryvax and the newer cell-cultured smallpox vaccines for use inother segments of the population. At the same time, we are lookinginto alternative vaccine strategies with the goal of designing saferand more effective vaccines. NIAID is also accelerating efforts to identify antiviral drugs that will be effective in treating smallpox and related viruses. One ofthese agents is an antiviral called cidofovir, which has shown po-tential activity against smallpox and related viruses in test tubestudies and in animal models. NIH has taken the lead in develop-ing a protocol that would allow the use of cidofovir in emergencysituations. As we have seen in recent weeks, anthrax is another agent that deserves our attention as a bioterrorist threat. Human anthrax hasthree major clinical forms \u2014cutaneous, inhalation and gastro- intestinal. If left untreated, anthrax in all of these forms can leadto septicemia and death. Anthrax vaccine adsorbed [AVA], is theonly currently licensed anthrax vaccine and is used solely by theDepartment of Defense to protect U.S. military personnel in high-threat areas. NIAID has been working with DOD to support the de-velopment of the next generation of anthrax vaccines that may bemore appropriate than AVA for use in a civilian population. In collaboration with other government agencies, NIH is working to prioritize and accelerate testing of promising candidates for useas antimicrobial therapies for anthrax in order to increase the poolof available treatments. Novel antitoxins approaches are also underdevelopment. An example of this work has just recently been pub-lished in the scientific journal, Nature. Much remains to be accom-plished, however, and the challenges posed by bioterrorism will re-quire a protracted and sustained commitment. The NIH will announce in the next few weeks several new initia- tives to provide the academic and industrial research communitywith an opportunity to propose studies targeting new approachesconcerning bioterrorism research. The submission, review, andfunding of these proposals will be expedited in order to facilitatethe rapid advance of these important research endeavors. With a strong research base, talented investigators throughout the country, and the availability of powerful new research tools, wefully expect that our basic and applied research programs will pro-vide the essential elements that will help enhance our defenseagainst those who attempt to harm us with bioterrorism. Thankyou. Mr. B URTON . Heilman. Mr. B URTON . I had it right the first time. [The prepared statement of Ms. Heilman follows:] VerDate go to Dr. Meyerhoff, Ben Gilman, the chairman emeritus of the International Realtions Committee, hasa brief statement he 'd like to make. Mr. G ILMAN . Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I regret I'm being pulled away to another hearing, but I want to thank you and the committee for conducting these extensive hearings on bio-terrorism; and our committee has been one of the leading commit-tees in doing the oversight on what our Nation is prepared to doto take care of the problem. The September 11th attacks in NewYork, Pennsylvania and Virginia and the subsequent breakouts ofanthrax around the country raised the issue of bioterrorism to ahigh level. With regards to vaccines and remedies against various biological agents such as smallpox and cholera, there 's a tremendous amount of medical information that we already know, but there 's still a great deal more that we should know and that we should be doing.The American public has been inundated with information aboutanthrax and smallpox, some of it accurate, some not so accurate.Doctors and pharmacists are having to learn about these illnessesas they present themselves, as the margin for error or a misdiagno-sis is so great. The American public needs to know that their health profes- sionals are prepared to handle a biological crisis, and I want tothank you for bringing these expert witnesses before us, and we 're eager to learn how the defense and medical communities are pre-pared for any attack of this nature, what we 've learned from the most recent attacks and what still needs to be done to further pre-pare us accordingly. Mr. Chairman, again I thank you for arranging these hearings. I regret I 'm going to have to run to another hearing, and I 'll try to return as quickly as possible. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Gilman. And now we 'll hear from Dr. Meyerhoff. Dr. M EYERHOFF . Thank you. I am here to answer questions, and I am joined by Dr. William Eagan, also from FDA. Mr. B URTON . OK. So you 're prepared to answer questions, but you don 't have a statement? Dr. M EYERHOFF . That 's right. Mr. B URTON . OK. Fine. Let me start off with General Parker. In your written testimony, you reference that the Department uses passive and active countermeasures to protect our troops, andyou mentioned pretreatments, therapies, timely detectors and effec-tive protective equipment. During our previous committee hearingswe had last year, we learned that DOD had to recall most of theirprotective gear and masks. Has all this gear been replaced? General P ARKER . Mr. Chairman, respectfully, I 'd asked to come back to the answer with that question. Mr. B URTON . OK. General P ARKER . I am not in that part of the world to acquire garments and masks, but I will answer that question off the record. Mr. B URTON . OK. If you could have somebody get that back. General P ARKER . I will. Mr. B URTON . OK. We know there are numerous potential biologi- agents \u2014anthrax, smallpox, In your written testimony, you mention that we only have licensed vaccines for one biological agent, that beinganthrax. However, the medical NBC battle book, which we havehere, which is given to medical personnel states that 14 possiblebiological agents have vaccines, including anthrax, cholera, plague,tularemia, typhoid fever, Q-fever, botulism, toxin and smallpox. Italso states that seven other agents have vaccines in development. Are all these vaccines that are mentioned in the battle book li- censed vaccines; and if not, what specific measures are taken to ad-vise members of the military about their participation in humansubject research? General P ARKER . Sir, the vaccines mentioned other than the an- thrax vaccine have not been licensed. They fall into the categoryof investigational new drugs, which means that if you take thatvaccine, it has to be under a protocol with a principal investigatorleading that protocol and informed consent is used, of the individ-ual. Now, we use a lot of those vaccines in our research program be- cause our researchers and scientists who are dealing with thosepathogens like tularemia, plague, Rift Valley fever, a lot of thethings that you mentioned, have to be protected in their laboratoryfrom the agent. And we give them the investigational new drugvaccine and follow them in our special immunization program, butthey are not fully licensed with the FDA for use on the public. Mr. B URTON . Well, these vaccines are mentioned in this book. If they're not ready for use by the military, why are they mentioned? General P ARKER . They 're mentioned, sir, because in a contin- gency or a crisis, we could invoke the protocol for those who wereinfected or threatened to be infected by those agents and makethem part of the research group of the investigational new drug.And in that particular case, we would have to go to each individualand explain what their situation was and that this drug was avail-able and here 's all the things that we know about that drug or vac- cine, but it is not licensed; and you would have to be essentiallya subject to a research experiment. Mr. B URTON . In a few minutes, you 're going to hear from Dr. Wayne Jonas, a retired Army doctor who conducted research in anArmy laboratory and published and peer reviewed a scientific jour-nal showing that homeopathy could be utilized with tularemia. What have you done at Fort Detrick to capitalize on this re- search? General P ARKER . Mr. Chairman, I would say that we probably have done nothing to capitalize on that research, except to knowabout it. Mr. B URTON . Well, if there is a disease that the military might be faced with and there was a published journal or paper showingthat some product was helpful or had a cure rate, why wouldn 't they check into that? General P ARKER . Mr. Chairman, we pursue the use of fully li- censed or fully approved drugs under the Food and Drug Adminis-tration for the use of our forces, to use on our forces. And so forthat particular reason, I would say to you that we use the Food andDrug Administration as our regulating and licensing agency, andif a product isn 't in some queue with the Food and Drug Adminis- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 investigational new drug protocol or li- censed, we don 't anticipate using that on the service members in the Department of Defense. Mr. B URTON . Homeopathy is fully licensed and regulated by the FDA, and I guess I 'm a little at a loss here. If this paper has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and it shows thatthis could be helpful in this particular situation, I don 't understand why the military hasn 't looked at that. You have to wait till the FDA gives its approval on that; is that correct? General P ARKER . That 's correct, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Meyerhoff, could you respond to that? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Generally, the sponsor of a product would come to us and ask us to review the safety and efficacy data of a particu-lar product. We 're not currently aware of any particular homeo- pathic remedy for tularemia, but we would certainly be willing toreview that information if it were brought to our attention. Mr. B URTON . Well, when something is published in a peer-re- viewed journal, scientific journal, you don 't review that and then take action on it? You wait until somebody submits it to you? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Generally that 's the way that proceeds. Mr. B URTON . That 's surprising. I just don 't understand why, if it looks like there 's something that 's very promising and has some very beneficial effect, why wouldn 't the FDA go ahead and take the initiative to check that out, especially if it 's published in a scientific journal? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Generally, a product is brought to our attention by a sponsor \u2014an individual or an organization or a business \u2014that is intending to manufacture or use the product; and it 's at that point that those data are presented to us, and that 's when we re- view them. Mr. B URTON . Do you have many homeopathic, or remedies like that, that are brought to you, other than, say, it 's things that are brought to you by pharmaceutical companies? Dr. M EYERHOFF . I'm not aware of any. Mr. B URTON . So unless it 's brought to you by a pharmaceutical company, you normally don 't take action on it? Dr. M EYERHOFF . No. A product could be sponsored by any num- ber of potential organizations or individuals, academic investiga-tors, other government agencies or a pharmaceutical company. Mr. B URTON . But, in fact, you don 't know of any that have been sponsored, other than by pharmaceutical companies? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Perhaps I misunderstood your question. I 'm not aware of any homeopathic remedies for that \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . That have been licensed by you? Dr. M EYERHOFF . That 's correct. Mr. B URTON . So unless it was submitted by a pharmaceutical company, you probably wouldn 't have taken any action on it? Dr. M EYERHOFF . A pharmaceutical company or an academic in- vestigator or \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, has there been any academic investigations on homeopathic remedies that have been brought to you? Dr. M EYERHOFF . No. I 'm not aware of any. Mr. B URTON . Oh, OK. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Kucinich. Mr. K UCINICH . First of all, I want to thank the Chair for his on- going interest in trying to advance the cause of humanity by mak-ing sure that people are aware of emerging practices in health careand making people aware of broader choices in health care and of-fering the possibility of increasing public awareness of other thanallopathic practices. I think the chairman did you a service, and I want to congratu- late him for that. I 'd also like to continue to pursue the line of questioning, perhaps with Dr. Meyerhoff. Is it of interest to the FDA or to you that there may be alter- native or complementary approaches to medicine that may providerelief under certain circumstances to people who are affected by awide range of diseases, some of which might be connected to a bio-logical event? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Yes, it is, and we would be very willing to look at those data. Mr. K UCINICH . You just haven 't done it yet, because the question hasn 't really arisen. Is that \u2014\u2014 Dr. M EYERHOFF . That 's correct. Mr. K UCINICH . But you 're not averse to considering the possibili- ties of alternative medicine to deal with any particular health crisisthat would confront the American people? Dr. M EYERHOFF . That 's true. We would be happy to review any data that 's presented to us for either safety or efficacy. Mr. K UCINICH . Now, your role is just \u2014you've mentioned it sev- eral times \u2014happy to review any data. Do you ever initiate any study or initiate any action in a search for alternatives, or are youpretty much bound by medicine as it 's described by allopathic prac- titioners and pharmaceutical companies? Dr. M EYERHOFF . As a regulatory agency, there is a limit to how much we can get involved in the actual development of a product,and generally the process is that the developer comes to us andpresents the data so that we can review it. There is a potential forconflict of interest if we go out and participate in the development. Mr. K UCINICH . I understand that, but aside \u2014you know, if we 're talking product, we 're talking pharmaceuticals. What about a prac- tice as opposed to a product? What about an approach to medicineitself that \u2014apart from a particular product, I 'm asking you. I mean, what 's your view of that? Dr. M EYERHOFF . I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? I 'm having a little trouble hearing you. Mr. K UCINICH . What I 'm asking is, when you speak of a product, you're speaking, I suppose, of pharmaceuticals. And I understand that the FDA has to, through the procedure of clinical trials, keepa distance from something until it proves itself. Now, as the chairman pointed out, there are many peer-reviewed articles which derive from complementary and alternative prac-tices. Does the FDA do anything to publicize, encourage, bring for- ward, let the public know or anything like that to let people knowthey have other choices; or are you pretty much bound by what wewould know as conventional medicine? I'm trying to find out about your scope here. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar OK. We 're focused on the approval of products, whatever those products might be. Certainly when we 're looking at some of these more unusual diseases that are presented to us bybioterrorism threats, we maintain an open-minded stance aboutwhat might be appropriate remedies for them. Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you, Doctor. If I could ask, before I 'm finished here \u2014Dr. Straus, I looked at your testimony carefully, which takes in a way a common-sense ap-proach saying, look, if we 're in a bioterrorism incident, we certainly want to use time-tested measures to treat the general public; andI think most of us would agree with that. As the Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, are you prepared to bring forward alter-natives which may provide for efficient treatment of some of thebioterrorist episodes we may have that may even be less expensive,let's say, than the pharmaceuticals which are currently being pre- scribed? Do such, to your knowledge, products exist, or are you \u2014 is it simply your position that there really are no other alternativesthan what we have conventionally? Dr. S TRAUS . Mr. Kucinich, NCCAM solicits and funds meritorious research applications in a very wide range of areas. We are specifi-cally looking for complementary and alternative approaches to neu-rological disorders, to cancer, to arthritis, mental health conditionsand infectious diseases. We are funding studies related to HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, influenza, hepatitis and several oth-ers. And we would be happy to receive and consider applicationsthat come through the new initiatives that Dr. Heilman indicatedfrom the NIH or through any other mechanism as a priority. We have had no such applications, and in the absence of what I would consider to be fairly good evidence that something is safeand effective and does not interfere with other safe and effectivetherapies, I would be loathe to deploy them. I do think that bioterror-weapon infections are a special case be- cause of their rapidity of action, their virulence and their spread;and I think we must be more cautious with issues of public healthin this setting than for many other disorders in which complemen-tary and alternative medicines may have far more to offer \u2014dis- orders of a more chronic nature, where the capacity to retain peo-ple's dignity and comfort, to reduce pain, to improve their nutri- tional status, to fight off opportunistic infections and things likethat\u2014all make a great deal of sense. Mr. K UCINICH . Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you, and I just want to address the Chair in saying that, you know, we hearreports that if we were to be subject, God forbid, to one kind of bio-logical terrorism or another, that perhaps the vaccines may not beavailable, you know, in quantity, all right; and I would think thatit might be helpful for the National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine to have plan B ready, plan A being unwaver-ing trust, ''in the currently approved drugs and vaccines; '' plan B, alternative and complementary medical approaches that in anemergency might help save lives. And I think that 's the spirit in which the Chair proceeds here. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent that my opening statement be included in therecord. Mr. B URTON . Without objection. Mrs. M ORELLA . I appreciate your calling this hearing and the se- ries of hearings that you 've been very interested in, and that has helped us all. It has become clear to us all that while the threatof bioterrorism is significant, it can be overcome with knowledge,good planning. We need a coordinated civil defense, a robust, pre-pared public health system and further development and researchinto current and future therapies. We need to integrate our hos-pital, our response system, increase our stockpiles of medicines andvaccines and recruit and train more first responders. So today 's hearing is pointing out to us medicinal treatments that are most effective and what new ones should be developed. [The prepared statement of Hon. Constance A. Morella follows:] VerDate first question is to Dr. Meyerhoff. Two weeks ago, Dr. Frank Young, remember him, he was an FDA Adminis-trator? He testified in front of the Science Committee, of which Iam also a member, and he mentioned some so-called ''urgent rec- ommendations. '' One of these recommendations was for Congress to finalize the proposed FDA regulations whereby new drug and bio-logical products used to reduce or prevent toxicity from chemical,biological and nuclear substances could be approved, even thoughthe traditional efficacy studies in humans are not feasible and can-not be ethically conducted under FDA 's regulations for adequate and well-controlled studies in humans. I would agree with the agency that this is necessary to protect, or treat individuals that are exposed to lethal or permanently dis-abling toxic substances, even when human studies have not andcannot be performed. But presently, are there treatments availablethat would help someone affected by a chemical or biological agentthat could not be used because of the present regulations? Is thisregulation familiar to you? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Yes, it is. If I understand your question, you are asking if there are current remedies available that are not permis-sible to use because \u2014\u2014 Mrs. M ORELLA . In other words, is that recommendation valid in its premise, as well as then I 'm going to ask you if you think that Congress should be moving on this. Dr. M EYERHOFF . OK. That regulation is designed to facilitate the development of the products that you describe, for rare diseasesand diseases that can 't ethically be studied in humans. There are a number of products available for use in humans who have beenexposed to a biological or a chemical or a nuclear agent. Some ofthem are proved. Some of them would be available under the IND,or Investigational New Drug, regulations. Right now I can 't think off the top of my head of anything that is not usable because theanimal efficacy rule is not finalized. Mrs. M ORELLA . If Congress did not finalize these regulations, would it seriously hamper our ability to provide treatment to thosewho suffer from a chemical or biological or nuclear agent? Dr. M EYERHOFF . Well, the use of an animal model to dem- onstrate drug or vaccine efficacy is certainly a critical piece of thedevelopment of these types of products that can 't be studied in hu- mans for the efficacy piece of their development. Mrs. M ORELLA . Would any of the other members of the panel like to comment on that? Do you have any problems with that idea,General? General P ARKER . Yes, I would. The support and the passage of a good surrogate model rule for the FDA is critical in these weap-ons of mass destruction, because it would be unethical to exposehuman beings to any of these agents that we call the threats, be-cause of the severe effects they have on a human being. Bioethicswouldn 't even allow us to approach an individual and ask them for informed consent because of the voracity of these diseases and thepotential to kill. So I support the FDA in exploring a way to license drugs through a surrogate model, and I think they 're trying to do that very care- fully and in a correct way, but we all want it yesterday. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar Did anyone else want to comment on it? I guess not. Dr. Young also discussed the need for just-in-time immune thera- pies to treat potential threat agents. Does anyone have any com-ments on that? Dr. Meyerhoff. Dr. M EYERHOFF . I'm not sure I 'm familiar with the type of agent you're referring to. Could you give a little bit more information on it? Mrs. M ORELLA . Well, it would be the \u2014I guess those therapies that you would just \u2014as you see the incident occur, that you would be using it at that time so it hasn 't gone through the whole ap- proval process. I will get you more information on that. I can getyou part of the testimony that he presented. It might be very help-ful for us to have you look at some of his recommendations. Dr. M EYERHOFF . OK. Mrs. M ORELLA . From your experience point of view. He hasn 't called me on time yet. General Parker, it 's my understanding that there aren 't nearly enough field hospitals that can be used in the case of mass casualtymanagement within the DOD. DOD, I understand, has only fivesuch units, and the equipment is lacking to meet the civilian need.Are you aware of anything that 's being done to address this situa- tion, sir? General P ARKER . You spoke to a field hospital? I think you said field hospital. Mrs. M ORELLA . Yes. General P ARKER . The Secretary of Defense has quite a bit of ca- pability from the standpoint of hospitals that are built by the Serv-ices, Army, Navy and Air Force and the Marine Corps, and he hasstated publicly that the Department of Defense stands by to sup-port the homeland security and homeland defense with all of theDefense Department 's capabilities. I would say that the capability to field combat support hospitals, field surgical teams, ambulatorymedical units is quite robust, and stands by to support local gov-ernment and State government and Federal Government in theevent of need. Mrs. M ORELLA . So your answer is that you don 't have any con- cern that these needs would be addressed? General P ARKER . I don 't have any concern. If the Federal Gov- ernment or an agency turned to the Secretary of Defense and saidwe need help, I 'm sure he would leverage his capability. Consider- ing we have a campaign going on right now \u2014\u2014 Mrs. M ORELLA . Yes. General P ARKER [continuing]. I 'd think he 'd want to hold a little in reserves so we wouldn 't have any service members in jeopardy as they fight the Nation 's wars and work on this campaign, but he would also have residual capability to help the Nation. Mrs. M ORELLA . I think your trust is probably well founded. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. You know, General, in previous hearings that we 've had, DOD experts have testified that we had to vaccinate with the current an-thrax vaccine because if there was an exposure to anthrax spores, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar be able to or shouldn 't be giving all of the troops battlefield antibiotics, because it will leave them unable tofight. What would be the side effects of battlefield antibiotics inlieu of giving them preventative anthrax vaccines? General P ARKER . Well, sir, if they were immunized via vaccine, we wouldn 't have to have a daily regimen of giving an antibiotic \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, right now the Bioport Co. is not delivering the vaccine, because there 's been a number of problems, as you know, and the complete regimen of vaccines has not been given to all themilitary. Some of them have received it and some of them have not.Let's say we had a battlefield situation where anthrax was sprayed by an airplane over a whole battlefield contingency and they hadnot been vaccinated, or if they had been vaccinated they hadn 't re- ceived the complete regimen of the vaccinations. What would be theproblem with giving them the antibiotics to fight that? General P ARKER . None, sir, and we would do that, because they were threatened, and we 'd have credible evidence that they were exposed. We would in fact treat them as exposed at this presenttime. Mr. B URTON . What would that do to the fighting force? What kind of incapacity would be involved? General P ARKER . Well, sir, you eloquently stated the side effects in your opening statement of a drug like Ciprofloxacin. Mr. B URTON . Right. General P ARKER . I don 't know how many people in this room have taken an antibiotic for any length of time, but just the compli-ance of taking something every day is one aspect of that. The sec-ond thing is, it doesn 't make you feel good on a day-to-day basis. You're taking an antibiotic, and it has an effect on the system. Now, all the people don 't respond the same way. I mean, maybe 80 percent of the people could probably take this and they wouldn 't have a problem at all, but 20 percent would probably have a prob-lem, and it would be serious enough that it would worry them andthey wouldn 't be at full capacity to fight our Nation 's wars. Mr. B URTON . Now, the side effects of the anthrax vaccine that have been pretty severe in a number of cases, you think that 's a fair tradeoff, though, rather than going with the antibiotics in theevent of exposure? General P ARKER . Mr. Chairman, I personally feel that that 's a good tradeoff, compared to the risk of contracting anthrax or thepulmonary anthrax \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No. I understand that, but I mean the vaccination of\u2014you think would be preferable to giving battlefield antibiotics in the event of an exposure? General P ARKER . Mr. Chairman, I do. Mr. B URTON . Dr. Straus, do you think there are complementary therapies that can improve a person 's immune response and if so, can you give us examples of those? Dr. S TRAUS . There are complementary therapies that are said to improve people 's immune responses and there have been laboratory assays showing changes in lymphocyte and other kinds of whitecell responses to animals or people who have been placed on someof those. Echinacea is a common herb in which that is stated to be VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar What we don 't know is whether the changes that had been measured in the clinical studies or in the laboratory modelsare of such a nature as to be clinically meaningful, and for thatreason we are currently funding large prospective studies ofechinacea for volunteers being challenged with respiratory virus in-fections and people who casually acquire these infections to seewhether it would make a difference in the course of the illness. Animportant belief, among those who use complementary medicine, isthat echinacea boosts immunity. Our responsibility, one that we 're taking seriously, is to find out whether that 's true and whether it 's to a meaningful extent. Mr. B URTON . And how long does a study like that take? Dr. S TRAUS . It depends on the studies. Most of them take at least 2 years. Mr. B URTON . Now, is that the only one that you know of that 's being studied right now, or are there others? Dr. S TRAUS . There are other approaches that are said to affect the immune system, various mind and body techniques, relaxationand meditation techniques. Mr. B URTON . I know, but other things that you can \u2014dietary sup- plements that can be taken that might help, like zinc or VitaminC or those sort of things? Have there been studies on those? Dr. S TRAUS . There have been studies of zinc and Vitamin C. There have been conflicting studies of outcomes in colds, as well asstudies of immunologic effects of zinc. Some have been positive.Some have been negative. There have been many more studies ofVitamin C in the aggregate. There 's no good evidence that Vitamin C boosts one 's measurable immune response, and its effect on colds themselves is in the aggregate a very small one. Of all the studiescombined, Vitamin C is said to have perhaps a 9 or 10 percent dif-ference in rate of resolution of a cold, though we don 't know wheth- er that 's because of a biochemical effect or whether it 's working through the immune system, per se. Mr. B URTON . You know, I talked to Dr. Linus Pauling before he died, who won two Nobel prizes, one for scientific research, and hewas convinced that Vitamin C had tremendous positive effects ona whole host of things, and his research he said had shown that.Have you ever looked at any of his documents? Dr. S TRAUS . Of course. When I was a medical student, I read his book, Vitamin C and the Common Cold. I 've read many of the pa- pers that he 's published in the field. I 've reviewed the literature on Vitamin C and the cold. There have been many \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I'm not just talking about the \u2014\u2014 Dr. S TRAUS [continuing]. Large studies. In addition, there are studies suggesting that Vitamin C and other antioxidants, nutri-tional supplements, might be beneficial in cancer. Small studieswith oral Vitamin C have not been successful. There are some datasuggesting that if it is given intravenously one may be able toachieve cellular levels that cannot be achieved with oral supple-ments. For that reason, we 're working with the National Cancer Institute to plan a workshop at this time on antioxidants, includingVitamin C, as adjunctive approaches to the treatment of cancer. Mr. B URTON . Now, when would that start? I 'm just curious, be- cause cancer is pretty prevalent in our society, you know. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar Yes, of course. There was a preliminary planning workshop. Authorities came together this past summer. I believethe workshop is planned for later this fiscal year. Mr. B URTON . What is NCCAM doing to look at homeopathic rem- edies and natural substances for infectious diseases? Dr. S TRAUS . Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned earlier, we are fund- ing several studies related to dietary approaches, mind/body ap-proaches and the like for HIV/AIDS, for influenza, respiratory in-fections of various kinds and for various forms of chronic hepatitisB and C infections. Mr. B URTON . In your written testimony, you appear to discount that any complementary therapy would prove useful for bioterror-ism agents. In the cases of things like dengue fever and tularemia,don't they offer viable options that should be considered? Dr. S TRAUS . Well, there are differences between dengue fever, which is a fatal disease in unusual circumstances when peoplehave been reinfected by other dengue types. There is an epidemicin Hawaii right now. Mr. B URTON . Right. Dr. S TRAUS . And most people really recover quite well from den- gue. Tularemia is a more virulent and explosive infection for whichthere are very good antibiotics that are quite effective. I fully sup-port the notion of exploring any option from any background, doingso in the context of good science, and I would argue that before Iwould wish to displace an antibiotic treatment for tularemia, Iwould like to see serial animal model studies suggesting that thetherapy is active. Mr. B URTON . Well, we understand the antibiotics are effective, but one of the concerns that we have in some of these other dis-eases is that you might have a huge run on antibiotics in a givenarea and they may not be ready available. Now, hopefully theywould be, and in that particular case, is it not logical to look at al-ternatives in the event that should occur? Dr. S TRAUS . I think it would be logical to determine whether al- ternative medicines would provide adequate clinical preventativeand therapeutic effect. If our national response was such that wecould not deliver enough antibiotics, it would be problematic to givesome of our populace therapies which are untested and unprovenand let others have the tested and proven therapies. Mr. B URTON . No. I understand, but if there are therapies, homeo- pathic remedies and so forth, that have had success or there 's al- leged successes, why are those not being looked into as an adjunctto antibiotics in the event that that would occur? Dr. S TRAUS . Right. I would have no problem funding studies of homeopathic regimens. Dr. Jonas is here and is far more an expertin homeopathy than I am, but if he or someone else wished to in-vestigate the small studies suggesting a 20 percent overall im-provement with homeopathy as compared with 100 percent im-provement with the tularemia vaccine, that certainly could be ad-dressed. NCCAM has no reluctance to receive or fund studies thatare well-designed and can answer the question in a way that willbenefit American public health. Mr. B URTON . You know, in a number of other countries, there have been therapies that have been used in the past for centuries VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar been believed to have been very, very effective in dealing with a number of diseases and problems, in China and India inparticular. Has your organization done much to collect the existingdata from countries like India and China and conduct trials onsome of those things that they have used these remedies for? Dr. S TRAUS . Yes, Mr. Chairman. This is a small planet today, and the American melting pot has brought experts in these thera-pies to our shores. We have many investigators who are exploringAyurvedic and traditional Chinese approaches to many diseases. Inaddition, we 've reached out abroad. This very day we are holding a workshop with the National University in Singapore in whichwe've invited investigators throughout Asia to come together and talk about opportunities for research funding through the NIH. Inaddition, I have met personally with the Minister of TraditionalMedicine of India, and we have been planning with them a work-shop in India to bring American investigators to India to meet withinvestigators and practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine to discuss re-search opportunities. We have had some such investigators here, and we have dis- cussed, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, fundinga study of a homeopathic approach to cancer in Calcutta. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Morella, do you have more questions? Mrs. M ORELLA . Oh, thank you. I do. This could be directed to any of you on the panel. I know that developing medical counter-measures to disease historically has been a very long process. Theestimate is it 's taken anywhere from 12 to 14 years. Today recom- binant DNA techniques and other biotechnologies are reducing thetotal development time and allowing improvement of existing vac-cines, treatments and diagnostic methods. My question is how sig-nificantly has the development time been reduced, and are thereany more biotechnologies on the horizon that would further reducethe time needed to produce these countermeasures? Are there anyvaccines or treatments that might be available soon? Ms. H EILMAN . I'd like to answer that. You are correct in that there are a number of approaches that are new that would allowfor, for example, insertion of genes into a platform, and so the pos-sibility of having a compendium of genes that you can simply insertin when you do have a problem is a reality. The problem that we do face is getting from that stage into the next stage, and that 's getting products that have been approved for use in humans and then getting the information about how theseproducts actually work in humans. Those steps are still long stepsthat one needs to take in order to assure, before you can even usethe product under an investigational new drug status, that it actu-ally has some potential value. So although the time on basic re-search is cut short, there is a long road that needs to be taken inorder to be able to use the products in humans. Mrs. M ORELLA . I might jump into a followup question and allow anyone else who wants to comment. The development process isguided, as you are suggesting, by a whole series of reviews, sci-entific, clinical, regulatory, to assure the product 's safety and effi- cacy, and all of the research at USAMRIID is performed in fullcompliance with Federal guidelines and regulations, includingFDA, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the De- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Health andSafety Administration. Does this process significantly slow product development? And it sounds like it probably would. And if you agree, is there anythingthat we can do to further coordinate compliance? For instance, hasthe Office of Homeland Security looked into the process at thispoint? Anyone want to comment about the process and what could be done for better coordination if you feel it 's necessary? Dr. Meyer- hoff. Dr. M EYERHOFF . There are certain points in the product develop- ment process where as a regulatory agency FDA seeks to stream-line or make more efficient that process, and some of the points Iwould cite would include very early dialog with developers at theperiod that we would call the pre-IND phase; that is, as the devel-opers, thinking about moving into human trials, we encouragethem to come to us for regulatory guidance that often can stream-line the process. As the development process goes on, there are points later on where products can be made available under what we would calla treatment IND or an emergency IND. That is prior to the formalapproval, but if there is a certain amount of data or a certain bodyof data that has been developed that suggests safety and some effi-cacy, products can be made available that way. Later on when a formal application is made for marketing ap- proval and comes to us for review, there are a number of ways thatcan be expedited, such as the accelerated approval process. Thereare ways that developers can present their work to us in what wecall a rolling fashion, where as it 's ready, it goes to FDA and we review it as a rolling submission. When a product is demonstratedto have a particular public health need, we can commit to an expe-dited review clock, where we will perform the review and rendera decision more quickly than we normally would on the standardreview clock. So there are a number of points in the development process, where as the regulatory agency, FDA would seek to streamline thatprocess and make it more efficient. Mrs. M ORELLA . Anyone else want to comment on it? Dr. Straus? Dr. S TRAUS . Mrs. Morella, I 'm not a regulator, but I 've been a clinical investigator for 22 years. We have an extraordinary seriesof tensions that play upon us. We have not only the usual high re-sponsibility of not harming our patients that we have as physiciansin general, but we have the added burden of not imposing addi-tional harm to people who are not sick in the conduct of research.This august body has held hearings in recent years about potentialrisks of doing research, and here we are challenged at a time of agreat national emergency to respond, but yet our responsibilities toeach individual person who would be a research subject remains the same. It 's hard to overlook that responsibility. Mrs. M ORELLA . That was a very good answer. So it sounds like you're trying to say, you can expedite when necessary, but you haven 't really approached the fact that there may still be a cum- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 could well be coordinated. At least I 've always felt that way. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. Ms. Watson, do you have any questions?Thank you.Let me just say that Tommy Thompson, the head of HHS, has indicated that we would have something like 12 million vaccina-tions for smallpox. Is that correct? I think that 's correct, isn 't it, 12 million? Ms. H EILMAN . It's actually 15 million. Mr. B URTON . 15 million. We have 240 some million people in America right now. If we had a massive outbreak of smallpoxthrough a terrorist attack of some kind and it was spreading, thatmight not be sufficient. Have we looked at any other approaches for the population that would not be vaccinated to deal with that tragedy so they wouldnot come down with smallpox other than to get it and just die? Ms. H EILMAN . I think the only other approach that we have taken seriously is to look at potential antivirals. We have screenedabout 500 potential candidates in an animal model system to tryto identify classes of compounds that may be very valuable in actu-ally treating smallpox even after you have just gotten it. One ofthem is cidofovir, which I mentioned before, and although it is de-livered by the IV route, and so it is a very cumbersome as well astoxic drug, that we have actually put in a treatment IND to theFDA so that if we were in that horrible situation, we would haveat least another option to consider, and that is treating people withcidofovir. Mr. B URTON . But you don 't know of any alternative or homeo- pathic therapy that would be helpful in dealing with that? Dr. S TRAUS . There is a homeopathic regimen that has been mar- keted on the Internet recently that 's of uncertain initial origin that has such claims, but the experts in homeopathy and the AmericanAssociation of Homeopathic Pharmacists and the National Centerof Homeopathy have declared recently in their own literature andWeb sites that they don 't believe there is any cogent data to sug- gest that the material works. I do believe it is possible that thereare materials out there in our natural kingdom that may have ac-tivity inhibiting the replication of the variola virus. They haven 't been found, and such compounds have been screened. It is true that many products that are drugs that we use today originated in plants, and people identify those activities, purifytheir substance and prove them to be effective. One of the recentexamples is that of artemisinin, which has been extracted from andsynthesized and chemically modified as a treatment for malaria. Itwas used for many centuries in Southeast Asia for treatment ofchronic and recurring fevers without knowing of malaria as a spe-cific disease. I am not aware in the literature whether there are natural prod- ucts that people have felt to be very effective against smallpox. His-tory is writ large with the scourge that it represents havingdessimated populations in regions in the world that have developedsome of the most robust empirical approaches to health care, such VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar and China I would say that we as a Nation would be chal- lenged by a mass epidemic of smallpox, and it 's not yet clear whether there are products to meet it other than through the exist-ing vaccines and kinds of new drugs that NIAID-funded investiga-tors and industry are looking at. I would have no difficulty takingleads from practitioners of nominating products to put into thescreens to see whether some of these were effective in mouse mod-els of smallpox. There would be no problem doing that in the prior-ity list of products that need to be screened that make the mostsense. Mr. B URTON . I appreciate that, and I think that 's an open-mind- ed approach to it. The problem is, we are facing a terrorist threatnow, and it could happen at any time. We don 't know. We know that the threat exists, and we know how lethal it can be. So I guessthe question is there have been some claims made, I think, by ho-meopathic entities. None of those that have been claimed are beingchecked by our health agencies right now as to the veracity of thoseclaims. Dr. S TRAUS . I am not aware of any such activities. Mr. B URTON . So the bottom line is if we had a smallpox epidemic right now, we would be able to take care of approximately 15 mil-lion people. And maybe some of the people who are vaccinated pre-viously might have some residual immunity because \u2014like me, I had one when I was a child, so I probably would have some immu-nity possibly. But by and large, we would have a terrible loss oflife. Ms. H EILMAN . Could I just clarify, because we are indeed doing a dilution study, and our first attempt at looking at the dilutionstudy at the current vaccine showed that if we diluted it 1 to 10,we got a 70 percent take rate of the general population. These arepeople who actually have not been immunized before. So the possi-bility of at least making the vaccine more broadly available andthen going back and revaccinating people within a week, for exam-ple, who did not get a take rate, may indeed stretch the vaccine.And that is something we are seriously looking at and considering. Mr. B URTON . I have one more question for this panel, and if my colleagues have any, that 's fine. Dr. Ken Alibek has talked about the need to develop vaccines or other treatments to provide nonspecific immunity. Dr. Heilman,can you please explain his theory and what NIAID and others aredoing in this field? Ms. H EILMAN . The concept of being able to in some way prime the general immune system such that when you had an assaultsuch as a bioterrorist agent or some other pathogen, the immunesystem would already be primed is indeed an area of a lot of inves-tigation. This area is much more in the basic arena at this pointin time, and the ability to translate anything into a clinical trialto validate it is still kind of early, but there are a number of peoplethat are looking at ways to tweak the immune system to keep itprimed enough, but not overprimed, to be able to be responsivequickly. Mr. B URTON . So you are looking at something that may be a pan- acea for number of diseases. I would like to get one shot insteadof tons. I am sure our children would, too. Children receive as VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar or 26 vaccinations before they start school, and there has been some severe side effects with some of those. Ms. W ATSON . Just one question before the panel concludes. Thank you so much for being here. I am just now coming in to hearyou, but I harken back to the recent death that have occurred be-cause of anthrax, and it seems like even describing the classicalsymptoms, the healthcare providers did not or were not able to di-agnose. Are we doing a better job of trying to train the personnelout in the hospital emergency rooms to be able to identify thesecommunicable diseases and bioterrorism kinds of agents? How arewe doing along that line? I am very disturbed that theymisdiagnosed and death occurred. Ms. H EILMAN . I would like to respond on behalf of the Depart- ment. This is an area that is primarily the responsibility of theCenters for Disease Control. But I do know there has been a lotof effort both within the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion as well as within medical societies, for example the InfectiousDiseases Society of America, to better train all of our physicians onhow best to diagnose. A lot of the activities within the Society haveresulted in Web pages and information that 's immediately acces- sible to the infectious disease community. So I do agree with you that although we are at a point where it is unfortunate that we weren 't able to do things immediately, the community has really rallied around the need to be able to betterinform. So I think we are in better shape than we were. Ms. W ATSON . Just this last weekend there was a panel on which I served that went on for about 4 hours, and the main questionscoming from community-based people is how do we recognize andhow do you respond, where do we go? And so the more informationthat can be given out publicly that is accurate, that everybody isaware of \u2014because they are calling my office as I am sure other Members ' offices when they see baby powder on the floor of the restroom. And I had asked the experts, how do you identify an-thrax spores \u2014well, probably don 't see them at all \u2014and what does the powder look like? And there was a little hesitancy to give a de-scription. They said, you know, call this number. Well, calling thenumber doesn 't give you the answers you want. So we have a challenge there. I understand you are developing as you go along, but please keep us well informed. And certainlywe are talking to CDC everyday, but we want to be able to giveanswers out there to the general public. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I have a whole host of questions we would like to submit to you for the record, and that way we won 't keep you here all day, but if you would answer those, we 'd appreciate that. Thank you very much. If you have the opportunity to stick around, we may have some more questions, but we understand that you have demands on yourschedule. But if you could make it, we 'd appreciate it. We'd now like to have Wayne B. Jonas, Dr. H. Reg McDaniel, Dr. Sherwood Gorbach and Dr. Richard Klasco come to the table,please. Would you stand, please, so we can have you sworn, please. [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Well, you have heard the testimony from the pre- vious panel. I hope that you will incorporate that thinking into VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar statements, and if you choose to take issue with some of those things, then feel free to do so. We would like to try to getthe questions as quickly as possible, so if you have a long openingstatement, if you could submit for the record, we 'd appreciate it. Dr. Jonas. STATEMENTS OF WAYNE B. JONAS, M.D., DIRECTOR, SAMUELI INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION BIOLOGY, ALEXANDRIA, VA,AND ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF FAMILYMEDICINE, UNIFORMED SERVICES UNIVERSITY OF THEHEALTH SCIENCES, F. EDWARD HEBERT SCHOOL OF MEDI-CINE; H. REG McDANIEL, M.D., DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH,FISHER INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL RESEARCH, MEDICAL DI-RECTOR, MANNATECH, INC., GRAND PRAIRIE, TX; SHER-WOOD GORBACH, M.D., TUFTS BOSTON, MA; AND RICHARD S. KLASCO, M.D., MEDICAL DIRECTOR,MICROMEDEX, INC., GREENWOOD VILLAGE, CO Dr. J ONAS . Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I'd like to point out that some of the research that I will be describ- ing that I conduct has been supported by the Department of De-fense and the NIH, and currently is also. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I want to thank you for inviting me to testify on the potential for nonconventionalapproaches to medicine and health care to the fight against terror-ism. I am a medical doctor and basic and clinical researcher whohas retired recently after more than 20 years in the military. I wasDirector of the Medical Research Fellowship at Walter Reed ArmyInstitute of Research where I did research on bioterrorism, and Iwas also Director of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the NIHwhere I did work on complementary and alternative medicine. Icurrently direct the Samueli Institute for Information Biology,which is a nonprofit, freestanding research organization investigat-ing the biology of healing with informational and nonmolecular sig-nals. Those are things like homeopathy, consciousness, the placeboeffect, bioenergy, digital biology and bioelectromagnetics. Much of what I will describe in this testimony is controversial. Some of it has solid data to support it. Some of it is more specula-tive and can only suggest directions for research. Thus my com-ments will be focused mostly on practices of potential, but not prov-en, use. And as we have heard already, I agree that none shouldbe used to substitute for effective treatments and preventive tacticsthat we have against bioterrorism. To sort out what works from what does not, it will be necessary to make a focused, concerted investment in research on com-plementary medicine approaches to terrorism. I have been asked bycommittee staff and others to comment on homeopathy, digital biol-ogy, phototherapy, colloidal silver, essential oils, protobiotics, herb-al preparations, dietary supplements and other complementarytherapies. Mrs. M ORELLA . Is that all you asked him to do? Dr. J ONAS . As you can imagine, time precludes a discussion of these; however, I have provided some information on most of thesein my written testimony. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 focus on homeopathy, which seems to be the topic of the day because it is a medical system that illustrates both the poten-tial and the scientific neglect of that potential in bioterrorism. Firstlet me give you some historical background on homeopathy andlow-dose effects. The German physician Samuel Hahnemann developed homeop- athy about 200 years ago. It is based on the concept that smalldoses of medicines or toxins or infectious agents for that mattercan stimulate a heating response which, when carefully selected tomatch the symptoms of the disease or the illness of the patient,then is beneficial. It is of historical interest that the first use of a homeopathic preparation of an infectious agent, which are called nosodes, wasdone in 1830 by the German veterinarian Gustav Louks, who re-ported using anthracinum, which is derived from anthrax for theprevention of anthrax in animals. Data collected from conventionalcompared to homeopathic hospitals in the last century when it wasprominent about 100 years ago reported much lower mortalityrates in homeopathic hospitals during epidemics of smallpox, scar-let fever, yellow fever, diphtheria, cholera and influenza. I refer you to the testimony of Joyce Frye for a more complete discussion of this literature, but an example of this is a comparisondone in Ohio in the 1920 's of 24,000 cases of influenza treated with conventional therapy compared to 26,000 approximately treatedwith homeopathy. The mortality in the conventional was 28 per-cent, and the homeopathy was about 1 percent. Let me point outthat these mortality differences in epidemics historically may notbe due to homeopathy because the conventional treatments used atthat time, such as bloodletting and mercury toxicity, likely in-creased the mortality in conventional hospitals. However, weshould not simply discount this information. There are two sets of recent high-quality, double-blind studies of relevance to biological terrorism. Three double-blind, placebo-con-trolled trials have been done showing that homeopathic remedy issafe and effective in the treatment of influenza. And Jennifer Ja-cobs, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, has donethree double-blind, placebo-controlled trials finding homeopathysafe and effective for the treatment of infectious diarrhea. All thesedata must be considered preliminary. They are not ready for publicuse. Chemical warfare might also be approached with low-dose expo- sures in homeopathy. In 1994, Klaus Linde from the University ofMunich and I did an overview of all homeopathic laboratory studiesinvestigating prevention and treatment of toxin exposures. Most ofthese studies were of poor quality, unfortunately. However, therewere two sets of good quality studies that reported an average per-cent protection with high dilutions of 19.7 percent more than con-trols. It is also of historical interest in the 1940 's in what was probably the first multicenter double-blind placebo-control study done ever,some British investigators who were fearful of mustard gas expo-sure in London did a study in two sites looking at the homeopathicpreparation of mustard and whether it could protect against mus-tard gas. They reported it as effective. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 part of my military career in Walter Reed Army Institute of Research investigating whether homeopathic preparations mightbe of use for prevention and treatment in biological attack. Onebiowarfare agent I studied which has been mentioned today is tula-remia, and it is still considered a threat. In a series of 15 labora-tory experiments conducted over 2 years, my coinvestigators and Ifound that homeopathic preparations of tularemia reduced the mor-tality of lethal exposure to tularemia by 22 percent in mice. Now,this is less than the 100 percent protection that is afforded by avaccine; however, it might offer a potentially harmless approach forpartial protection when vaccines are not available or not yet devel-oped. At this point it would be irresponsible to recommend that we use homeopathic prophylaxis in place of vaccine therapies or say thatthey have been proven as a cure; however, certainly this is an areathat warrants further discussion. More recently, our laboratory, again funded with two NIH grants, has shown that the chemical agents may be useful for theprevention and treatment of low-dose \u2014of high-dose toxic agents using homeopathy. For example, we found that low-dose and home-opathic preparations of glutamate, diphtheria and cyclohexamidewill protect against exposure to higher doses of these agents. Wehave repeatedly found that homeopathic preparations of glutamatereduce brain injury by 40 to 50 percent, and this is published thepeer review literature. Not all toxins afford protection in low-dose or homeopathic form. We have screened about a dozen. Some of them do not produce thiseffect. There is, however, an extensive data base in the low-dosenonhomeopathic literature called hormesis showing that low dosesstimulate autoregulatory and healing responses in many modelsand in many toxins, and these should be looked at as potential pro-tective agents. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, it is a fact that the United States has the greatest biomedical scientific research exper-tise and infrastructure in the world, much of it funded with Fed-eral dollars. It 's my opinion that it 's time for us to acknowledge that business as usual in biomedical research is no longer ade-quate. Rather it is essential that we broaden our investment intoother potential avenues in the defense of and the healing of terror. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Jonas. [The prepared statement of Dr. Jonas follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 M CDANIEL . Mr. Chairman and members of the House Com- mittee on Government Reform, it is a privilege to be asked to ap-pear before this panel of Members of the House, invited to testifywith the professionals and scientists chosen to address the prob-lems of bioterrorism. If it were not for the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 [DSHEA], my comments and written in-formation given to you would not exist. I as a physician, who Imight say was initially quite skeptical, now commend the Congressfor its unanimous vote that passed this legislation. My comments and written submission are focused on the impact of glyconutrients, dietary sugars, not herbs or oriental prepara-tions, have with the human body that support and enhance naturaldefense mechanisms against infectious disease. They also are takenin support of standard therapy. Slide 1 that is included in thepacket identifies 30 scientists and 11 institutions in the UnitedStates that performed experiments on our dietary ingredients andreported their results for peer review. Slide 2 identifies researchersoutside the United States that have contributed to the developmentof clinical applications of glyconutrition. Over 200 scientific presen-tations have been made by these scientists on the glycoscience ofthese micronutrients. When research was initiated in the early 1980 's, it was a sci- entific heresy to represent that sugars have significant biologicalroles to play in the biochemistry of life processes. It had been incor-rectly accepted that glyconutrients, known as dietary sugars,monosaccharides, carbohydrates were simply burned for energy tosupport life. Slide 3 is a collection of journals that validate the verymajor role sugars play in the structure and especially the functionof the human body. Glycobiology and glyconutrition are now recog-nized as cutting-edge technology. Dietary sugars are critical compo-nents in the molecular structure of compounds synthesized in cellsthat conduct the complex and marvelous processes we call life, andthis includes protection and defense against infectious agents. Multiple bacteria and viruses have been shown to be killed and inactivated in cell cultures and in animals by glyconutrients. Thiswas done because humans claimed benefit from this before we didthe laboratory examinations. With our limited funds, we haveshown five viruses are inactivated. Independently, Lancet in 1996contains a review article citing similar saccharides induced actionagainst 37 infectious agents classified as pathologic bacteria, vi-ruses, fungi and protozoans. Evidence is expanding that supplying concentrated micronutri- ents of which glyconutrients are a major category will support re-lief for chronic and acute diseases in a manner unmatched for alack of toxicity with unparalleled low cost. This is accomplished bynutritional support of intracellular molecular synthesis under thecontrol of the genetic code that, much like a computer program,contains the instructions for the biochemistry of life; that is, nor-mal structure and function. Such instructions enable appropriaterecognition and response to invading microorganisms. How is this possible with nontoxic dietary supplements? There is a common belief promulgated by authorities in medicine and nutri- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 one needs for good health and healing is a good gen- eral diet with variety. The statement may be correct for those whoare healthy. We have found it is not sufficient for those with chron-ic and recurrent diseases, especially infections. In instances of un-usual, epidemic and virulent infectious agent exposure,glyconutrient supplementation has been found effective for enhanc-ing general immune function and defense. When supplied at ahigher level and available in nature, sugars needed for cellular syn-thesis can take innate defense mechanisms to a much higher levelthat are effective against infectious agents. The biochemical prin-ciples responsible for this phenomenon and mechanisms of actionare in your written material. Body defense, such as the mechanisms that act naturally when we recover from a common cold or influenza, can now be up-regu-lated to destroy virulent organisms associated with more virulentdisease. Such benefit is the result of increased synthesis of slide 4cell-to-cell communication molecules that act like tiny IBM cardssent between cells to provide instructions for destroying bacteria,viruses and other infectious organisms. Slide 5 increasing the lev-els of glyconutrients in the diet increases the synthesis of theseanti-infection molecules. The bar graph provided is evidence of the functional antiviral ac- tivity described. It is an example of the increase in general defenseagainst infectious organisms that results when glyconutrients areprogressively added to the diet. There is a current concern for not only preventing and destroying anthrax bacteria, but neutralizing toxins that attack host cell mem-branes. Physicians have reported apparent neutralization of bac-terial toxins produced by various species of bacteria and full recov-ery of patients near death. In addition, there have been a few re-ports in major trauma and postsurgical infections complicated withmultiple-drug-resistant organisms that dietary glyconutrients ren-dered the patients afebrile within hours of use and shortened hos-pital expected stays. Minimal morbidity occurred in patients ex-pected to die, based on abundant prior medical experience. Under the provisions of DSHEA, glyconutrient formulations, of which I am listed as a coinventor, have been marketed for nearly8 years. Over 750,000 people have consumed them. Currently weestimate over 200,000 people consume our glyconutrients daily.Several thousand have taken the supplements continuously for 8years. There have been no significant toxic reactions or fatalities,and complications have been limited to rare food allergies. This at-tests to the safety of this concentrated dietary nutrient approach. A research partnership of industry and academia, Texas A&M University School of Veterinary Medicine and Mannatech, Inc.,stand ready to move this research forward. If supported by the ac-tion of Congress, experimentation on bioterrorist infectious agentswill be conducted. There is a real potential through nutritional for-tification to neutralize decades of what I would call dark side re- search on the use of disease-causing agents designed to destroy orincapacitate millions of innocent people. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. McDaniel. G ORBACH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for your kind invitation. I am an infectious disease phy-sician. I am going to be talking about the use of probiotics, whichis a dietary supplement for prevention of side effects associatedwith antibiotic use for prevention of anthrax. It's estimated that 32,000 persons are currently taking prophy- lactic antibiotics for periods of 60 days for potential exposure to an-thrax in the workplace. The most commonly prescribed drug isCipro, which is in a class of fluoroquinolones. Cipro is a drug that has been used for the past 14 years in treat- ing over 300 million persons as out-patients and within the hos-pitals. It has one of the best safety records of any antibiotic thatis used to treat serious infections. Nevertheless, the package insertreports an incidence of 16 percent of adverse effects possibly orprobably related to taking Cipro. Extrapolating to the 32,000 tak-ing the drug currently, this could mean between 2,000 and 5,000of these people could experience side effects, and this relates to theusual duration of treatment, 7 to 14 days. The number could beconsiderably higher during a 60-day exposure. The most common side effects of all oral antibiotics relates to the intestinal tract, as you had stated. Nausea, abdominal cramps, di-arrhea and loose bowels are the major complaints. It appears thatantibiotics upset the normal balance of healthy bacteria that in-habit our intestine. Restoring these healthy bacteria and normaliz-ing our balance is the way to recovery from the ill effects of anti-biotics. One approach to reestablishing the normal balance is to implant healthy bacteria by using probiotics. Many of you will recognizethese products as consisting of Lactobacilli, the bacteria that havebeen used since Biblical times to make fermented dairy productssuch as yogurt, sour cream and cottage cheese. These Lactobacilliare considered dietary supplements and are recognized by the Foodand Drug Administration as generally regarded as safe. In ourcountry, various probiotics are sold in the supermarkets as dairyproducts and over the counter as capsules and tablets. I developed a probiotic in 1983 which is known as Lactobacillus GG or LGG. This product was patented in 1985 and is sold in thiscountry as a capsule by ConAgra by the name of Culturelle. LGGis 1 of a family of about 15 probiotics that are sold under varioustrade names in various countries. What distinguishes LGG fromother antibiotics is the record of scientific research that has con-firmed its safety and efficacy. Over 100 publications in medical andscientific journals has documented the beneficial effects of LGG. In relation to this hearing, I would like to recount the results of two published studies published in the journals Pediatrics and theJournal of Pediatrics of preventing antibiotics side effects withLGG. In 1999, Dr. Jon Vanderhoof and colleagues in Omaha re-ported on a trial of LGG in preventing side effects in 188 children who received antibiotics for common respiratory infections. At theend of 10 days, 26 percent of the children who received placebo de-veloped diarrhea compared to only 8 percent of the LGG-treatedchildren, a threefold difference in diarrhea rate. Using a similar de- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Finland, also found a threefold reduc- tion in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. While these reports are encouraging for using probiotics to pre- vent side effects relating to antibiotics, important caveats need tobe issued with regard to the current situation of antibiotic prescrip-tions for anthrax prevention. These probiotic studies relate to anti-biotics that are used in children, generally ampicillin, amoxicillinand erythromycin, not to Cipro, a drug that is not prescribed forchildren. Indeed, we have no information about using probiotics to prevent intestinal side effects due to Cipro. If the mechanism of disturbingthe intestinal flora holds for all antibiotics, then probiotics, whichrestore normal healthy bacteria to the intestine, might work aswell with Cipro, but this remains to be proven. Another issue relates to the long course of Cipro usage now rec- ommended for 60 days. In the studies reported above, the anti-biotics were used in children for an average of 7 to 10 days. Wheth-er the salutary benefits of LGG would persist for a treatment pe-riod of 60 days remains to be proven. The final point is that these reported benefits relate to LGG, not to probiotics in general or to yogurts in general. Each type ofprobiotic is somewhat different, and each one must be compared ina clinical trial to show that it is beneficial. In summary, Mr. Chairman, a probiotic such as LGG could pro- vide protection from the expected intestinal side effects associatedwith antibiotic prophylaxis for anthrax exposure. Based on pub-lished research, LGG could reduce these side effects by two-thirds.Probiotics offer a safe, reasonably inexpensive means to lower therate of such adverse effects with antibiotic usage; however, moreresearch is needed before these products can be recommended forwide usage. Thank you for your attention.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. K LASCO . Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today.I am an emergency physician and vice president of medical affairsat Micromedex. September 11 taught us several valuable lessons. One thing that we learned is that America 's police, firefighters and healthcare workers deserve our very special praise. Together with the bravemen and women in the Armed Forces, they are on the front lineof this new war against terrorism. We also learned that these agencies, and indeed every potential American victim of biological terrorism, have an urgent need forquick access to comprehensive and accurate information to guideeffective triage and treatment. Mr. Chairman, I know the importance of this from my own per- sonal experiences as an emergency physician. In an emergencyrapid access to reliable information can in a very real sense meanthe very difference between life and death. I was on duty in the ERduring the Columbine High School shootings. Critically woundedstudents arrived who had suffered gunshot wounds to both theirspinal cords and bowels. The problem that this situation poses isthat the recommended treatment for spinal cord injury, a drug thatmight offer these children the chance to walk again, seriously in-creases the risk of infection, and such an infection can be a life-threatening complication of bowel injury. To decide whether to ad-minister this drug, I consulted a computerized medical informationdata base in the ER and was able to quickly retrieve the informa-tion needed to provide the best possible care. The information that I used on the day of the Columbine shoot- ings and many times before and since, and the computer systemthat provided me access to that information is what is known inthe medical field as decision support technology. It allows a care-giver real-time access to information that can establish a diagnosis,suggest a treatment and in the process improve medical outcomes. Mr. Chairman, in the wake of recent events, it is clear that our Nation 's emergency responders could strongly benefit from access to similar decision support technology. To meet this need,Micromedex has been working day and night over the past severalweeks to develop BioDex, an electronic information product deliv-ered on a CD Rom for use in a personal computer, and mobileBioDex, an electronic product that can be accessed by an emer-gency responder at the response site via a hand-held device. BioDex contains comprehensive, easy-to-access information on all of the agents likely to be used in a bioterrorist event, including in-formation on all of the treatable CDC category A critical biologicalagents, their appropriate medical treatments, including antidotesand drugs, and appropriate protective clothing to ensure the safetyof our healthcare workers and first responders. While this type of information might sound dry or academic, any- one who has watched the recent difficulties experienced by a myr-iad of public health, law enforcement and other government offi-cials in attempting to respond to the introduction of anthrax intothe U.S. mails knows otherwise. The importance of quick access to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar protect public safety and to treat victims cannot be overstated. Quite simply, BioDex can save lives. Mr. Chairman, Micromedex would like to partner with the Fed- eral Government to immediately get this crucial information intothe hands of the more than 22,000 law enforcement agencies,29,000 fire departments and 6,000 hospitals in the United States.Within days and with your help, we can provide all of those on thefront lines of bioterror response with BioDex. Micromedex is a Colorado-based division of the Thomson Corp. and is uniquely qualified to help these new American heroes in car-rying out their mission. We are the premier manufacturer of medi-cal information data bases for decision support. For almost 30years, Micromedex has been the reference standard for every U.S.poison center. U.S. Military health professionals used us for on-the-spot decision support during Operations Desert Storm and DesertShield. Our information guided military healthcare workers in thediagnosis and treatment of a variety of unusual and exotic healthrisks, from the special chemicals used regularly by the military tothe poisonous snakes and plants indigenous to the area, and pre-pared them for biological and chemical threats. Micromedex 's knowledge also helped the World Health Organization to diagnoseand treat the victims of the Wakayama, Japan, arsenic poisonings. Over 500 physicians, pharmacists and healthcare experts from leading universities such as Harvard and Stanford make up theMicromedex editorial board that reviews this content. With a staffof 400, Micromedex reviews the world 's literature every day. Mr. Chairman, accurate comprehensive medical information in the hands of our Nation 's emergency responders can strongly im- prove the safety and effectiveness of any response to biological orchemical terror. I hope that the members of this committee cansupport our efforts to put this knowledge into the hands of theseindividuals and entities. Finally, Mr. Chairman, Micromedex is proud of its corporate good citizenship. Our parent organization, the Thomson Corp., has al-ready pledged $5 million to World Trade Center relief efforts andto assist the families and loved ones of victims. I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the committee and will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Klasco. know, this isn 't the first time that we have held hearings where our health agencies testify and then we haveanother panel testify, and it 's like you are talking to two different worlds. The health agencies indicate that there 's one train of thought, one line of reasoning as far as dealing with epidemics orterrorist attacks like the anthrax scare, and then you talk to peoplelike yourselves and you get a different perspective, that there areother possible approaches or complementary therapies that can beused in conjunction with those to save lives. So I would like to start off with a general question, and that is, start with you, Dr. Jonas, why is there this attitude at our healthagencies that there is only one approach to use the antibiotics, andwhen you are talking about complementary or homeopathic or al-ternative therapies, that they are untried, untrue and unproven,and they really don 't have any desire to go ahead and research those? Dr. J ONAS . Well, sir, I have sat on both sides prior and this is the first time I sat on as a nongovernmental representative, andI think there are a couple of reasons. No. 1, when you are taggedas being someone whose primary duty is to protect the publichealth, then you take an ultraconservative approach and require \u2014 or I think a more extensive data base before one would make apublic announcement that something is useful for fear that your re-marks might be taken out of context and that they generate thingsthat others would criticize. I think there is a deeper reason, however and that has to do with belief. Montaigne said 500 years ago that there 's nothing so firmly believed as that which is least known. And I think in these areas,a lot of the information is not known, even by our public health of-ficials. So we get individuals who believe in complementary medi-cines and believe so strongly that they are willing to promote themwithout evidence, and then we get individuals who believe so muchagainst them that they are not willing to look at the evidence inan open-minded way. Unfortunately, most of the support comesfrom the more conservative, the latter side, and so the investmentthen in research to try to get that information isn 't forthcoming. But I think faith and belief supplanting science and rationale is the underlying cause, and that is not a judgment, sir, that is anobservation. Mr. B URTON . How do you bridge that kind of gap, because, you know, there are things that have been accomplished and provenover time that the conventional belief wouldn 't listen to. And I guess maybe this is an age-old question. I think Pasteur faced thesame thing in his day and age when he talked about vaccinationsand cleanliness and surgery and so forth. And it gets very frustrat-ing here especially when you are looking at a possible terroristthreat against the United States and limited resources to deal withsome of those terrorist threats should they occur. If we had asmallpox epidemic right now, we would be limited to 12 to 15 mil-lion vaccinations. What would we do with the other 230 some mil-lion people in this country? I mean, if there are complementary andalternative therapies that could be used to save a lot of thoselives \u2014maybe not a large percentage of those \u2014how do we get that message across? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 know this is a general question, and it 's not really sci- entific-related, but I am frustrated, quite frankly, because we havehad these hearings time and time and time again, and it seemsthere is a narrow approach by our health agencies, and when youtalk to others in the alternative and complementary therapies andhomeopathic therapies, they have a different view. And to get themtogether so we can all work together to make sure that we havethe best approach to solving these problems is just like breakingdown a wall with your fist. Dr. J ONAS . Right. I think that the government can play a large role in this. I think an example is the Office of Alternative Medi-cine and now the National Center for Complementary and Alter-native Medicine. Mr. B URTON . Let me interrupt. The gentleman who is here from the Office of Alternative and Complementary Medicine \u2014I don 't know if you listened to him or not, but his attitude is very muchlike the rest of the attitudes at CDC and FDA. I mean, he 's got a very conservative view on complementary and alternative thera-pies. And when you talk about testing some of these things, theydon't do it. Dr. J ONAS . Wouldn 't you agree, Mr. Chairman, that they are doing more than they would have without such an office? I thinkthat certainly is advancing the field. I agree with you that we need a more open attitude. I experi- enced a number of the pressures that he 's going through right now and how to deal with them, but I tried to maintain an open atti-tude to a variety of possibilities and not simply cut things off be-cause I didn 't think they were plausible, but to actually look at the evidence. I think one way to do that is to make sure that practi-tioners who had experiences in these areas are an integral part ofguiding those types of offices and actually work in those types ofoffices. I think that is one thing that could help. Mr. B URTON . In other words, having some people on the advisory boards and so forth who are having input into the leadership ofthose agencies so that they will look at those alternatives. Dr. J ONAS . I think that is one approach, and also having individ- uals in those offices who have those types of attitudes who are in-terested in that. You wouldn 't ask an orthopedic surgeon to run an office who was doing pediatric research. You need to have individ-uals that are widely supportive and widely knowledgeable aboutthe areas actually in charge of those places. Mr. B URTON . I will try to get ahold of Secretary Thompson and ask that that be done. Remind me to do that. Comment?Dr. M CDANIEL . I think Dr. Jonas hit the nail on the head and pretty well summarized it. In some ways I think of myself as al-most an anarchist about freedom until I was elected to be an offi-cial down in Austin for 2 12years, and all of a sudden fiduciary re- sponsibility for people that I don't even know, and the all the vari-ations that may be in the formula, you get more personally in-volved when you see them and you know what they are and youare in a situation and you feel the pressure of it. Even when I was hearing the officials speak during the early phases of the AIDS epidemic, I was amazed at how bending and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar FDA could be under crises and panic, and even found out and told me, ''You could have an individual physician \u2014I indeed attest this \u2014and you can start next week. '' So I was really amazed because FDA gets nothing but hell and criticism, and some of it iswell founded because human beings like power and protection, butthey are also responsible for the regulation of poisons that get ele-vated to the status of drugs. If you and I were responsible for that,we would be very conservative, too. And if anybody doubts that,look at how many drugs have been pulled off the market in the last10 years after years and millions of dollars of development, andthey had to be pulled off. They are responsible to the public to havesomething safe and effective. Another thing is about \u2014as Dr. Jonas hit about belief, I have found that people are very religious in terms of developing the ideaand it is right, and everybody else is wrong, and we all got to-gether, this is canonized and acceptable and we followed that. AndI call that the dark side of this equation. But on the other lightside, human beings can be very spiritual and understanding andforgiving and will take actions and break the laws and all the regu-lations when it calls for it, but they usually want really good sub-stantiation even as an administrator in the government, but theydon't like to do it because they are held responsible for it. I was thinking about the vaccine. If they turned something loose, like a drug, and it works before they 've done all the regulatory tasks, they are heroes, but if it doesn 't, who gets drawn and quar- tered? Mr. B URTON . I understand. That was a great defense for the FDA that you just made. It doesn 't alter the fact that there are alternative and complementary therapies out there that are not being thoroughly investigated, andyou wonder why, because not only are they having a different view-point, but there 's not a lot of investigation or clinical studies being done on alternatives that ought to be done. Dr. M CDANIEL . It takes a lot of money to do studies. I have been trying to move up the ladder. Dr. Straus gave an excellent inter-view in the JAMA \u2014two pages. He called this pioneer medicine, and you start with anecdotals, and you get case series, and you workyour way up. Once you get past case series, you start getting into$500,000 to $1.2 million just like that. And this is very demandingand difficult. And I was taught, and the scientists that have beenhere, ''Where is your double-blind placebo random-assigned cross- over? '' But on the other hand, just in the last year, the number of physicians and even faculty members that all of a sudden wantedto know more about this, and I couldn 't imagine some of the hell I have been through for pursuing this path off the beaten path,why they were showing such interest, and their statement was,''Helped my little boy. '' ''My daughter 's surgery was canceled. '' ''My wife is alive. '' One patient was all it took to change their attitude when they saw it themselves. Mr. B URTON . Well, therein, as Shakespeare said, lies the rub. Do any of the other gentlemen have a comment on that? Dr. G ORBACH . I am a NIH success story. I have been funded con- tinuously for 35 years, and most of my salary is paid by the NIH,so I work for the government. I have five NIH grants, but when VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar put in three now for probiotics \u2014they always get turned down. So I get well-funded for my other research, which ison nutrition and HIV, but the review panels just don 't believe in anything that isn 't straight party-line conventional therapy. Even if you present a study which is very well designed in order to proveefficiency, they don 't acknowledge the first step that there may be some worth to exploring the question. So I think it is a problemwith the study sessions of the NIH. Tomorrow, I am going to a study session at the NIH. I serve on a study session, but my colleagues just don 't believe in this type of medicine. I have to put a different hat on when I go to the NIH,because I can 't talk about probiotics. They won 't accept it. I think the way to deal with this, Mr. Chairman, is that if the NIH puts out what they call an RFA, if they have a request for anapplication, in which that is the program that they want to study,whether it is probiotics, homeopathy or the carbohydrate, then thestudy session has to deal with the applications, and they must giveout the money that is allocated. But if you put it into the generalstudy sections, these applications, I find, they just get cut up andslaughtered. Mr. B URTON . Well, if you have suggestions, because you are on the side that 's looking at new approaches to dealing with major problems in our health area \u2014if you have suggestions, I 'd wish you submit those to me in writing, and we will pursue them with theagencies and with the Secretary of HHS. This is a time that we 've never experienced before where we have terrorist attacks and ter-rorist threats on the United States of America, and while we wantto make sure that we have the best science and the best medicine,we want to make sure that we get to the bottom of it as quicklyas possible so we can protect the largest number of people. And ifthere is a cemented mental attitude about research in any of theagencies, we got to break through that so we get as much bang forthe buck and as many results as we possibly can. So if you have suggestions \u2014and I hope I am making myself clear the way I am expressing myself \u2014if you have some suggestions on how we can get that done, I would like to know what they are, andI will talk to the Secretary about that. Dr. K LASCO . Mr. Chairman, much of our discussion today focused on the use of complementary or alternative therapies as an adjunctto stretch otherwise constrained resources to meet the needs of 240million people. We talked about diluting vaccines in order to makea limited supply meet the needs of our country, and we have talkedabout many other agents. I think one of the most important ways that we can stretch our limited resources to meet our needs is to take the information thatwe already possess, put it in the hands of those people who aregoing to be on the front lines, and empower them to use our re-sources wisely, empower them to use our resources for people whoare actually exposed or actually infected, and to spare the use ofprecious resources for those people who turn out not to be infected. Mr. B URTON . Your comment in your opening statement was not lost upon me, and I understand that you would like to have thisinformation that you produce given to the various agencies aroundthe country so that there is real quick access to it in the event of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar and we will see if we can figure out a way to make sure that is done. So I want to make sure we followup on that. I know you have been here a long time, and I don 't want to pro- long this, but there are a few questions I would like to ask. Let mestart with Dr. Jonas. Homeopathy has been used around the world for some time. Can you explain how it 's used and the success rate in a generic sense? Dr. J ONAS . We have looked at this in quite detail. It 's used, as you say, all around the world for a variety of conditions. We pub-lished a med-analysis of all the clinical research that was done inhomeopathy in 1997 in the Lancet, and the amount of research, un-fortunately, wasn 't large enough to say that we can identify a spe- cific condition in which it has been proven safe and effective. Subsequent to that there has been additional research that I mentioned in my testimony that has demonstrated that, but theoverall effects did show that it was effective, about twice as effec-tive as placebo on average in the clinical studies. Mr. B URTON . Well, if it 's twice as effective as placebo on average, then it would have a positive impact on those who did not benefitfrom other forms of prevention. Dr. J ONAS . Yes. There were two other similar summaries of the studies that came to similar conclusions, one did not, and there hasbeen criticism about the statistics and the statistical approaches onthat from the conventional community saying that it is not ade-quate evidence. Mr. B URTON . So there is inconsistencies, and so they are not going to pursue any studies on that? Dr. J ONAS . Well, they are pursuing some studies of it. I have a couple of NIH grants, and actually there are two or three otherNIH grants that I know of specifically on homeopathy, and thereis currently an RFA out in which they did put experts in the areaof homeopathy on the review panel, and it 's currently under re- view. That potentially could fund a center in these areas as wellas other frontier areas. So there is some money being put into it. Mr. B URTON . You talked about digital biology. Can you explain a little bit more about that and its potential applications? Dr. J ONAS . Digital biology is a concept that has been really devel- oped by a French researcher by the name of Jacques Benvenistewho claims he has been able to digitize biological signals andrecord them on a computer and then deliver them through an elec-tromagnetic frequency off of a wave file and reproduce those digitaleffects. If this is true, and if this is something that could be devel-oped, then it is a technology that possibly would allow us to detectagents as well as possibly deliver medical treatments in an elec-tronic format. So it is an exciting procedure. The Department of Defense actually is supporting some research in one of my labs to see if we can replicate some of those claims. Mr. B URTON . How about our health agencies, are they doing any- thing on this? Dr. J ONAS . The only support of this that I know of is from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency, whichfunds what they consider out-of-the-box types of things. This is oneof those things that I wouldn 't dare submit to a NIH review group. It wouldn 't even get the time of day. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar It sounds like it is an exciting research project. Dr. J ONAS . It's what 's called a high impact, high risk. That 's the terminology that 's used. I mean high risk in the sense that if you find nothing, you have wasted your money. But high impact, if youfind something, it will revolutionize medicine. Mr. B URTON . Do you think the White House needs a senior do- mestic policy advisory on complementary medicine to coordinatethe OAM issues worldwide and governmentwide? Dr. J ONAS . Yes, I do, sir, and we are actually discussing this on the White House commission. Mr. B URTON . You are on the commission? Dr. J ONAS . I am on the White House Commission for Com- plementary Medicine, yes, and I do believe something like this isneeded. You only have to look to the success of the OAM and theNational Center for Complementary Medicine in terms of the stim-ulus that they have provided in the research area. There are many things that need to be done if we are going to properly integrate complementary medicine into our healthcaresystem, including education, licensing, technology transfer, busi-ness issues, and a senior-level effort in those areas I think couldgo a long way toward moving that forward. Mr. B URTON . Is your advisory panel going to make that rec- ommendation to the \u2014\u2014 Dr. J ONAS . I can 't speak for them right now. It is under discus- sion, but it is one of the considerations, one of the things they arestrongly considering, yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . How many people are on that advisory panel? Dr. J ONAS . There are I think 16. Has it increased \u201416 or 17. Mr. B URTON . Well, if you need assistance in making that rec- ommendation to the President and the White House, I 'll be glad to work with you on that. So if you 'll let me know, we could send a note over there to the \u2014\u2014 Dr. J ONAS . Thank you very much. As we get closer, I 'll let you know that. Mr. B URTON . OK. Dr. McDaniel, how does the public find good information about micronutrients, and is the government providingthis information? Dr. M CDANIEL . Well, it 's available on various search engines. In fact, Acta Anatomica, Volume 161 -1998, out of Switzerland, points out that with a MEDLAR search \u2014I think that comes out of the na- tional library \u2014that in that year alone, there were over 20,000 jour- nal articles published worldwide on glycobiology, glyconutrition,glycoscience with a MEDLAR search, and it doesn 't require the government to disseminate everything or do everything. I thinkthis is a private company that is doing the technology that wetalked about. But where the problem is in some of these out-of-the-box things is being able to get the funds to do the research to getthe type of evidence base, because the funds are limited even forall of the drug studies. We 've got 20,000 journals in the world, and we still haven 't got all the drug studies done in a century. And here you come up with something else outside the box. It justdoesn 't get funded, as Dr. Gorbach said about, and I was sitting here feeling \u2014I got into all of this. I was taught all the same things that\u2014of the men that preceded us and the ladies then, and I found VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar probiotics were very important, and I think after nutrition and the role it plays in health and disease, that theflora in our bowel and what it contributes to health and disease isgoing to be another very common economical approach. As an addi-tion to energy, I would call what you were talking about, which isas old as Oriental medicine, and we 're just applying it in a more technical, modern \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I see Dr. Jonas grabbing for the mic there. Dr. J ONAS . Sir, I just want to say that we shouldn 't be thinking that the government should be funding all of this research. It isvery expensive \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . No, no. I don 't think anybody has indicated that the government should be funding it, but it seems like there 's road- blocks to some of this research. Dr. J ONAS . There are roadblocks, and one of the major roadblocks is that there are currently few incentives for the private sector tomove into this area. The current patent structure, the current taxincentives and these types of things result in a very large amountof money going into standard medical technologies and drugs andthis type of thing. Mr. B URTON . Do you have recommendations on how that could be changed? Dr. J ONAS . Well, I think that should be looked at. I think we should look at patent laws in terms of the relation to natural prod-ucts, and how can we incentivize the private sector to begin to in-vest in this. I think we should look at the FDA regulations to cre-ate a category that will allow for approval of products so that theydon't have to spend $250 million for a drug classification that they may not recover or tax incentives that then would incentivize theprivate sector to move into these areas. Mr. B URTON . Let me just tell you that Members of Congress \u2014 we have 40 some members on this committee. Do you see howmany is here right now? My colleague from Ohio and I. But thething is we have so many things on our plate, that we can 't con- centrate \u2014there are few people who have concentrated on what we're talking about here today, and what we need from you folks is recommendations on how we can cut through the logjam andsolve the problem. So if you have suggestions, I implore you to givethose to us. If it 's a change in our patent laws or a suggested change or a suggested change in how research is done on nutrientsso that it 's more cost effective and could be done in the private sec- tor or if it 's a tax incentive for people to invest in new technologies and new methodologies, we 'd like to have those, and we can make those suggestions. Dr. J ONAS . In March 2002, the White House Commission will be providing you with a number of specific suggestions in those \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Well, I 'll look forward to that. Yes, sir? Dr. M CDANIEL . I wanted to also mention another thing that I do think is an area of government that \u2014in response to your first question. It is the hesitancy of people to get outside the box or outof standard practice of medicine because of exposure to litigation.If it works \u2014but if it doesn 't work \u2014and nothing works 100 percent of the time \u2014the exposure ends in \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Malpractice. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 insurance, and they won't even cover you if you 're doing it. I know a practitioner in Texas that got involved with some of this energy flow-type thing,and he had to appear before the State Board of Medical Examiners.We've had a number of incidences that I 've been involved in after DSHEA was passed that physicians, very frustrated with patientswith chronic unresponsive conditions, found out through their pa-tients and their own self-administration, ''Hey, this works. '' And they tried it and another \u2014the next thing they knew, they were turned in by their peers and are appearing before the State Boardof Medical Examiners. I happen to be one of those, turned in byno less than the dean of my own medical school to defend my li-cense for doing this work. They found out, surprise, that I had anFDA individual exemption to do research on it, and I had nevercharged a patient a dime, which kind of tilted the machine. But ifI hadn 't have had those, I would be in deep you know what. Mr. B URTON . Well, I think I understand that. These glyconutrients that you 're talking about, you know, you can 't make a medical claim on those, because if you do, then of course there 's another avenue that has to be pursued and you could be held re-sponsible. So you don 't make those claims. But I know in your opinion, you think they really help with a lot of medical problems. Dr. M CDANIEL . I will put it this way. The glyconutrients do not treat, cure or mitigate any disease. They give the body, under thecontrol of genes, what the cells need \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I understand. Dr. M CDANIEL [continuing]. To do normal structured and func- tion. It is not normal to be sick. Mr. B URTON . I understand. Mr. LaTourette, do you have any questions?Mr. L ATOURETTE . I do, but I can wait until you 're done. Mr. B URTON . I'll be through here in just 1 second. I only have two more questions and then I 'll yield to my colleague. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Patience is a virtue. Mr. B URTON . OK. How much training do doctors get in medical school about bio- logical warfare and terrorism? Dr. K LASCO . Very little. At least during my time in medical school, anthrax was an esoteric disease of slaughterhouse workers.So there 's a real gap. There 's a knowledge gap. But the knowledge fortunately exists. We just need to get it out into the hands of theresponders. Mr. B URTON . The gentleman from Ohio. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I won 't take long. I appreciate all you gentlemen coming here today, and I ap-preciate the fact that the chairman has these hearings on alter-native methods of looking at things. We hear from the CDC anda lot of other people that do wonderful work, but I can remembera hearing that the chairman had last year on autism and some re-search relative to whether or not the early childhood vaccinationsmay be contributing to things in a way that people \u2014that everybody to be vaccinated as early as possible didn 't want to hear, and I find it to be elucidating. And I don 't know whether it was you, Dr. McDaniel, or you, Dr. Gorbach, that said that sometimes one of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 my child \u2014I can remember when Dr. Gorbach was going over the antibiotics, our \u2014my first child had horrible ear in- fections, and we went through ampicillin, amoxycillin, Ceclor, andthe ear kept oozing. And finally some wonderful pediatrician cameout with a couple needles that looked like you would give it to ahorse and said, we 're going to fill this with gamma globulin, and I didn 't think that this was going to be \u2014and apparently it was that\u2014the introduction of gamma globulin \u2014and I think as I 'm hear- ing you, Dr. McDaniel, talking about glyconutrients \u2014gave the body the ability to not be sick, and then she 's been fine ever since. Dr. Jonas, I am not as smart or well versed as the chairman is on many subjects, and if you don 't believe me, you can just ask him later, but I read your testimony about homeopathy, and I guess I 'm a little unclear. I read your observations about influenza breakoutsand other things from previous centuries. Can you just describe forme in general \u2014I understood taking a small amount of medicine and inserting it \u2014is it similar to an inoculation where you take a portion of the disease and reinsert it back into the person to build-up an immunity, or is it something else? Dr. J ONAS . I guess you could say it is similar to that, yes. How- ever, instead of focusing on a particular peptide, as you would inan inoculation where you 're trying to get the immune system to produce a specific antibody, what you 're trying to do is match the stimulus, the homeopathic remedy, in a global fashion, with the en-tire person 's response so that they get an overall healing response. So it 's the level of focus in which you have it. You can use it, ap- parently, at the level, like you might for a particular infectiousagent, and that 's done in a number of countries. But the classical homeopathic approach is really an attempt to give the body a par-ticular signal, a particular energetic stimuli, that it responds com-pletely, so it responds both mentally and physically. And there 's a very special matching process that goes on for those that practicethat type of classical homeopathy. But the analogy is very similar to a vaccine or very similar to a toxin, in which if you take a little bit of the toxin, you developa tolerance for it, so that if you then get a higher level of that toxinas a stressor, you 'll be able to respond to it. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Can you give me an example of what was used for influenza, for instance, what was the homeopathic remedy? Dr. J ONAS . Yes. For example, there 's usually about four or five remedies that are used for influenza, depending upon the symp-toms. If someone had a type of headache in which they were notable to move, they just had to lay on the bed but they were verythirsty, then that matched the symptoms of a particular remedycalled baptisia, which when they had given it to healthy people pro-duced those kinds of symptoms. So that type of an influenza wouldrespond to baptisia. If someone had a completely different type, if they were not thirsty, for example, but were crying all the time for some reason \u2014 sometimes that happens \u2014had aches down a part of their spine, that corresponds to tests that have been done with pulsatilla inhealthy people, which is another plant product, and they would getthat remedy. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Got you. Thank you very much. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 about probiotics and particularly the LGG that you were most familiar with. You indicated that thenews is encouraging on probiotics, but the studies I think you indi-cated were as a result of pediatric studies and they were 7 to 10-day courses for Cecor or amoxycillin and those matters. And Ithink I heard you say that there 's a need for a clinical trial to de- termine whether or not probiotics can be effective in fighting offsome of the \u2014or diminishing the side effects from Cipro. Are any clinical studies underway that you 're aware of? Dr. G ORBACH . No. No clinical studies underway. Mr. L ATOURETTE . And is that because of the reluctance of NIH and others to \u2014I mean, have you submitted such a thing saying that, hey, I 've got this great stuff? Dr. G ORBACH . Well, I 'll have to say we 've only been in this cur- rent crisis for a matter of weeks. It takes a few months even to puttogether an NIH application. But besides that, I personally am notdoing research on this. It 's a conflict of interest for me, because I am an investigator, but in this case I own the patent on it, so Irather encourage other people from universities to do the researchwhere I don 't have a conflict of interest, and I would hope that this issue of antibiotic side effects with Cipro would become importantenough for others to submit applications and do research. I help a lot of investigators, about 30 around the world, who are doing research in various aspects, by giving advice, but I don 't feel it proper to do research of my own product itself. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Got you. Dr. G ORBACH . So I hope someone else does it. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Well, I do, too, to tell you the truth. And then, Dr. Klasco, you made observations about the preserva- tion of scarce resources, and anthrax is a pretty big deal aroundCapitol Hill because of what happened at the Ford Building andthe Hart Building and other places. And there 's been sort of \u2014even though Bayer has been, you know, kind enough \u2014I don 't know if that's the right word, but they 've slashed their prices and others have indicated you can take these antibiotics, there 's a great deal of concern, and so you have a lot of people taking 60-day coursesof Cipro that probably shouldn 't be taking 60-day courses of Cipro. The advice that has been generated by the Bush administration and also by the Attending Physician here at the Capitol is that un-less you 've been exposed don 't run out to the drugstore and hog up everybody 's Cipro, one, because it 's a scarce resource, and, two, it may do you harm through some of the side effects that Dr. Gorbachhas been talking about. Does everyone agree with that prudent approach by both the ad- ministration and our Attending Physician? Dr. G ORBACH . Everyone agrees, except if you 're exposed. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Right. Dr. G ORBACH . And then it 's very difficult to persuade a postal worker that he or she shouldn 't take Cipro. So it 's a very difficult position for the physicians, the health authorities to make that call,but the general view \u2014I think it 's been rather conservative \u2014do not give Cipro unless there 's an indication. I know as a physician I 'm getting a lot of phone calls from my patients to stock up on Cipro,and I have refused to write any scripts. And the recommendations VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:47 Mar we 're giving and teaching to the community of physicians is if you have someone with a potential exposure, do not write ascript yourself, but consult with the authorities to see if that per-son in fact has a legitimate exposure, because otherwise \u2014I mean, we're already giving 32,000 courses of Cipro. But it could get even worse. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Right. Dr. Klasco, is there something you wanted to say relative to that? Dr. K LASCO . I agree with the way Dr. Gorbach just phrased things. I would differ in one slight regard, in that health care pro-viders shouldn 't have to look to a central authority to guide their patient care decisions. They should be armed with the tools thatthey need so that their knowledge, expertise and training can makean informed decision in the setting of a patient care experience. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Thank you. And Dr. McDaniel, last to you, like homeopathy, I 'm not real familiar with glyconutrients and, as I un- derstand it, they are sugar-based nutrients and I think in your tes-timony you said it was heresy to suggest such things would be ben-eficial in the past. And, I mean, is that rooted in the fact that yourmom said you shouldn 't be eating a lot of candy, I suppose, but I don't know that 's an oversimplification. But is the basic tenet of your research on glyconutrients is if you increase the body 's levels, it brings you to a point where you don 't have to \u2014not that you don 't have to worry about it, but your body is better able to deal withinfection and you don 't get sick. Is that where you are? Dr. M CDANIEL . Except that you don 't eat more candy. Mr. L ATOURETTE . I understand that. Dr. M CDANIEL . They are sugars that aren 't sweet. And actually the business end of antibodies, the variable-end that matches upare written in sugars. Who we are and the reason we can 't take a transplant from anyone other than an identical twin is writtenon the surface of our cells in sugars. But in the packet, you seethere that the head of immunology and allergy at the Universityof Health Science Center in Houston showed in mixed culture, fol-lowed by \u2014that showed the cytokines which are, as I referred to them, little IBM cards, that the various cytokines that are madeto be able to identify bacteria, yeast, tumor cells, viruses, go up ona dose-response basis. And then it follows through, there with the4-hour cytolytic assay, that the natural killer cells that come outof this will punch holes in the virus-infected cells. And I presenteda conference here in Washington that it will do the same to tumorcells. It puts holes in them. So these are used. But they 're not com- plex\u2014you know more about this problem than you think you do. I do a lot of lecturing. Everyone knows the difference in taste ofvine-ripened tomatoes versus those picked green, shipped acrossthe country, allowed to turn red; you take them home in great an-ticipation and they 're tasteless red mush. We 've plowed up our gar- dens, chopped down our orchards, insulted many of the things thathave come to our table. Our work started with aloe vera. Why have human beings been using aloe vera for over 5,000 years? And we found out with co-operation of work and a review done at Washington University inSt. Louis that in the endoplasmic reticulum, you need VerDate sugar that is in the aloe gel to start the synthesis of these cytokines, or the little IBM cards. Why that is so important? We raise it by the tons in the rice pat- ties of Louisiana and Texas, through the grain fields up to Canada,but on the way to our table, what do we get? White flour and whiterice, and you strip that sugar out, making white flour and whiterice, creating a deficiency such that when you add it back from thealoe plant, people say, ''It's a miracle; look what happened. '' It is not a miracle. It is correcting the supply of sugars that are missingfrom our diet that we have to have, and that happens to be a verycritical one in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mr. L ATOURETTE . Well, I thank you very much for that expla- nation, and, again, I thank you all for your work. I thank you foryour testimony before the committee. And I guess I was more hope-ful that I could leave here, Dr. McDaniel, and indicate to peoplethat said that Dr. McDaniel has indicated I had to eat that extraKitkat or whatever, but I appreciate your research very much. Andthank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . And I want you to know that there are very few areas where I have more knowledge than the gentleman from Ohio,except possibly in postal reform. We have a big difference of opin-ion on postal reform, which I 'm sure would be of little interest to any of you. Let me just end up by saying I really appreciate your being here, and I meant sincerely what I said, that if you have input that you 'd like to give to us on \u2014or suggestions on how to make things better for research in these homeopathic and alternative and complemen-tary therapies, we would like to do it. I would like to talk to you about getting this information to Mr. Thompson, and then I appreciate very much you being here. Westand adjourned.
