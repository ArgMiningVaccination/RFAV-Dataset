Baggage Information Review information on our baggage guidelines such as size and weight allowances, and baggage fees to help you pack and plan according to your needs. When plans change Changes, insurance and refunds Fares with flexibility We understand travel plans can change. For your peace of mind we have a variety of fare options, some with flexibility included, so you can select the fare that is best for you. [Fare options](/en-ca/flights/our-fares), along with comprehensive travel insurance plans and [our change/cancel policies](/en-ca/manage/change-cancel) are another way we're putting your Safety Above All. Protect your travel plans when you book vacation packages or land-only bookings to destinations in Mexico, the Caribbean, Canada, and the United States. For travel affected by a travel advisory Sometimes a [travel advisory](/en-ca/get-travel-ready/advisories) in a destination will interrupt your travel plans. Guest-impacting events like extreme weather, airport closures, and disease outbreaks can happen. While the travel advisory is in effect, we apply our change/cancel guidelines until it's lifted, and normal operations resume. If there's a [current travel advisory](/en-ca/get-travel-ready/advisories#travel-advisories) for your destination on your trip dates, you have options. WestJet will waive the applicable change or cancellation fee, and you have the option to: - Change your travel dates to and/or from the same destination. If there's a difference in fares, you won't be charged. Blackout dates may apply. - Change your destination with or without changing your travel dates. If you're going to a close airport like Vancouver (YVR) instead of Abbotsford (YXX), you won't be charged for any fare difference. - If you choose to go to an airport that isn't geographically close, you'll pay the fare difference. - If the new fare is less, the refund guidelines for fare types apply. - Cancel your trip. You'll get a refund according to the guidelines for the original fare bundle. Travel insurance Travel with confidence in Canada and around the world with insurance solutions administered by Allianz Global Assistance. Protect your wellbeing and finances with benefits to cover costs related to emergency medical care and the cancellation or interruption of your trip. Refunds eligibility You're eligible for a refund to the original form of payment if your flight is cancelled, or if you're otherwise delayed by more than 3 hours in relation to your original departure or arrival time, or if we add a connection to your itinerary. If your reservation was part of Air Group booking or a WestJet Vacations group booking, please contact your travel agent or your group specialist to submit a request for a refund. If you booked through a Travel Agent (online or directly), third-party like Expedia or Airmiles, Corporate Travel arranger, or another airline, please contact them directly. Guests looking to discuss a refund due to other circumstances are required to [contact us](/en-ca/contact). Our top priority Your health and safety If you're travelling with health concerns, we have all the information that you need before you take off. Government of Canada official information Aircraft cleaning and sanitization Window or aisle? Movie or Podcast? You can travel with peace of mind knowing our aircraft are cleaned extensively and frequently and are equipped with HEPA filters, so you can breathe a little easier as you fly with us. HEPA filters A common misconception with aircraft is that the air on board is recirculated. But that's not the case. All WestJet aircraft are equipped with an industry-leading air circulation system containing a HEPA filter, similar to what's used in hospitals. Not only do these filters introduce fresh air into the cabin every 2 to 3 minutes, but they also capture and filter 99.99% of all airborne particles so you can breathe a little easier. On board cleaning and sanitization We clean our aircraft extensively and frequently. We continue to clean with aviation-approved products, including Sanicide (disinfectant) for galleys and lavatories, along with EX3 Disinfecting Spray for: - tray tables - general seating areas - galleys - lavatories and door handles - tray tables - seat armrests and headrests - seatbelt buckles - overhead lights and control buttons - overhead-bin door latches to ensure all guest contact surfaces are thoroughly disinfected. Safety above all We have your wellbeing at heart and will always have your Safety Above All. "}
