The Committe e members unanimously agreed upon the findings and recommendations presented in this report. Although some of the recommendations crossover between reco mmending statutory an d/or regulatory changes, all recommendations were included so that a complete picture could be presented to the Legi slature. The Bureau would like to acknowled ge and thank all the members of this Committee for their hard work and dedicati on. The Formulary Committee held 15 committee meetings over the last year. Suffice it to say that this was an arduous process. As the Bureau Chief, I was impressed by the commitment on the part of each member of this Committee. They serv ed without compensation giving graciously of their weekends, evenings and overall time to share their vast knowledge and invaluable professional exper tise. This report spea ks to the facts gathered, research done, and the outcome of specific recommendations. What is not articulated in this repor t, and I attempt to describe here, is the process that went into its creation. What cannot be so easily captured are the discussions, opinions, agreements and at ti mes disagreements that took place among the Committee members. It would have been easy to rush through this process in only a few meetings, do a curs ory review of the items that were requested to be looked at and draft th is report. Even though they were not compensated for any of their time servi ng on this committee, they didn't rush through this process. Each committee member worked diligently, deliberately, carefully and thoughtfully on each and ever y recommendation that was included in this report. It would have been easy to pass recommendations with a majority vote, but they didn't. They were commi tted to working through each issue that arose, resolving differences, underst anding each other's viewpoints and ultimately reaching a consensus. W hen they could not agree, they did not include it as a recommendation or modifi ed existing recommendations to ensure each member agreed with what is presented in this report. Patient safety and efficacy remained of utmost importance. The Bureau further extends its gratitude to Peter Wannigman, Naturopathic Doctor and Pharmacist, for se rving as the Chairperson of this Committee and as such putting in countless hours of research time. Further, a special thank you to the Committee's Vice-Chair, Soram Singh Khalsa, MD, for graciously hosting numerous Committee meetings at his office. i The Bureau, along with the Committee, w ould like to also extend gratitude to special consultants, Dr. Virginia Osborne, National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Dr. Craig Runbeck, Executive Dir ector, Arizona Naturopathic Physician Board of Medical Examiner s, and Professor Debra Woll ner, Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, for their invaluable assistance and expertise. I am very pleased to have served as t he Bureau Chief during the development of this report and to be able to present this report with the unanimous findings and recommendations of this Committee. Without their extensive knowledge, experience, and commitment to the field of naturopathi c medicine, these reports would not have been possible. Sincerely, Tonya Blood, Chief Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine ii Introduction Senate Bill 907 (Burton; C hapter 485, Statutes of 2003) established the Naturopathic Doctors Act (the Act) and created the Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine (the Bureau) within the Department of Consumer Affairs to administer the Act. The Act sets up criteria for the licensure and regulat ion of Naturopathic Doctors (NDs), and establishes a scope of practice for the profession. SB 907 specified (Business and Professions Code Sec. 36271): The Bureau shall establish a natur opathic formulary advisory committee (the Committee) to determine the naturopathi c formulary based upon a review of naturopathic medical educat ion and training. The Committee shall be composed of an equal number of representatives from the clinical and academic settings of physicians and surgeons,pharmacists, and naturopat hic doctors. The Committee shall review naturopathi c education, training, and practice and make specific recommendations regar ding the prescribing, ordering, and furnishing authority of a naturopathic doctor and the r equired supervision and protocols for those functions. The Bureau shall make recommendati ons to the Legislature no later than January 1, 2006, regarding t he prescribing and furnishing authority of an ND and the required supervision and protocols, including those for the utilization of intravenous and ocular routes of prescription drug administration. The Committee and the Bureau shall c onsult with physicians and surgeons, pharmacists, and licensed naturopathic docto rs in developing the findings and recommendations submitted to the Legislature. Assembly Bill 302 (Committee on Business and Professions; Chapter 506, Statutes of 2005) exte nded the date that the Bureau was to make recommendations to the Legislature to January 1, 2007. The purpose of this report is to fulfill that legislative mandate. 1 All further section references are to the Business and Professions Code, unless otherwise indicated. 1 Naturopathic Formulary Advisory Committee The Naturopathic Formulary Advisory Committee (the Committee) was appointed by Charlene Zettel, Director of the D epartment of Consumers Affairs. The Committee is chaired by Dr. Peter Wannigman, a pharmacist and ND, and is vice-chaired by Dr. Soram Singh Khalsa , a medical doctor. The Committee consists of three pharmacists, three medical doctors, and three NDs. The committee first met on June 26, 2005, and has met every 4-6 weeks for over a year to determine the recommendations included in this report. Biographies of the committee members are contained in the Appendix. Brief History of Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is one of the ol dest continuously licensed health care professions in the country. Its roots lie in German traditions of \"Water Cure\" or hydrotherapy advocated by Seba stian Kneipp in the mid-19th century. Dr. Benedict Lust, considered to be the Father of Naturopathic Medicine, expanded upon the European water cure a nd herbal therapies to develop a comprehensive philosophy and system of health which he brought to the United States around the turn of the century. In 1901, Dr. Lust opened the American School of Naturopathy in Manhattan. Its approach emphasized diet, exercise, physi cal medicine, herbs, and homeopathy as ways to improve and maintain good health. Naturopathic medicine grew quickly as a profession and by 1925 there were approximately 2,500 practicing naturopathic doctors and more than a dozen schools. During this period, regulations were enacted in many states, with about half of the states licensing or regulating naturopathic medi cine. This rise in popularity created strong opposition from allopathic medicine, wh ich labeled naturopathic medicine as \"quackery.\" Naturopathic medicine experienced a signi ficant decline in popularity from the post World War II era until the 1970s as most health care at that time centered on the allopathic medical m odel and the increased use a nd development of drugs and antibiotics. In the 1970s , with increased interest in holistic and alternative health care, naturopathic medicine exper ienced a resurgence of interest with expanded educational program s and state licensure. In the past 30 years, naturopathic medicine has experienced dram atic growth with new schools being established, standardization of educat ion and accreditation, and expanded research on safety and effica cy of naturopathic practices. In 2003, California became the 13th state to recognize naturopathic medicine and provide licensure to naturopathic doctors. 2 Naturopathic Medicine Today Naturopathic medicine is a distinct and comprehensive system of primary health care that uses natural methods and substances to support and stimulate the body's self-healing process. Currently, 14 states, the Distr ict of Columbia, and the US territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have licensing laws for naturopathic doctors. The Alliance for State Licensing (Allianc e) is a group of representatives from various state naturopathic associations that align with each other to share information, support, and experience in their quest for licensure, under the auspices of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. According to the Alliance, the states of Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Virginia have introduced legislation during the last year or will be introducing legislation nex t year. The states of Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin are moving towards legislation in the near future. Although the scope of practice varies widel y from state to st ate, all naturopathic doctors abide by the same six principles: \u00beThe Healing Power of Nature : Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent healing process in the person that is ordered and intelligent. The body is capable of healing itself. The role of the naturopathic doctor is to identif y and remove obstacles to healing and recovery and to facilitate and augment th is inherent natural tendency of the body. \u00beIdentify and Treat the Cause: Naturopathic doctors seek to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, not merely eliminat e or suppress symptoms. \u00beFirst Do No Harm: Naturopathic doctors follow three guidelines to avoid harming patients: 1. Utilize methods and medicinal subs tances that minimize risks of side effects, using the least force needed to diagnose and treat. 2. Avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms. 3. Acknowledge and work with the indi vidual's self-healing process. \u00beDoctor as Teacher: Naturopathic doctors recall that the origin of the word \"doctor\" is the Latin word, \"to teach.\" A fundamental emphasis in naturopathic medicine is patient education. 3 \u00beTreat the Whole Person: Naturopathic doctors attempt to take in to consideration all the factors that make up patients' lives and affect their health and well-being. \u00bePrevention: Naturopathic medicine emphasizes the prevention of disease, assesses risk factors, and makes appropriate interventions with patients to prevent illness. Most naturopathic doctors provide primary care natural medicine through office-based, private practice. In st ates where NDs have been licensed for many years, they often work in collaboration with medical doctors, and routinely refer patients to each other for optimum management of a patient's healthcare. Bureau Information The Act, which created the Bureau, was ef fective January 1, 2004. Before the Bureau could issue any licenses, a Bureau Chief and staff were hired. Equipment was purchased to support t he Bureau's activities. Emergency regulations were drafted to implement the Act. An application process was developed, files were set up, application forms and a website we re created. The first ND license was issued on January 14, 2005. There are currently 211 newly licensed NDs in California. The Bureau is staffed by one full-time anal yst. The analyst is responsible for all activities of the Bureau, including ans wering phones, analyzing qualifications for licensure, issuing licenses, respondi ng to correspondence, coordinating legislative, regulator y, and budgetary activities , preparing reports, and administering all disciplinary and enforcement activities. The Bureau is completely funded by application and licensing fees. Requirements for Licensure In order to be licensed as an ND in California, the Act and the California Code of Regulations require an applicant to: Have obtained a degree in naturopat hic medicine from an approved naturopathic medical school. (Section 3630) Pass Parts I and II of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination [An applicant who graduated prior to 1986 must have passed a state or Canadian provincial exam.] (Section 3631) Submit fingerprints, and not have been c onvicted of any crime that would be grounds to deny licensure. (Sections 144, 480, 3630) Request verification of good standing for any other licenses held in California or another state be su bmitted directly to the Bur eau from the licensing entity. (Section 3633) 4 Pay to the Bureau an application fee of $400 and an initial license fee of $800, prorated, which is renewed bienn ially (Title 16 C.C.R. \u00a7 4240). Furnishing and Ordering Drugs If an applicant or ND wishes to furnish or order drugs or dangerous devices, they must first receive a furnishing number issued by the Bureau, and registration with the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, if required. In order to qualify for a furnishing number, the Act requires that an applicant or ND must show evidence of 48 hours of instruction in pharmacology that included the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles and properti es of the drugs to be ordered or furnished under the provisions of the Act. To comply with this requirement, the instruction must have been offered by one of the following (Title 16 C.C.R. \u00a7 4212): An approved naturopathic medical school. An institution of highe r learning that offers a baccalaureate or higher degree in medicine, nursing, pha rmacy, or public health. An educational institution or provider with standards and course content that are equivalent, as determined by the Bureau. Education and Training An applicant for licensure must have graduated from a nat uropathic medical education program accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). For accreditation, the school s must meet the following minimum requirements (Section 3623): Admission requirements that include a minimum of three-quarters of the credits required for a bachelor's degr ee from a regionally accredited or preaccredited college or university or t he equivalency, as determined by the council. Program requirements for its degree or diploma of a minimum of 4,100 total hours in basic and clinical sciences, naturopathic philosophy, naturopathic modalities, and naturopathic medicine. Of the total requisite hours, not less than 2,500 hours shall consist of academ ic instruction, and not less than 1,200 hours shall consist of supervised clinical training approved by the naturopathic medical school. A naturopathic medical educ ation program in the Un ited States shall offer graduate-level full-time studies and traini ng leading to the degree of Doctor of Naturopathy or Doctor of Naturopath ic Medicine. The program shall be an institution, or part of an institution of, higher education that is either accredited or is a candidate for accreditation by a regional institutional accrediting agency recognized by the United States Secretary of Education and the 5 Council on Naturopathic Medical Educat ion, or an equivalent federally recognized accrediting body for naturopathic doctor education. To qualify as an approved naturopathi c medical school, a naturopathic medical program located in Canada or the United States shall offer a full-time, doctoral-level, naturopathi c medical education program with its graduates being eligible to apply to the Bureau fo r licensure and to the North American Board of Naturopathic Exam iners that administers the naturopathic licensing examination. Approved Schools To be eligible for licensure in Califo rnia, an applicant must have graduated from one of six approved naturopat hic medical schools. Each of these schools has met the requirements listed above for ac creditation by CNME. Four of the approved schools are located within the Unit ed States and two are in Canada. A brief synopsis of the schools is given below. As can be seen below, the number of pharmacology hours required for graduation at the approved schools varies from 42 to 110. More det ailed information on each of the schools, including admission requirements and curriculu m may be found in the Appendix. School Year Established Class Size* Pharmacology Hours Required for Graduation National College of Naturopathic Medicine Portland, Oregon 1956 81 72 hours Bastyr University Seattle, Washington 1977 260 55 hours Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences Scottsdale, Arizona 1993 65 110 hours University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine Bridgeport, Connecticut 1996 19 44 hours Canadian Naturopathic Medical College Toronto, Ontario, Canada 1978 135 110 hours Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada 2001 16 42 hours * Number of graduates in 2006. 6 Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination In order to qualify for lic ensure, NDs must take and pa ss Parts I and II of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam ination (NPLEX). The NPLEX is a rigorous, standardized licensing examination that is used in all states that license NDs. Administered by the North Amer ican Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE), the NPLEX became the first natio nal test, replacing state exams in 1986. Part I of the NPLEX, the Basic Science Examinations, is designed to test the naturopathic student's skills and knowledge prior to his or her clinical training. Students are encouraged to take this portion of the examination as soon as they finish their basic science coursework. Pa rt I is composed of five individual exams. Candidates are given 60 minutes to complete each of the five exams: Anatomy Physiology Biochemistry Microbiology Pathology A student must pass Part I of the exam before being allo wed to sit for Part II. Part II, the Core Clinical Science Examination, consists of eight separate exams which are designed to test the skills and knowledge that an ND needs in order to practice safely. The eight s eparate exams in Part II are: Physical & Clinical Diagnosis Lab Diagnosis & Diagnostic Imaging Emergency Medicine Botanical Medicine Pharmacology Nutrition Psychology Physical Medicine Examinees have 180 minutes (3 hours) to complete the Physical & Clinical Diagnosis Examinatio n (150 items), 90 minutes to complete the Lab Diagnosis & Diagnostic Imaging Examination (75 items) , and 60 minutes to complete each of the other examinations. Part II of t he NPLEX is taken over a two-day period. Beginning with the August 2007 NPLEX Exam administration, the Part II - Core Clinical Science Series will be integrat ed into a single examination that will include Homeopathy. In comparison to t he current exam format which consists of 50 to 150 \"stand-alone\" questions on each of the eight exams, the integrated 7 exam format will consist of extensive c linical case summaries for which the candidate must answer a series of questi ons relevant to diagnosis and treatment for each case. Part I of the examinati on is also being restructured and updated. The new integrated Part I of the ex amination will be administer ed to candidates beginning in 2008. The Bureau must receive a report di rectly from NABNE with an applicant's passing scores on both Parts I and II of the NPLEX before a license will be issued. The NPLEX is administered twice a year at six different test sites through the U.S. and Canada. Continuing Education In order to renew his or her license, an ND must satisfactorily complete 60 hours of approved continuing education biennially. (This requirement is waived for the first renewal.) The cont inuing education submitted must meet the following requirements (Section 3635): At least 20 hours shall be in pharmacotherapeutics. No more than 15 hours may be in naturopathic medical journals or osteopathic or allopathic medical journals, or audio or videotaped presentations, slides, programmed in struction, or computer-assisted instruction or preceptorships. No more than 20 hours may be in any single topic. No more than 15 hours of the conti nuing education requirements for the specialty certificate in naturopathic childbirth att endance shall apply to the 60 hours of continuing education requirement. The continuing education requirements ma y be met through continuing education courses approved by the California Natu ropathic Doctors Association, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, the Medical Board of California, the California State Boar d of Pharmacy, t he State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, or the Bureau. Scope of Practice The Act authorizes an ND to: Order and perform physical and laborat ory examinations for diagnostic purposes, including, but not limited to, phl ebotomy, clinical laboratory tests, speculum examinations, orificial ex aminations, and physiological function tests (Section 3640(a)). 8 Order diagnostic imaging studies, incl uding X-ray, ultrasound, mammogram, bone densitometry, and others, consistent with naturopathic training as determined by the Bureau, but shall refer the studies to an appropriately licensed health care professional to conduct the study and interpret the results (Section 3640(b)). Dispense, administer, order, and pr escribe or perform the following (Section 3640(c)): (1) Food, extracts of food, nutraceutic als, vitamins, amino acids, minerals, enzymes, botanicals and their extrac ts, botanical medicines, homeopathic medicines, all dietary supplements and nonprescription drugs as defined by the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, consistent with the routes of administration as specified. (2) Hot or cold hydrotherapy; naturopathi c physical medicine inclusive of the manual use of massage, stretching, resi stance, or joint play examination but exclusive of small amplitude mo vement at or beyond the end range of normal joint motion; electromagnet ic energy; colon hydrotherapy; and therapeutic exercise. (3) Devices, including, but not lim ited to, therapeutic devices, barrier contraception, and durable medical equipment. (4) Health education and health counseling. (5) Repair and care incidental to superfi cial lacerations and abrasions, except suturing. (6) Removal of foreign bodies located in the superficial tissues. Utilize routes of administration that include oral, nasal, auricular, 4323(d)) specify that an ND may only utilize the ocular and intravenous routes of adminis tration if he or she is clinically competent in those areas.] Independently prescribe epinephrine to treat anaphy laxis, and natural and synthetic hormones (Section 3640.7). Furnish or order drugs, including Schedule III-V controlled substances, under supervision of a medical doctor, with requirements for standardized procedures and protocols identical to those for nurse practitioners (Section 3640.5). The Act restricts an ND from perfo rming any of the following functions (Section 3642): 9 Prescribe, dispense, or administer a controlled substance, except as authorized. Administer therapeutic ionizing radiation or radioactive substances. Practice or claim to practice any ot her system or method of treatment for which licensure is required, unless otherwise licensed to do so. Administer general or spinal anesthesia. Perform an abortion. Perform any surgical procedure. Perform acupuncture or traditional Ch inese and Asian medicine, including Chinese herbal medicine, unless al so licensed in California as an acupuncturist. 10 COMMITTEE FINDINGS Formulary Laws from Other States As the scope of practice for NDs varies fr om state to state, so do the laws and regulations regarding prescribing. Of t he 13 other states that license NDs, 9 of those states allow NDs to prescribe independently, without any MD supervision or protocol. Only one state, Kansas, wh ich instituted licensure in 2003, requires MD supervision, and Maine requires collaboration with a physician for one year prior to independent prescribing. State ND Licensure Enacted # of Current Active NDs Prescriptive Authority MD Supervision Required Alaska 1986 40 No No Arizona 1935 375 Yes No Connecticut 1920 210 No No Hawaii 1925 85 Yes No Idaho 2005 8 Yes No Kansas 2003 11 Yes Yes Maine 1995 27 Yes 1 year Montana 1991 67 Yes No New Hampshire 1994 57 No No Oregon 1927 715 Yes No Utah 1997 18 Yes No Vermont 1995 117 Yes No Washington 1919 802 Yes No The formularies for each state vary greatly . A brief summary is given below. The actual formularies may be viewed in the Appendix. Arizona has the broadest formulary in the nation. Arizona NDs are allowed to independently prescribe all classes of pr escription drugs, with 4 exceptions: IV medications (except vitamins, chelation therapy, and drugs used in emergency resuscitation and stabiliza tion, which are allowed). Controlled substances listed as Schedule I or II (except morphine is allowed). Cancer chemotherapeutics classified as legend drugs. Antipsychotics. To support this broad prescribing author ity, Arizona passed HR 2028 in 2002. This bill required, as of January 1, 2005, that all NDs complete a 60-hour series of pharmacy courses and pass an examinatio n. After that date, only NDs who have completed the additional training and passed the test in 11 pharmacotherapeutics are able to prescri be drugs and controlled substances. Southwest College in Tempe, Arizona has made this additional training part of their required curriculum for NDs. Hawaii state law authorizes NDs to prescri be vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids. Idaho passed a bill in 2005 authorizing licensure of NDs. The bill creates a formulary council to establish a formulary for use by NDs that is consistent with the training and education of NDs. The formulary will be reviewed on an annual basis. To date, the formulary has not been completed. Kansas passed an ND licensing law in 2003. It authorizes an intravenous and intramuscular formulary which must be under the supervision of a physician. Kansas is the only state, other than Californi a, which requires continuous MD supervision for prescribing. Maine NDs are allowed to independently pr escribe noncontrolled legend drugs after completing a 12-month collaborative re lationship with a licensed allopathic or osteopathic physician to review the NDs prescribing practices. Montana law requires a five-member formulary committee to establish a natural substance formulary list and review the list on an annual basis. Among other items, the approved list of natural substances contains antibiotics and hormones. Oregon NDs have wide prescribing authority. All substances on the formulary are recommended by the formulary counc il and approved by the State Board of Naturopathic Examiners. Utah NDs are allowed to prescribe noncontro lled drugs that are consistent with competent practice of naturopathic medicine and are approved in collaboration with the Naturopathic Formulary Advisory Peer Committee. Vermont law authorizes the Commissioner of H ealth to establish the formulary with the advice of advisory appointees. The formulary lists the substances that are authorized as well as their route of administration, and in some instances even the specific dose and length of treatment. Washington state law was recently amended to allow NDs a broader formulary. HB 1546 of 2005 defined naturopathic medicines to mean \"vitamins; minerals, botanical medicines; homeopathi c medicines; hormones; and those legend drugs and controlled substances consistent with naturopathic medical practice in accordance with rules established by t he secretary.\" An updated formulary has not yet been completed. 12 Safety Record of ND Prescribing In preparation for this report, the Bur eau contacted the licensing agencies for each of the states that allo w NDs to prescribe. None of the states reported any patient harm or disciplinary action due to ND prescribing. In addition, the states were not aware of any civil actions against NDs for prescribing. The Bureau also contacted NCMIC Insurance Company. NCMIC insures NDs in all of the licensing states and also insure s the naturopathic medical schools. In a letter to the Bureau dated June 7, 2006, NCMIC stated: \"In the five years that NCMIC has been insuring Naturopathic Phys icians and the colleges, we have never opened a claim against a Naturopathic Physician involving prescription medications.\" [See Appendix.] Additionally, the Committee contacted Jury Verdicts Northwest (JVN) to see if there were any civil actions filed agai nst a licensed ND. JVN covers both Oregon and Washington, the two st ates with the greatest num ber of NDs and that have been licensing NDs for a considerable le ngth of time (since 1919 and 1927, respectively). JVN responded \"Upon revie wing cases contained in Jury Verdicts Northwest's database we found no cases against naturopaths for prescription negligence, or for that matter our database contained no cases against naturopaths at all.\" [See Appendix.] Why Do NDs Need to Prescribe? The NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine considers naturopathy a \"major Western whole medi cal system\" that \"involves complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved indepe ndently from or parallel to allopathic (conventional) medicine.\" In 1987, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) began wo rk on a consensus definition of naturopathic medicine for the modern era. The defin ition, unanimously adopted by the AANP's House of Delegates in 1989, focused on the guiding naturopathic principles and philosophy rather t han specific therapeutic modalities or treatments. The definition reads: \"N aturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health care - an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles which underlie and determine its practice. T hese principles are based upon the objective observation of the nature of health and disease, and are continually reexamined in the light of scientific advances. Methods used are consistent with these principles and are chosen upon the basis of patient individuality. Naturopathic physicians are primary health care practitioners, whose diverse techniques include modern and traditional , scientific and empirical methods.\" 13 The AANP recommended that further work on practice principles move to the academic community. Throughout the 1990' s clinical faculty and practitioners built on the core foundation throughout the 1990's. In 1997, \"The Process of Healing, a Unifying Theory of Natur opathic Medicine\" was published in the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine (Zeff). The article presented three principles underlying the practice of naturopathic medicine. T he first of these is the characterization of disease as a process rather than a pathologic entity. The second is the focus on the determinants of health rather than on pathology. The third is the concept of a t herapeutic hierarchy. As t aught in naturopathic medical schools, the therapeutic hierarchy is a guideline to applying the modalities of naturopathic medicine according to uni que needs of an individual patient. 1. Establish the conditions for health. 2. Stimulate the self-healing mechan isms (Vis Medicatrix Naturae). 3. Support weakened or dam aged systems or organs. 4. Address struct ural integrity. 5. Address pathology using specific natural substances, modalities or interventions. 6. Address pathology using specific pharmacologic or synthetic substances. 7. Suppress pathology. Here is an example of a child with Recurr ent Otitis Media (ear infections), a common reason for seeking naturopathic care. Using the hierarchy above: 1. Look for and address obstacles to health - allergies, environmental irritants (e.g., 2nd hand cigarette smoke), diet high in simple sugars, etc. 2. Stimulate the healing power of nature with ther apies like homeopathy and hydrotherapy. 3. Support affected systems such as i mmune support - Vitamins C and A, oligopolysaccharides; respiratory s upport with herbs like Hydrastis or Berberis. 4. Address structural factors with so ft tissue manual therapy like lymphatic drainage. 5. Treat the pathology with specific natural therapies such as topical Garlic-Hypericum oil. 6. Typically children respond well experi encing fewer infections with faster recovery. Should a child experience a particularly severe ear infection, it may be necessary to prescribe a course of antibiotics. 7. If the infection does not subside, referral to a MD may be necessary. Another scenario might involve a child w ho experiences signifi cant relief and the parents bring the child in for a sore thr oat, that turns out to be Group A Strep. The safest, most effective, and most convenient treatment would be for the naturopathic doctor to prescribe a c ourse of appropriate antibiotics. 14 ---A final example involves a patient who has relocated to a new area and chooses a local ND to be his or her primary care doctor. The patient has been on long-term high dose proton-pump inhibitors to decrease symptoms of GI reflux (heartburn). After facilitat ing the therapeutic hierarchy of naturopathic practice, it is only a short time before it becomes re cognizable that the dose of the proton pump inhibitor is excessive and should be lowered (due to no exacerbation of symptoms nor any known underlying pat hology from thorough review of diagnostic imaging). Thus, the ND writes a new prescription for a lower dose, or perhaps discontinues the medi cation and the patient is maintained in the \"lower\" levels of naturopathic hierarchy. It is important to note that modification of a pre-existing prescription can only be done legally if the ND has authority to prescribe the medication in the first place. The Therapeutic Hierarchy creates a guide line for prescribing (or referring for) therapeutic life changes, homeopathic & botanical medicines, nutritional supplements, manipulative therapy and legend drugs by naturopathic doctors that is both consistent with the profession's prin ciples and addresses the patient's dynamic needs (see Appendix). Furnishing (or Ordering) vs. Prescribing The Act authorizes NDs to both furnish drugs and prescribe certain items. Prescribing is done independent of MD s upervision, and includes both natural substances such as vitamins, mineral s, botanicals, and homeopathic medicines, as well as natural and synthetic horm ones and epinephrine for anaphylaxis. NDs are also authorized to furn ish or order other prescription drugs, which must be done under the supervision of a medical doc tor, and authorizes other prescription drugs, including Schedule III-V controlled substances. Furnis hing or ordering is done under procedures and protocols with the supervision of a medical doctor. The required procedures in the Act are identical to the procedures for nurse practitioners. Inclusionary or Exclusionary Formulary The Committee studied both inclusionar y formularies and exclusionary formularies. An inclusionary formulary is a list of every drug or drug classification that is authorized to be prescribed. An ex clusionary formulary is a list of drugs or drug classifications that are not allowed to be prescribed. Arizona is the only state that currently has an exclusionary formulary. The Committee initially approved a broad exclusionary formulary, which would have allowed NDs to independently prescri be a large number of medications. A survey of education at the approved nat uropathic schools showed that adequate education to support this enhanced prescribing could be completed by a postgraduate course, similar to one rec ently required for NDs in Arizona. 15 However, in the interest of ensuring ma ximum public safety and taking the most conservative approach, the final positi on of the Committee was to recommend a limited inclusionary formulary. The inclusionary formulary included in the recommendation section of this report was drafted with the int ention of allowing for the use of the most common medicati ons necessary for safe and efficacious use in primary care medicine. An ND would still need to qualify and receive a furnishing number as outlined in regulat ion, and would additionally have to complete 20 hours of pharmacology fo r each license renewal. The Committee determined that the inclus ionary formulary would be the most functional for both NDs and pharmacists. Formulary Upkeep As can be seen from the information gi ven above, most states appoint an advisory committee that has the authorization to create and update the state's ND formulary. Currently a statutory change would be necessary to allow the Bureau or a Committee to determine and updat e the formulary. It would be much easier for the Bureau through the Committee or the Naturopathic Advisory Council to update the formulary through regulation rather than through a more lengthy statutory process. This would be true particularly in the case of a drug that is later discovered to be unsafe, or if a safer more effective drug becomes available. In order to protect cons umers, an emergency regulation could be adopted which would remove the unsafe dr ug from the formulary. Intravenous formulary upkeep should also be done by the Bureau through the regulatory process. Routes of Administration Need to Be Clarified for Prescribing Section 3640(d) of the Act states that \"[a] naturopathic doctor may utilize routes of administration that include oral, nasal, auricular, naturopat hic doctor to \"dispense, administer, order, and prescribe or perform the following: \"'(1) Food, extracts of food, nutraceuticals, vitamins, amino acids, minerals, enzymes, botanicals and their extrac ts, botanical medicines, homeopathic medicines, all dietary supplements and nonp rescription drugs as defined by the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, consistent with the routes of administration identified in subdivision (d). '\" (Emphasis added.) The sponsors of SB 907 (California Naturo pathic Doctors Association) intended for naturopathic doctors to be able to administer the substances authorized by Section 3640(c)(1) through any of the authorized routes of administration, including intramuscular (IM) and intr avenous (IV) when safe and appropriate. After SB 907 was passed, there was some confusion as to whether NDs were 16 authorized to prescribe for all the routes of administration specified in the Act. In order to clarify this perceived gray area, AB 302 added the phrase highlighted above \"consistent with the rout es of administration identified in subdivision (d)\" to Section 3640(c)(1). It has been stat ed that perhaps the amendment should have been worded \" regardless of the route of administration.\" The Committee supports further amendments being made to the Act and the pharmacy laws in order to clarify that NDs are able to i ndependently prescribe the substances in Section 3640(c)(1) for all routes of administration listed in Section 3640(d). Current Furnishing Laws Are Untenable Over the year of meetings held by the Committee, it was determined there is a limited number of MDs who have training in naturopathic philosophy or practice or who have had the extensive clinical experience in naturopathic modalities to make them appropriate supervisors for NDs in this area of care. The few physicians who are willing and well-tr ained for ND supervision are having difficulty getting malpractice coverage to do the supervision. The Bureau has had reports from both MDs who are having di fficulty getting malpractice insurance and NDs who are having difficulty finding an MD supervisor. The Committee has concluded the supervision provision is untenable. Additionally, although the Committee and t he Bureau attempted several contacts with MD malpractice insurance companies, neither were able to find any malpractice insurance company willing to give us specific information about a cost or surcharge for an MD to supervise an ND. One of the large malpractice insurers indicated that it would not ev en consider insuring an MD to supervise an ND. It should also be noted that the malpractic e companies routinely insure MDs who supervise other medical professionals such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Both nurse practitioners and physician assistants have a lesser entry-level training and education requi rement than NDs. Although most NDs carry their own malpractice insurance, it may be impossible for an MD to get insurance for the supervision requirement in the Act. 17 COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS There are two main factors to be considered when making recommendations for naturopathic medicine formulary laws. Firs t, it is paramount that the act of prescribing or IV administration be done safely by a competently trained ND. Secondly, the substance being administ ered must be prepared in a way to provide for absolute patient safety. Both of these factors were considered by the Committee in many arduous discu ssions in order to prepare the recommendations provided in this report. Recommendation # 1\u2014Prescribing Laws Need to Be Clarified. It was the intent of the sponsors of SB 907, and the intent of the clarification to Section 3640(c)(1) in AB 302 that NDs are to be recognized as independent intravenous and intramuscular prescribers for the substances listed in Section 3640(c)(1)--food, extracts of food, nutra ceuticals, vitamins, amino acids, minerals, enzymes, botanicals and t heir extracts, botanical medicines, homeopathic medicines, all dietary supplements and nonprescription drugs as defined by the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Committee recommends that statutory and/or regulat ory changes be made to effectuate this clarification in the pharmacy laws and the Act. Recommendation # 2\u2014Regulation of the Ocular Route. Section 3627 requires the Bureau to make recommendations regarding the required supervision and protocols for utilization of the ocular route of prescription drug administration. Section 4234(d) of Division 40 of Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations specifies that an ND may only use the ocular route of administration if he or she is clinically competent in that area. Clinical competence is defined as possessing and ex ercising the degree of learning, skill, care and experience ordinarily possessed and exercised by a member of the appropriate discipline in clinical practice. Use of the ocular route is limited by the authorized formulary (see Ophthalmic A gents in Recommendation #6). The Committee has determined that further regulation of this route is not necessary. 18 Recommendation # 3\u2014IV Therapy Blueprint. It is the intent of the Co mmittee to protect the health and welfare of California consumers by ensuring the training and competency of NDs who use the intravenous route of admin istration. The Committ ee recommends that the Bureau implement a regulatory change that would require any ND who wishes to utilize the intravenous route of administrat ion to complete a 25-hour continuing education course in IV administration, as specified. Course Requirements: Courses are to be pre-approved by the Bureau, and are to contain a minimum of 25 contact hours. Of the 25 hours, 14 hours s hall be identified as practicum.

III.IV fluids, incl uding mOsm VI.Vein/site selection, site pr eparation, insertion techniques VII.Complications with therapies, errors and adverse reactions, reporting errors to appropriate agencies, error prevention, follow-up with patient complications, FDA Watch.VIII.Emergency protocols, management and referral. IX.Pharmacology, indications, preparation, adverse reactions, nutrient/drug interactions and administration of IV vitami ns, minerals, electrolytes, amino acids, botanicals, biologicals , including care , OSHA, certification standards XI.Catheters/pic lines: standard of care for approach and management, co-management with medical providers.XII.Practicum a.Observations of IV set up and adm inistration\u2014must observe at least 10. b.Successful completion of IV set up, administration and managem ent\u2014must complete at least 10. XIII.Exam Successful completion (70% or greater) of a minimum of 50 questions (10% or more of the questions must have dire ct content to California formulary categories). 19 Recommendation # 4\u2014IV Formulary.

It is recommended that changes be made to statutory law and subsequently to the Bureau's regulations to allow NDs to be able to independently prescribe, without supervision or protocol, from the formulary below (in addition to what is currently allowed by Section 3640.7). It is recommended that this formulary be included and maintained in the California Code of Regulations, rather than in statute. It is further recommended that a statutory change be made in order to require the Bureau in consultation wit h the Committee and the Naturopathic Advisory Council to review and update the naturopathic formulary on an annual basis. Changes to the formulary by the Bureau would be recommended by the Committee and approved by the Naturopathic Advisory Council.
