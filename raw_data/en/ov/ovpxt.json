Now it is time to give the whole family the best available tool to stay safe by getting vaccinated. Vaccines are safe and effective in protecting children against severe infection by COVID-19. It is also important to continue getting parents and caregivers vaccinated so they can help their children grow and thrive. COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe and effective for everyone aged 6 months and older, and the vaccines will help keep our children healthy for school, playdates and other activities that help them build bright futures. When more of our younger family members are vaccinated, they can join their older siblings, family, and friends in being safer and doing the things they love that support their long-term health and wellness. Though your child may experience mild to moderate side effects after vaccine injection, these are common responses and a sign that their body is building up its defenses to protect them. It's normal for a child to feel sore at the injection site or have a fever, headache, and muscle or joint pain for a day or two after vaccination. Vaccines are already a normal and regular part of your child's immunization schedule and just like your children's routine vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are an important addition to these safeguards. It is also important to continue other harm reduction measures! It is strongly recommended that families wear a mask in indoor settings to limit the spread of germs. Wearing a well-fitting mask is key to keeping everyone in the family safe. Video en Espa\u00f1ol Vaccine eligibility Any Californian aged 6 months and older can get vaccinated, for free. Your immigration or insurance status does not matter. No one will ask about your immigration status when you get vaccinated. The eligibility for additional doses for immunocompromised people and booster doses vary by COVID-19 vaccine brand. The COVID-19 vaccine brands have different age and eligibility requirements. To view your child's vaccination record, including their COVID-19 doses, request a copy using the Digital Vaccine Record (DVR) portal. Through the DVR portal, it is easy to access your or your child's immunization records, which can be used for school or childcare entry, work, and to verify DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) doses. Your DVR can also be printed or saved on your smartphone. The updated bivalent vaccine is now available for children ages 6 months - 5 years. Children 6 months - 5 years may be eligible for the updated bivalent vaccine if they: Have completed the primary series of the Moderna Vaccine and it has been at least 2 months Are 6 months - 4 years of age and have not begun or completed the three-dose primary series of the Pfizer vaccine. They can now receive the Pfizer updated bivalent vaccine as their third dose in their primary series. Children 6 months through 4 years of age who have already completed their three-dose primary series with the original (monovalent) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will not be eligible for a bivalent vaccine at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people ages 5 years and older receive one updated bivalent vaccine if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose, whether that was: Their final primary series dose, or An original (monovalent) booster People who have gotten more than one original (monovalent) booster are also recommended to get an updated bivalent vaccine. You must have gotten your primary series vaccine or original booster at least 4-8 weeks ago to receive the bivalent vaccine. See if you're eligible.

We must get young people vaccinated to prevent more hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccinations protect children from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as MIS-C, hospitalization, and death. They can also shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting children 6 months and up vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love. Video en Espa\u00f1ol If I'm pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. The CDC strongly recommends that if you're pregnant, could be pregnant, or are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated. If you get COVID-19 while you are pregnant, you are more likely to get severely ill. Additionally, you are at increased risk of complications that can affect your pregnancy and developing baby, including premature birth. The vaccines are safe for you and your baby. They do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19. Vaccination during pregnancy helps protect your baby from COVID-19 by building antibodies in your blood and milk that is shared with the baby. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. You are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines if you have completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series and received the most recent booster dose recommended for you by the CDC. COVID-19 vaccine recommendations are based on three things: Your age The vaccine you first received, and The length of time since your last dose People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have different recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. You are still up to date if you receive all COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you and then become ill with COVID-19.
