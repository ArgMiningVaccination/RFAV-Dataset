Remedies for your COVID-19 sore throat If your sore throat is due to COVID-19,, you can use numerous treatments to ease your pain and discomfort, ranging from home remedies to over-the-counter medications to prescription medications. Contact your provider to see if a prescription medication is appropriate. A few recommended remedies to soothe your throbbing throat are: - Take over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol. This will help to ease the pain and take the edge off. - If your sore throat is accompanied by congestion, sneezing or a runny nose, try an over-the-counter decongestant such as Claritin D. Be aware that this medication can cause palpitations and high blood pressure. - Make sure to stay hydrated. Staying hydrated boosts your body's immune system and helps to flush bacteria out. - Gargle with salt water by mixing in one teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of warm water. Gargle the saltwater mixture for a few seconds and then spit the mixture out. Remember to disinfect your sink afterward. - Try sucking on a cough drop or medicated lozenge. This will help to keep your throat moist. - Drink warm tea or broth to soothe your throat. - Take a hot shower or plug in a humidifier. The warm, moist, steaming air will help to soothe a sore throat. - Get lots of rest because your body does its best healing when you are at rest. How long does it last? Typically, a sore throat can last up to seven days, but a sore throat caused by COVID-19 can persist until the infection has cleared or it can linger for a few weeks or months. In this case, the pain will grow intensely in the beginning and reduce as your body heals. If your aching throat remains a few weeks or months after your COVID infection or if your symptoms are severe, contact your physician or visit an urgent care location. "}
