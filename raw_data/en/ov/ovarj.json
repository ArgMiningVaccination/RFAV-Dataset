The Board is the final authority as to all matt ers relating to or in any way affecting the operation and we ll-being of the University. Campbell is affiliated with the B aptist State Convention of Nor th Carolina, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of North Carolina, and the Cooperative Bapti st Fellowship. The University's relationship with its affiliate s is voluntary and each mutually affirms that Campbell University is an autonomous entity governe d by its Board of Trustees. F ACULTY STATUS , RESPONSIBILITIES , AND OBLIGATIONS Faculty Status Types of Faculty FullTime Status: Full-time status as a member of the Campbell University facult y commences on the effective date of a teaching or professional contract.

T he general policy of the University is that staff personnel do not provide academic instruction. However, the University recog nizes that there may be instances where the expertise of staff and the academic needs o f the University comingle. In such instances the University allows reasonable, though limited, exceptions to its policy. These exceptions must be approved for each semester by the Dean respo nsible for the academic area of instruction, the Dean and Vice President in whose reporting line the staff individual is positioned, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs & Provo st. In its handling of requests for exceptions, the University must first determine th at the level of preparation, expertise, and inter est of a staff member is appro priate to the teaching assignment. Care must be given to ensure that the teaching assignment in no way interferes with the individual's responsibilities as staff. All related matters, su ch as class time, salary, etc., are subject to Vice President approval.

Faculty Organization Every member of the faculty of th e University's colleges and sc hools is a member of the University Faculty. Within their College or School, each facult y member shall be a member of an academic program or department. Each academic program will h ave a faculty member who serves as the program director. E ach department will ordinarily have a Department Chair. Each college or school is administer ed by a Dean.

The Provost is a member of the University Cabinet and reports directly to the President of the University. The faculty of each college or s chool shall consist of all memb ers of the full-time teaching staff plus certain others with faculty status: the President, the Pro vost, and the appropriate Dean. Faculty include all librarians w ith professional degrees. The P resident and the Vice President for Academic Affairs & Provost are eligible t o meet and vote with the faculty of any unit of the University. Faculty Responsibilities and Obligations The primary function of the facul ties of Campbell University is to teach students, research the truth, and serve the community, all of which grow out of their presence in a community of Christian scholars. In the process of doing this, they become i nvolved in a second critical 1 The terms \"Vice President for A cademic Affairs & Provost\" and \"Provost\" are interchangeable. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 7 function, which is to give expert advice and recommendations to the President of the University, through whatever admin istrative stru cture and proce dures he designates. The President charged by the Trus tees with the ad ministrative re sponsibility of fulfilling the mission of the University. Given that the faculties of the Univ ersity are responsible for the quality of the educational program , which is the University's p rimary reason for being, they have an obligation to give the President their best advice on academic matters and to rely on his judgement, maturity, and wisdom to balance what are often competing demands on limited resources and to do so in the best interests of the entire comm unity. Teaching Responsibilities Curriculum: The University places primary responsibility for the content, quality, and effectiveness of the curriculu m with its full-time faculty. Fac ulty have the final say in pedagogical issues involving their disciplines: their plans, th eir research, their teaching efforts, and their uses of technologies. However, the planning and delivery of curriculum is a cooperative effort between the f aculty and its ad ministrative leaders (department chairs, deans, and the Provost). Faculty are e xpected not only to engage in te aching and scholarship, but also to engage in periodic review a nd revision of the curriculum, offering concrete recommendations to the administrative leaders who allocate funds and balance co mpeting demands for limited resources in order to implement the plans and programs designed to produce high-quality educational programs. The normal process for changes in curricula begins at the depar tmental level. The departmental faculty develops proposals regarding curricula, and the Departm ent Chair submits them to the appropriate Curriculum Committee of the College/School. Changes in curricula include, but are not limited to, additi on of, major change s in, or dropping of c ourses, concentrations, programs, or majors. After the proposal has been acted upon by the Colleg e/School Curriculum Committee, the chair of the committee shall give notice in writ ing to the Department Chair and to the Dean that the proposal w as accepted or rejected. If a pr oposal is reject ed, a revised proposal may be resubmitted to t he committee. Approved proposal s for curricular changes that fall under the purview of the Uni versity Curriculum Council shall be sent to the chair of that committee by the chair of the College/School Cu rriculum Committ ee or the Dean of the School. Teaching Load: The teaching responsibilities of a fulltime faculty member sh all be defined with respect to semester hours and contact hours according to t he expectations of the school in which the faculty member serves . Unless specified otherwise, the normal teaching load is 12 to 15 semester hours. From semester t o semester, the number of dif ferent courses and sections will vary according to departmental scheduling and needs. The teachi ng load is normally reduced by 3 credit hours per semester for D epartment Chairs to compensate for administrative responsibilities. Oth er variations in the schedule may be made at the discretion of the Dean of the college or school. Course overloads for full-time undergrad uate faculty shall be limited to no more than four contact hours, o r the equivalent, per semeste r. Any exception must be approved by the Dean of t he college or school. The teaching load of part-time and adjunct faculty should norma lly not exceed 12 credit hours per semester. Permissions to exc eed this limit must be received from the appropriate Dean. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 8 Occasionally, unusual circumstance s may present a faculty membe r with the opportunity or necessity to teach an additional course or section that would a dd semester or contact hours. Under these conditions, and with prior approval of the Dean, ex tra compensation will be offered. Faculty members awarded an exter nally funded grant of significa nce may have a reduction in their regularly assigned workload in order to allow time to man age the funded research or creative activity. The actual workload will be adjusted in cons ultation with the appropriate Chair of the department and D ean of the college or school. Course Syllabus Requirements: A syllabus is a primary instrument for detailing the content, requirements, and other informati on pertinent to a course. Curr ent and thorough syllabi are required for all courses, with copies filed in the offices of b oth the Department Chair and the academic Dean. Syllabi templates are posted to the Assessment c ommunity in Blackboard by the academic departments in advance of the semester for adoptio n and utilization by AOE and adjunct faculty. The following lis t reflects the minimum required components for course syllabi: Course Title and Number Professor Name Professor Contact Information, to include as appropriate office location, office hours, phone, e-mail, web page, etc. Course Description, to include a statement of the relationship between the course and the University's mission.

Acade mic advising promotes academic excellence and empowers students to implement educational plans that are consistent with their personal values and goals. Adviseme nt establishes collaborative mentoring relationships and is thus part of the teaching role. Each student entering a degree program at Campbell University i s assigned an academic advisor (or advisory committee) associated with t heir academic program. In most undergraduate programs, students are initially assigned professional advisors whose role is to facilitate students' academic transition a nd intensive exploration related to academic and career goals. Faculty serve as advisors to uppe r-class undergraduate students who have declared a major within the respective department. The student is ultimately respons ible for learni ng and satisfyi ng all degree requirements as indicated in the University Catalog under which they are subject. To that end, students are expected to do the following: Accept full ownership for a ll academic decisions; Prepare for advising sessions a nd bring appropriate materials and resources; Consult with their advisor, in a timely manner, when in need of assistance; Follow through on all appropriate a ctions identified during each advising session or other communication; 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 10 Clarify personal values and goals du ring their time at Campbell ; Know and adhere to institutional policies, procedures, requirem ents, and important dates. Imperative to supporting student s in the pursuit of learning an d the completion of degree requirements is the timely, rel iable, and caring advice of faculty. To that end, advisors are expected to do the following: Understand and provide accurate information regarding universit y curriculum requirements, programs of st udy, academic policies, and procedu res; Monitor student academic progre ss and recommend, if necessary, strategies to improve; Assist students to plan coursewo rk which considers the student' s academic goals and background; Be available for a reasonable duration of crucial academic calendar periods (registration and drop/add) and provide approval, as appropriate, for advisees' enrollment actions; Make proper referrals when neces sary (e.g. Office of Academic A dvising, Counseling Services, Disability Services, Financial Aid); Understand and adhere to the mandates of the Family Education R ights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The Office of Academic Advising ser ves as a resource for all undergraduate students and advisors. The office provides maj or and career exploration serv ices for all undergraduate students, as well as guidance for academic planning and goal-se tting. Faculty advisors are encouraged to refer students to the Office of Academic Advising for services and resources supplementary to their own advise ment. The Office of Academic Advising is also available to support faculty in d elivering effective advisement.

Committees: Full-time faculty are expect ed to serve on committees of the u niversity and their respective colleges/schools. The University makes use of a number of standing committees to carry out the needs of the univers ity. Faculty are nominated by the University Nominations Committee to serve on these standin g committees. The University Nominations Committee is composed of representatives fr om across the Colleges and School s. Nominations are voted on by the Faculty at the annual Fal l Faculty Orientation. The full list of the Faculty and Staff Committees can be found at https://www.campbell.edu/about/l eadership/provost/faculty- committees/ . 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 12 Each college or school shall form additional committees accordi ng to its needs, normally to include a Faculty Development Ev aluation Committee and a Curric ulum Committee. The process by which faculty are appo inted to serve on the college/school committees will be determined by the respective Dean. Involvement in the Larger Community: Faculty members are expect ed to give of their time, service, and talents to the commu nity, consistent with excellen ce in their duties at the University. Academic Policies and Procedures Academic policies and procedures are published in the Universit y's academic bulletins or catalogs. Please refer to the Undergraduate Studies Bulletin (http://courses.campbell.edu/) or the appropriate College/School academic bulletin. Training Each faculty member, regardles s of rank, will be required to co mplete certain mandatory training on an annual basis as dete rmined by the University. Tr aining topics may include, but are not limited to, FERPA, Title I X, anti-harassment and discri mination, and accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). F ACULTY EMPLOYMENT , RANK, PROMOTION , AND TENURE Faculty Appointment Each College/School will generally follow all University guidel ines or regulations relating to appointment, tenure, and promoti on, except as may be set forth in each College/School's respective addendum to this Faculty Handbook. These guidelines are meant to inform faculty of the standards of the College/School and are to be used by the a ppropriate department and College/School committees in cons idering appointment, promotion , and tenure. They reflect minimum requirements. The University Board of Trustees hires members of the faculty o f Campbell University and delegates this authority to the President of the University. Upon determination by the appropriate Dean and the VP for Academic Affairs & Provost of a vacancy/need for a full-time faculty member, the P resident may accept recommendations concer ning potential faculty appointments. Faculty involveme nt in the selection process is e xpected. At the time of initial appointment, it shall be set f orth in writing whether the position is tenure-tr ack or non-tenure- track. The general responsibilities of faculty include teaching, scholarship, service, and support of the University Mission. The character of faculty wor k assignments m ay differ, however, among the various departments within a give n college/school. The distribu tion of each faculty member's responsibilities regarding teaching, scholarship, and service i s determined by Chair of the Department in consultation with the faculty member, subject to approval of the Dean. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 13 Faculty Ranks All full-time faculty members s hall be appointed to an appropri ate rank as described below. The four standard ranks are instruc tor, assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. All persons appointed to whatever rank are expected to commit thems elves unreservedly to the stated mission of the University. Instructor: For appointment as instructor, the candidate must hold, at a minimum, the master's degree or its equivalent from a n accredited institution with at least 18 hours in the field of instruction, preferably with e vidence of pursuit of the doctora te or other terminal degree. He or she must also have a willingness to teach well, interest in pro ductive scholarship, and willingness to cooperate with othe rs for the good of the Univer sity, as well as commitment to the mission of the University. In structors will typically hold temporary, one-year appointments. Assistant Professor: For appointment or promotion to assistant professor, the candi date ordinarily shall have earned the doctorate, or an equivalent terminal degree in the field of specialization, from an accredite d institution. He or she must also present evidence of success as a teacher and scholar or, if this appointment is a faculty m ember's first teaching appointment, must demonstrate a potential to teach well and to be productive in scholarship. He or she must also demonstrate a willingness to cooperate with ot hers for the good of the University, and be committed to the mission of the University. Associate Professor: For promotion or appointment to a ssociate professor, the candi date must possess the qualifications for a n assistant professor, and in a ddition he or she must possess a record of significant achievem ent in his or her field or profes sion. There shall be clear evidence that his or her schol arly activities are respected both inside and outside his or her immediate academic community. There shall be clear evidence of his or her continued professional growth and of continued effectiveness in teaching. There shall also be clear evidence of ability to provide leadership, both withi n and outside the University. Professor: For promotion or appointment to professor, the candidate must possess the qualifications for an associate professor, and in addition he o r she must possess a record of exceptional intellectual, educational, or artistic achievement and a demonstrable record for excellence in teaching. There shall be evidence of his or her c ontinued professional growth, and the judgment on promotion shall primarily consider evidence of achievement in teaching and scholarship since the most recen t promotion or appointment. The re shall also be continued clear evidence of ability to provi de leadership, both within and outside the University. The rank of Professor, the highest the University can be stow, is reserved f or those who exemplify the highest level of potential and ach ievement in Christian higher education. Promotion and Tenure Criteria for Promotion and Tenure Outstanding performance in the are as of teaching, scholarship, institutional and community service, and support of the Uni versity mission will be considered in any recommendation for promotion o r granting of tenure . The weight accorded to each of these elements will vary from case to case, and each department s hall have the primary respon sibility in developing specific 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 14 guidelines that define scholarshi p in the fields represented in that department. However, in all cases, demonstrated teaching ability must be a critical conside ration. Faculty rank distribution will be taken into considerati on in the promotion process. Advancement in rank or the awa rding of tenure cannot be guarant eed. The criteria described below are recognized as a general guide which will be considere d in making a decision regarding both prom otion and tenure. Years of Service: Years of service at the University and elsewhere may be taken into account, but seniority by itself cannot be the primary reason for granti ng of tenure or promotion to any rank. While there may be excepti ons, it is generally expected f or a faculty member to spend a minimum of five years at the University in a particular rank be fore seeking promotion. It is understood that a faculty member without the earned doctorate o r its equivalent will spend additional time in rank before be ing considere d for promotion. Teaching: Promotions and granting of tenur e shall be made only when ther e is clear evidence of the individual's ability and commitment as a teacher. Evaluation of teaching effectiveness, ability, and commitment shall be based on all relevant materials and evidence, including but not limited to, instructiona l materials and techni ques that incorpo rate new ideas or scholarly research, curriculum or program d evelopment, and student advise ment. Scholarship: Evidence of scholarship shall be sought in the candidate's publications or creative work, supported by all relevant mat erial. Works should be evalu ated as well as listed, and work in progress should be assessed. When work is a product of a joi nt effort, it is the responsibility of the candidate to establish as clearly as possible his or her role in the joint effo rt. It is also the responsibility of the candidate t o indicate those works that ar e re-publications and to describe the differences betwee n similar publications. Service: The faculty plays an important role in the formulation and imp lementation of departmental, College/School, and University policies. Faculty members will, therefore, be judged on the degree and quality of their participation in depa rtmental, College/School, and University governance. Similarly, f aculty contributions to stud ent welfare, through service on committees or advising student o rganizations, should be recognized. Faculty members are expected to be active in and tak e leadership roles in relevant professional societies. Service to the community, state, nation, a nd world, both in th e faculty me mber's special capacity as a scholar and in areas beyond this when the work is pertinent and significant, will be recognized. Support of University Mission: Every faculty member is exp ected to support the Christian mission of the University, as arti culated in its M ission Statem ent. Additional Criteria for Tenure The granting of tenure is the highest faculty honor the Univers ity can bestow. Tenure is a mutual sign and commitment by whi ch the continuity of the Unive rsity's educational goals and objectives are assured. It affirms an individual as an image of the University's mission, and in the act of acceptance, the indi vidual publicly asserts continui ng commitment to its goals. An underlying purpose of granting tenure is to uphold the concept of academic freedom by 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 15 assuring the individual faculty member certain procedural rights that have traditionally been assured to members o f the profession. Specific approved criteria for tenure may vary slightly depending on the School, but in general, any full-time faculty member i n a tenure-track position having the rank of assistant, associate, or professor is eligible to be considered for tenure. Tenure re commendations will depend on outstanding performance in the c riteria outlined above. In addi tion, the following years of service are generally required: Full Professor: A faculty member who has attained the rank of full professor a t Campbell University and has taught full-time at Campbell University for three years shall be eligible for consideration for tenure. Associate Professor: A faculty member who has attain ed the rank of associate profes sor at Campbell University and has taugh t full-time at Campbell Univer sity for five years shall be eligible for consideration for tenure. Assistant Professor: A faculty member who has attained the rank of assistant professor at Campbell University and has taugh t full-time at Campbell Univer sity for seven years shall be eligible for consideration for tenure. For purposes of tenure, any faculty member who receives a salary commensurate with full-time employment at their stated facu lty rank shall be considered as engaged full-time, even if specific duties are partially or wholly of an administrative na ture. Procedures for Promotion and Tenure Stage One -Preliminary Consideration: At the point of eligibility for consideration, a candidate shall explore with their Departm ent Chair and Dean the concept of readiness for promotion or tenure. Such preliminary consideration shall be exploratory, wi th specifics in no way binding on either the faculty member, the Department Chair, the Dean, o r further individuals or committees involved in the proce ss. Should the faculty member d ecide to proceed, by September 15, the candidate mus t organize documentation of thei r readiness for promotion or tenure into a dossier (portfolio) and forward it to the Departm ent Chair. The contents of the dossier should include a cover le tter, a curriculum vitae, a su mmary of student evaluations, copies of scholarly works and ot her creative activities, annual faculty evaluations, copies of Professional Performance Reco rds, and any other supporting mate rials that the candidate may consider relevant to conducting a thorough evaluation. In the cover letter, the candi date should describe his or her w orkload assignments since appointment or promotion to the p resently held rank. The candid ate should specify the proportions of time allocated for teaching, scholarship, and se rvice. In addition, the candidate should describe his or her professi onal activities and attainme nts in relation to the criteria (teaching, scholarship, and servi ce) for promotion or tenure sp ecified in their College/School's guidelines. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 16 Upon receipt of the candidate's dossier, the Department Chair s hall seek letters of evaluation from professionals outside the University. It shall be the Depa rtment Chair's responsibility to establish the qualifi cations of these reviewers in the report and recommendation. Stage Two - Recommendation by the Department Faculty: All reviews begin at the departmental level. The Department Chair, in concert with the r espective members of the department, evaluates both the candidate's record and the role the candidate can be expected to play in the future evolution of t he department's c urriculum and mission. The role of the department is primary. Its recomm endations carry the weight of informed professionals considering their colleagues a nd, more importantly, the future strength and v itality of their curriculum and identity. The full-time faculty members of the department shall consider the merits of the candidate with respect to his or her teaching, scholarship, service, and suppo rt of the University's mission, along with the role of the candida te in light of the department 's curriculum, mission, personnel, projected needs, and all other rel evant departmental concerns. The candidate may request a personal appearance before the d epartment faculty to present hi s or her case. The department faculty may also request that th e candidate appear personally. Following a systematic and rigor ous evaluation, the full-time f aculty members of the department shall vote by secr et ballot on whether to recommend the candidate for promotion/tenure. Following this vote, the Department Chair shall write a report of the department's action. The report, along with any minority reports, shall be forwarded to the School's Faculty Development and Evaluation (FDE) Committee and to the candidate no later than November 15. The candidate shall have one week to respond in writing to the Chair's report of the department's recomm endation. The candidate's resp onse (if any) shall be forwarded to the FDE Committee. Stage Three -Review by the Faculty Development and Evaluation Committee: The School's FDE Committee provides the faculty with a broader forum to cons ider the standards applied in a promotion or tenure decision. It brings faculty from different disciplines together to develop the identity of the total f aculty and, through its recommendati ons, articulates the agreed-upon values and standards of the faculty. After receipt of the departmental report and the candidate's re sponse (if any), the FDE Committee shall consider that re port, any programmatic or fiscal statements written by the Dean, the candidate's record, a nd any and all matters it consid ers relevant to the candidate's application. Such considerations may include, but shall not be limited to, the merits of the candidate, the curriculum and mis sion of the candidate's depart ment, the candidate's demonstrated support of the Unive rsity's purpose, the way in wh ich faculty standards and the balance among the criteria of teaching, sc holarship, and servic e are applied, and the overall situation and direction o f the College/School. At its option, the FDE Committee may request the candidate or o ther interested party to make a presentation before it or accept the written testimony of facul ty or students. The candidate may also request a personal appear ance before the committee. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 17 After discussion, the FDE Commit tee shall vote by secret ballot on whether to concur with or dissent from the recommendation o f the department. The chair sh all write a report that summarizes the vote and addresses in detail the rationale for t he recommendation. In the event that the chair of the FDE Committ ee disagrees with the majority vote of the committee, the chair should designate to another member of the committee who agrees with the majority the responsibility for writing the re port. Any member of the FDE Co mmittee who cannot support the majority report shall ha ve the option of writing a minority report that includes the rationale for his or her dissent. The FDE Committee's report, along with any minority reports, shall be forwarded to the Dean and to the candidate no later than January 31. The candidate shall have one week to respond in writing to t he report of the FDE Committ ee. The candidate's response (if any) shall be forwarded to the Dean. Stage Four - Review by the Dean: The Dean's role in the process of promotion or tenure is the broadest within the College/S chool. He or she not only has the responsibility to consider the record of the candidate and its relationship to the mission and curriculum of the candidate's Department, his or her responsib ility extends to the broad rang e of institutional considerations, both in the College/School and in the University, that shape th e on-going growth and direction of the College/School as a whol e. At the same time, he or she e nsures the application of consistent standards to faculty selection, retention, and devel opment. After receipt of all material submitted in the earlier stages ( the dossier, the reports of the department and of the FDE Committee, and any responses from the candidate), the Dean shall consider the candidate's app lication. At his or her option, the Dean may request or consider additional material or speak with other informed parties. The Dean shall write a report that indicates w hether or not he or she supports the recommendations of the department and the FDE Committee. In thi s report, the Dean shall set forth in reasonable de tail the rationale f or his or her recomme ndation, including but not limited to institutional considerations , the candidate's record, the department's curri culum and mission, support of the University purpos e, and any other relevant matte rs concerning the candidate's application. The Dean's report, along with a ll material submitted in earlier stages, shall be forwarded to both the Provost and to the candidate by March 31. The candidate shall have one week to respond in writing to the Dean's report and to submit that resp onse (if any) to the Provost. Stage Five -Review by the Provost, the President, and the Board of Trustees: After receipt of all material submitted in the earlier stages (the dossier, the repo rts of the department, of the FDE Committee, and of the Dean, along with any responses from the c andidate), the candidate's application will be reviewed by the Provost and the President. Affirma tive recommendations will be presented to the Board of Trustees at its Fall meeting. In making their decisions, the Provost and President shall consider material prepared by the c andidate as well as recommendations from the various levels of review. They shall a pply their professional judgment in considering the merits of the individual's case, and in determining what is in the best interest of the University and its programs. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 18 The decision of the Board of Tru stees concerning promotion or t enure will be communicated in writing to the faculty member. A ny such promotion or tenure wil l become effectiv e only after being conferred by the Board of Trustees. The purpose of this policy is st rictly to improve the quality o f the educational process at the University. Nothing contained in this handbook shall be construed as creating any contractual obligation on the part of the Uni versity to provide evaluations or particular types of evaluation, approve promotions, or grant tenure. The alleged failure of the University to complete an evaluation shall not be grounds f or an employee to contest a decision of the University not to approve his or her app lication for promoti on or tenure, or to r enew his or her contract, or to terminate his or her employment. Annual Evaluation Evaluation of faculty performan ce is a form of quality control and a means of faculty development. The major objective of faculty evaluation is to en sure high levels of professional performance in every discipline and to validate that faculty me mbers are worthy role models for students in a Christian institution of higher education. Depart ment Chairs and Deans are responsible for assisting facult y members in such matters as im proving teaching techniques, experimenting with better course materials, and upgrading crede ntials. Faculty evaluation may take seve ral forms, including selfevalu ation, student evaluations, environmental evaluation, inter views with the Dean or their des ignee, or other forms approved by the faculty and administration. Every faculty member is expected to conduct an annual self-eval uation using the Professional Performance Record. A copy of the Professional Performance Record form can be found in the University's Planning and Assessment Manual . Terms of Contract Faculty contracts offered by the University contain the terms a nd conditions of employment. Both the University and the facu lty member are expected to abid e by the stated terms of employment. Salary and Type and Duration of Contracts Generally, annual contracts for the forthcoming academic year a re extended to faculty members by March 1 of each year. Signed contracts are to be returned by March 31. Contracts not returned by March 31 are deemed rej ected and are withdrawn. If a signed contract is not returned by the date indicated, the University may elect to ini tiate a search to fill the vacancy or to eliminate the position. It is expected that faculty members will not ask to be released from a signed contract. Members of the faculty who will not be offered employment for the following academic year will be notified by March 1. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 19 The dates set forth in this s ection (March 1/March 31) may vary by College/School as indicated in the attached addenda. Fringe Benefits Full-time faculty members are eli gible for many of the fringe b enefits available to other full- time employees of the Unive rsity, as specified in the Campbell University Personnel Manual . A copy of the Personnel Manual can be found at https://www.campbell.edu/faculty-staff/human- resources/personnel-manual/. Full-time faculty are not elig ible for non-FMLA sick leave or vacation leave unless specificall y set forth in the addenda to this Faculty Handbook. Outside Employment Campbell University recognizes the privilege of the faculty mem ber to accept outside employment. Appropriate faculty a ctivities can enrich professio nal competence and provide a service to society. It is als o recognized that excellence in te aching requires time and energy, and that the first professional re sponsibility of the faculty membe r is to the University. A faculty member must receive approval before accepting outside employmen t. Requests for approval of outside employment by the facult y member, including teaching at another institution, shall be made in advance and will be rev iewed by the Department Chair, t he Dean of the College or School, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs & Provost. The Department Chair will communicate the final decision to the faculty member. These pri nciples will be followed in making a decision: Outside daytime employment duri ng regularly scheduled semesters /summer terms is discouraged, other than that wh ich is directly related to one's professional field; e.g., research or lecture engagements. No outside responsibilities shoul d be accepted which interfere with or create a conflict of (i) interest or (ii) commitment with one's contractual obligations or duties to the University, and priority should alw ays be given to University d uties, including counseling, teaching responsibilit ies, and committee assignment s. Leave of Absence Requests for leave of absence, ot her than emergency cases, shal l be made in writing to the Department Chair at least 60 days in advance and must be recomm ended by the Department Chair, Dean of the College/School , and Vice President for Acade mic Affairs & Provost, and approved by the President and the Board of Trustees. Faculty FMLA Sick Leave Accrual Full-time faculty members who apply for and receive FMLA leave will be entitled to eight hours of paid FMLA leave for each month of service at the university prior to the date of the inception of the FMLA leave (the \"Accrued FMLA Leave\") not to exceed 480 hours. Any unused Accrued FMLA Leave will be credited against any future q ualifying FMLA leave. When a faculty member's Accrued FMLA Leave falls below 480 hour s, the faculty member is eligible to accrue additional FMLA Leave upon return to full-ti me duty at the university under 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 20 the guidelines set forth above up to a maximum of 480 hours. Absences during approved FMLA leave in excess of these accumulated days will be treated as FMLA leave without pay. Termination of Service Types of and Reasons for Termination Faculty appointments may be terminated in the following ways: 1. By the faculty member, through voluntary resignation to take ef fect at the end of any academic year of service, provided notice is given by April 15. Voluntary resignation by the faculty member after April 15 s hall be effective only upon reco mmendation by the appropriate Dean and Vice Presiden t for Academic Affairs & Provost and approval of the President. 2. By the faculty member or the trustees through retirement. 3. By the direction of the President or of the Board of Trustees a t any time, a decision may be made to terminate a faculty mem ber or not to renew a faculty me mber's contract for any of the following reas ons, among others: Academic incompetence or failure to perform the duties of emplo yment. Violation of University academic or administrative regulations and policies, including but not limited to, behavior that violates this Faculty Handboo k or the University Personnel Manual, or professionall y harmful incompatibility wit h colleagues or students. Moral turpitude, or the conviction of crime amounting to feloni es or serious misdemeanors. Serious physical or mental disabi lity of more than six (6) months which prevents the faculty member from performing the essential functions of the position and such has been established by compete nt professional judgment. Significant changes in cu rriculum and/or programs. Financial exigency as defi ned by the Board of Trustees. WHEREAS, The Trustees of Campbell University are acutely aware of the state of the economy of the state, nation, and world; and WHEREAS, They are aware of the d ifficulties now facing education, particularly higher education in the private sector, and the many adjustment s that must be made by colleges and universities to mee t the financial or academic con siderations of the University; and 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 21 WHEREAS, The Trustees deeply appreciate the loyal and dedicated service now being rendered by the faculty and staff of Campbell University and desire that they know the general financial policy of the University as it relates to the meeting of these financial exigencies; NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED Th at the Board of Trustees of Camp bell University do declare: That Trustees consider it to be imperative that Campbell University operate a balanced budget. A sound financial p rogram is one that preserves the endowment of the institution and that every reasona ble effort should be made to adopt programs that will strengthen and enlarge the endowment in order to stabilize the academic and administrative programs. The University, so far as possible, will be current in the payment of its bills for current operations, including the salary obligations to its emp loyees, and the liquidation of indebtedness, especially shor t-term indebtedness; and The Board of Trustees do further declare that any projections o r developing conditions that would prevent the achievement of the desired go als will be considered as a financial exigency demanding immed iate adjustment in both the a cademic and administrative areas; and The Board of Trustees requests th at the Administration of the U niversity communicate this policy to the faculty and staff of the Univers ity at an early date. A faculty member may be place d on paid or unpaid leave during t he pendency of any investigation or appeal as the ci rcumstances may warrant. It is understood that termination of service pursuant to this sec tion 3 shall be effective immedi ately and shall not be deemed a breach of the faculty member's contract. Grievance Procedure for Faculty: General Issues 1. The following procedures shall apply to grievances by full-time faculty members (including tenured faculty and non-tenured f aculty) on issues which include but are not limited to the following: (a) minor disciplinar y actions such as warnings or s uspensions; (b) alleged violation, misinterpretation or inequitable application of the provisions of this Faculty Handbook; or (c) alleged violation of academic freedom. The for mal grievance procedure shall in no way be a forum for i ssues which should be resolved at other levels and in other ways. Otherwise, complaints alle ging violation, misinterpretati on or inequitable application of laws, regulations, or Univers ity policies applicable to all employees shall be reported in accordance with procedures set for th in the University's Person nel Manual. Non-grievable issues include the following: termination, salary and fringe be nefits, sabbatical or other leaves, faculty rank and promot ion, non-renewal of appointments or contracts, or the content of published policies and procedures. Any general griev ance shall be submitted by the grievant to the Chair of the Grievance Committee within thi rty (30) calendar days of the decision or action being grieved. 2. The purpose of this procedure is to assure fairness and consist ency in faculty relations, and to resolve complaints internall y within the University in a fai r, effective , and timely 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 22 manner. No faculty member's employment or academic status will be adversely affected in any way as a result of using the se grievance procedures, nor wi ll the University tolerate any retaliatory action against a person using or providing evidence fo r these procedures. The nature of the procedures shall be considered administrative hea rings within an educational context, not formal legal proceedings. The University shall not be obligated to pay for any expense of either party invol ved in the grievance. 3. Any grievance of a faculty member shall first be discussed with the appropriate Department Chair, with every reasonable effo rt made to resolve the matter informally at the department level, and no written record of the matter placed in the facult y member's official file. If the grievance cannot be resolved infor mally at the department level , or if the grievance is against the Department Chair, t he grievance shall be discussed with the appropriate Dean. Again, every reasonable effort s hould be made to resolve the matter informally within the individual school, with no writt en record of the matter placed in the faculty member's file. If the grievance cannot be reso lved by the Dean, or should the grievance be against a Dean and informal discussion at the d epartment level proves unable to bring resolution, the grievance may be brought for dis cussion with the Provost. The f irst attempt will then be to bring resolution to the matter in formally. If th is attempt prov es unsatisfactory, the faculty member may file a written grievance directly with the Chair of the University's Grievance Committee within seven (7) calendar days of the informal meetin g with the Provost. 4. The Dean of each School or College of the University shall nomi nate one tenured faculty member of either Professor or Asso ciate Professor rank to serve a three year term on the Grievance Committee. The committee shall elect its Chair annually. In addition to the eight regular members of the committee , one for each of the University's schools, the Provost shall appoint from th e faculty two standing alternates to be utilized as needed, such as in cases of conflict of interest, illness, etc. On any particular grievance issue, the committee members shall consider conflict o f interest matters (such as close friendships, shared academic department, etc.) before moving forward with the proce edings. The University's General Counsel shall serve as an advisor to the Grievance Comm ittee throughout the entire course of its deliberations. 5. The written complaint to the Chai r of the Grievan ce Committee must include at least the following: a) Identification of the individual( s) against whom the grievance is being lodged; b) Description of the specific ac tion(s) giving rise to the grieva nce; c) Rationale for assertion that the specific action(s) was/were in violation of University policy; d) Details of location, date or peri od of time in whi ch the action (s) occurred; e) The desired remedy; f) The name and full contact in formation of the grievant; 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 23 g) The grievant's signature. Within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the written compla int, the Chair of the Grievance Committee shall send a c opy of the written complaint to the individual(s) against whom the grievan ce is being lodged. 6. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of a copy of the writt en complaint, the individual(s) against whom the grievance is being lodged shall submit a writt en answer to the complaint to the Chair of the Grievance Committee. Within fourteen (14) c alendar days after receipt of the answer, the Chair of the Grievance Committee shall determin e a hearing date, which shall be no later than twenty one (21) days from receipt of the answer. The hearing date shall be communicated to all part ies at least ten (10) calendar days before the hearing is convened. 7. At all times the Gri evance Committee shal l be guided by the vir tues of fairness, kindness, and impartiality in decision-making. For good cause shown and d ue to exigent circumstances, the Chair may extend any deadline set forth abov e. 8. Each member of the Grievance Com mittee shall receive copies of the grievance and the response of the subject of the grievance at least five (5) working days prior to the hearing. 9. The following stipulations shall normally govern the conduct of the hearing: a) The grievant and the party against whom the grievance is filed shall have an opportunity to bring persons to testify on the ir behalf. So that the hearin g may be conducted in as efficient manner as possible, bo th parties shall avoid calling multiple persons who are expected to testify about t he same information. b) The hearing shall be private, due to the confidential nature of issues which may be raised. c) No university employee shall publicly disclose or relate to a t hird party any matters presented, disclosed, or discusse d at the hearing, or the final decision. Violation of this prohibition may subject the violat or to discipline. This prohib ition shall not apply to communication with an attorney c onsulted by the employee making the disclosure. d) A confidential tape recording of the proceedings shall be kept by the University's General Counsel. e) The Grievance Committee will not be bound by formal rules of legal evidence, and may consider any information it deems relevant in d etermining the i ssues involved. The committee shall have authority, at its discretion, to seek addi tional in formation that it deems relevant that is part of any university records, or request additional persons it deems to have relevant testimony to appear. Decisions of relevancy shall be determined by a majority of those present and voting. f) The hearing shall proceed in a m anner determined by the Grievance Committee, which shall be communicated to all parties as part of the hearing not ice. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 24 g) The findings and decision of the Grievance Committee will be ba sed on the information presented at the hearing. h) A majority of the members of the Grievance Committee must be pr esent for hearings, deliberations, and voting. i) These procedures are entirely adm inistrative in nature and are not considered legal proceedings. During any hearings , but not a subsequent appeal, the grievant or the respondent may have an advisor or advocate accompany and assist him/her at the faculty member's expense. This advisor can be anyone, but the advisor may not take part directly in the hearing its elf, though he or she may commu nicate with the advisee as necessary as long as it does not disrupt the proceedings. 10.

However, sabbatical l eaves are not granted automati cally upon the completion of the necessary period of service. E qually important is the quali ty of the project. The faculty member must demonstrate in writing evidence of sound research, creative activity, or other academic achievement to support the program of work that is pla nned for the sabbatical period.

Receipt of an e xternal grant to assist in accomplishing the purpose of the sabbatical (other than for tui tion and related expenses for pursuing further education) shall result in a corresponding red uction of sabbatical leave compensation provided by the University. Time toward each new sabbatical begins immediately upon return to full-tim e service and completion of the pro ject for which the sabbatical was granted. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook 30 9.

Faculty should give consid eration to indi vidual student circumstances that prevent attendance at the rescheduled t ime. In some instances, professo rs may request to move an in- person class to a remote synchr onous format during the schedule d class time for continuity and health and safety reasons. If it is impossible to reschedule a class meeting, some other s olution must be found to ensure that the students are gaining maximum educational benefit from the c ourse and that learning outcomes are met. Such solutio ns could involve graded outside assignments, field trips, assignments to be conducted via Blackboard, and so on. Class Rosters Faculty can view and print class rosters using their Self Servi ce account. Rosters should be printed for the first night of class at a physical campus. Some campuses may use a \"No-Show\" roster. The use of a \"No-Show\" ro ster is addressed in the local site procedures.

Faculty members record official grades through Self Serv ice. Grades must be assigned i n accordance with the guidelines specified in the course syllabus. Faculty will assign each student a final grade of A, B, C, D, or F at the end of the term. Campbell University does not recognize plus or minus grades. If a final grade cannot be assigned, the instructor must assign an Incomplete. See Grades - Incomplete for further information. All I or IC grades require coordination and documentation with the campus administrative offices. Grades - General Appeals Students have the right to appeal grades they think are incorre ct. Students should first discuss the grade with the Faculty member t eaching the course. If the grade dispute cannot be resolved, the student appeals in writing to the AOE Leader. The Grade Appeal Form and process are found in the AOE Student Handbook. The AOE Leader will review the appeal and related documentation . The AOE Leader may choose to convene a review panel or consult with other AOE Lead ers to make recommendations on disposition. If the AOE Leader feels the appeal is justified, they will forward the findings to the Faculty member for consideration. Since grades are the prerogative of the Faculty member; the Faculty member may or may not agree to c hange the grade. The Faculty me mber will notify the AOE Leader of the Faculty member's decision. If the AOE Leader does not feel th e appeal is justified, the de nial findings will be returned to the student. The Faculty member wi ll be advised of the findings. Students wishing to appeal further will submit the Grade Appeal Form to the Dean for Adult & Online Education. The Dean's decision is final. Grades - Changes As a general rule, a final g rade should only be changed due to instructor error or miscalculation of the final grade. The submissi on of late work after the assig nment of a final grade does not normally justify a grade change. T he student should have receiv ed an Incomplete if the potential for late work was anticipate d. Normally, change s from the initi al final grade will not be accepted after one year from th e course completion date. Faculty members will use the Main Campus Grade Change Form to submit changes. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum A - AOE 19 Grades - Grading Scale/Grade Point System Campbell University uses a ten-p oint grading scale for classes as shown below. Campbell does not use a plus or minus designati on. Grade point averages are c alculated using a 4.0 system. A - 90 -100 Excellent B - 80 - 89 Good C - 70 - 79 Average D - 60 - 69 Below Average F - Below 60 Unsatisfactory Grades - Incompletes (I) An Incomplete is a punitive grade and impacts the student's gra de point average in a negative way until a final grade is assigned. Incomplete grades should be given rarely and only under very unusual circumstances. Generally, Incompletes are assigned when the student is unable to complete the course requirements within the term. Instructors are responsible fo r completing the Incomplete Agreement form and submitting it to t he appropriate AOE Leader for approval before the last week of the term. Students should complete the missing work within 30 days after the beginning of the next term, including summer. St udents are responsibl e for coordinating wit h the instructor to make up the incomplete work. The completion of required course work is an academic function. The coordination for completing the course requireme nts must be between student and Faculty member. Instructors are responsible fo r making the nece ssary grade chan ges. All grade changes must be submitted on the official grade ch ange form (available in the a dministrative office), must include the reason for the change, and mus t be signed by the instructor. Incompletes not resolved withi n the 30 day time frame automatic ally change to a failing grade. Faculty may still allow the student to complete the cour se requirements if the Faculty member determines doing so is appr opriate. The maximum time allowed for submitting grade changes is one year. Grades - Incomplete Continued (IC) An Incomplete Continued is a non-punitive grade that is assigne d only in rare situations where the student has limited responsib ility for the grade, or when c ompletion of the course material may require more than one term . Since the Incomp lete Continued is non-punitive, it does not affect the grade point average. Instructors are responsible for completing the Incomplete Conti nued Grade Agreement form and submitting it to the a ppropriate AOE Leader for approval before the last week of the term. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum A - AOE 20 Students have 120 days to complete the course requirements. Incomplete Continued grades not resolved within the 120 day time frame automatically change to a failing grade. Faculty may still allow the student to complete th e course requirements if the Faculty member determines doing so is appropriate. The maximum time allowed for submitting grade changes is one year. Grades - Faculty Reporting Faculty members are to post grad es no later than the date communicated by the AOE Leader immediately following the end of the term. Grades will be posted using the elec tronic Campbell University tool (e.g. Student Pla nner). Grade changes, after initial reporting, will be coordinated with the campus office that scheduled the class. Inclement Weather Campbell University's policy is to remain ope n and in operation during regularly scheduled hours. Normally administrative offices will remain open and cla sses will be conducted. Safety is the primary concern. T hus, extreme or emergency condi tions may occur that necessitate closing. Campuses operating on a mili tary installation will clo se and cancel classes if the military installation closes. The University recognizes that f lexibility is required in extre me circumstances and, thus, all persons are encouraged to use maturity, good judgment, and prof essionalism in dealing with adverse weather conditions. Faculty are encouraged to be unders tanding in the event a student does not feel safe in attending class. The decision to close offices a nd/or cancel classes will normally be made by the AOE Leader, in coordination with the Dean of Adult & Online Education.

Each test is administered based on a schedule determined by Main Campus. If such an asse ssment test is assigned to a course by the University or Dep artment, the AOE faculty teachin g the course must administer the test. The results of these national tests may be used to ev aluate the effectiveness and comparability of education at Campbell University. The results may also be used to measure comparability between Main Campu s and AOE. The results of thes e instruments will also be made available to AOE Faculty and students. Reimbursement for Expenses Expenses incurred by an employee on the University's behalf are reimbursed if the purchase was made with prior written approval by the AOE Leader.

Student Attendance Regular attendance and punctuality are expected a t all times in all courses. University policy is that students can miss no more th an 15-percent of scheduled cla sses. Further, students who miss more than 15-percent of schedul ed classes may not receive credi t for the course and could receive a failing grade. Fifteen percent of an eight wee k course depends on the method o f delivery as shown below: Traditional classes meeting for 4 hours once a week: 1 in-class period Blended classes: 1 in-class period Traditional classes meeting 2 tim es per week: 2 in-class periods Traditional classes meeting 3 tim es per week: 3 in-class periods Online classes for an 8-week session: 1 full week of work 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum A - AOE 23 It is important for students t o attend class in o rder to learn. AOE Faculty are encouraged to use good judgment in applying Univers ity policy. The requirements o f adult learners are such that many students must miss classe s due to circumstances beyond their control. Online and blended faculty are required to have w eekly measurable and documentable participation. Faculty are required to document to student s how attendance is computed, as well as how they will manage students who arrive l ate or leave early. Students missing classes may be ass igned appropriate \"make-up\" work. The make-up work should require as much time as the missed class time and should be related to the course material covered in the missed class. Student Add and Drop The Add and Drop periods for traditional and blended courses are combined and cover the first week of classes plus Monday of t he second week of a given term. Students may add, drop or register late for cour ses during this week. The Add period for online courses en ds the Wednesday after the start of the term. Students dropping courses during this week do not incur an acad emic or financial penalty and receive a full refund of tuition. Students wishing to discontin ue a course after the add/drop period must withdraw, which incurs a financial obligation and potentia l academic penalty. Campus AOE Leaders may make exceptions b ased on individual circumstances. See Student Withdrawals for additional information. All students wishing to add, drop, or withdraw from a course must do so via the administrative office. Faculty may not add, drop, or withdraw a student in the ir courses. Only the administrative office can do this. Student Cheating and Plagiarism Students are to be honest in all behavior, never cheating, plagiarizing, or knowingly giving false information. Campbell University 's English Department publishes a statement and definition of cheating and plagiarism as seen be low. A statement about cheating and plagiarism must be included in all syllabi. Cheating: Campbell University's po licy is that all students mus t do their own work for grades. Any academic work presented for a grade that is accomplished th rough collaboration with others (without the express permissi on of the instructor), through pla giarism, or th rough means other than strictly individual effort cannot be accepted or condoned. Evidence of cheating should be reported to the AOE Leader who will take the appropriate action or convene a representative committee (administrator, faculty member, student) to recommend appropriate action. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum A - AOE 24 Plagiarism: Plagiari sm is any use of another person's words or ideas without giving proper credit to the person from whom you borrowe d the words or ideas. Plagia rism is the theft of intellectual property. Plagiarism includes fail ing to cite properly any direct or indirect quotation from: Professionally written materials (books, journal articles, etc. ) Student papers, projects, presentations, etc. Internet sources Submitting as their own work a pa per, project, or presentation that the student did not compose (that is, write, compile, draw, etc.) Submitting work for on e class that was previously submitted to a different class, without express permission of both instructors. Allowing or asking another pers on or organization, paid or unpaid, to write or develop a paper, project, presentation, exam, or any other work submitted for class credit. All instances of plagiarism mus t be reported to the faculty mem ber's AOE Leader for disposition. Students are genera lly required to receive Academi c Integrity Training which is arranged by the AOE Leader. Facult y have the discretion to give the student a failing grade for the assignment and/or the course. Student Tutoring All AOE students, regardless of campus location or course discipline, have access to 24/7 online tutoring services through a third -party vendor, which is linked into the Blackboard course template. Student Withdrawals Students withdrawing from a cour se must complete a withdrawal f orm available online or at the Campus Administrativ e Office. Faculty are not directly involved in the withdrawal process; however, faculty must provide the campus office with the studen t's date of last attendance. Once the student has been withdrawn, t he student no longer appears o n the Academic Roster. The policies and procedures appl ied to withdraw als can be found on the AOE website and in the student handbook. Failure on the pa rt of the student to complet e the withdrawal form constitutes intent to remain officially enrol led in the course. Students wh o stop attending a course should be given the appropriate grade at the end of the term. Substitute Instructors/Proctors/Guest Lecturers AOE Faculty desiring to use a subs titute proctor, or guest lecturer who is not employed by Campbell University must obtai n prior approval from the AOE Lea der. All costs associated with 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum A - AOE 25 substitute instructors or proctors will be covered by the Facul ty member. The AOE Leader may subsidize some of the costs base d on individual c ircumstances. Substitute Instructor: A substitute instructor is one who is in tended to teach in class and must meet the same basic creden tialing requirements as the regu lar instructor. Proctor: A proctor is not inte nded to teach but is used to hand le certain tasks in the absence of the instructor (e.g. show films, and administer exam s). A proctor is not required to meet crede ntialing standards. Guest Lecturer: Guest lecturers are experts in their specific f ield and are invited to address a class on their area of expertise. Faculty members are expected to be present during a guest lecturer's presen tation. Guest l ecturers do not have to meet credentialing standards. Syllabus The syllabus is a contract betw een the Faculty member and the s tudents. It informs students of what to expect from the Faculty m ember and what the instructor expects of the students. Each Faculty member is required to prepare an online syllabus for ea ch course. The Campbell University's Syllabus Format with the minimum required informat ion is provided by each AOE Leader to new faculty. The syllabus should be available to students by the Wednesday prior to the start of the term in the Blackboard course site. Stude nts may be requi red to print t heir own copy if the syllabus is provided online. An electronic copy of the sylla bus will be forwarded to the Adm inistrative Offi ce in accordance with the local Campus procedures. Textbooks/Course Materials Every course must have a require d text as the primary text. Required texts are approved by the main campus Department Chair. T he University Bookstore has a database of required texts for all courses. Faculty desiring to use a different text than those already app roved must have that text approved by the appropriate Department Cha ir. A request for textbook app roval and copy of the proposed textbook will be forwarded through the AOE Leader to the approp riate Department Chair for approval. All required texts must be adopted no less than six ( 6) weeks prior to the beginning of the term. Faculty may choose to use supplemen tal required texts. Students are expected to purchase all supplemental texts. Supplement al texts must be approved by the appropriate Department Chair. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum A - AOE 26 Additional supplemental material is material that the Faculty m ember uses in class. This material is not required and, therefore, do es not need to be approved by the Department Chairs. Such materials must be provided at no cost, or purchased voluntarily by the students. Students may not be held responsible for materia l that comes from an unapproved source, unless it is provided at no cost. Normally, textbook changes occur at the beginning of the Fall o r Spring semesters. Faculty will be provided Instructor copies when changes are made in the requ ired texts. As noted above, faculty may be req uired to use an online textbo ok ordering tool. Respondus Monitor and TurnItIn SafeAssign Respondus Monitor (in conjuncti on with Respondus Lockdown Brows er) and TurnItIn SafeAssign are useful tools. R espondus Monitor and Lockdown Bro wser monitor and record students, and restrict them fro m browsing the web, when taking online exams. SafeAssign instantly identifies papers cont aining non-original material. T hese tools act as powerful deterrents to identify and st op plagiarism. Facu lty members are encouraged to use these tools to identify plagiarism. Faculty may use TurnItIn, Saf eAssign, and Respondus Monitor/Lockdown Browser through their Blackboard course. VI.

CPHS CLINICAL RELEASE POLICY The following policy guides the allocation of potential clinical release time for clinical faculty that do not have an assigned clinical site. The intent is to provide f aculty the opportunity to record practice hours required to maintain clinical licensure and/or specialty certifications that are relevant to their 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 15 practice areas and teaching focus. This is considered outside employment as defined in the Faculty Handbook and therefore requires review and approval by the depa rtment chair, the Dean of the College of Pharmacy & Health S ciences, and the Vice President f or Academic Affairs & Provost. The Dean of the college can withdr aw or amend this policy at an y time deemed necessary in order to maintain the primary mission of the college. The chair/director of the program, at their prerogative, may su pport a request for licensed/certified faculty members' clinical release time equivalent of up to 16 h ours per calendar month for clinical practice within the following parameters: 1. Release time is intended for c linical practice and no other act ivities. 2. If the faculty member is cleared for clinical release time in w riting through the outside employment policy in the Faculty Handbook, neither the department, college, or university will play any role in securing sites for faculty practice. Faculty members must secure their own clinical site; however, they must inform the chair/director of their practice site and provide a point of contact. 3. Any reimbursement for clinical pr actice is a matter to be deter mined between the faculty member and their clinical site - any re imbursement for clinical practice remains the property of the faculty member. The University plays no role in reimbursement. 4. The University will claim no liability for the clinical practic e of faculty during clinical release time. All faculty approved for clinical release time must prov ide their own professional liability coverage or negotiate such coverage with their clinical site. 5. Clinical release time is fully c ontingent upon fulfillment of a ll contractual obligations to Campbell University to include teaching, service, and scholarship as noted in the faculty contract for employment at Campbell University. 6. Clinical release time is fully contingent upon the needs of the department and within the purview of the chair/director and dean t o approve, modify, or withdraw faculty clinical release time, if necessary, in order to maintain the mission of the department o r college and provide the best quality education to students. 7. University resources, including but not limited to university o wned computers and university email accounts, may not be used for purposes of any approved cl inical release activity. Any CPHS faculty member requesting a clinical release needs to contact their program chair/director to complete a Clinical Release form. The form must be renewed at the beginning of each contract year. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 16 APPENDIX 1 CAMPBELL UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF PHARMACY & HEALTH SCIENCES THE PHILOSOPHY, POLICIES, GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS FOR APPOINTMENT, PROMOTION, AND TENURE FOR FACULTY Table of Contents I.

If necessary, a replacement member may be appointed by the Dean from the tenured and/or Professor faculty from within the CPHS or from another College/School within the University with the approval of the appropriate Dean. IV. APPOINTMENT OF CPHS FACULTY A. General Considerations 1. CPHS faculty are appointed by the Pres ident upon the recommendation of the Department/Program Chairperson/Director, the Dean, and Provost of the University. 2. The term of the appointment is one year unless otherwise specified in the faculty member's University contract. 3. The general responsibilities of all faculty within the CPHS include the support of the University Mission. 4. The University requires all employees to exem plify the highest principles of Christian character, including honor, integrity, truthfulness, and compassion. 5. All employees are required to maintain high standards of moral conduct, personal appearance, and professional performance. B. Appointment Series There are two Appointment Series: (1) Tenu re Track, and (2) Non-Tenure Track. 1. Tenure Track Tenure track appointments are for faculty w ho contribute full-time effort to all three 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 21 strategic mission areas of the CPHS: a) Teaching b) Scholarship c) Service and contributions to mission A complete description of the tenure track ranks including aspects of appointment and promotion is in Appendix A. Tenure track faculty generally receive full compensation from the University. However, appointment in the tenure track is not limited based on percentage of University funding. An individual's contract with the Univer sity will indicate the appointment to the tenure track series. At any time during their employment with the CPHS, faculty may request with the approval of their Chairperson/Director a tr ansition from the tenure track to the non-tenure track series or from the non-ten ure track to the tenure track series. 2. Non-Tenure Tracks There are four (4) non-tenur e track appointments. A complete description of the Non-Tenure Track ranks including aspects of appointment and promotion is in Appendix B . a) Non-Tenure Track Clinical Non-tenure track Clinical appointments are for faculty who focus the majority of their efforts on a practice or service activity that serves as a framework for teaching, and/or supervising students in ac ademic, clinical, or field settings. Such faculty may receive full or partial compensation from the University. b) Non-Tenure Track Research Non-tenure track Research appointments are for faculty who focus the majority of their efforts on research. Such faculty may receive full or partial compensation from the University. c) Non-Tenure Track Adjunct Adjunct appointments are determined at the Department/Program level and should be of a fixed term (from one (1) to five (5) years), and are intended for individuals who may contribute to one or more aspects of the College's mission. Adjunct appointments may be either \"Clinical\" or \"Research\". d) Non-Tenure Track Visiting Visiting appointments are of a brief duration (one year or less with the option for one successive reappointment by the De partment/Program for a term not to exceed one year) and intended for individu als that are not otherwise employed by the CPHS or Campbell University. Visiting faculty may receive full or partial compensation from Campbell University but are not entitled to earn vacation or sick leave. Visiting faculty who are hire d to work 30 hours or more per week may be entitled to insurance and other benefits. For complete information on insurance and other benefits, refer to the Campbell University Personnel Manual. C. Joint Appointments 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 22 Joint appointments may be made in conj unction with one or more other Campbell University schools, departments, or units. Joint appointments are applicable to any appointment series. Although faculty with jo int appointments often derive salary from each of the appointing units, the sharing of the salary burden is not a requirement for a joint appointment. However, all units participat ing in a particular joint appointment also should participate in appropriate review of faculty appointment, particularly with respect to issues of reappointment, promotion, and tenure. D. Appointment Request Process The selection of the appropriate initial appoi ntment initiates at the Chairperson/Director level after consultation with the candidate faculty member. The APT Committee Chairperson must be provided the following documentation for a candidate under consideration for an init ial CPHS appointment above the rank of Assistant Professor: 1. Letter of request: The request from the Dean or Chairperson/Director that may include a suggested rank for appointment, if applicable. 2. Current curriculum vitae of the candidate. 3. Any additional documentation to support meeting qualifications for a suggested rank. This may include documentation of prior appointments and accomplishments in teaching, service, and scholarship. The APT Committee, upon receipt of the reque st and documentation, shall review the application and provide a recommendation to the Dean and the Chairman/Director in a timely manner. The APT Committee Chair person will provide the Committee's recommendation to the Dean. V. PROMOTION OF CPHS FACULTY A. General Considerations 1. The process of evaluating a fa culty member for promotion begins at the point of hire and initial appointment. 2. Chairpersons/Directors shall provide each faculty member with expectations of performance associated with their current appointment during annual reviews. 3. A faculty member's expectations of perfor mance shall include an allocation of focus and responsibility to the three st rategic areas of the CPHS: a) Teaching b) Scholarship c) Service and contributions to mission 4. The faculty member, in consultation with their Department Chair/Program Director, determines the distribution of a faculty me mber's responsibilities regarding teaching, scholarship, and service. If the faculty member and the Department Chair/Program Director do not agree on the distributi on of responsibilities, the Department Chair/Program Director will make the fi nal determination on distribution of the faculty member's effort. 5. Faculty with tenure track appointments shall have expectations of performance in all three strategic areas of the CPHS. The allocation of effort amongst the teaching, 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 23 service, and scholarship must total 100%. 6. It is reasonable that a faculty member will have a dominant area(s) (greater percentage of effort) of focus and responsibility amongst the three strategic areas. However, it is required that all tenure-tr ack faculty should dedicate at least 10% effort to each of the three strategic areas. 7. Faculty members and their Chairperson/Director shall document performance in accordance to the dominant area(s) of focus and responsibility in a manner that will allow comprehensive and thoughtful analyses. 8. Department Chairpersons/Program Directors are encouraged to incorporate the career aspirations of the faculty member (including promotion) into the expectations of performance and allocation of focus and responsibility. 9. Expectations of performance should be de veloped and communicated in the context of the promotion guidelines for the CPHS. 10. When preparing an evidentiary foundation for promotion, it is incumbent upon the candidate and the Department Chairpers on/Program Director to consider the specific expectations of performance previously agreed upon over the time-period supporting the request for promotion. The dominant area(s) of responsibilities should be documented and performance of expectations clearly explained. 11. Expectations of performance are not immutable. They may change as the needs of the Department/Program, the CPHS, and the faculty member change. Changes in responsibilities and expectations are subject to negotiation and documentation. If the faculty member and the Department Chair /Program Director do not agree on the distribution of responsibilities, the Depa rtment Chair/Program Director will make the final determination on distributi on of the faculty member's effort. 12. Advancement in rank cannot be guaranteed according to any fixed schedule. Seniority alone is not a reason for promotion to any rank. 13. Tenure and promotion are separate consider ations. Faculty are allowed to submit concurrent requests for promotion and tenure with one dossier. Tenure decisions are made independently of any prior or concurrent promotion consideration. 14. Since promotion and tenure are considered separately, there is the potential for approval of both, denial of both, or a pproval of one while denial of the other request. 15. A candidate may elect to withdraw the re quest for promotion and/or tenure at any time in the process by submitting a request in writing to the APT Chair, the Dean, or the Provost, as applicable. 16. Time spent in rank at another instituti on may be applied to fulfill the suggested minimum years noted in the Descriptions of Tenure Track Ranks found in Appendix A . B. Eligibility for Promotion 1. CPHS does not mandate a faculty member be promoted to the subsequent rank within a specified timeframe or require a pre-defined period within a rank prior to applying for promotion. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 24 2. Faculty should maintain a record of accomplishments that would provide evidence to support promotion to the next academic rank within a reasonable timeframe. 3. All reviews begin at the departmental level. Faculty members should discuss the timing and appropriateness of applying for promotion with their Department Chairperson/Program Director. 4. Departments/Programs may have additional guidance for a candidate seeking promotion and based on the Evaluation of Performance Guidelines ( Appendix C ). Such additional guidance will address the unique characteristics and identity of the Department/Program. C. Promotion Review Process 1. Review by Department Cha irperson/Program Director a) A candidate shall explore with their De partment Chairperson/Program Director the concept of readiness for promotion. Such preliminary consideration shall be exploratory, with specifics not binding on either the faculty member or the Department Chairperson/Program Director involved. b) The Department Chairperson/Program Dir ector should evaluate the candidate's record and the role the candidate can be ex pected to play in the future evolution of the department's curriculum and mission. c) If the Department Chairperson/Program Director agrees with the appropriateness and timing of the prom otion request, the candidate should prepare a dossier for submission to the APT Committee. d) If the Department Chairperson/Program Director disagrees with the appropriateness and timing, the Department Chairperson/Program Director should advise the candidate on what needs to be done to enhance the potential for approval. In the event of lack of support from their Department Chairperson/Program Director, the cand idate may apply directly to the APT Committee without the Department Chairperson's/Program Director's endorsement. e) Should the faculty member decide to proceed, documentation of the candidate's readiness for promotion should be organized into a dossier ( Appendix D) . The completed dossier must be submitted to the APT Committee and the faculty member's Department Chairperson/Program Director by October 1 . f) A letter from the Department Chairpers on/Program Director must be submitted to the APT Committee summarizing the achi evements of the candidate in the three strategic areas of CPHS, commi tment to the University mission, and recommendations regarding the candidate's eligibility for promotion. The letter must indicate the allocation of effort of the candidate in the three strategic areas covering the relevant assessment period for promotion. This letter must be submitted by November 15. 2. Review by References a) The candidate in consultation with the Chairperson/Director shall provide the names, titles, and addresses of six (6 ) individuals who would be capable of assessing the candidate's qualifications fo r promotion. This information shall be included in the faculty member's dossier ( Appendix D) and due by October 1. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 25 b) These selected references should be individuals from the academic community with academic rank that is at the same level (or higher) as that sought by the candidate. No more than two of these re ferences should be from current CPHS faculty members. c) References shall not be members of the APT Committee. d) References in nonacademic positions are acceptable if they are able to address one or more of the main areas upon wh ich the candidate will be evaluated. e) The Chairperson/Director should confirm that each of the references would be willing to conduct and document, in a letter, a timely and meaningful evaluation of the candidate's accomplishments. Candidates should not directly solicit letters of recommendation from the listed references. f) The APT Committee will solicit the letter of assessment from the references who are selected. The Committee will provide the references with a copy of 'Philosophy, Policies, Guidelines and Standards for Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure for Faculty' of CPHS, the candidate's Dossier (components outlined in Appendix D), and a letter from the Committee which outlines what the reference should address. The reference's assessment is due November 15. g) The Committee may identify one to three individuals who may not know the candidate directly, but would be qualified to comment and assess the candidate's promotion package. These individuals would usually be faculty members at comparable institutions who might be fa miliar with the candidate's specialty area, scholarship, teaching quality, and/or professional service. 3.

General Considerations of Tenure 1. Campbell University operates with a tenure system for its faculty, understanding the granting of tenure to be the highest honor it can bestow on a faculty member. 2. Tenure is a mutual sign and commitment by which the continuity of the University's educational goals and objectives are assured. It affirms an individual as an image of its mission, and in the act of acceptance, th e individual publicly asserts continuing commitment to its goals. 3. The purpose of granting tenure is to u phold the concept of academic freedom by assuring the individual faculty member certain procedural rights that have traditionally been assured to members of the profession. 4. In general, the candidate for tenure shall have a sustained record of accomplishments in teaching, service, and scholarly activities. 5. Tenure and promotion are separate consider ations. Faculty are allowed to submit concurrent requests for promotion and tenure with one dossier. Tenure decisions are made independently of any prior or concurrent promotion consideration. 6. Since promotion and tenure are considered separately, there is the potential for approval of both, denial of both, or a pproval of one while denial of the other request. 7. A candidate may elect to withdraw the re quest for promotion and/or tenure at any time in the process by submitting a request in writing to the APT Chair, the Dean, or the Provost, as applicable. 8. A decision to submit a request for tenure shou ld be made with consultation with the appropriate Department Chairperson/Program Director. B. Eligibility for Tenure 1. Only a full-time faculty member holding th e rank of tenure track Associate Professor or Professor is eligible to apply for ten ure after meeting the following criteria: a) Professor: A faculty member who holds the rank of Professor at Campbell University and has taught full-time at Campbell University for three years shall be eligible for consideration for tenure. b) Associate Professor. A faculty member who holds the rank of Associate Professor at Campbell University and has taught full-time at Campbell University for five years shall be eligible for consideration for tenure. 2. In rare and special circumstances, an indi vidual appointed to the full-time faculty 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 29 who held tenure at another academic institution, (or who otherwise has an outstanding record of accomplishments in teaching and scholarly pursuits consistent with those standards of awarding tenure as noted in this document) may be eligible for tenure upon employment contingent on a recommendation from the Dean and approval by the Executive Administrati on of the University and the Board of Trustees OR may be provided a letter at the time of employment which indicates that tenure at Campbell will be supported (pending approval by the Board of Trustees) after one year of satisfactory employment. The APT Committee would be notified of this decision at the time of appointment of such a faculty member. C. Guidelines and Standards for Awarding Tenure 1. The awarding of tenure is recognition of past academic and professional achievements and confidence in continued professional development and projections for positive contributions to the institution in the future. 2. The Evaluation of Performance Guidelines ( Appendix C ) are used in making the recommendation to grant tenure. Candida tes are expected to demonstrate rank- appropriate achievements in all three areas (teaching, scholarship, and service) to be granted tenure. An additional assessment of the projected long-term contribution that the individual will make to the University and the College will be considered and evaluated. 3. Departments/Programs may have additional guidance for candidate's seeking tenure that are based on the Evaluation of Performance Guidelines ( Appendix C ). Such additional guidance will address the unique characteristics and identity of the Department/Program. 4. Teaching skills, contributions to the gro wth and development of the CPHS, and the receipt of extramural grants and other typ es of revenue generated for the CPHS and the University will be considered in the tenure decision. 5. A positive attitude and loyal support to the mission of the institution must be apparent. D. Tenure Review Process 1. Review by Department Cha irperson/Program Director a) At the point of eligibility for tenure cons ideration, a candidate shall explore with their Department Chairperson/Program Di rector the concept of readiness for tenure. Such preliminary consideration sh all be exploratory, with specifics not binding on either the faculty member or the Department Chairperson/Program Director involved. b) The Department Chairperson/Program Dir ector should evaluate the candidate's record and the role the candidate can be ex pected to play in the future evolution of the Department's/Program's curriculum and mission. c) If the Department Chairperson/Program Director agrees with the appropriateness and timing of the tenure request, a dossier should be prepared for presentation to the APT Committee. d) If the Department Chairperson/Program Director disagrees with the appropriateness and timing, the Department Chairperson/Program Director should advise the candidate on what needs to be done to enhance the potential 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 30 for approval. In the event of lack of support from their Department Chairperson/Program Director, the cand idate may apply directly to the APT Committee without the Department Chairperson/Program Director endorsement. e) Should the faculty member decide to proceed, documentation of the candidate's readiness for tenure should be organized into a dossier ( Appendix D). The completed dossier must be submitted to the APT Committee and the faculty member's Department Chairperson/Program Director by October 1. f) A letter from the Department Chair person/Program Director to the APT Committee summarizing the achievements of the candidate in the three strategic areas of CPHS, commitment to the Un iversity mission, and a recommendation regarding the candidate's eligibility for ten ure. This letter must be submitted by November 15. 2. Review by References a) The candidate in consultation with Chairperson/Director shall provide the names, titles, and addresses of six (6 ) individuals who would be capable of assessing the candidate's qualifications for tenure. This information shall be included in the faculty member's dossier ( Appendix D) and due by October 1. b) These selected references should be individuals from the academic community previously granted tenure regardless of academic rank. No more than two of these references should be from current CPHS faculty members. c) References shall not be members of the APT Committee. d) References in nonacademic positions are acceptable if they are able to address one or more of the main areas upon wh ich the candidate will be evaluated. e) The Chairperson/Director should confirm that each of the references would be willing to conduct and document, in a letter, a timely and meaningful evaluation of the candidate's accomplishments. Candidates should not directly solicit letters of recommendation from the listed references. f) The APT Committee will solicit the letter of assessment from the references who are selected. The Committee will provide the references with a copy of 'Philosophy, Policies, Guidelines and Standards for Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure for Faculty' of CPHS, the candidate's Dossier (components outlined in Appendix D), and a letter from the Committee which outlines what the reference should address. The reference's assessment is due November 15. g) The Committee may identify one to three individuals who may not know the candidate directly, but would be qualified to comment and assess the candidate's tenure package. These individuals would usually be faculty members at comparable institutions who might be fa miliar with the candidate's specialty area, scholarship, teaching quality, and/or professional service. 3.

References shall not be members of the APT Committee. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum B - CPHS 41 References in nonacademic positions are acceptable if they are able to address one or more of the main areas upon which the candidate will be evaluated. The Chairperson/Director should confirm that each of the references would be willing to conduct and document, in a letter, a timely and meaningful evaluation of the candidate's accomplishments. Candidates should not directl y solicit letters of recommendation from the listed references. The APT Committee will solicit the letter of assessment from the references who are selected. The Committee will provide the references with a copy of 'Philosophy, Policies, Guidelines and Standards for Appointment, Prom otion, and Tenure for Faculty' of CPHS, the candidate's Dossier, and a letter from the Committee which outlines what the reference should address. The reference's assessment is due November 15. The Committee may identify one to three in dividuals who may not know the candidate directly, but would be qualified to comment an d assess the candidate's promotion package. These individuals would usually be faculty members at comparable institutions who might be familiar with the candidate's specialty area, sc holarship, teaching quality, and/or professional service. 6. Documentation of Performance Documentation of performance in the three area s of teaching, scholarly activity, and service as noted in Appendix C. Addendum C Divinity School Addendum to the Campbell University Faculty Handbook 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 1 Preface Dear Colleague: This Addendum has been prepared a s a supplement to the Campbell University Faculty Handbook. Faculty should consult the University Faculty Handbook for general guidance on faculty appointment, promotion, tenure, benefits, and responsib ilities. The Divinity Addendum seeks to address matters unique t o the Divinity Faculty. Unlike the undergraduate college structure presumed in the Un iversity Faculty Handbook, the Divi nity School does not have departmental structure with vari ous department chairs. In gener al the tasks assigned to the department chair in the Unive rsity Faculty Handbook are tasks f or the Assistant Dean in the Divinity School. Grace and peace, Andrew H.

Originally scheduled to begin operation in the fall of 1997, the Divinity School opened a year earl y due to a larger than expect ed number of interested students. The idea of educating church leade rs in the context of a libera l arts university was not a new idea to Campbell. Feasibility st udies were conducted in 1969 and 197 5 to explore the possibility of offering graduate and professional courses in Religion. The Sep tember 21, 1995 decision to add a Divinity School to Campbell's al ready existing pr ofessional pro grams in law, pharmacy, education, and business came after a lengthy third feasibility study initi ated in 1992. Dr. Jerry M. Wallace, then serving as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost , who chaired the feasibility studies of 1975 and 1992, made the recommendation to the President and the Board of Trustees to move forward with the Divinity School. After considering this matter for over a year, the Board of Trustees voted on September 21, 19 95, to establish the Divinity School. A public announcement was made in a worshipful ceremony at the Baptist State Convention building in Cary, NC on October 25, 1995. The University was proud to name Michael G. Cogdill and Bruce P . Powers as the school's first Dean and Associate Dean. Soon afterward, the deans announced th e recruitment of an outstanding cadre of founding faculty and adj unct faculty members to help launch the new school. Among these persons were Malcolm L. Tolbert, Thomas A. Jackson, Delos Miles , James W. Good, Ginger S. Graves, JoAnn Stancil, and Jerry M. Wallace. Clella A. Lee was instrumental in beginning support services and an assimilation process for the new students. In 2 010, Dr. Andrew H. Wakefield, Tyner Professor of New Testament and Greek, became the Divinity Schoo l's second Dean. The Divinity School offi cially opened on August 19, 1996, offer ing elective courses until the beginning of the formal curriculu m and the Charter Class. Thirty-five founding students plus those who enrolled in the fall of 1997 constituted the Charter Class of eighty-four students. Currently, approximately 150 students are en rolled each year and alumni no w number almost 700. Building on the heritage and reput ation of Campbell as an outstanding Christian liberal arts university, the Divinity School seeks to educate Christian mini sters who are intellectually prepared, spiritually mature, and capable of inspiring and leading church es to fulfill their unique role in the world. The mission of the Campbell University Divinity School i s to provide theol ogical education that is Christ-centered, Bible-ba sed, and Ministry-focused . We build on this mission through ties to the Baptist State Convention of N orth Carolina and to the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. The vision that birthed Campbell in 1887 lives on as the University continues its commitment to serve God and churches across the nation and around the world. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 4 Campbell University Divinity School Statement of Purpose The Campbell University Divinit y School has a formally adopted statement of institutional purpose which clearly reflects the mission and sets forth the s chool's particular identity and values. This statement of institutional purpose communicates clearly an d vividly the commitment of the deans, faculty, administrative staff, and students. Moreover, the Divinity School has enjoyed uncommon affirmation for the conviction, clarity, and commitmen t described by this statement of institutional purpose and missi on. The University Board of Tru stees formally affirmed and adopted the statement prior to the announcement and beginning of the sc hool. The statement of institutional purpose is printed in all doc uments of the school: The purpose of the Campbell Univ ersity Divinity School is to provide Christ-centered, Bible-based, and Ministry-focused theological education. The Campbell University Divinit y School is clear about its mission and purpose. New students entering the school each semester are featured in a Commissioni ng and Covenant Service where they are challenged to become \" Christ-centered, Bible-ba sed, and Ministry-focused \" servants of Christ and the church. Each st udent in the school knows the mission statement, and many have adopted this statement as their personal philos ophy of ministry . The deans and faculty have experienced the value of a clear and realistic mission statemen t that can be easily remembered and passionately adopted. This Statement of Institutional Purpose is clearly consistent with the University Statement of Purpos e and is a positive outgrowth of its excellence. It is our conviction that this mission state ment reflects the essence of theological scholarship and the mission of the church. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 5 Policies Absence from Classes The Faculty is to make no commitments which would for personal reasons take them away from classes more than one week during any given semester. During th e summer terms and/or special terms, this principle is interpreted to mean no more than one c lass day during any given term. This expectation is a common faculty commitment, but emergency excep tions to this principle may be arranged through the Assistant De an. In any case the Assistant Dean should be informed when absences are anticipated and/or when they are unexpected, and t he Assistant Dean should be informed about the steps taken to care for class responsibilities. It is permissible to announce that the class will not meet if adequate assignments are made, but cancellation of classes should be a last resort. Often a colleague or guest speaker can suitably conduct a class in a faculty member's temporary absence, but long term situations require consultation with the Assistan t Dean and approval by the Dean. Academic Freedom See Appendix A. Chapel Faculty and staff members are e xpected to attend chapel regular ly. Church Involvement All faculty are expected to be active members in local churches . A majority of the faculty is to maintain membership in Baptist churches. Expense Reports Whenever a faculty member travels or extends entertainment offi cially on behalf of the Divinity School, expenses incurred will be reimbursed through completing an expense report in the Dean's Office. Faculty, Adjunctive Campbell University Divinity School is fortunate to have a numb er of qualified part-time or adjunctive teachers available w ho, for the most part, live and work in the region. The Divinity School contracts with them for one semester or one academic year to te ach specified courses in the curriculum. Adjunctive faculty me mbers are expected to affirm the Statement of Purpose of the Divinity School and of C ampbell University. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 6 Faculty Committees All full-time faculty members ser ve on one or more divinity com mittees in a rotation system to ensure equal sharing of responsibilitie s. Committees are appointed eac h August to serve for the academic year. These committee assignmen ts are in addition to University Committee assignments. These committees function througho ut the calendar year. As necessary, faculty committees act during the summer on behalf of the Faculty and report these actions to the Faculty during the Fall Faculty Workshop. Faculty Evaluation As an aspect of faculty accountab ility and in order to foster f aculty excellence in teaching, in scholarship, and in professional responsibilities, the Faculty engages in peer review (through academic interchange in Faculty m eetings), intensive self-evalu ation (of courses ta ught, of means and methods of teaching and evaluation, of professional interests and accomplishments, of church and denominational involvement, of f aculty and school responsibilit ies), and student evaluation (of courses taught, textbooks, assignments, instruction, and classroom performance). Student evaluations of teaching are conducted each spring, and annual reports on professional achievements are prepared by each faculty member and presented through the Dean's office to the President of the University. The primary purpose of the evaluat ion system is to help faculty members improve the ir teaching skills and their professional expertise . This three-fold evaluation pr ocess (peer review, self-evaluation, and student evaluation) provides a st rong and effective means for m aintaining the quality of the Divinity School's instructional program. Faculty Meetings Regular meetings of the Faculty are held monthly. Dates for the se meetings are set in the Faculty's Fall Workshop. Special meetings may be called by the Dean or As sistant Dean. Regular meetings are not scheduled during the summer terms or during holidays from classes. Governance The operating principles and philosophy of the Campbell Univers ity Divinity School are consistent with the accrediting standards of the Association of Theologica l Schools in North America and are published in the school's primary documents. Our primary docume nts recognize the principle of \"shared governance\" in expressl y assigning various responsibili ties to the princip le component parts of the institution: the Board of Trustees, the University administration, the Dean, the Assistant Dean, and the Faculty. The Board of Tru stees is responsible to secure and oversee financial i ntegrity, to set policy, to elect the Divinity Sc hool's leadership and Faculty, and to approve programs. The Dean of the Divinity School is responsib le to implement and administer Board-approved policies, to make recommendations regarding programs and personnel, and to overse e the administrative and academic integrity of the Divinity School program. The Faculty, under th e leadership of the Assistant Dean, is responsible for developing and conducting the academic program and setting standards for admission and the conferring of degrees. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 7 This system of shared governance functions best when each compo nent of the Divinity School contributes to the corporate life of the institution by excelli ng in the performance of assigned responsibilities. Trustees alone have the legal authority and the fiduciary respo nsibility to govern the school by setting policy. The practice in higher education is to delegate many in stitutional duties and responsibilities to the administration and facu lty. The duties of the Faculty ar e clearly specified in the Bylaws of the University and are ex ercised under the aut hority and subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees and those to whom these duties have been delegated. Guest Lecturers (Classroom) When the budget permits, the Dean can approve requests for expe nses and/or fees for special guest lecturers. These funds are designa ted for \"outside speakers\" wh o come as experts to supplement the regular classroom lectures. The funds are not available to prov ide payment to current faculty members who may be invited to lecture in place of the regular teacher in some classes. Faculty members may invite qualified individuals to lead class sessions at their di scretion, but when application is made to the Dean for funds to provide expenses for these speakers, a br ief written rationale for the guest should be provided for record-keeping pur poses. All requests should be handled in advance of the event. Interims Faculty who interested in serving as interim pastors should fo llow the Off-Campus Employment Guidelines in the University Faculty Handbook. Professional Society Meetings The Divinity School provides each full-time faculty member with an allowance to cover a portion of the documented expense for atte ndance at professional/scholarly meetings each fiscal year. When a professor is an elected officer of the organization or a major participant on the program, it may be possible to negotiate an additional allowance at the Dean's dis cretion, if budget funding is available and if the request is made well in advance of the meeting. Addi tional allowances, when available, are rotated among faculty members to a ssure that opportunities are available to all. The purpose of this travel allow ance is to enhance the scholarly and professional life of the Divinity School Faculty. The allowance may be denied if the meeting is n ot recognized as a traditionally defined professional society or a scholarly meeting. Travel for personal study and to meetings of denominational organizations generally does not qualify. The av ailability of professional development funds is provided to faculty members at the beginning of each budget year. Professor's Assistants Every faculty member teaching a fu ll load is entitled to the as sistance of a Professor's Assistant who will work 12-15 hours per month. The professor makes a proposal to the student to be his/her assistant and then makes a formal request for approval to the Assistant D ean. The form for making this request 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 8 is available in the Divinity School office. Criteria for selection of a Professor's Assistant are specified on the request form. Teaching Load The teaching load of full-time faculty members is 9 semester ho urs. It is assumed that each faculty member will also be available to teach a course during one summ e r s e s s i o n a t l e a s t e v e r y o t h e r summer if needed. Occasionally, a faculty mem ber may request to teach more than 9 hours so as, for example, to have a lighter load the next semester or to cover f or a colleague who is on sabbatical leave. Certain duties assigned by the Dean may be partially com pensated by a reduction in teaching load or additional compensation. Faculty members asked to teach a summer course or an \"overload\" will receive additional compensation. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 9 APPENDIX A Campbell University Divinity School Principles and Guidelines for Academic Freedom Freedom has been affirmed, devel oped, and safeguarded by many persons and groups concerned with justice, with due process, and with commitment to free inquiry. In many lands, the protection of the rights of citizens and groups is provided for in the constituti ons, in legal precedents and practices, and in the charters and bylaws of education and other institutions. There are also vital religious roots of freedom. Israel's prophets insisted upon speaking the truth of God despite the opposition of those in authority. The early Chr istians insisted that they were required to obey God rather than human authority. Recognizing that there are variou s theological approaches to fr eedom, theological schools acknowledge that they share a co mmon concern for realizing the highest possible standards of freedom in all institutions of e ducation. Theological schools a lso acknowledge that the grounds for their understanding of freedom, a nd thus of academic freedom, need to be stated clearly and adhered to. Campbell University Divinity School subscribes to the principle s of academic freedom encouraged by the Association of Theologica l Schools (ATS) and enabled by the Trustees of Campbell University. Campbell University Divinity School's principles an d guidelines are consistent with ATS's standards and particulari zed to Campbell University Divin ity School. Fundamental to academic fre edom are beliefs that: 1. All thought and life is to be directed toward God, the source of truth, the judge of all human thoughts, and the ultimate end of all theological inquiry. 2. The freedom of the person of faith always involves a commens urate responsibility toward God and neighbor. It is never the freedom merely to be left alone or to ignore basic obligations. 3. Freedom has specific import in th e cont ext o f a r el igious co nfession of faith. Theological schools may acknowledge specific c onfessional adherence as laid down in the charters and constitutions of the schools. A concept of freedom appropriate to theological schools will respect this confessional loyalty, both in the institutions and among their individual members. Faculty members must, therefore, be (1) supportive of local chu rches and (2) must affirm the Purpose Statement of Campbell University and the Mission Statem ent of the Divinity School. These criteria are reviewed duri ng an employment interview prio r to being offered a position and when being considered for tenure. Faculty members are required to teach in accordance with and not contrary to these criteria. 4. While freedom must ultimately be reali zed through the spirit and the loyalties of men and women, it must take form and be protected through concrete stan dards of institutional practice. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 10 Every statement of such standard s moves somewhat in the sphere of law and regulation. The effectiveness of such stated pri nciples depends finally upon th e dedication within the theological school to a genuine c oncern for liberty of mind and spirit in theological teaching. Institutional Guidelines 1. Central to the vocation of the theological school and to its faculty members and students is the inquiry for truth. This inqui ry is both a communal and an i ndividual vocation. 2. Faculty members are free to teach, carry on research, and pu blish, subject to adequate performance of their academic du ties as agreed upon with the sc hool. 3. Teachers are free to express and act upon their conscientiou s convictions as individual citizens, although they should rea lize that there is the tacit representation of their institutions in whatever is said. 4. Faculty members should take care lest they violate each othe r's academic freedom by covert interference with their colleague's work or through bypassing t h e o r d e r l y p r o c e s s o f f u l l faculty discussion of curriculum, appointments, and other basic matters. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 11 APPENDIX B Faculty Promotion and Tenure Principles and Guidelines Faculty members who desire promo tion should familiarize themsel v es w ith th e g e n eral st an d a rd s described below. Faculty members should then discuss the timing and appropriateness of an application for promotion/tenu re with the Assistant Dean by August 1 . (Such conversation should be an ongoing process that is discussed during annual faculty revi ews relative to criteria being met for promotion.) There is no policy wh ich mandates that a faculty member be promoted to the next rank or earn tenure within a specified time frame or else a terminal contract be given. However, faculty members are expected to be productive and should develop a reco rd of accomplishment that would lead to promotion to the next rank within a reasonable time fra me. Failure to do so may ultimately jeopardize the continual awarding of year to year contracts. Review by Divinity Facult y Development Committee If the Assistant Dean agrees with the appropriateness and timin g of a request for promotion/tenure, then a letter of application from the faculty member should be forwarded to the Divinity School Faculty Development Committee. This letter should set forth the request for promotion, the reasons why the request is justified, a nd attached materials showing th e applicant's record of scholarly, ecclesial, and institutional ser vice. Letters of application sh ould be received by September 15 of the year promotion/tenure is requested. The faculty member may inc lude in the application any supplementary material that would support the request. An optio nal letter of support from the Assistant Dean is due to the Divinity School Faculty Developmen t Committee by November 15 . After discussion, the Divinity F aculty Developm ent Committee sh all vote on whethe r to recommend promotion/tenure. The c hair shall write a report that summarize s the vote and addresses the rationale for the decision. In the event t hat the chair of the committee disagrees with the majority vote of the committee, the chair should design ate to another member of the committee, who agrees with the majority, the responsibility for writing the report. Any member of the committee who does not support the majority report shall have the option of writing a minority report that includes rationale for his or her dissent. The report, along with any minority reports, shall be forwarded to the Dean and the candidate no later than January 31 . The candidate will have one week to respond in writing to the report of the Committee. Review by the Dean After receipt of all material submitted, the Dean shall conside r the candidate's application. At his or her option, the Dean may request or consider additional materia l or speak with other informed parties. The Dean shall write a report that indicates whether or not he or she supports the recommendations of the Divinity Faculty Development Committee. In this report, the Dean shall set forth in reasonable detail the rationale for his or her recommendation, including but not limited to institutional considerations, the candidate's record, the school's curriculum and mission, support of the University purpose, and any other relevant mat ters concerning the candidat e's application. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum C - Divinity Page 12 The Dean's report, along with all material submitted in earlier s t a g e s , s h a l l b e forwarded to the Provost by March 31 . The Dean's report shall also b e forwarded to the candidate by March 31 . The candidate shall have one week to respond in writing to the Dean 's report and submit that response (if any) to the Provost. Review by the University Administration A careful review by the Provost and President will be made. Aff irmative recommendations will be presented to the Board of Trust ees at its Fall meeting. In maki ng their decisions, the Provost and President shall consider material prepared by the candidate as well as recommendations from the various review levels. They shall apply their professional judg ment in considering the merits of the individual's case, and in determining what is in the best inter est of the University and its programs. Decisions of the Board relative t o promotion and tenure will be communicated in writing to the faculty member.

In addition to offering the Doctor of Pharmacy program, the school offers undergraduate and graduate programs in clinical research and pharmaceutical sciences. In 2009, the name was formally changed from the School of Pharmacy to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences in order to provide additional heal th science programs, including the Physician Assistant program (2011), a Master of Public Health degree (2012), a Doct or of Physical Therapy degree (2014), and a Bachelor of Science of Nursing (2015). The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopa thic Medicine (CUSOM) was established in 2011. 2.2 Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) CUSOM has three distinct graduate programs - Doctor of Osteopat hic Medicine (DO), Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (MSBS), and Master of Health Professions Education (MHPE). CUSOM admitted its first class of DO students in August of 2013 a n d b e c a m e t h e second-largest medical school in the state of North Carolina. Factors that led to the establishment of the school were an increased demand for primar y care physicians, an aging population that will require medical services and many ar eas of the state designated as medically underser ved. Osteopathic medicine's hi storical roots are in rural primary care with approxima tely 60% of osteopathic physicians choosing to practice family medic ine, internal medici ne, pediatrics, and ob stetrics and gynecology. In 2015, CUSOM started a Master o f Science in Biomedical Scienc e (MSBS) program and matriculated the first MSBS cohort in 2015. In 2019, CUSOM started a Master o f Health Professions Education (MHPE) program and matriculated the first MHPE cohort in 2020. CUSOM faculty, staff and students value teamwork, leadership, p rofessionalism, integrity, diversity, and the ethical treatment of all humanity as reflected in the CUSOM Mission statement. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 6 CUSOM DO Mission Statement Mission The mission of the CUSOM is to educate and prepare community-ba sed osteopathic physicians in a Christian environment to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States, and the nation.

For the purposes of this policy, a \"therapeutic relationship\" o ccurs when a licensed clinician assumes the responsibility for the evaluation, diagno sis, or management of a student's medical or behavioral health condition. Recusal Policy If a CUSOM faculty member is a health professional with a previ ous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a C USOM student in any CUSOM prog ram, they must recuse themselves as described below. Committee Meetings In the case of committee meetings, including, but not limited t o, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee, the committee Chair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of in terest from committee members prior to student case discussions. Any committee membe r(s) identifying a potential conflict will be required to recuse themselves from both the discussion phase of the meeting as well as the decision-mak ing process for matters in which a poten tial conflict exists. This policy also applies to any faculty member on the Admission s Committee or Endowed and Annual Scholarship Co mmittee involved in the discus sion of an applicant with whom the faculty member has a previous or ongoin g therapeutic relationship. In such a case, the faculty member must recuse t hemselves from any discussion or vote regarding the student's candidacy or adm ission decisions. Summative Skills Assessments In cases of summative skills assessments including, but not lim ited to, OMM, clinical skills, simulation, and OSCE evaluations, faculty grad ers with conflicts of interest must recuse themselves from the assessment and grad ing process. Any faculty member assigned to assess or grade the performance of a current CUSOM student with whom they have a previous or ongoing establi shed therapeutic relationship must identify the conflict of interest to the Course Director. The Course Director will either assign the student assessment and/or grading to a different faculty mem ber or perform it themselves. If the Course Director also has a potential conflict, then the Block Leader(s) will perform the assessment (or designate another qualified faculty member) and assign the grade. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 15 Final Course Grades: Blocks 1-8 During all first- and second-year courses in preclinical Blocks 1-8, a Course Director who has a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student is prohibited from making any decisions regarding final course grade determinations for that student. In these cases, the Course Di rector must report the potential conflict of interest to the Block Leader(s) who will then assign the Co-Course Director to make the student's summative assessment o r final grade determination. In cases in which there is no Co-Course Director , t h e B l o c k Leader(s) will assume these responsibilities. Activities Not Prohibited by This Policy CUSOM faculty who have previous or ongoing therapeutic relation ships with a CUSOM student are permitted to provide student instruction thro ugh lectures, small group sessions, clinical skills instruction, or OMM table t r a i n i n g . I n addition, they may provide academic advising or letters of reco mmendation at the student's request. Clinical Rotation Evaluations and Grades During third- and fourth-year clinical rotations, supervising f aculty preceptors who have an established therapeutic relationship with a current CUSOM student are not permitted to determine the end-of-rotation evaluation for that student. If a preceptor is assigned to supervise such a student for a clinical rotation, they should immediately notify the Regional Dean or Director of Stud ent Medical Education (DSME) in the case of a Clinical Campus without a Reg ional Dean. The Regional Dean or DSME, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, may identify an alternative clinical practice or service for the student's rotation, or in cases when that is not feasible, iden tify another preceptor on the rotation to complete the end-of-rotation evaluation. Policy Implementation Adherence All faculty are notified of thi s policy and, by si gning an ackn owledgement, they have read and accept the policies and procedures delineated in the CUSOM Faculty Handbook and are attesti ng to agreement with abiding by this policy. Each faculty member is required to acknowledge their review of the Faculty Handbook annually. New faculty will acknowledge reviewing the Faculty Handbook upon signing their contract , and thereafter review on an annual basis as cited previously. As noted above, this policy will be reviewed at the beginning of any committee meeting regarding student academic performance in which a conflict of interest may exist. Reminders of the policy are al so made at one or more scheduled Faculty and Staff Meetings annually. CUSOM Professional Development programs al so include discussions related to this t opic. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 16 Assessment of Compliance In compliance with the COCA standards, any health professional with a CUSOM faculty appointment who provi des health services to a CUS OM student through a patient relati onship must recuse themselves from the academic assessment or promotion of the student receiving those services. A faculty member providing a the rapeutic relationship is not re sponsible for assigning grades for medical students. In the pre-clinical curriculum, the Office of Assessment, Accre ditation, and Medical Education manages the as sessment process and recording of grades in all courses. In the CUSOM model, one of the Course Director s serves as the instructor of record and is responsible for the assigning o f grades for their particular course. In this capacity, the Acting Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs asks each Course Director during every Block if they ha ve a therapeutic relationship with a ny of the students in their course. If the Course Director identifies any conflict s, then feedback would be provided to the Vice Dean and in that instance a Co-Course Director or other de signee appointed by the Vice Dean or Dean would be appointed to assign the grades and act as the instructor of record. In th e clin ical cu rriculu m, th e app ropriate Clin ical Chair o r t he Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs acts as the instructor of record. In a case similar to described above for the situation when a Clinical Chair is aske d and determined to be acting in a therapeutic relationship with a st udent, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs would act as the instructor of record to assign a grade for that student. If a circumstance does arise in which a student identifies a cl inical preceptor or faculty member providing summative course grading or skills assessments (including, but not limi ted to, OMM, clinical skills, simulatio n, and OSCE), or with whom they have a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship, they should immediately contact the Course Director (for 1 st and 2nd year courses) or Associate Dean for C linical Affairs (for 3rd or 4th year rotations). 4.4 Delegation of Authority The Dean may delegate to standing, or ad hoc , faculty committees the responsibility for formulating and administering the programs of the School of Ost eopathic Medicine to the extent the Dean deems to be in the best interest of the Sch ool of Osteopathic Medicine. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 17 SECTION 5: FACULTY 5.1 CUSOM Statement of Professional Ethics CUSOM's Statement on Professional Ethics follows general standards serving as a reminder of responsibilities assumed by all faculty, administra tion, and staff.

Part-time academic faculty may have agreements, whic h may hold them responsible to perform these duties. The process for faculty a ppointment of part-time faculty follows the same process as for full-time faculty. Par t-time faculty appointments are reviewed annually. Part-time faculty members may attend the Faculty Senate meetings but do not have voting privileges and a re not eligible for tenure. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 20 5.5 Initial Faculty Appointment There are two Appointment Serie s: (1) Tenure Track, and (2) Non -Tenure Track. Tenure Track Tenure Track appointments are for faculty who contribute effort to all three (3) strategic mission areas of CUSOM: 1. Education 2. Scholarship 3. Service and contributions to the University Mission A complete description of the Tenure Track ranks including aspe cts of appointment and promotion is presented in Appendix D. Tenure Track faculty generally receive full compensation from t he University, however appointment in the Tenure Track is not limited based on percentage of University funding. An individual's contract with the University will indicate the appointment to the appropriate Tenure Track series. Non-Tenure Track There are four (4) different N on-Tenure Track appointment class ifications. A complete description of the Non-Tenure Track classifications in cluding aspects of initial appointment and pr omotion is in Appendix E. Non-Tenure Track Clinical Non-Tenure Track Clinical appointments are designated specifica lly for Program Directors, Associate Program Directors, and ACGME-defined Core Faculty in CUSOM-sponsored Graduate Medical Education programs. Such faculty may receive full or partial compensation from the Unive rsity. Titles for faculty in this track carry the modifier of \"Clinical\" i.e. , Clinical Assistant Professor, Clinical Associate Pr ofessor, Clinical Professor. Non-Tenure Track Adjunct Non-Tenure Track Adjunct appointme nts are designated for fully qualified faculty who have an academic or clinical relationship with CUSOM. Adjunct faculty include those individuals who are committed to the academic program or the clinical traini ng programs through teaching cont ributions. Adjunct appointments are determined at the school (CUSOM) level . These are of a fixed term (from one (1) to three (3) years) and are r enewable based upon continued participation and performance. Titles for facul ty in this track carry the modifier of \"Adjunct\" i.e., Adjunct Instructor, Adjun ct Assistant Professor, Adjunct Associate Pr ofessor, Adjunct Professor. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 21 Non-Tenure Track Research Non-Tenure Track Research appoint ments are designated for facul ty who focus their efforts on research, such as post-doctoral fellows. Such faculty may receive full or partial compensation from the University. Titles for faculty in this track carry the modifier of \"Research\" i.e., Re search Instructor, Research Assistant Professor, Research Associate Pr ofessor, Research Professor. Non-Tenure Track Visiting Non-Tenure Track Visiting appointments are designated for a fin ite duration (one (1) year or less) with the option for one (1) successive r eappointment for a term not to exceed one (1) year and intended for individu als who are not otherwise employed by Campbe ll University. Visiting facult y may receive full or partial compensation from Campbell University b ut are not entitled to earn vacation or sick days. Titles for faculty in this track carry the modifier of \"Visiting\" i.e., Vis iting Assistant Professor, Visi ting Associate Professor, Visit ing Professor. Joint Academic Appointments Joint academic appointments may be made in conjunction with one or more other Campbell University schools, departments, or units. Joint appo intments are applicable to any appointment s eries. Although faculty with jo int appointments often derive salary from each of the appointing units, the shar ing of the salary burden is not a requirement for a joint appointment; however, a ll units participating in a particular joi nt appointment should participate in appropriate review of faculty appointment, pa rticularly with respect to iss ues of reappointment, promotion, and tenure. For matters of promotion or tenure, the policies and procedures of the Campbell University School/Colle ge in which the faculty member has his/her prim ary appointment will be followed . Initial Appointment Academic Ranks INSTRUCTOR This academic rank describes the faculty member who does not po ssess the terminal degree in their discipline. This rank may also be use d for faculty members with a terminal degree(s) but limited postgraduate expe rience (e.g., Resident Physicians). 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 22 ASSISTANT PROFESSOR This academic rank describes the faculty member who possesses t he terminal degree in their discipline and shows promise in the areas of ed ucation, scholarly activities, and servic e/support of the CUSOM Mission. T h e requirement of a terminal degree may be waived by the Dean for a faculty member with documented accomplishments in the three academic en deavors of education, scholarly a ctivities, and service. ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR This academic rank describes the faculty member who exceeds the criteria for rank of Assistant Professor and displays a sustained and significant record of accomplishments in educati on, scholarly activities, and serv ice. PROFESSOR This academic rank describes the faculty member who exceeds the criteria for rank of Associate Professor. The academic rank of Professo r is among the highest honors that a university can bestow upon a faculty member. Therefore, it is awarded only to candidates who have distinguis hed themselves in their discipline at the national or international l e v e l . T h e faculty member must demonstrate a sustained record of outstandi ng achievements in education, scholarship, and service. Although the faculty member is expected to excel in two areas, the candidate must demonstrate significant activity in all thr ee areas. Although other factor s will be considered, consultantships, pro fessional publications, invited \"editorships\" and lectureships, and holding of a professional societal office will be important elements in assessing a faculty member's accomplishme nts. 5.6 Appointment Request Process For new faculty hires, the Faculty Search Committee will recomm end appropriate candidates to the Dean. Appointme nt requests for Adjunct and C linical faculty may be made by respective administrative leadership (e.g., Department Chairs, Regional Deans, Associate Dean for Biomedical or Clinical Affairs, or Program D irectors). The Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure (APT) Committee must be provided the following documentation for a ca ndidate under consideration for a n i n i t i a l C U S O M appointment: 1. Letter of request: The request from the respective administrat ive leadership may include a suggested rank for appointment, if applicable. 2. Current Curriculum Vita e of the candidate. 3. Any additional documentation to support meeting qualifications for a suggested rank. This may include documenta tion of prior appointments and accomplishments in education, scholarship, and service. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 23 The APT Committee, upon receipt of the request and documentatio n, shall review the application and provide a recommendation to the Dean (with a copy to the candidate and respective administrative leadership) in a timely manner. The APT Committee Chair will provide the Committee's recommendation to the Dean. At the discretion of the Dean of CUSOM, with recommendations fr om the respective administrative leadership, faculty with prior academic experien ce or with unique scholarly and educational backgr ounds may be appointed at a spe cific academic rank or with tenure based on the creden tials and experience of the cand idate. These credentials and experience should be consiste nt with the definitions and de scriptions for the academic ranks noted above. The APT Committee will also review the documentation and credentials of faculty memb ers who received an initial appo intment rank from the Dean. At the time of initial appointment, it shall be set forth in wr iting whether the position is Tenure Track or Non-Tenure Track, and if the position is full-t ime or part-time. 5.7 Faculty Annual Review Process and Timeline To provide clear documentation of goals and accomplishments and plan for professional development needs, faculty will participate in an organized pro cess of performance review. Process The CUSOM faculty annual performance review process involves th ree (3) major steps: 1. Faculty self-assessment - Each faculty member compiles documentation of their accomplishments over the previous academic year. They th en complete the majority of the annual perfo rmance review form, including s elf- assessment of progress on goals set the previous year; performa nce in the three strategic mission areas (ed ucation, scholarship, and serv ice - including contributions to institutional mission); and proposed goals for the coming year. 2. Supervisor assessment - Faculty self-assessment and compiled documentation is reviewed by the direct supervisor, who prepare s their own assessment. 3. Discussion and goal-setting - A one-on-one meeting between the faculty member and supervisor is held to consider progress toward acade mic advancement, long-term goals, and development needs. Goals for the current academic year are agreed upon and documented for use in the fol lowing year's review. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 24 Timeline MONTH ACTIVITY PERSON(S) RESPONSIBLE July Year-end data compiled - Teaching & advising evaluations - Interview participation - Professional development participation - Committee participation - Clinical volume, if applicable Office of Assessment Office of Admissions Professional Development Committee Chairs Clinical Affairs August Data reported to facu lty and supervisors As above September Self-assessments prepared - Due to supervisor 7 days before meeting Individual faculty October Individual Annual review meetings - Final reports due to Dean by October 31 Supervisors November Review results - Signed copies of reports back to faculty Dean 5.8 Promotion in Academic Rank General Considerations The process of evaluating a facu lty member for promotion begins at the point of hire and initial appointment. Departme nt Chairs/Supervisors shall p rovide each faculty member with expectations of performance associated with their c urrent appointment during annual reviews. A faculty member's expectations of performance shall include an allocation of focus and responsibility to the three strategic areas of CUSOM: 1. Education 2. Scholarship 3. Service and contributions to Mission The faculty member, in consultation with their Department Chair/Supervisor, determines the distribution of a faculty member's responsibilit ies regarding education, scholarship, and service. Faculty with Tenure Track appointments shall have expectations of performance in all three strategic areas of CUSOM. The allocation of effort among st education, service, and scholarship must total 100%, and is reflected as such in th e CUSOM Faculty Adequacy Model, which is prepared regularly by the Executive Di rector of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education and maintained in the Offic e of Academic Affairs. It is reasonable that a faculty member will have a dominant are a(s) (greater percentage of effort) of focus and responsib ility amongst the three strate gic areas. Faculty members and their Department Chair/Supervisor shall doc ument performance in accordance with the dominant area(s) of focus and responsibi lity in a manner that will allow comprehensive and thoughtful analyses. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 25 Department Chairs/Supervisors are encouraged to incorporate the career aspirations of the faculty member (including promotion) into the expectations of performance and allocation of focus and responsibility. Expectations of perfor mance should be developed and communicated in the context of the promotion guidelines for CUSOM. When preparing an evidentiary foundation for promotion, it is i ncumbent upon the candidate and the Department Chai r/Supervisor to consider the s pecific expectations of performance previously agreed upon over the time-period support ing the request for promotion. The dominant area(s ) of responsibilities should be documented and performance of expectations clear ly explained. Expectations of performance are not immutable. They may change as the needs of the Department/Prog ram, CUSOM, and the faculty member change. Change s in responsibilities and exp ectations are subject to negotiation and documentation. Advancement in rank cannot be guaranteed according to any fixed schedule. Seniority alone is not a reason for promo tion to any rank. Tenure and pr omotion are separate considerations. Faculty may submi t concurrent requests for pro motion and tenure with one dossier. Tenure decisions are made independently of any pr ior or concurrent promotion consideration. Since promotion and tenure are consid ered separately, there is the potential for approval of both, denial of both, or appro val of one with denial of the other request. A candidate may elect to withdraw the request for promotion or tenure at any time in the process by submitting a request in writing to the APT Chair , the Dean, or the Provost, as applicable. Time spent in rank at another institution may be applied to ful fill the suggested minimum years noted in the criteria of Tenure Track Ranks found in Appe ndix D. Eligibility for Promotion CUSOM does not mandate a faculty member be promoted to the subs equent rank within a specified timeframe or require a pre-defined period wi thin a rank prior to applying for promotion. Faculty should maintain a record of accomplishments that would provide evidence to support promotion to the next academic rank within a reasona ble timeframe. All reviews begin at the departm ental level. Such additional g uidance will address the unique characteristics and ide ntity of the Department/Progr am. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 26 Promotion Guidelines and Standards Guidelines for Promotion of Tenure Track Faculty A complete description of the T enure Track ranks including aspe cts of appointment and promotion is presented in Appendix D. These c riteria are used by the APT Committee to determine whether a Tenure Track facult y member should be recommended for promotion. Guidelines for Promotion of Non-Tenure Track Faculty A complete description of the N on-Tenure Track ranks including aspects of appointment and promotion is pre sented in Appendix E. These cr iteria are used by the APT Committee to determine whether a faculty member shou ld be recommended for promotion in a Non-Tenure Track position. Department/Program Evaluation of Performance Measures CUSOM Departments/Programs may have additional guidelines for p romotion that are consistent with the unique characteristics and identit y of the Department/Program. This is consistent with the concept that e ligibility for promotion begins at the Departme nt/Program level. Faculty memb ers should discuss the timing and appropriateness of applying for promotio n with their Department Chair/Supervisor. Promotion Review Process - Tenure Track Review by Department Chair/Supervisor a) A candidate shall explore with th eir Department Chair/Superviso r the concept of readiness for promotion. Such preliminary considera tion shall be exploratory with specifics not binding on either the faculty me mber or the Department Chair/Supervisor involved. b) The Department Chair/Supervisor should evaluate the candidate's record and the role the candidate can be expected to play in the future ev olution of the department's curri culum and mission. c) If the Department Chair/Supervis or agrees with the appropriaten ess and timing of the promotion request, the candidate should prepare a dossier for submission to the APT Committee. d) If the Department Chair/Supervisor disagrees with the appropria teness and timing, the Department Chair/Supe rvisor should advise the candi date on what needs to be done to enhance the potential fo r approval.

Tenure Guidelines for Awarding Tenure The awarding of tenure is recogni tion of past academic and professional achievements and confidence in continued professional development and projection s for positive contributions to the institution in the future. The Tenure Track Rank Criteria (Appendix D) are used in making the recommendation to grant tenure. A faculty member (the \"candidate\") is expected t o demonstrate rank- appropriate achievements in all t hree areas (education, scholar ship, and service) to be granted tenure. An additional assessment of the projected long -term contribution that the individual will make to the University and the School will be c onsidered and evaluated. Departments/Programs may have additional guidance for candidate s seeking tenure that are based on the Tenure Track Rank Criteria (Appendix D). Such additional guidance will address the unique cha racteristics and ident ity of the Departme nt/Program. Teaching skills, contributions to the growth and development of CUSOM, and the receipt of extramural grants and other types of revenue generated for C USOM and the University will be considered in the tenure decision. A positive attitude and loyal support to the Mission of the ins titution must be apparent. The candidate must hold the rank of Associate Professor or Prof e s s o r a t C U S O M f o r a minimum number of years in ord er to be eligible to apply for te nure. Full Professor.

Outside Employment Faculty may engage in outside pr ofessional activities only afte r review and approval by the Dean and the Provost. Appropriate outside activities can enric h professional competence and provide a service to society. Full-time faculty members, however, are expected to devote working time and efforts pr imarily to their duties to th e School of Osteopathic Medicine. The following guidelines should be considered: As a general rule, any outside employment or consultation shoul d contribute affirmatively to the faculty mem ber's profession al advancement and correlate with the faculty member's duties to t he School of Osteopathic Medicine. A primary consideration should be whether outside activities in terfere with the faculty member's classroom schedul e, student interviewing and c ounseling role, scholarly activities, or other respon sibilities. The Dean must be consulted in advance where the faculty seeks t o engage in outside activities, such as regular outside private practice, part-time teaching at other educational institutions, or substantial educational undertakings, could ha ve a negative impact upon faculty duties and responsibilities. CUSOM does not allow other outside employment for those faculty members who are employed by CUSOM as full-time e quivalent (FTE) faculty for thi rty (30) hours a week or greater unless approved per University policy. Requests for ap proval of off-campus employment by the faculty memb er, including teaching at another institution, shall be made in advance and will be reviewed b y the Department Chair; the Dean of the College or School; and the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost . Clinical salaries and duties paid from a clinical site are not considered outside emp loyment, as CUSOM students are at the site for educational purposes. When full-time facul ty members who are employed by CUSOM are invited to provide their academic expertise to out side institutions or to provide precepting for outside students, pri or approval for suc h activities must be provided by the Dean. Faculty must read and sign Intellectual Property and Outside Em ployment Policies of Campbell University before enter ing into any outside employment agreement. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 38 SECTION 6: FACULTY GOVERNANCE 6.1 CUSOM Faculty Senate The CUSOM Faculty Senate is the representative body for the fac ulty of CUSOM. The CUSOM Faculty Senate serves as a forum for free and open faculty discussion of issues relevant to CUSOM and Campbell University. It also s erves as an advisory body to the Dean of CUSOM as needed and, through the Dean, to t he President and Board of Trustees of Campbell University. All full-time faculty members, as defined herein, are voting me mbers of the CUSOM Faculty Senate. Members of the CUSOM Administration (Dean and Associate Deans) may be invited to attend and participate in CUSOM Faculty Senate me etings but are not eligible to be elected as an Officer and sh all have no voting privileges . The CUSOM Faculty Senate shall elect the following Officers fro m the voting- eligible membership: Chair, Vice-Chair, and Secretary. Any member of th e Faculty Senate may volunteer or be nomin ated for any Officer position, but each individual is only eligible to run for one (1 ) Officer position. Each Office r will serve a two-year term. Elections shall take place prior to the first regular me eting of the CUSOM Senate in every other academic year. An Officer may only be elected to serve two (2) consecutive terms in any officer position. The faculty member will again be eligible to serve as an Officer after sitting out for two (2) years followi ng a second consecutive term. Should the Chair leave their position for any reason, th e Vice-Chair will assume the Chair and the CUSO M Senate will hold a special election to replace the Vice-Chair for the remainder of the term. If the Vice-Chair or Secretary vacates, the Senate will hold a special election to replace that position for the remainder of the term. The Chair will call for nominations when an Officer's departure is known so that a special election may proceed as quickly as possible. At the latest, the new Officer should be named by the next Faculty Senate meeting. The individual who is elected to serve the remainder of a term will be eligible to s erve one (1) additional term. A minimum of two (2) regular meetings of the CUSOM Senate shall b e h e l d i n t h e academic year, one in the Fall Semester and one in the Spring Semester. The Chair may schedule and convene additional meetings as necessary. A s chedule of meetings will be distributed to all CUSOM faculty members. A meeting qu orum shall consist of a minimum of 25% of the voting members in attendance or availab le by teleconference. Duties of CUSOM Senate Officers Chair : The Chair of the CUSOM Faculty Senate shall preside at meetin gs of the Senate and appoint all ad hoc committees formed by the Senate. The Chair of the Senate or their designee shall report all action taken by t he Senate to the CUSOM faculty and Dean of CUSOM. Vice-Chair: The Vice Chair of the Faculty Senate shall perform duties as requested by the Chair and all th e duties of the Chair in their absence. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 39 Secretary : The Secretary of the CUSOM Faculty Senate shall keep accurate minutes of all meetings of the Senate; conduct necessary corres pondence; keep an accurate list of the membership of the Faculty Senate; keep an accurate record of attendance; and perform duties as requested by the Chair. 6.2 Membership of Faculty Committees Committees, comprised of CUSOM faculty, staff, and students, fu nction to contribute to the efficient operation of the medical school. Each Committee has a specific charge and defined responsibilities. Faculty may request to serve on a pa rticular Committee; however, the Dean makes final appointments. Sufficient faculty are appointed to conduct the work of each Committee. A review is conducted periodically by the Office of Academic Affairs to ensure each Committee operates in a manner consistent with its charge. These qualitative reviews are part of the process by w hich the Dean reviews and drafts the annual committee appointment roster for the coming y ear and help inform the Dean's appointment decisions. Additionally, the workload of specific committee assignments is considered in CUSOM's faculty adequacy model to ensure sufficient time is ava ilable for the faculty member to successfully perform all other requirements of the fa culty role including, but not limited to, teaching, research/scholarship, service, clinic al activities, and administration. The Dean reviews and drafts the annual committee appointment ro ster, typically in the fall semester of each academic year, after consulting with CUSO M leadership and evaluating the Committee accomplishments from the previous year . Standing CUSOM Committees may have specific identified representation to facil itate the functioning of the committee. The general composition of CUSOM Committees consists of full members (and occasionally ex officio members), including faculty, staff, and administrative staff support selected from CUSOM and from Campbell University as nec essary, as well as students when appropriate. Some CUSOM Committees have an Executive Committee whose primary function is to discuss matters of importance to the functioning of the Committ ee, and to offer suggestions to the Chair relativ e to logistics and other topics . The Dean also recommends faculty and staff members to serve as CUSOM representatives on Campbell University Committees. Members are appointed, in part, because they are knowledgeable about, or interested in, the Com mittee's area of activity. To the extent possible, the business of the medical school is c onducted through the utilization of Standing Committees. The Dean determines the nu mber, and subject matter jurisdiction, of such committees. The number of members of each Committee, and the faculty members composing each Committee, is at the discretion of the Dean. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 40 At the beginning of each academic year, the Dean (or the Dean's designee) shall charge each Standing Committee. Charges will include specific tasks t o be performed by the committees in exercising their responsibilities. The Dean annually reviews each Committee charge at the time com mittee appointments are made, typically in the fall semester of each academic year. Committee charges may be modified if a need is determined after consulting with CUSOM leadership including discussions of committee functionality. CUSOM has three (3) distinct gra duate programs - Doctor of Oste opathic Medicine (DO), Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (MSBS), and Mast er of Health Professions Education (MHPE). C o m m i t t e e s w h i c h o v e r s e e a s p e c t s of all three programs are listed as CUSOM Co mmittees, whereas the DO, MSBS, and MHPE programs each have Committees whi ch oversee only that specific program and are listed as either DO, MSBS or MHPE Committees. Each Committee presents reports as designated in the respective charge. Additionally, and consistent with Campbell University processes for committee s, each CUSOM Committee shares an overall report to Dean's Council, the Strat egic Planning Committee, and other stakeholders as necessary, at the end of each academi c year. These end-of-year reports include Committee self-assessment as well as self-identified Committee recommendations and goals which help inform decisions regarding Committee formation or dissolution, possible changes to Committ ee charges, and the subsequent committee assignments for the upcoming academic year . To close the loop, the recommendations and goals implemented th e prior year will be assessed to determine success and inform changes for the next a cademic year in a continuous quality improvement approach as important components of ongoing programmatic assessment and strategic planning. Dean's Council The Dean's Council acts as the ad visory committee to the Dean o n matters affecting CUSOM and may act on other administrative matters as they arise. The Dean's Council consists of the Dean of CUSOM, who will chair the committee and Associate Deans appointed by the Dean. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 41 CUSOM Standing Committees To the extent possible, the bus iness of the faculty should be c onducted through the utilization of standing com mittees. The Dean and the facul ty shall determine the subject matter jurisdiction of such committees. The number of members of each committee and the faculty members composing each committee , shall be at the discretion of the Dean. S ubcommittees of standing committe es may be constituted by the Dean at their discretion. Committees are pr ovided their charge by the Dean or the Dean's designee and shall include specific t asks to be performed by the committees in exe rcising their responsibilitie s. For a complete list of CUSOM Standing Committees, membership, a nd charges, please see the CUSOM Committee Manual. Ad hoc Committees Should any item of business not lend itself well to the work of one of the standing committees, the Dean may appoint an ad hoc committee to handle such matters. Upon the completion of its duties, the ad hoc committee will submit a final report to the appropriate entity and cease to function. Campbell University Standing Committees with CUSOM Representati on The Dean of CUSOM recommends CU SOM faculty and staff members to serve as CUSOM representatives on Cam pbell University committees. For a complete list of Campbell University Committees, membersh ip, and charges, please see the Campbell University Committee Manual. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 42 SECTION 7 GENERAL CUSOM FACULTY POLICIES 7.1 Employment Obligations Each department is responsible for new-hire orientation. CUSOM faculty represent the School of Osteopathic Medicine an d Campbell University at all t imes while at work and assume positional, school, and university responsibilities incl uding adherence to all professionalism standards descri bed elsewhere in the Faculty Ha ndbook. 7.2 Continuing Medical Education and Professional Development CUSOM recognizes the necessity of Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Professional Development (PD) for both clinical and basic science faculty from both an intellectual and licensing perspective. All faculty members ar e expected to utilize scientifically reliable and professionally recognized sources o f CME and PD. Faculty members may utilize peer-reviewed, professional CME and PD from a variety of media, including print, internet, vide o, lectures, and meetings. Facu lty should keep a record of CME and PD in print or digital formats and submit this record t o their medical licensing boards or specialty organizati ons upon request. In addition, a record of CME and PD activities should be submitted as part of the Annual Faculty Re view documentation. Faculty members should be wary of CME and PD tha t is potentiall y biased by financial and other influences. Faculty members are encouraged to create and lead CME and PD programs for their own professional development as well as the education of other CUSOM and Campbell University facu lty, local and regional healt h care professionals, and distant professionals who woul d benefit from the expertise of CUSOM faculty. All CUSOM faculty are expected to attend to their own ongoing d evelopment, participating in at least ten (10) hours of faculty development annually. Two (2) or more of these hours should be in live programs offered at CUSOM. 7.3 Role Model The faculty should be aware that students are influenced by the example of their professors. The behavior of the CUSOM faculty members provides an effective means of projecting the character and ideals of the institution and of the Osteopathic profession. In order to best prepare our medical students for a professiona l life of service, faculty members should strive to meet the highest standards of conduct in their working and private lives and relationships. Faculty members are expected to exemplify graciousness, conside ration for others, and the observance of the high principles of honor, integrity, dece ncy and morality; obey, honor and uphold the law; respect the personal and property rig hts of others; maintain high standards of personal appearance and professional performa nce; and adhere to all institutional policie s and regulations. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 43 7.4 Professional Attire The professional nature of the school should be considered in m atters of faculty attire. Faculty members and other employees who dress and groom themsel ves in a manner consistent with the professional aspect of their position and o f CUSOM will set a positive example to both students and visitors. Faculty must m aintain a professional appearance. Professional attire must be maintained whenever th e faculty members are on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University, in all clinical experiences, and on teaching clin ical rotations. Faculty must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes, and worksho ps except as may be authorized by the immediate supe rvisor. Faculty ID badges must be prominently worn at all times. A clean and well-cared-for appearance should be maintained. Th e apparel and appearance of faculty, staff and students project, and the imag e the community has of the University, convey respect for those who come to us for car e or an education. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well-groo med, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, st udents, or patients. 7.5 Class Meetings Each member of the faculty will meet classes at the scheduled t imes and be adequately prepared. Classes should not be postponed for personal conveni ence, and when postponement is required, the fac ulty member shall post appropr iate notice. 7.6 Academic Counseling Academic counseling and individu al attention to student needs a re an important component of the educational mission of CUSOM. The Academic Advisor-Advisee relationship is one of an institut ional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, pro fessional, personal, scholarly, and career planning i ssues. The academic Advisor-Ad visee relationship provides mentoring between facul ty and students on both academi c and personal levels. This relationship assists in pr oviding consistent feedback rega rding academic performance and gives students gui dance to additional resources within and outside the institution. The CUSOM advising process ensu res both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student advising and establishing relationships, wh ich create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. All advi sors play an importa nt role in identifying students experiencing academic , personal, or behavioral health problems and providing them with referrals to appropria te resources including CUSOM's Office of Student Affairs, Academic Center for Ex cellence (ACE) for individual study skill coaching, Behavioral Health Services for a ssessment and appropriate treat ment, or Campbell University Disability Services. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 44 The Office of Student Affairs as signs academic advisors, with input and approval from the Associate Dean for Biomedi cal Affairs, to each incoming CUS OM student. The list of academic advisors is reviewed and approved by the Dean. Student advising is provided through both mandatory group and individual meetings in the first two (2) years. Times reserved for advisors to meet w ith their advisees are designated on the academic calendar. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors during years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Blocks 1 and 2 of Year 1, students meet with their academic advisor at least once individually, and once in a group setting each Block (4 meetings total). The focus of these meetings is to provide academic support to t he students during this transitional period but also serves as an opportunity to answer questions, identify student concerns or difficulties, and provide students information regarding helpful CUSOM resources and support services. During Blocks 3-5, students are r equired to meet with their adv isors at least once each Block in a group setting. Additional individual meetings can be arranged based on needs. In addition to their role of serving as academic advisors to sp ecifically assigned students, faculty also meet with non-assigned students to provide additio nal help with course work. Faculty offer office hour s individually and are availabl e to students outside office hours for any additional assistance. Many faculty members host additional virtual office hours, via a virtual meeting platfo rm, to provide students with additional flexibility and opportunities to receive help. Scheduling may be done either d irectly with faculty, or through the appropriate admin istrative assistant. 7.7 Interviews CUSOM interviews a substantial n umber of applicants in order to assess their personal and professional qualities in add ition to their academic qualif ications for admission. All faculty members are expected to participate in the applicant in terview process and the required number of interviews per faculty member will be establ ished by the Director of Admissions based on the number of applicants scheduled to be in terviewed each semester (Fall and Spring). Faculty members may be assigned to conduct applicant interviews on specific in terview days based on need. 7.8 Research CUSOM is committed to providing resources, opportunities, and support for faculty research. The Associate Dean for Research serves as a key reso urce for faculty interested in engaging in scholarly activity and provides key l eadership in fostering a research environment that nurtu res scholarly activities, promot es research integrity and encourages the growth of extra mural funding initiatives at the CUSOM affiliated clinical sites. As scholarship (along with educat ion and servic e) is one of the components of the three (3) strategic areas of CUSOM and contributes to faculty performance assessment and promotion and tenure decisions, faculty members are encouraged to take advantage of the resources and opportunities ava ilable to engage in scholarl y research activity. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 45 7.9 Service Service is an important responsib ility of CUSOM faculty and a k ey component of the faculty performance assessment an d promotion and tenure decisio ns. As such, faculty members are expected to actively participate in both curricular and co-curricular activities of CUSOM. This incl udes, but is not limited, to the following responsibilities: Accept and carry out committee assignments; Attend CUSOM's White Coat Ceremony; Attend CUSOM's graduation commen cement ceremony in full academi c regalia; attend Campbell University's graduation commencement c eremony held in December if CUSOM students are participating; Participate in CUSOM applicant interviews; Participate in CUSOM Grand Round s and Faculty Development sessions; Complete monthly reports and an a nnual Professional Performance R e c o r d or Activity Report as directed by the Department Chair; Submit an annually updated Curricu lum Vitae to the Dean's offic e; Cooperate fully with colleagues, staff, and students to contrib ute to the advancement of the educational a nd administrative affairs of th e institution. 7.10 Faculty Workload The faculty workload is designed and adjusted to ensure each faculty member makes meaningful and significant contributions to the mission of the institution while providing flexibility to emphasize facu lty strengths and interests. Faculty with Tenure Track appointments shall have expectations of performance in all three (3) strategic areas of CUSOM. The allocation of effort amongst education, service, and scholarship must total 100%, and is reflected as such in th e CUSOM Faculty Adequacy Model, which is prepared regularly by the Executive Di rector of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education and maintained in the Offic e of Academic Affairs. It is reasonable that a faculty member will have a dominant are a(s) (greater percentage of effort) of focus and responsib ility amongst the three strate gic areas. Faculty members and their Department Chair/Supervisor shall doc ument performance in accordance to the dominant area(s) of focus and responsibili ty in a manner that will allow comprehensive and thoughtful analyses. Expectations of workload, distribution and performance are not immutable. They may change as the needs of the Department/Program, CUSOM, and the f aculty member change. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 46 Faculty workload is divided into three (3) broad categories as briefly defined below: Education Faculty educational activities include development and delivery of didactic content, laboratory-based instruction, facilitation of small group activ ities, writing and grading examinations, and other complementary educational efforts. Additional educational activities include design of courses and activities, and continual improvement of educational programs through applicati on of assessment data and educational research. Scholarship Faculty are expected to engage in scholarly activity. Basic sc ience research, clinical research, and medical education research are particula rly encouraged. Additional information regarding research and scholarly activity is found in Section 7.8 of Addendum D - CUSOM of the Faculty Handbook. Service Membership, participation, and le adership in CUSOM and Campbell University committees will be required. Facult y will be encouraged to adv ise student organizations, participate in community activities and medical mission trips, and be active in professi onal organizations at both the local and national level. One of the most important activities of faculty is to assist in the recruitment and selection of future students. Faculty are expected to interview prospective students as necessary. Providing guidance to students dur ing all four years of their e ducation is an essential role of the CUSOM faculty. All faculty members are e xpected to serve as student advisors. Additional information regarding service is found in Section 7. 9 of Addendum D - CUSOM of the Faculty Handbook. 7.11 Informed Consent Policy Patients, research participants, and designated surrogates when appropriate, must be provided with appropriate information required for them to make informed choices and give informed consent. Faculty, staff, students, and researchers are responsible for e nsuring that all personal health information of patients a nd research participants remain s confidential in accordance with the Health Insur ance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). All CUSOM faculty, staff, and students must practice within the informed consent framework as presented in this policy. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 47 Guiding Principles Patients have an ethical and legal right to be free of unwanted medical interventions and bodily invasions. Competent patients, by law, must be info rmed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of th e proposed care and have the ri ght to reject a physician's recommendations. This right to refuse also extends to noninvasive care, such as diagnostic tes ts and medications. Patients have a right to consent or decline their participation in medical education (including the presence of student s or other observers during treatment or examination) or to take part in research. \"Observers\" (including students) are defined as individuals additional to the normal medical team an d personnel immediately involved in a patient's acute or on-going care. Patients must not be included in research without their written informed consent. Additional information regarding informed consent for research studies is provided by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Campbell University or the IRB of record for affiliated clinical sites. T he Campbell University IRB may be found at: https://cphs.campbell.edu/centers-programs/institutional-review - board/?centers-and-programs/ institutional-review-board/ Procedure General Principles Informed consent is the process whereby an individual who has t he capacity/competence to consent to a medical evaluation and treatment, having been given suffi cient information, arrives at a reasoned decision as to whether or not to agree to a pr oposed therapy or procedure. Consent may be given verbally or in writing so long as the deta ils that are discussed are appropriately documented. Consent must be given in writing if: o The patient will be under general anesthesia; o There is a significant risk of adverse effects on the patient; o The procedure is experimental; o The patient is to particip ate in any research study; o The procedure is to be undertak en in the operating room setting ; o When either party requests it; or o As required by specific health care system/fac ility policies. Informed Consent is not only th e act of completing documentatio n, but rather a process of exchange of informa tion so that an informed decisi on can be made by the patient (or their leg al surrogate) or research part icipant. The patient has the right to be accurately and adequately infor med about any proposed procedure or treatment and to subsequently agree or re fuse to proceed with the procedure or treatment discussed. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 48 All health professionals have a responsibility to inform patien ts about proposed procedures and treatments and to obtain informed conse nt to procedures and treatment plans. Due to the potential lack of fam iliarity of treatment details, potential adverse outcomes, and alternatives to treatment, medical students are N OT permitted to obtain informed written consent for diagnostic studies, trea tment, or procedures being performed by ot her physicians or health care p roviders. In the event of a discrepancy between the CUSOM policy and the pol icy of the teaching site, this CUSOM policy supersedes the teaching site w here written consent obtained by a stu dent is concerned. Generally, informed consent must be obtained for each treatment o r procedure proposed (e.g., anesth esia and surgery are separate p rocedures). There are, however, situations where consent for each individua l treatment or procedure would be inappropri ate. (See below section regard ing Composite Procedures). Consent in Emergency Situations o Consent may not be available in emergencies when the capacity t o consent is impai red or absent. o Key features of an emergency include a medical condition of ext reme urgency, which, if left untreated, may result in serious conseq uences including significant morbidity or mortality. o In these situations, health car e providers may operate under th e principle of implied consent, which is founded on the notion that reasona ble persons would consent to treatment in such emergency circumstan ces. o When providing treatment in the situation of implied consent, t reatment provided should generally be limit ed to that which is necessary t o stabilize and treat th e emergent condition. o After the emergency has been stabilized, and the patient has th e capacity to consent, the patient must be p rovided information regarding any treatment or procedures that we re utilized in their care. Information that Should be Provi ded When Obtaining Informed Consent The higher the probability of risk, or the greater the magnitud e of harm associated with a treatment plan or procedure, the more care an d detail is required when providing the patie nt information. Every patient has the right to receive: o An explanation of their condition; o An explanation of the treatment options available, including an y alternatives, and an assessment of the expected risks, side eff ects, benefits, and costs of each option; o Advice as to the estimated time w ithin which the services will or should be provided; o Any other information required by legal, professional, ethical, and other relevant standards; o The results of any diagnostic tests; o The results and outcomes of procedures; and/or 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 49 o An explanation of any complications that may occur during a pro cedure or treatment. Every patient has the right to receive honest and accurate answ ers to questions relating to diagnostic and treatment services, includ ing: o The identity and the qualificatio ns of the provider(s) who will b e rendering care; o The recommendation of the provider(s); o How to obtain an opinion from another provider; and o The results of research related to the procedure. Every patient has the right to receive, on request, a written s ummary of information provided. Patient Right to Refuse Treatment It should be made clear to the patient or research study participant that they have the right to refuse or w ithdraw from any treatment without fear of recrimination or penalty. Advance Directives Every patient may use an advance d directive to consent to or refuse a health care treatment or procedure. An advanced directive is the pati ent's instructions to consent to or to refuse treatment, given at a t ime when the patient was competent, for use when they are subsequently of di minished competency. An advanced directive must be written and notarized to be consi dered a legal document. There may be language in the advanced directive that specifies the healthcare power of attorney's ability to ch ange the content in select cir cumstances, or that specifies the content of the advanced directive is not to be altered in any event. Composite Procedures Composite Procedures, or interdependent treatments, are those w here the treatments are routine and necessarily interdependent, for exam ple, administration of general anest hetic, endotracheal intubation a nd the insertion of intra-vascular line s accompanying major surgical p rocedures (but not the surgery itself). In such cases, all the component procedures should be clearly described to th e patient as an integral part of the treatment for which they are consenting. Appropriate further action may be consented to by a patient in the event of potential pathology being confirme d during the procedure for wh ich they actually consented. o For example, the surgeon may proceed to a more extensive operat ion following a biopsy that is confirmed as malignancy during froze n section analysis. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 50 o The patient should be informed as to the possible nature of the additional surgery, and the consequences of non-consent; for example, the need for further surgery. o If the patient is unable to make an informed decision without a confirmed diagnosis, consent to a composite procedure should not be sough t. Composite procedures should never be used to imply prior consen t to treatment or procedures, which are not routinely used in the tr eatment for which the patient has consented, and/or are unproven in the sit uation, even in an emergency. In the event unforeseen pathology is discovered during the procedure for which the patient actually cons ented, the physician should not perform a definitive procedure for that pathology during that procedure. It is preferable that the new diagnosis be considered separately and separate co nsent to treatment gained from the patient. Laws Concerning Procedures without Consent Provisions for overriding the individual's right to decide whet her or not to consent to treatment, including s ome procedures, exist in limit ed circumstances in cases where that right is seen to work against the public good. The following are examples: o A patient may be urgently sedated, by injection if necessary, without their consent when the medical practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe it is necessary to maintain that person's or another person's s afety. o In the instance of tuberculosis, North Carolina law permits quarantine or isolation under certain circumstances as set forth in North Carolina General Statute Sec. 130A-145. o Coroners have the ability to req uire post-mortem exams, which t he deceased's family has no right to refuse. o The court has the ability to appoint a welfare guardian to make decisions on behalf of a person who lacks capacity to make or communicate decisions about any particular aspect or aspects of that person 's personal care and welfare - including med ical and surgical procedures. o The use of \"such force as may be reasonably necessary\" is allow ed in the circumstance to prevent the com mission of suicide, or of an off ense likely to cause immediate and serious i njury to the person or property o f anyone. This includes the application of chemical or physical restraint without consent in the circumstan ces specified in the section. Informed Consent of Minors Consent to treat patients under th e age of 18 years must be obt ained from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), except in cases when the patien t has been declared a legally emancipated minor. In order for parents to provide informed consent, they must be provided all the information nor mally required to obtain consent from an adult. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 51 In addition to obtaining parental consent, information should, where practical, be given to the minor in a way that the minor can understand and, where possible, the child's agreement should also be sought. E ven when children are not capable of givi ng informed consent, their asse nt to interventions is still ethically important if it is development ally appropriate. Some state laws may allow minors to consent to specific services such as care for pregnancy and sexually t ransmitted infections. Studen ts, physicians, and other healthcare p roviders must be familiar with the state laws in which they are practicing and know how to reference them when require d. Reference to the state laws where the student is rotating is re commended. The presumption of parental decision making provides that paren ts, after being provided with all information needed to make an informed decision, have the right to refuse treatments, procedures, and testing fo r their child even when it is recommende d by the treating physician. However, courts have ruled that parents do not have absolute po wer to refuse care for their children. For example, when parents cannot be p ersuaded to accept life-saving therapy that has few side effects, such as a ntibiotics for bacterial meningitis in a previously healthy child, physicians may ask the courts to override parental decisions. Blood and Blood Products In the case in which treatment would include the administration of blood or blood products, the patient must receive adequate information r egarding the reasons for the transfusion, the risks, the anticipated benefit s, and potential adverse sequelae. In addition, they must receive the same info rmation regarding potential outcomes of not proceeding with a transfusi on. In circumstances where the patient cannot give informed consent (e.g., under anesthesia) blood products may be given if deemed to be in the patient's best interest, unless there is clear knowledge that the patient woul d not agree. As a general rule, when consent is being obtained for anesthesi a, consent would also be obtained for the use of blood products if, in the particular circumstances, there is a significant risk (1% or more) of thes e products being required. When blood or blood products are refused by an adult for any re ason (e.g., religious beliefs), this decision must be respected, ensuring t hat those making the decision fully understand the implications this may have on the clinical outcome. Consent for Photography, Video, or Audio Recordings Making a recording of any patient without obtaining written informed consent is not permitted. For t he purposes of this policy, \"Recording\" refers to still photography and vi deo and audio recordings. Clinical Case Recordings - The r ecordings must be used purely for patient management and must be included as part of the patient's confid ential medical record and protected acco rding to HIPAA requirements. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 52 In the case of a patient who is incapable of consenting persona lly, consent must be obtained from that patient's surrogate/representative. No patient who has declined conse nt may be incl uded in a record ing. Where staff or relatives are to be included in the recordings, their written consent must also be obtained. Where recordings are to be used for reproduction in a journal or textbook, inclusion in a display presentation or any other form of public ation, or distributed or transmitted by el ectronic or digital media, writ ten consent detailing the use of material is required. Recordings are to be identified by the patient's hospital numbe r or other tracking number, rather than by use of the patient's name. The re shall be no information on any recording which specifically identifies the patient by name. Recording for Research or Educational Purposes A consent to be recorded for r esearch or educational purposes i s ineffective and invalid unless it is given following a disclosure of all th e relevant information surrounding th e recording, including: o Who is to make the recording; o Why the recording is being made; o The audience for whom it is to be made and used; and o How, and for how long, the recording will be stored. These matters must be specifie d in the written consent obtained . The patient must not be subject to any pressure to give consent. No recordings may be used for any purpose other than the purpos e or purposes specified in th e consents obtained. Ethical Guidelines for the Involvement of Patients in Clinical Teaching and Research Any research involving patients mu st have appropriate mechanism s in place for identifying patients and gaining informed consent from each involved person. A healthcare provider CANNOT giv e participation consent on beha lf of a group of individual patients. Individual consent must be obtai ned in all instances. In the partnership between patient, teaching and research staff , and student, the paramount consideration must always be the welfare and inte rests of the patient. These guidelines apply to all teaching staff, other qualified s taff, and students working in all settings where pat ient/student interactions are organized primarily for teachi ng and research purposes. The quality of patient care is the responsibility of the clinic al team. Students participating in aspects of the clinical treatment are supervis ed by their clinical team and supported by the teaching staff. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 53 Physical examination or specific procedures undertaken by stude nts must not be repeated unreasonably on any one patient and must not produc e or prolong any distress, embarrassment, or pain. Students involved in research ac tivities must have received aut horization to participate and do so under superv ision of the teaching staff. Campbell University IRB Policies and Procedures governing research safety, regulation compliance, scienti fic quality, and ethical standard s are found at: https://www.campbell.edu/about/lead ership/provost/institutional -review- board/for-investigators/ policies-procedures/ Campbell University IRB Policies research are found at: https://www.campbell.edu/about/lead ership/provost/institutional -review- board/for-investigator s/student-research/ Medical Education Consent Every patient has the right to decide whether they wish to agre e to an interview, examinati on or other specific pr ocedure carried out by a student. Every patient has the right to withdraw from a teaching session or research project at any stage and must receive a clear prior assurance t hat refusal to participate in teaching and research or withdrawing from teaching and research will not jeopardize their car e in any way. Students must seek the agreement of patients to be interviewed and examined, or to be the subject of specific learning procedures, and must explain clearly w hat is involved. Written consent must be obtained from the patient by the treati ng physician or health care provider for a stu dent to undertake any procedur e or examination to be performed by them while the patient is under general anesthesia or sedation. The patient's verbal consent must be obtained for learners to o bserve procedures in surgical suites if they are part of the care givi ng team. The consent should be obtained before pre-medicatio n is given. Patients have the right to know the name and professional statu s of any person who wishes to interview them for teaching or research pu rposes and/or examine them, or to carry out specific treatment or inve stigation procedures. Clinical educators must ask a patient's permission to involve h im or her in group teaching or clinical demonstr ation sessions and explain p recisely what will be involved and how many students will be present. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 54 Consequences of Non-Compliance Instances of potential non-comp liance with the Informed Consent Policy are of serious concern and any allega tion of such will be investiga ted and adjudicated according to the process delineated in the CUSOM DO Academic Bulletin. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievanc e, CUSOM will require that all real and standardized patient interaction s with the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation conclusion. As outlined in the CU SOM DO Academic Bulle tin, the APPS Committ ee is responsible for the review of situations involving academic mis conduct or violations of CUSOM's Honor Code, Code of Conduct, or Professio nalism standards. 7.12 Chaperoned Phys ical Exam Policy The purpose of this policy is to define the need for, and usage of, chaperones in patient care, simulation, and te aching environments of Campbell University and its affiliated sites. Patient/learner trust cannot be maintained without a basic unde rstanding of the limits and responsibilities of the profe ssional's role. The valued hu man experience of the physician-patient relationship is damaged when there is either confusion regarding professional roles and behavior o r clear lack of integrity that allows sexual exploitation and harm. Sexual impropriety may comprise behavior, gestures, or expressi ons that are seductive, sexually suggestive, d isrespectful of patient privac y, or sexually demeaning to a patient, that may include, but are not limited t o: Neglecting to employ appropriate disrobing or draping practices respecting the patient's privacy or deliberatel y watching a patient dress or u ndress; Subjecting a patient to an intimate examination in the presence of medical students or other parties without the patient's informed consen t or in the event such informed cons ent has been withdrawn; Examination or touching of genit al mucosal areas without the use of gloves; Inappropriate comments about or to the patient, including but not limited to, making sexual comments about a patient's body or underclothing, making sexualized or sexually demeanin g comments or \"jokes\" to a patie nt or in the patient's presence, or to any others outside of the presence of the patient, criticizing the patient's sexual orientation, or making comment s about potential sexual performanc e during an examination; Using the physician-patient relationship to solicit a date or r omantic relationship; Initiation by the physician of conversation regarding the sexua l problems, preferences, or fantasies of the physician; Performing an intimate examination or consultation without clin ical justification; 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 55 Performing an intimate examinat ion or consultation without expl aining to the patient the need for such examination or consultation even when the examination or consultation is pertinent to the issue of sexual function or dysfunction; and/or Requesting details of sexual history or sexual likes or dislike s when not clinically indicated for the t ype of examination or consultatio n. Chaperone Policy Medical students at any level of training are held to the same ethical standards as established by the medical profession. Efforts to provide a comfortable and considerate atmosphere for the patient and the learner are part of respecti ng patients' dignity. These ef forts may include, but are not limited to, providi ng appropriate gowns, private facilities for undressing, sensitive use of drap ing, and clearly explaining va rious components of the physical examination. Having chaperones present during the physical exam can also hel p prevent misunderstandings between patient and learner or health care provider. CUSOM students and faculty must comply with the following requi rements: 1. Adhere to a policy that patients are free to request a chape rone during the medical encounter and ensure that the policy is clearly communicated to patients. 2. Always honor a patient's re quest to have a chaperone. 3. Never perform invasive or sens itive exams such as breast, pe lvic, rectal, and genitourinary exams without the presence of an authorized chaperone. 4. Have an authorized member of the health care team serve as a chaperone. Physicians should establish clea r expectations that chaperones will uphold professional standards of privacy and confidentiality. 5. Use a chaperone even when a pa tient's trusted companion or f amily member is present. 6. Provide opportunity for private conversation with the patien t without the chaperone present. Physicians should minimize inquiries or history taking of a sensitive nature during a chaperoned examination. 7. Have chaperones available regardless of the physician's gend er. 8. Inform the patient that an appropriate staff member can act as a chaperone if required and where possible this will be a staff m ember of the same gender as the patient. 9. Respect that the patient has th e right, at all times, to dec line a particular person as chaperone. 10. Utilize the learning or simulation environment in a manner consistent with respecting patient privacy. 11. Utilize same gender models for sensitive physical exam demonstrations whenever possible (cardiac exam, s acral exam, et c.). 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 56 12. Perform Osteopathic Manual Manipulation (OMM) only on subje cts or patients who are adequately cl othed to cover all sensitive a reas. 13. Not perform OMM as an internal or invasive procedure. 14. Respect the right of a patien t participating in an educatio nal activity (such as, but not limited to OM M lab, ultrasound lab, clinical skills) to refuse any component of the physical exam. 15. Respect the right of a child volunteer in the OMM or Clinic al Skills lab to refuse any component of a physical exam, even if approval to perform the exam has been given by the pa rent. Children participating in OMM or Clinical Skills labs must never be forcefully subjected to a ny physical exam, even if the exam is not c onsidered sensitive in nature. Family members or friends of the patient should not be expected to undertake any formal chaperone role. There is a risk of inadvertent brea ches of confidentiality and embarrassment if friends or relatives are c haperones, and they are best avoided unless there is no alternative than postp oning an immediately necessary physical examination. There is also the possibility of collusion between the patient and friend/relative/caregiver to conspire where any complaint of abuse is made. Medical students must not conduct any intimate examination unsu pervised even if the patient provides permission for them to proceed with the examination without a chaperone. Medical students cannot act as a chaperone to their clinical pa rtner (another medical student) or another heal th care provider for intimate e xaminations. It is important that students seek verbal consent from patients for any form of examination. For intimate examinations, informed consent is pa rticularly important. Intimate examinations include the following: Vaginal examination; Rectal examination; External genitalia examination; Breast examination; or Any other examination that might embarrass patients through t he removal of clothes, particularly those examinations that might expose e xternal genitalia or breasts. Chaperone Procedures Communicate the chaperone protocol to patients by prominent not ice through conversation with the patient. In addition, all health care providers and students must adhere to th e following principles: Honor all requests for a chaperone. Utilize private facilities for undressing, incorporate sensit ive use of draping, and provide clear exp lanations on the various componen ts of the physical examination to be performed. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 57 The nature of the procedure/ex amination should be explained. The purpose of the procedure/examination should be clearly stat ed (e.g., \"it is to help me learn how to...\"). There should be an explanation, where relevant, of what will happen to the information collected (e.g., \"I will record my findings in the medical notes...\"). The patient's understandi ng and acceptance of the procedure/examination should be assessed and d ocumented. Utilize chaperones on a consistent basis, particularly for inti mate examinations and those that may be construed as such regardless o f physician or learner's gender. When a chaperone is present, k eep patient inquiries of a sens itive nature to a minimum. Provide a separat e opportunity for a private conversation between the patient and the physician, in order to protect the patient's personal health information (PHI). Provide an authorized health professional to serve as the cha perone whenever possible. During a rectal/vaginal examination, surgical gloves must be worn. Gloves act as a barrier and thus help to maintain the clinical nature of the exam. Throughout the examination the healthcare professional must r emain alert to verbal and non-verbal indications of distress from the p a t ie n t. Any request for the examination to be discontinued should be re spected and documented in the pa tient's records. Any discussion during the examination should be kept relevant avoiding any unnecessary personal comments regardless of whethe r a chaperone is present. A person who is feeling embarrassed or v ulnerable is more likely to misinterpret a comment. Document in the patient note or chart the presence of a chaperone with any intimate examination or those that may be co nstrued as such . The American Academy of Pediatri cs (AAP) offers the following a dditional guidance on the use of chaperones for chil dren and adolescents. In the medical office settin g, the physical examination of an infant, toddler, or child should always be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian is unavailable or the parent's presen ce will interfere with the physical examination, such as in a possible case of abuse or parental mental health issues, a chaperone should be p resent during the physical examination. Consequences of non-compliance Items of potential non-complian ce are of serious concern and will require confirmation via investigation of any allegation. Due to the s ensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and standardize d patient interactions involving the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation conclusion. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 58 As outlined in the CUSOM DO Academic Bulletin, the APPS Committ ee is responsible for the review of situations where students are inv olved in academic misconduct or unprofessional conduct. The CUSOM Honor Code will guide this review. Outcomes of an APPS committee intervention may include, but are not limited to, any of the following levels of discipline: Disciplinary Probation Suspension Withdrawal Dismissal from the program without the option to return Revocation of Degree Violations of patient rights are serious matters and may result in civil and criminal charges. FERPA priva cy laws do not protect violations of a criminal nature. Conclusions regarding fitness to practice and treatment if appr opriate. According to the recommendations made by the Federation of State Medical Boards, Campbell University supports the loss of enrollment int o the school as well as revocation of degree upon confirmed misconduct. 7.13. FERPA Training CUSOM has a policy for the training of CUSOM faculty and staff on adherence to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, 42 USCA 1232g, as amended), and on the regulations surrounding the accurate, confidential, and secure system for official student record keeping.

The physician shall d ivulge information only when required by law or when authorized by the patient. Section 2: The physician shall give a candid account of the pat ient's condition to the patient or to those responsible for the patient's care. Section 3: A physician-patient relationship must be founded on mutual trust, cooperation, and respect. The patient, therefore, must have co mplete freedom to choose her/his physician. The physician must have complete freedom to choose patients whom they will serve. However, the physician should not refuse to accept patients because of the patient's r ace, creed, color, sex, national origin or handicap. In emergencies, a physician should make their services available. Section 4: A physician is never justified in abandoning a patie nt. The physician shall give due notice to a patient or to those responsible for the patient 's care when they withdraw from the case so that another physician may be engaged . Section 5: A physician shall practice in accordance with the bo dy of systematized and scientific knowledge relate d to the healing arts. A physic ian shall maintain competence in such systematized and scientific knowled ge through study and clinical applications. Section 6: The osteopathic medical profession has an obligation to society to maintain its high standards and, therefore, to continuously regulate itself. A substantial part of such regulation is due to the efforts and i nfluence of the recognized local, state and national associations representing the osteopathic medical profession. A physician should maintain membership in and actively support such associations and abide by their rules and regulations. Section 7: Under the law, a physician may advertise, but no phy sician shall advertise or solicit patients directly or indirectly through the use of m atters or activities, which are false or misleading. Section 8: A physician shall not hold forth or indicate possess ion of any degree recognized as the basis for licensure to practice the healing a rts unless they are actually licensed on the basis of that degree in the state in which they practice. A physician shall designate their osteopathic school of practic e in all professional uses of their name. Indications of special ty practice, membership in professional socie ties, and related matters shall be governed by rules promulgated by the American Osteopathic Association. Section 9: A physician should not hesitate to seek consultation whenever they believe it advisable for the care of the patient. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 67 Section 10: In any dispute between or among physicians involvin g ethical or organizational matters, the matter in controversy should first be referred to the appropriate arbitrating bodies of the profession. Section 11: In any dispute between or among physicians regardin g the diagnosis and treatment of a patient, the attending physician has the respons ibility for final decisions, consistent with any applicable osteopathic hos pital rules or regulations. Section 12: Any fee charged by a physician shall compensate the physician for services actually rendered. There shall be no discipline/department of professional fees for referrals of patients. Section 13: A physician shall re spect the law. When necessary a physician shall attempt to help to formulate the law by all proper means in order to impro ve patient care and public health. Section 14: In addition to adheri ng to the foregoing ethical st andards, a physician shall recognize a responsibility t o participate in community ac tivities and services.

CUSOM will ge nerally promote Non- Tenure Track faculty who hold othe r faculty appointments to com mensurate rank as long as the candidate's qualifications are reasonably consisten t with CUSOM criteria for that academic rank. Advancement in rank cannot be guaranteed according to any fixed schedule. Seniority itself cannot be the primary reason for promotion. The specifi c rank criteria listed above apply for promotions as well as initial appointments. The APT committee considers the following items when determinin g whether to recommend a Non-Tenure Track can didate for promotion in academi c rank: The period of service to Campbell University; Understanding and acceptance of, and commitment to, the Mission s and objectives of the University and the School of Osteopathic Medi cine; Quality of performance and quantity of assignments; Evidence of cooperation, positive outlook, and maturity; Evidence of ongoing profe ssional development; Availability to students for advisement and willingness to shar e in their concerns; Involvement and participation in campus, professional, and comm unity activities. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 91 The APT Committee will accept promotion applications for Non-Te nure Track faculty year-round. However, the APT Committee will only address promo tion reviews for Non-Tenure Track faculty twice annually, in May and September. Deadlines for receipt of materials: March 1 for review at the May meeting July 1 for review at t he September meeting The APT Committee, upon receipt of the request and documentation, will review the application and provide a recommendation to the Dean in a timel y manner. The APT Committee Chair will provide the Committee's written recommenda tion to the Dean. APT staff notifies the candidate via email and sends a formal l etter regarding the promotion request upon receipt of the Dean's approval. Promotion of Non-Tenure Track faculty does not require a pproval beyond the Dean. The D ean's decision is final. The Dean will notify the APT Committee of any changes made to t heir recommendations. Termination of Non-Tenure Track Appointment Termination of a faculty appointment may be initiated at the re quest of the faculty member or by CUSOM. Campbell University policy indi cates faculty appointments may b e terminated in the following ways: By the faculty member, through voluntary resignation to take ef fect at the end of any academic year of service, provided notice is given by April 15. Voluntary resignation by the faculty member after April 15 shall be effec tive only upon recommendation by the appropriate Dean and Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost and approval of the President. By the faculty member or the trustees through retirement. By the direction of the President or of the Board of Trustees at any time, a decision may be made to terminate a faculty member or not to renew a fac ulty member's contract for any of the fo llowing reasons, among others: o Academic incompetence or failure to perform the duties of emplo yment. o Violation of academic or administrative regulations and policie s, including but not limited to, behavior tha t violates the Faculty Handbook , this addendum, or the University Perso nnel Manual, or professionally harmful incompatibility with col leagues or students. o Moral turpitude, or the conviction of crime amounting to feloni es or serious misdemeanors. o Serious physical or mental disabi lity of more than six (6) months which prevents the faculty member from performing the essential funct ions of the position and such has been established by competent profess ional judgment. o Significant changes in cu rriculum and/or programs. o Financial exigency as defined by the Board of Trustee Resolutio n presented in the Campbell University Faculty Handbook. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum D - CUSOM 92 Additional potential reasons for termination of Non-Tenure Trac k faculty appointment include: Public disciplinary action by a sta te licensure board or certifying organization.

Law School Vision and Distinctives Campbell Law School is a highly demanding, purposely small, in tensely personal community of faculty and stude nts whose aim, guided by transcen dent values, is to develop lawyers who possess moral convi ction, social co mpassion, and pr ofessional competence and who view the practice of law as a calling to serve others and to create a more just society. The Law School's vision manifes ts itself in the following five distinctives: (1) We have an academic program that is highly demanding . The School of Law provides a lib eral arts lega l education des igned to assist talented students in developing strong moral character, disciplined and creative minds, and superb professional skills for pur poseful lives of leadership a nd service to their communities. We intend that all students think, s peak, and write sensibly, make relevant and valid judgments, discriminate among valu es, and maintain the highest standards o f professional excellence. In short, we seek to produce gradua tes ready to deliver the best p ossible legal services to their clients and communities. To accomplish this goal, our course of instruction is unusual ly rigorous and demanding. Our faculty holds stude nts to the highest expectations in thinking, preparation, and application. Success comes only as students are fully engaged i n learning to analyze the law, construct and evaluate legal ar guments, and resolve legal problems. Our small class sizes help fos ter an intellectual community that is focused and determined, yet personal and supportive. Students have to work hard here, but they develop a sense of community with their professors and classmates, and th ey appreciate the academic demands as they enter the practi ce of law confident that they'r e fully prepared. (2) We bring together the theo retical and practical to produce thoughtful, talented lawyers. Part of Campbell's demanding natu re comes from our conviction that legal education must be a genuinely \"professional\" education, combini ng theoretical inquiry with practical skills. Whether engage d in litigation, transactions, or any other type of practice or public service, a good lawyer must have extensive knowledge and exceptional professional skills. Not only is the Campbell program academ ically challenging, but it also provides students with comprehensive skills tra ining in planning, counseling, neg otiation, legal drafting, trial and appellate advocacy, and alternative forms of dispute resolution. No law school in North Carolina has had greater success in pr eparing its students for the bar examination and few schools in the United States or elsewhere can equal Campbell's effectiveness in providing st udents with practical skills. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 5 ( 3 ) We have a faculty that is profoundly committed to students and teaching . The faculty of the School of L aw is a community of scholars w ho make teaching their priority and are readily accessible to students. They devote substantial time to serving students as mentors, coaches, and professional role models. All faculty have open-door office policies and are willing to consult regularly with students one -to-one. Our professors are deeply committed to the searc h for knowledge through meaningful legal scholarship, but never at the expense of their devotion to the academic success and professio nal development of each student. ( 4 ) We present the practice of law as a way to make a difference by serving others . The School of Law strives to produce highly competent, deeply compassionate lawyers who see the practice of law as a calling to serve other s. We want our graduates not only to be successful but also to liv e unselfishly, considering the needs of others as more important than their own and understanding t hat reconciling differences is as important as winning cases. Particular emphasis therefore is given to practicing the highes t ideals of integrity and civility, seeking transformative justice , promoting reconc iliation, and h elping those who are most in need of our assistance. In this wa y, our graduates can become effect ive advocates for legal and social justice, both in their local com munities and in other parts of the world. ( 5 ) We offer a Christian pers pective on law and justice. Our vision is inspired by a pers pective not typ ically heard a t other law schools. As part of the Campbell University c ommunity, the School of Law shares in the University's purpose and mission to educate students from a Christian perspe ctive in a car ing Christian community. This perspective guid es our professional choices, ac tions, and directions. We believe that laws and lega l institutions are subject to a moral order which transcends human authority and judgment. A centr al premise of t his moral order is that all human beings are created in the ima ge of God and are endowed by God w ith certain natural rights and obligations. These rights and oblig ations are the cornerstone o f true human dignity and must be respected by every political order. We encourage students to examine the relationship between spi ritual and legal issues, to explore the theologi cal foundations for law, to thin k differently about justice and the legal system, and to consider how w e can help achieve a more ju st and merciful society. We intend our faculty and graduates t o engage the larger academic, professional, and social communities as thoughtful persons of conscience and conviction who humbly bring a faith perspective to legal and cultura l issues with the power of skil lful argument and an unfailing commitment to human flourishing. Because we recognize the immeasurable dignity and worth of ev ery person that follow from our creation in t he image of God, w e seek to preserve a congenial academic environment where everyone is treated with kindness, civility, and respect, and students from all faiths or secular moral traditi ons are welcome. While the Schoo l of Law embraces an intellectual 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 6 perspective rooted in Christian tradition, it is committed to f ree and open discussion of ideas and students are under no obligation to e mbrace any particular way of thinking. B. History and Perspective of the Law School I n August 1976, the law sc hool ad mitted its charter class. The decision to establish a law school was made with the firm conviction that it and its graduates would help meet unfulfilled needs. It was believed that Campbell , with its avowed adherence to Biblical principles of morality and Christian ideas of vocation, was particul arly suited to make great contributions to legal education in two ways, one theoretical and the other practical. Theoretically , it was believed that the American legal system, if not all legal systems , has religious and philosophical foundations that are essential to its survival. Basic concepts of individual rights, the dignity and respect due human beings, the value of family life, responsibility for society , and even concern for the environment are essentially theological notions. Legal education should examine these basic premises; our law grew fro m them and cannot be properly understood with out reference to them. The la wyer is sworn to respect and uphold the law, and legal education should offer members of the profess ion the opportunity to weigh and evaluate the presuppositions on which our system of justice is built. Practically , the law school stresses that the practice of law is a vocatio n, a proper activity for one who wishes to make a contribution to society rather than merely make a living. The importance of both the practical and the theoretical is recognized, and emphasis is placed upon their overlap in a program designed to provide a foundation for competent representation of client s in any setting in which one chooses to practice. The law school is structured a round its basic character and g oals. The selection of students and faculty , the size of the school and of individual classes , the design of the curriculum, academic standard s, and accessibility of faculty to students are all determined by these basic consideration s. These considerations make it imperative that the law school be a demanding school . The vocational attitude is incompatible with kindly incompetence. It demands of each student the maximum of effort and technical excellence . Law School faculty serve as role models for students and should be the best of lawyers: conscientiou s, community minded , and a credit to the profession . They must be demanding, but they must demand more of themselves than of their students . We have said that a law school offering a Christian perspective and a caring Christian community has a unique contribution to make to the legal profession. Our Christian perspective informs our character and our calling. Our Christian community affirms the dignity and value of each person and demands that everyone be treated with kindness, civility, and respect. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 7 C.

FACULTY APPOINTMENT , PROMOTION, AND TENURE A. Introduction The general responsibilities of law school faculty include tea ching, scholarship, service and support of the University Mis sion. The distribution of each faculty member's responsibilities regarding teaching, scholarship, and service is determined by t he faculty member in consultation with the Dean. The law faculty sha ll have the primary responsib ility for maintaining the academic vitality of the law school . One of the principal means of exercising this responsibility is to support on-going peer evaluat ions, with special attention to the teaching and professional growth of all faculty. Senior facu lty shall be available for such consultation and assistance in problems of both scholarship and t eaching as the junior faculty may require. The University respects the in tegrity and independence of its individual schools and their accrediting bodies. The University gladly extends great latitud e to its individual schools, while maintaining a broad coordinat ion through such avenues as its faculty committees and administrative operations. Each professor is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of their other academic dut ies; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an unders tanding with the authorities of the institution in advance of the acceptance of employment. Each professor is entitled to freedom in the c lassroom in disc ussing their subject, but the professor should be careful not to introduce into their teachin g controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom becaus e of religious or ot her aims of the institution should be clearly sta ted in writing at the time of the appointment. Each professor is a citizen, a m ember of a learned profession, an officer of in struction of an educational institution. Each professor's primary loyalty is to their institution, profession, and growth and development as a s cholar, a person, and a teacher. E ach professor posse sses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write , subject to speci al obligation s arising from thei r position as an employee of the University; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to indicate that i n their role as a citizen the professor is not an institutional spokesman.

However, the described policies are recognized as a general guide a nd as indications of the various criteria, which will be considered in making a decision regarding promotion. While years of servic e at the University and elsewhere may be taken into account, it is understood that seni ority by itself cannot be the primary reason for promotion to a ny rank. While there may be ex ceptions, it is generally expected for a faculty member t o spend a minimum of five years at the University in a particular rank before seeking promotion. Outstanding performance in the a reas of teaching, scholarship, institutional and community service, and support of the University mission will b e considered in any recommendation for promotion (the weight accorded to each of th ese factors may vary from case to case). Faculty rank distribu tion will be taken into consider ation in the promotion process. Process Preliminary Consideration . At the point of eligibility for consideration, a candidate shall explore with the Dean the concept of readiness for promot ion. Such preliminary consideration shall be exploratory, with specifics in no way binding on either the faculty member or the Dean, or further indivi duals or committees involved in t he process. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 14 Should the faculty member decide to proceed, by September 15, d ocumentation of the candidate's readiness for promot ion must be organized into a do ssier and forwarded to the Chair of the Tenure and Promotion Committee. The contents of the dos sier should include a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, a summary of student evaluations, copies of scholarly works and other creative activities, annual faculty evaluations, and any other supporting materials that the candidate may consider relev ant to conducting a thorough evalua tion. In the cover letter, the candidate should describe their workl oad assignments since appointment or promotion to the p resently held rank. The candid ate should specify the proportions of time allocated for teaching, scholarship, and se rvice. In addition, the candidate should describe their p rofessional activitie s and attainments in relation to the criteria (teaching, scholarship, service, and support of the University mission) fo r promotion. Tenure and Promotion Committee . The members of the Committee shall consider the merits of the candidate with res pect to their teaching, scholar ship, service, support of the University's mission and the rol e of the candidate in light the department's curriculum, mission, personnel, projected needs, and all other relevant departmental concerns. The candidate may request a personal appearance befo re the Committee to present t heir case. The Committee may also request that the candi date appear personally. Following a systematic and ri gorous evaluation, the Committee shall vote by secret ballot on the candidate's application. The vote shall be on whether to recommend the candidate for promotion. Following this vote, the Committee Chair shall write a report of the Committee's action. The report, along with a ny minority reports, shall be forwarded to the Dean and the candidate no later than November 15. The candidate shall have o ne week to respond in writing to the Committee's report of its recommendation. The candidate's r esponse (if any) shall be delivered to the Committee Chair and the Dean. Tenured Faculty . After receipt of the Committee report and the candidate's res ponse (if any), the tenured faculty shall consider that report, the candi date's record, and any and all matters it considers relevant to the candidate's app lication. Such cons iderations may include, but shall not be limited to, the merits of the candidate, th e curriculum and mission of the candidate's department, the candidate's demo nstrated support of the University's purpose, and the overall situation and directi on of the Law School. At its option, the tenured facult y may request the candidate o r other interested party to make a presentation before it or accept the written testimony o f faculty or students. The candidate may also request a pers onal appearance before the ten ured faculty. After discussion, the tenured faculty shall vote by secret ba llot on whether to concur with or dissent from the recommendation of the Committee. The Chair of the Tenure and Promotion Committee shall write a report th at summarizes the vote of the tenured faculty and addresses in detail the rationale for the recommendati on. In the event that the Chair of the Committee disagrees with the m ajority vote of the te nured faculty, the Ch air should designate to another member of the tenured faculty, w ho agrees with the majority, th e responsibility for writing the 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 15 report. Any member of the tenured faculty who cannot support th e majority report shall have the option of writing a minority report that includes the rationale for their dissent . The report, along with any minority reports, shall be forwarded to the Dean and the candidate no later than January 31. The candidate shall have one week to respond in writing to the report of the tenured faculty. The candidate's response (if any) shall be forwarded to the Dea n. Dean .

In making their decisions, the Provost and President shall consider material pr epared by the candidate as well as recommendations from the various review levels. They shall appl y their professi onal judgment in considering the merits of the i ndividual's case, and in determi ning what is in the best interest of the University and its programs. D ecisions of the Board relativ e to promotion will be communicated in writing to the faculty member. The purpose of this policy is st rictly to improve the quality of the educational process at the University. Nothing contai ned in this handbook shall be con strued as creati ng any contractual obligation on the part of the Uni versity to provide evaluations or particular types of evaluation. The alleged failure of the University to complete an evaluation shall not be grounds for an employee to contest a decision of the University not to renew t heir contract or to terminate their employment. E. Tenure Policy Introduction Campbell University operates wit h a tenure system for its facul ty, understanding the granting of tenure to be the highest honor it can bestow on a f aculty member. Tenure is a mutual sign and commitment by which the c ontinuity of the University's educational goals and objectives are assured. It affirms an individual as an image of its mission, and in the act of acceptance, the individual public ly asserts continuing commitme nt to its goals. The underlying 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 16 purpose of granting tenure is t o uphold the concept of academic freedom by assuring the individual faculty member cert ain procedural rights that have t raditionally been assured to members of the profession. Any ful l-time faculty member having the rank of assistant, associate, or professor is eligible to be considered for tenure. Tenure status of an individual f aculty member will become effec tive only after being conferred by the Board of Truste es. Affirmative recommendations for tenure that have been approved by the President will be presented to the Board of Tru stees at its Fa ll meeting. The President, or his designee, sha ll notify in writing the faculty member of the d ecision of the Board. The University recognizes the di stinctive situat ion of the Norm an Adrian Wiggins School of Law and, in the pages which follo w, sets forth the tenure policies specific to the law school. Law School Mission and Tenure Expectations The law school tenure process is a positive one that provides g uidance, requirements and a timeline for assessing a facult y member's progress toward and achievement of tenure. The process is intended to provide specific guidance both to those seeking tenure and to those charged with the responsibilit y of the evalua tion of qualificat ions for tenure. All Campbell Law Faculty members seeking tenure are evaluated i n four interrelated areas: 1. Teaching Effectiveness; 2. Scholarship and scholarly publication; 3. Range and Effectivene ss of Service; and, 4. Support of the University's Mis sion, including expectations of integrity, civility, and collegiality. The foundation of this four-part evaluation system and framewor k for the achievement of tenure rests on each faculty mem ber's commitment to support and contribute to the Vision and Distinctives of Campbell Law. The following is a summary: Vision Campbell Law School is a highly demanding, purposely small, int ensely personal community of faculty and stude nts whose aim, guided by transcen dent values, is to develop lawyers who possess moral convi ction, social co mpassion and professional competence, and who view the practice of law as a calling to serve others and creat e a more just society. Distinctives 1. We have an academic program that is highly demanding. 2. We bring together the theoret ical and practical to produce thou ghtful, talented l a w y e r s . 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 17 3. We have a faculty that is profoundl y committed to students and teaching. 4. We present the practice of law a s a way to make a difference by serving others. 5. We offer a Christian persp ective on law and justice. Teaching Distinctive 3 of the law school Vision and Distin ctives reads: We have a faculty that is profo undly committed to students and teaching. The faculty of the School of Law is a community of scholars who make teaching their priority and are readily accessible to students. They devote su bstantial time to serving students as mentors, coaches, and professional role models. All faculty hav e open-door office policies and are willing to consult regularly with students one-on-one. Our professors are deeply committed to the search for knowledge through meaningful legal scholarshi p, but never at the expense of their devotion to the academic s uccess and professional develop ment of each student. As a consequence of Distinctive 3, the development of substanti al teaching skills and a sincere commitment to students ar e indispensable prerequisites to earning tenure. The law school's mentoring program offers a process by which tenured faculty members observe and critique classroom teaching of untenured faculty members. Other distinctives complete Campbell Law's approach to teaching , requiring an academic program that is highly demanding ; requiring that faculty members bring together the theoretical and practical to train thoughtful, talented lawyers; requiring that faculty members present the practice of law as a way to serve others; and offering a Christ ian perspective on law and justice that encourages students to examine the relationship between sp iritual and legal issues, to think differently about justice and the legal system, and to consider how to achieve a more just and merciful society. Teaching-related qualities constitute a significant factor in t he decision whether to grant tenure and include effectiveness as a classroom teacher; effect iveness in advocacy instruction for those faculty members who are assigned skills courses; and avai lability for, and receptiveness to, meeting and counseling students. B ecause Campbell Law School's approach to legal education requires tenure-track faculty m embers to devote a substantial a mount of professional time fully engaged in teaching-related activities, this factor will be wei ghted accordingly in the tenure decision. Scholarship & Publication A. Introduction With regard to the tenure deci sion, the law school is committed to rewarding its faculty for legal and law-related schol arship and scholarly publication that meaningfully contribute to the improvement of the professi on, the advancement of legal education, and the development of competent, ethical professionals . Because the law school's serious commitment to encouraging 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 18 meaningful legal scholarship a nd scholarly public ation requires a significant investment of a tenure-track faculty member's profe ssional time, an applicant for tenure should expect that this factor will be weighted accord ingly in the tenure decision. B. Publication Standards and Guidelines The Law School \"Publication Def initions,\" set forth below, should be referred to for guidance. An \"article\" must be pub lished in a law journal of an ABA-approved law school or a peer reviewed academic journal. Details regarding publication of a book, hornbook, casebook or treatise are also set forth in t he \"publication d efinitions.\" O ther forms of sc holarly publication will be weighed as such works m ay merit. Tenure track faculty m embers have the responsibility of seeking advice in advance concerning whether other proposed publications will meet the tenure scholarly publication sta ndards and definitions. It is expected that the faculty member's scholarly publication make a meaningful con tribution to the literature on the subject. C. Publication Definitions 1. The term \"scholarly publica tion\" means the publication of a n article or book that meets all of the standa rds and guidelines of this Ten ure Policy. 2. What is considered a \"published\" scholarly publication may include a written acceptance for publicati on of a completed law review ar ticle or book with a scheduled date for publication. 3. Co-Authorship. Only one of the three scholarly publications required for the achievement of tenu re may be co-authored. 4. Self-published materials, photocopied articles and materials, including self-published course books a nd case books, do not qualify as a scholarly publication, but are important in terms of the t eaching mission of the law schoo l. Continuing legal education manuscripts and the pr eparation of text and treatise supplements or pocket- parts alone qualify as evidence of a professor's service to the legal profession but do not qualify as a scholarly publication. Brief articles, condensed v ersions of published law review articles, book reviews, news paper editorials, op-ed articles, general blogging activities, participation on panels at professional meetings, the delivery of papers at professional meetings, the prep aration of statutes and uniform or model acts, the drafting of memoranda and legal briefs, a nd newsletter articles qualify as service to the mission of the law school but do not qualify a s a scholarly publication. Qualification of Publication as a Scholarly Publication. The fo regoing notwithstanding, the Tenured Faculty shall have the authority to determine wheth er any publication meets the tenure policy standard of a scholarly publication. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 19 D. Publication Deadlines. 1. Summary of Scholarship and Publication Requirements and Deadlines a. May 1 of the Third Academic Year of Employment : One scholarly publication published. b. November 30 of the Fifth Academic Year of Employment : A second scholarly publication published. c. November 30 of the Sixth Acade mic Year of Employment: A third scholarly publication published. 2. Failure to Meet Publication Deadlines a. May 1 of the Third Academic Year of Employment: Failure to have a scholarly publication pub lished by this deadline will re sult in the following actions and requirements: i. The faculty member will meet with a member of the Faculty Tenure Committee for advice and counseling concerning the faculty member's publication progress and plans. ii. The faculty member will receive a letter from the dean advising that there is a lack of adequate progress toward tenure in the area of scholarly publication. The letter will include a notice that failure to have a first scholarly publication published by February 1 of the fourth academic year will result in non-renewa l of the faculty member's employment as of the en d of that academic year. iii. A requirement that the faculty member submit to the dean and the chair of the Facult y Tenure Committee by June 1 following the third academic year a satisfactory strategic plan to achieve a timely publica tion of the first scholarly publication no later than Februa ry 1 of the fourth academic year. b. February 1 of the Fourth Academic Year of Employment: Failure to have a first scholarly public ation published b y this deadlin e will result in a non-renewal of emp loyment notice from the dean informing the faculty member that their employment will be terminated as of the end of t hat academic year. Such notice of 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 20 nonrenewal shall be provided to the faculty member by no later than March 1. c. November 30 of the Fifth Ac ademic Year of Employment: Failure to have a second scholarly publication published will result in a written warning from the dean c oncerning the possible long-term consequences of not meeting this deadline. d. November 30 of the Sixth Ac ademic Year of Employment: A failure to have a third sc holarly publication published by this deadline will result in a notice of non-renewal of employment f rom the dean. The notice shall inform the faculty member that their seventh academic year of empl oyment will be that faculty member's final academic year of employment. The faculty member's non-renewal notice will not be amended or rescinded based on publications submitted a fter the November 30 deadline. Such notice of nonrenewal shall be provided to the faculty memb er by no later than March 1 of the sixth academic year of employment. 3. Sabbaticals and Leaves of Absence. Time spent on approved leaves of absence or sabbatical leaves sh all not interrupt the continuity of the faculty member's service for purposes of the six-y ear tenure timeline set forth in this tenure policy and shall not alter any of the requireme nts or deadlines outlined in this policy. 4. The Tenured Faculty shall have the authority to modify or a mend the Publication Deadlines for te nure-track faculty who also have ex tensive administrative responsibilities or when teachi ng over loads [sic] or other cir cumstances materially hinder the faculty member's ab ility to meet the deadlines set o ut above, provided that no modification or amendment may e xtend the overall process for mo re than one year. Service A. Introduction. In Distinctive 4 of the law school's Vision and Distinctives, the practice of law is presented as an opportunity to make a differ ence by serving others and to create a more just society. Facu lty members, therefore, must be personal and professional examples of individuals who suppor t and live this distinctive. Faculty service to humankind, the profession, and the university and law school constitutes a mat erial consideration in each tenure decision. B. Examples of Service. 1. Service to the law school. Service includes support of and attendance at law school and law student event s, an open-door policy at the l aw school, a presence at the law school and law school eve nts, and service as a role mod el, mentor, advisor and fellow member of the law school c ommunity. Active participation on law school and 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 21 University committees, faculty co lloquia, serving as advisors to law student clubs and organizations, coaching student teams, and volunteering as judg es in student competitions, are additional ev idence of law school service. 2. Service to churches and char itable organizations. Service i ncludes volunteer and leadership roles i n the community and at the facu lty member's place of worship. Faculty members, for exa mple, have volunteered at elementary schools, mentored at risk students, ta ught Sunday School, led Bible studies, served as missionaries in other countries, and served on c haritable committees and boa rds. 3. Service on and leadership i n professional organizations. Se rvice relevant to the tenure decision includes service on law reform organizations, and government commissions and committees; activ e involvement in American Bar Association and Association of Ameri can Law Schools; service on state and local bar associations; and other activities displaying a personal \"investment\" in professi onalism and the advancement of a m ore just society. Because the law school's commitment to service would reasonably require a tenure-track faculty member to devote an approp riate amount of his or her professional time in meaningful service-oriented endeavors, an applicant for tenure should expe ct that this factor will be weighted accordingly. Integrity, Civility and Collegiality Distinctive 5 of Campbell Law in forms that we support the Unive rsity's Christian mission and offer a Christian pe rspective on law and justice. T his distinctive includes the goal that the education of students be accomplished i n a caring Chri stian community. Distinctive 5 is also described as guiding our c hoices, actions, and directions and also envisions an academic environment where everyone is treated with kindness, civility, and respect. A faculty member's approach to integrity, civility and collegiality constitutes an important fourth factor to be weighed in all decisions concerning tenure and progress toward tenure. Mentorship A member of the tenured faculty w ill be assigned as a mentor to meet regularly with, advise and guide the tenur e-track faculty member. Annual Meeting of the Tenured Faculty The tenured faculty will meet by November 1 of each academic ye ar to discuss the progress of all tenure-track faculty members, including suggest ions for ways in which progress toward tenure can be positively encouraged and supported, and a reas in which individual faculty members may need advice and sugges tions. At least two weeks pri or to the meeting, the dean will ask untenured faculty members to write a one-page memo sum marizing their progress toward tenure in the areas of t eaching, scholarship, and servic e. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 22 Within three weeks after the meeting of the tenured faculty, mentors will provide feedback to their tenure-track mentees. Three-Year Pre-Tenure Panel Review Within the first two weeks of a tenure track faculty member's t hird academic year in the six-year tenure timetable proce ss, review of the faculty member's progress toward tenure will be initiated, by the dean's appointme nt of a panel of three tenure d colleagues for an evaluation meeting during the fall semester . The faculty member being reviewed will provide material for evaluation by the panel members , including current vita, curren t teaching materials, publication progress, past annual reports, a nd other relevant information. The dean will select three members of the full-time tenured faculty (excluding the faculty member' s mentor) to serve on the evaluation panel. 1. During the first month of the semester, the panel shall meet , review tenure evaluation procedures, and elect a chair. 2. Within eight weeks of the sta rt of the semester, the panel s hall meet with the faculty member. The faculty membe r shall give the panel the req uired materials at least one week in advance of this meeting. The faculty member m ay prepare these materials during the summer and through the first seven weeks o f the fall semester. At that time, the facu lty member shall give the mater ials to the panel. 3. In preparation for the meeti ng between the faculty member an d the panel, each member of the panel shall have ob served at least one class of t he faculty member. The panel shall also review teaching evaluations from all courses taught in the prior academic year. 4. Prior to the end of the fall se mester of the pre-tenure review, the panel shall review all aspects of the facu lty member's performance and prov ide a comprehensive assessment of the faculty member's performance. 5. The following is a general statement of the method that may be used to assemble the comprehensive assessment: a. The panel shall review the faculty member's scholarship and professional activity, including law school and university service, by caref ully examining the faculty member's vita and annual reports giving p articular attention to each of the four int errelated areas of evaluation: teaching; scholarship and scholarly publica tion; service; and integrity, civility and collegiality. b. Observation of teaching. The panel members should focus on t he method of instruction (appropriateness a nd effectivene ss), the clarity and organization of presentation, the level of presentation, the fo rm and extent of student participation, stude nt teaching evaluations, the att itude of the 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 23 professor toward the subject, and evidence of the professor's c ontent mastery, breadth, and depth. c. Examination of instructional materials involves reviewing the required text or texts and other assigned r eadings, the course syllabus, course objectives, out-of-class work assignments, innovations in teaching, use of technology, and examinations. d. An evaluation of the facult y member's overall support of the University's mission, including matters of integ rity, civility, and collegia lity. 6. The panel shall co llectively complete a Tenure Panel Review Report. The report shall include narrative explanati ons of the faculty member's pe rformance, progress toward tenure, and str engths and weaknesses. The panel 's final report shall be submitted to the dean. 7. The dean shall forward a copy of the final Tenure Panel Revi ew Report to the faculty member and each member of the Faculty Tenure Committee. 8. The entire faculty evaluati on process shall be completed wit hin the fall semester in which it was initiated. Application for Tenure 1. If the tenure-track facult y member (the \"candidate\") has complied with all article publication deadlines, the candi date shall receive written noti ce from the dean by December 15 of the fall semester of the sixth academic year that a final pa nel review will be conducted in January of the spring semester in order to determine whether th e candidate should be recommended for tenure. 2. The dean's notice shall reque st the candidate to prepare ma terials, including an update of materials submitted by the candidate during the three -year pre-tenure panel review process, for evaluation by the pa nel members. These materials shall include a current vita, current teaching materials, publi cation summary including copie s of all articles published, all annual reports, the three-year Pre -Tenure Panel Review Report, and other matters deemed relevant by the faculty member. The dean may provide summaries of past annual reports to the panel. All materials shall be submitted by the candidate to th e panel no later than January 15 of the spring semester of that academic year. Failure of the candi date to submit materials to the panel by January 15 of the candidate's sixth academic year will result in a notice of non-renewal of contract from the dean no later than March 1 of the candidate's sixth academic year. 3. The three members of the candidate's faculty evaluation pan el shall be appointed by the dean. At the dean's discre tion, one member of the panel can be appointed who also served on the candidate's three-year f aculty evaluation panel. The pan el members shall elect a chair. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 24 4. The panel shall meet with the faculty member on or before F ebruary 1 of the spring semester. Prior to this meeting, all memb ers of the pane l shall observe a c lass or classes of the candidate and review teaching evaluations from at least two courses taught in the prior academic year. Prior to the end of February of the spring semes ter, the panel shall review all aspects of the faculty member's performance in order to determi ne whether the candidate should be recommended for tenure. 5. The following is a general statement of the criteria that w ill be used to recommend or not recommend the candidate for tenure: a. The candidate's scholarly public ations - to be a ssessed in light of the scholarship and publication stand ards in the tenure policy. b. The candidate's professional ac tivity (including law school, un iversity and other service) - to be assessed by examining the faculty member's vita and annual reports. c. The candidate's teaching effec tiveness - to be assessed by focusing on method of instruction (appropriateness and effectiveness), clar ity and organization of presentation, level of presentation, form and e xtent of student participation, attitude of the professor toward the sub ject, and evidence of the professor's con tent mastery, breadth, and depth. d. Examination of instructional materials - to be assessed by revi ewing the required text or texts and other assigned readings, the course syllabus, course objectives, out-of-class w ork assignments, innovations i n teaching, use of technology, and examinations. e. Integrity, civility, and colle giality - to be assessed by revie wing the candidate's relationship with their colleagues and ability to w ork cooperatively to support the vision and distinctives of Campbel l Law. The strong tradition of academic freed om and individual independenc e of thought is a right of every faculty member and coexists with standards of integrity, civility and collegiality. 6.

Faculty Committees To the extent possible, the busin ess of the faculty shall be c onducted through the utilization of standing committees. The number and subject matt er jurisdiction of such committees shall be determine d by the Dean and/or the faculty. The number of members of each committee, and the faculty members composing each committee, sh all be in the dis cretion of the Dean. Should any item of business not lend itself well to the work o f a standing committee, the Dean may appoint an ad hoc committee to handle such matte r. Upon completing its duties, th e ad hoc committee shall cease to function. The Dean shall assign faculty m embers to various law school co mmittees on an annual basis. Generally the assignmen ts are to be announced in the sum mer months, with jurisdiction to commence on the day on which classes begin in the Fall academic semester and continuing thereafter until the day on which classes begin in the next Fal l academic semester. Each law school committee shall be chaired by a member of the faculty. The announcement of committee as signments shall be accompanied by charges to each committee. Charges shall include specific tasks to be performed by the committees in exercising their responsibilities. The charg es may include specific deadli nes and require deliv ery of reports. C. Faculty Meetings The law school shall hold regul ar meetings as determined by th e Dean. All faculty meetings shall be c onducted according to Robert's R ules of Order, as the same may be amended from time to time.

The presiding officer (or a designee) shall prepare the agenda for all regular meetings and shall distribute it at least tw o business days before the time of the regular meeting. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 30 A simple majority of the law sc hool faculty shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of law school business. Only members of the law school faculty present at a meeting sha ll have the right to vote on matters addressed at faculty meetings. Non-physical attendan ce at faculty voting meetings is permissible only in exceptiona l, good faith situations, and fac ulty members have an obligation to make every effort to attend in pe rson. Therefore, any faculty m ember wishing to attend by telephone or video shall first submit in writing to the dean a request for telephone or video attendance, stating the reason f or not being pers onally present. Within ten days after any f aculty meeting, the Secretary shal l circulate minutes of that meeting to the Dean and the Asso ciate Dean for Academic Affairs for their review and comment. Within three weeks after any faculty meeting, the Secretary or the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs shall circulate minutes of that meeting to the law scho ol faculty. D. Role Model The faculty should be aware tha t students are influenced by the example of their professors and that service as a faculty member provides an eff ective means of projecting the character and ideals of the institution and of the legal profession. To that end, faculty members should strive to meet the highest standards of conduct in their working and private lives and relationships. E. Meeting Classes Each member of the faculty is e xpected to meet classes at the scheduled times and be adequately prepared. Professors are discouraged from postponing classes for personal convenience (excluding illness, f amily emergenci es, or other un expected material events). Professors are expected to reschedule each missed class at a ti me mutually convenient to the professor and the majority of st udents registered in the course . The professor may wish to consult with the Associate Dea n for Academic Affairs to confirm room availability for any make-up sessions. F. Counseling and Advising Counseling and individual atten tion to student needs are an important component of the teaching mission of the law school. Faculty are randomly assigned a s mall number of students as \"ad visees\" each August, just prior to first-year o rientation week. This faculty advisor - st udent advisee relationship remains in place for the duration of the student's legal education (typica lly three years). Each faculty member is expected to meet wit h their group of 1L advisees duri ng orientation week, and thereafter invite their 1L, 2L, and 3L advisees (individually o r collectively) to meet with him or her at least twice during each academic year. Topics of convers ation during these meetings should include graduation requirements, academic progress towar d those graduation 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 31 requirements, and guidance on cour se selection. Recommended tim es for such conversations include the week after the res ults of any 1L midterm are known (for 1L advisees), late January after Fall semester grades are known (all advisees), and the we ek immediately preceding registration for the next academic semester (for 2L and 3L advi sees). G. Research The law school provides opportunities and support for research whenever possible (and subject to budgetary constraint s). Faculty members should make reasonable use of these opportunities by engaging in and com pleting projects of scholar ly research. H. Other Activities Faculty are expected to particip ate in both curricular and co- curricular law school activities; to accept and carry ou t committee assignments; to a ttend graduation exercises of the law school in academic regalia; and, in general, to cooperate f ully with colleagues, staff, and students to the end that each member willingly contributes thei r own potential to the advancement of the educational a nd administrative affairs of th e institution. Faculty may accept and engage in outside activities, including employment. Appropriate outside faculty activities can enr ich professional competence and provide a service to society. Full-time faculty members, howev er, are expected to devote subs tantially all of their working time and efforts primarily to the ir law school duties. The foll owing guidelines should be kept in mind: As a general rule, any outside employment or consultation sho uld contribute affirmatively to the f aculty member's profes sional advancement and correlate with the faculty member's duties to the law school. A primary consideration should be whether outside activities interfere substantially with the faculty m ember's classroom teaching sche dule, scholarship responsibilities, or s ervice expectations. The Dean should be consulted i n advance in those instances wh ere proposed outside activities, such as regul ar outside private practice, part-time teaching elsewhere, or substantial educational undertakings, could have a negative impact upon faculty duties and responsibilities. I. Course Syllabus Requirements A syllabus is a primary instru ment for detailing the content, requirements, and other information pertinent to a cour se. Each faculty member is expec ted to distribute a syllabus no later than the first day of class to each student (and to the A ssociate Dean for A cademic Affairs). The syllabus is not merely a schedule or outline of daily assignments. The syllabus should include a course description or overview and address other important matters, including, without limitation, desired outcomes and a ssessment methods; required m aterials; a daily assignment 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 32 schedule (which should initially include assignments for the fi rst two weeks, but which can evolve as the semester proceeds); policies on attendance (inclu ding tardiness or early departures, and any penalties for excessive absences), recitation (e.g., random, alphabetical by surname, by row, assigned panels, etc.), and i n-class use of laptops and ot her technology; your contact information; method of grading (e.g., attendance, class partici pation and preparedness, papers, projects, quizzes, final exam, etc.); and the following stateme nt: If you believe you need an accommodation in this class for an impairm ent, please contact __________ (Associate Dean for Academic Affairs) or _________ (Director of Academic Support and Bar Success). J. Attendance Policy ABA Standard 308 requires the law school to \"adopt, publish, an d adhere to sound academic standards, including those for regular class attendanc e ....\" Consistent with that standard, each course professor should ado pt and adhere to an attendance policy that requires regular class attendance and permits absences fewer than 20% of the class meetings in the course. Each course professor should clearly publish the attendance policy in the course syllabus. Each professor should retain at tendance records for their courses for no fewer than three years. In the event that a professor fails to publish an attendance po licy for a particular class, the policy for that class shall be t hat no student may miss more than 20% of the class meeting sessions regardless of the reason for the absences. K. Book Awards A professor is not required to de signate a book award recipient for any course. If a professor chooses to designate a recipient, the professor may d esignate only one recipient based on superior course performance. L. Office Hours Each faculty member is expected t o be available to students on a regular basis. Faculty members are expected to be avail able as required to discharge t heir duties in a timely and professional manner. M. Evaluation of Performance Evaluation of faculty performan ce is a form of quality control and a means of faculty development. The major objective of faculty evaluation is to en sure high levels of professional performance in every discipline and to ascertain that faculty m embers are worthy role models for students in a Christian institution of higher education. The De an, and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, are responsible for assisting faculty members in such matters as improving teaching techniques, experimenting with better course materials , and upgrading cre dentials. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 33 Faculty evaluation may take seve ral forms including annual sel f-evaluation via the professional performance report , student evaluations, and other forms approved by the faculty and administration. Normally the Dean and each faculty member (and, if requested b y either party, the Associate Dean for Academic Aff airs) meet for an annual review each April or May. N. Course Evaluation Policy Students will be asked to compl ete an anonymous evaluation of each course and instructor at the conclusion of the course. The Associate Dean for Academi c Affairs, in conjunction with the Office of the Registrar, is re sponsible for designing and admin istering the evaluations and compiling and distributing the re sults. Faculty are encouraged to supplement the standard evaluation form with course-speci fic questions, which can be submitted to the registrar for inclusion in their course evaluations. Evaluations will include objective and open-ended questions and will be administered using web-based evaluation software. In accordance with best practices, the following procedures will be used to administer the evaluations: 1) Students will be sent a link to t he evaluation once the course has met for at least three- quarters of its regularly schedul ed meetings. For courses that end early, faculty must notify the registrar of the last day that their class meets so that th e link to the course evaluation can be sent in a timely basis. 2) The Registrar shall inform facu lty members when the students ha ve received the link to the evaluation. 3) Students will be sent a reminde r and the link to the course eva luations at least twice after the initial email a nd link are sent. 4) All faculty will reserve at least 10 minutes of class time duri ng one of the final one-quarter of regularly scheduled class mee tings where students are encour aged to complete their course evaluation in class. The professor should remind student s to bring their laptops to the classroom for that purpose and must leave the room while students are working on the evaluation. 5) Students will be sent a final reminder and the link to the cour se evaluations 2 days before exams begin. 6) Course evaluations will close the day before the first day of the exam period. No evaluation results will be submitted to faculty until final grades for the semester have been submitted. The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will ma ke the evaluations available to the Dean and instructor before the second week of classes in th e following semester. The Office of the Registrar will retain digital copies of the e valuations for seven years. After seven years, the evaluations will be securely deleted fro m the Registrar's files. Faculty are encouraged to keep their own copi es of their evaluations. 2023 Campbell University Faculty Handbook Addendum E - Law 34 O. Recommended Final Exam Time Limits Full-time and adjunct faculty ma y establish the total time perm itted for students to complete the final examination a dministered within their respec tive courses, subject to the following guidelines. Final examin ations administered within the law school during the regularly scheduled exam period should not exceed a total time that is a multiple of 1.5 times the credit hours earned by students enrolled i n a course. For example, the final examination in a two-hour course should not exceed three hours when administered within t he law school. Any deviation from the time limit stated by this rule should be discussed wit h the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, especially if it would cause the examination to exceed 4.5 hours. Full-time and adjunct faculty who elect to offer take-h ome examinations or examinatio ns not administered within the law school are not time-constrained. Additionally, these guidel ines shall not apply to students receiving additional time as re quired for accommodation purpose s. V.
