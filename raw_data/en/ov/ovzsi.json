Although numerous articles were published in newspapers, magazines, Web sites and other electronic media that conveyed a generally positive role for herbs and other dietary supplement ingredients, coverage in the larger mainstream media outlets tended to be critical and negative in 2009. Usually, when a majority of the major U.S. media outlets cover a topic, it is often a topic that is somewhat negative or focused on product bans or recalls, the proposed need for more regulations of dietary supplements, or some controversy (e.g., adverse reactions). Probably the most high-profile articles were a series published by the Associated Press (AP) in June and July that were characterized by a decidedly critical tone. The series of nine articles was written by AP science writer Marilyn Marchione, who focused on the negative aspects of herbs, dietary supplements and alternative medicine. In one article in this series, the writer coined what appears to be a new term, Big Herba, to refer to large herb and dietary supplement companies whose drive for profits is allegedly greater than their concerns for the health of their customers. High-profile outlets also addressed the recall of the sports supplement Hydroxycut\u00ae as well as Zicam\u00ae, a homeopathic cold-treatment product that was covered in a matter that did not distinguish it from dietary supplements. There were also continuous stories about illegal steroids in dietary supplements as used by professional athletes, and the Senate subcommittee hearing on steroids in supplements at the end of September. Articles on fraudulent marketing methods associated with the sale of the increasingly popular herb-du-jour acai received considerable attention, painting a negative picture to consumers and regulators et al. about acai, even though such credit card fraud marketing schemes could have been associated with the sale of any dietary supplement product. One example of generally positive or neutral coverage in contrast to the negative media in major outlets in the United States might be a few articles dealing with the potential for some herbs to help build immunity and thus, act as a potential prevention strategy for flus, particularly H1N1 (aka swine flu). The San Antonio Express-News and the Denver Post ran stories in which herb experts opined on the potential for herbal supplements to prevent flus. However, few such experts would venture a positive opinion on H1N1 due to lack of adequate scientific or clinical data on this topic, as well as general consensus by industry trade groups that dietary supplements should not be marketed for prevention or treatment of swine or avian flu. Other generally positive coverage included some of the following articles: Forbes carried a cover story titled One Supplement That Works, beginning negatively calling most dietary supplements quack medicine, but summarizing the growing body of impressive literature on the benefits of fish oil. Forbes also ran a story in September about an investigation in Ohio on the harvest of wild American ginseng. Reporting on recent research involving herbs, The Boston Globe ran articles by health writer Judy Foreman with headlines asking whether garlic can prevent the common cold (based on a July systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration) and whether a Chinese herbal medicine could combat endometriosis. \u00b7 U.S. News & World Report ran a positive piece in February, covering animal research on a traditional Chinese formula that might be able to treat allergies to peanuts. Most other positive herbal medicine coverage in U.S. news comes from smaller, lesser-known outlets. These are usually general and report on a specific herb or herbs and their beneficial uses; herbal trends; or on local herbal happenings, such as workshops, acupuncture clinics, botanical gardens, etc. Sometimes statewide or regional newspapers/news orgs run similar stories. Interestingly, the most positive coverage comes from international media outlets in countries such as Africa, Asia and Indiaplaces where herbal and alternative medicines have deeper traditions, and generally more support and usage. These stories tend to focus on positive herbal accomplishments, findings, culture and events. There are also frequent stories from developing countries on the need to regulate the traditional practice of herbal medicine, often citing poorly-trained self-styled traditional healers who appear to be operating scams under the guise of traditional medicine.
