[Myers' Cocktail ](https://www.empowerpharmacy.com/what-is-myers-cocktail)uses vitamins and minerals that have known nutritional benefits and low potential for serious side effects. Patients who receive treatments may experience a sensation of heat, which is likely due to magnesium. Magnesium may also cause lower blood pressure with lightheadedness if administered too rapidly. Some patients, such as those taking digoxin, should avoid treatment. Vitamin C: According to National Cancer Institute: [a growing number of preclinical studies are showing how high-dose vitamin C might benefit cancer patients](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2020/yun-cantley-vitamin-c). In addition to treatment for cancer, we use high dose intravenous Vitamin C to treat a variety of infections as an adjunctive modality. Please inquire about the specifics. Glutathione has been the subject of scientific research for many years. Studies have shown that levels of glutathione directly correspond to the health and function of cells. Glutathione is involved in tissue building and repair, making chemicals and proteins needed in the body, and in [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function) function. Overall, the aging process is associated with changes in the balance of glutathione. As research proves more disease states manifesting glutathione deficiency, glutathione repletion therapy will continue to be a helpful therapeutic strategy. IV glutathione therapy is recommended to Parkinson's patients, other aging problems, alcohol use disorder, liver disease, heart disease, and many other conditions. Glutathione supplementation is relatively safe, caution is taken for people with sulfite sensitivities and patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments. In the body, [phosphatidylcholine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4821435/) (PC) is found naturally in all cell membranes. and it is a major supplier of choline, which is a precursor to acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter essential to proper muscle, brain and nerve function. Although the body synthesizes its own [choline,](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/choline#supplements) levels of healthy choline in membranes can decline with age, toxic exposures and other chronic ilnesses, and additional supplementation can be necessary. [Phosphatidylcholine ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4821435/)IV therapy can benefit patients with liver damage, high cholesterol, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, poor memory, autoimmune conditions, mold and other environmental toxicity, chest pain, anxiety, as well as brain injury from stroke or trauma. In addition to the above listed infusions we provide other individualized formulas including [Mistletoe injection therapy](https://misletoe) for cancer patients. We also work closely with several practices across the country to provide continuity infusions during patients' travels. If your physician prescribed a specific nutritional IV formula, we may be able to provide it for you. Please contact us directly at 202-833-5055 if you have questions. "}
