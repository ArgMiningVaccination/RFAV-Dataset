This bundle supports the body's natural detoxification process while replenishing the nutrients your immune system needs to function properly. 1. Activated charcoal has been used for thousands of years. Today's scientific studies prove charcoal to be the #1 supplement for general systemic detoxification, known for its ability to bind to toxins and safely assist the body in flushing them out. The majority of hospitals across the world administer activated charcoal to poison victims as a first-line remedy. Cymbiotika's Activated Coconut Charcoal is not just for emergency situations, taken daily; it assists in longevity and nutritional support, helping you thrive in an overly toxic environment. Perfect to take while traveling, eating out, during consumption of alcoholic beverages or at times of overindulgence. It can also be used daily to reduce common symptoms of an imbalanced, over-acidic body. Helpful for many gastrointestinal issues, Candida overgrowth, exposure to mold, radiation, poisons, pesticides, or pharmaceutical residues. 2. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that plays a key role in immune system function, collagen production, and healthy aging. Synergy C is Non-GMO L-Ascorbic acid, derived from fermented tapioca. To create the perfect synergy, we added bamboo silica, one of nature's most beautifying minerals required for collagen production, normal cell function, and strong connective tissue. Synergy C, Micelle Liposomal Vitamin C delivery system is a revolutionary breakthrough in vitamin c supplementation. Nano sized Micelles, encased and protected in Liposomes, travel through the digestive tract, and make their way into the lower gut, for superior absorption. This increases total bioavailability, comparable to vitamin C I.V. injection. 3. Silver is one of Earth's most precious elements, a trace mineral found in the soil. For thousands of years, silver has been valued for its beneficial health properties. We know silver is not an essential element for biological processes, however, when taken internally and topically in the correct form, silver acts as a potent mineral antibiotic that can neutralize viruses, fungus, yeast, and mold, while supporting friendly bacteria which is critical for a healthy and robust gut microbiome. Standard conventional therapies are designed to kill certain pathogenic bacteria, yet at the same time, they kill healthy bacteria, aka friendly flora. It is well known in the medical community that a healthy gut with healthy bacteria, equals a strong immune system. "}
