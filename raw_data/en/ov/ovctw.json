All rights reserved. According to a national poll conducted by Marist Poll, and sponsored by a coalition of organizations with an interest in natural health, 70% of Americans are more likely to support a congressional candidate that will protect the public's access to dietary supplements. According to a [national poll](http://npainfo.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Marist-Poll-Results.pdf) conducted by Marist Poll, and sponsored by a coalition of organizations with an interest in natural health, 70% of Americans are more likely to support a congressional candidate that will protect the public's access to dietary supplements, as well as other natural products and homeopathic remedies. The coalition of organizations includes the Natural Products Association (NPA; Washington, D.C.), Americans for Homeopathy Choice (Post Falls, ID), The Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH, Edinburg, VA), Citizens for Health (Washington, D.C.), and The American Institute of Homeopathy (Charlottesville, VA). The poll surveyed 1,690 adults between September 27 and 29, 2022 by phone using live interviews, test, or online. Phone and online samples were selected to ensure each region was represented in proportion to its population, then combined and balanced to reflect the 2020 American Consumer Survey 5-year estimates for age, gender, income, and race. Regional adjustments were made to reflect turnout in similar elections. The poll also included results from a subset of registered votes (1,562), and a subset of registered voters with plans to vote in the November election (1,293). Survey participants were asked three questions: \"As the poll indicates, 61% of households use our products daily, and 75% use them at least monthly. The poll also shows overwhelming support for candidates for office who support access to these products. At a time when our industry is under attack at the state and federal level, data points like these demonstrate proposals to require pre-market approval or age restrict products are not mainstream,\" said Daniel Fabricant, Ph.D. president and CEO of the Natural Products Association, in a [press release](https://www.npanational.org/news/new-national-survey-shows-strong-public-support-for-natural-health-options/). \"The survey demonstrates that more and more Americans recognize the importance of dietary supplements and other natural options to maintain and regenerate their health,\" commented Gretchen DuBeau, executive and legal director of ANH. \"We hope Congress will listen to their constituents and support access to and information about these natural health options.\" The latest draft of the FDA user fee reauthorization bill, a piece of must-pass legislation, [excluded](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/mandatory-product-listing-provision-removed-from-fda-user-fee-reauthorization-in-newly-introduced-appropriations-bill) a provision for mandatory product listings for dietary supplements found in [previous drafts](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/senate-help-committee-has-introduced-fdasla-which-includes-provision-for-mandatory-product-listing). Additionally, California's Governor Gavin Newsom [vetoed](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/california-governor-gavin-newsom-vetoes-bill-restricting-access-to-weight-management-dietary-supplements) legislation that would have banned the sale of weight management dietary supplements to minors. To industry advocates involved with this survey, mandatory product listings and age restrictions not only harm businesses but also hurt consumer access. The survey results, the coalition contends, demonstrate that these and similar efforts may in fact alienate voters who trust and rely on dietary supplements and homeopathic products. \"These survey results make it clear that U.S. consumers rely on these natural health products, including homeopathic medicines,\" said Peter Gold from the American Institute of Homeopathy. \"It is also clear that consumers will vote to protect their access.\" Updated on October 26, 2022 at 4:49 PM Eastern time "}
