COQP10 In the age of globalization, the effective use of language ensures the success of any venture or endeavour, including forming alliances and partnerships at the national and international levels. Against this background, the significance of learning languages has increased manifold. Not only do we use language for expressing and exchanging our thoughts and ideas but it also helps us in understanding and appreciating the culture, tradition and customs of other societies. Hence, learning a language in addition to one's own mother tongue provides an informed and nuanced access to the literature, culture and civilization of the country in which the language is rooted. The School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies (SLL&CS) in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was set up with this objective of instilling a spirit of critical engagements with the concerned culture. The School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies (SLL&CS) is not only one of the largest Schools of the university but also is a pioneer and premier institution in the country which offers teaching and research in major foreign languages, literature and culture studies. The School has 12 Centres namely, Centre for Arabic and African Studies, Centre for Chinese and South-East Asian Studies, Centre for English Studies, Centre for French and Francophone Studies, Centre of German Studies, Centre for Indian Languages, Centre for Japanese Studies, Centre for Korean Studies, Centre for Linguistics, Centre for Persian and Central Asian Studies, Centre of Russian Studies and Centre of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Latin American Studies.

Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health The Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health (CSMCH) was established in order to shape and provide academic content to the discipline of public health, making it relevant to the situation in India. It was recognised that the discipline of Preventive and Social Medicine needed a paradigm shift that could only be provided if this Centre was set up outside the confines of a medical college. Over the last five decades, the Centre has acquired vast experience in evolving problem-oriented interdisciplinary academic programmes in public health, in addition to building an active research base. At the same time, efforts have also been made at establishing institutional links with various academic, research, policy-making and non-governmental organisations. Under the overall objective of creating academic programmes for making health services meaningful to the people of the country, the Centre has set out as its objective the task of understanding the health problems and health needs of the Indian people. The endeavour is to understand how health problems are shaped by socio-economic factors and to examine the social structure itself, to delineate the structural constraints that contour the scope of health interventions. The task requires an inter-disciplinary approach involving disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, history, political science, demography, statistics and public administration, apart from the disciplines that are traditionally included in public health. It was for this reason that the Centre was located in the School of Social Sciences. Epidemiology, health service structure, health programme design, health systems research and health policy analysis are important foci for all the programmes. The Centre offers Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) The MPH students are required to undertake three semesters of course work. They are additionally required to conduct a field study during the inter semester breaks and to be completed in the fourth semester. The successful completion of the prescribed course work and dissertation/field study will lead to the award of M.P.H. degree. Courses in public health cover areas such as organization of health programmes, epidemiology, nutrition, maternal and child health, communicable diseases, family planning, research methodology, operations research etc. Courses in social sciences cover concepts perspectives and methods relevant for public health within an interdisciplinary perspective. During the second semester students are offered a number of optional courses. They also get an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the current issues in public health through an intensive journal club. All students are exposed to group field work in both urban and rural areas as a part of their course work.

Centre for Philosophy The Centre for Philosophy is one of the premiere places for the philosophical education and research in India. The Centre is driven by the thought that philosophical knowledge is the backbone of our educational process and we must try to inculcate philosophical thinking in every aspect of our modern day life. An engagement with basic philosophical issues and problems strengthens not only our imagination and critical ability as knowledge seekers but also it offers new dimensions to understanding about the world in general. The Centre aims to provide a strong platform for philosophical training and offer opportunities for pursuing cutting edge research in new philosophical areas, over and above the existing ones. The academic programmes of the Centre are intended to provide students with a deeper knowledge and rigorous foundation in the discipline while simultaneously encouraging students to be committed to thinking critically about the problems of our contemporary society. The teaching and research works are designed to educate students to read and engage with original philosophical texts, both classical and modern (Indian and Western), with a high degree of methodological awareness. Through our programmes we allow, inspire, and train our students to delve into the philosophical issues of diverse traditions and multi-disciplinary areas. In short, we provide educational training that helps students to philosophically think about everything that surrounds them in their everyday world of experience. M.A Programme: The MA programme of the Centre focuses on the thorough study of all the major areas of philosophy. The course contents are designed in view of the latest developments in an area. In most of our courses, apart from teaching the basic texts, we also train our students to go through seminal research papers published in major national and international journals in the respective areas of study. An MA student is required to do 16 courses with equal credits. All the courses are lecture-based. Students are expected to attend and participate in each course regularly. An MA project of 4 credits is mandatory for all the MA students where they are expected to write an original philosophical piece under the guidance of a teacher. Students are also encouraged to choose optional courses from other Centres so that they are exposed to interdisciplinarity both in terms of areas of research as well as on methodological approaches. Students' performances are evaluated based on term-paper presentation cum submission and written tests. For more details about the Centre, visit the JNU website : https://www.jnu.ac.in/sss/cp 8.

SCQP09 The School of Arts and Aesthetics offers post-graduate degree courses in the theoretical and critical study of cinema, and the visual and performing arts. It is one of the few places in India where these disciplines are offered in one integrated programme at the Masters level. The M.A. programme offers a specialized focus in each of the three disciplines viz. Cinema Studies, Theatre and Performance Studies, and Art History and Visual Studies. The study of the arts in recent years has been enriched by methods and insights from many fields, such as sociology, anthropology, linguistics, cultural studies, political science, economic history, ecology, semiotics and feminist studies. The School's outlook has been formulated in response to new ways of thinking about culture using a wide array of critical and theoretical approaches. During the course of their studies, students are introduced to a range of research methods that combine archival, ethnographic, theoretical and cultural approaches and are encouraged to create theory-practice interface. The faculty also encourages students to visit museums, exhibitions, and monuments and to attend festivals of theatre, film, dance and music. The school frequently hosts interactive sessions with eminent scholars and practitioners from within the country as well as from overseas. Please bear in mind that SAA does not impart a practice based education in the arts. Our pedagogy is a theoretical and critical one that examines the histories, philosophies and critiques of the mentioned areas. Resource Centre: Over the years the School has also built up a valuable and expanding library and archive of photographs, audio and video recordings. The use of multi media in teaching helps students maintain live contact with performance, visual art and film. Students are encouraged to undertake field trips, learn documentation methods, to curate exhibitions in the art gallery, to organize film festivals on specific themes and observe performance practices. Disciplinary Streams : Cinema Studies courses position the moving image as a force inhabiting a multi-media environment that includes film, television, video, and digital cultures. While film, as a powerful experience of 20th century modernity, continues to be an important scholarly focus, we also see it as a gateway to a broader field of the moving image complex. Our courses are structured to offer students exposure to a wide range of issues such as the sensory experience of moving image technologies; the stylistic and aesthetic dimension of diverse media forms; the political and cultural evaluation of audio-visual representations; and the infrastructures of media production, circulation, and exhibition. Students are encouraged to think conceptually and critically about global media cultures along with a special focus on India. Theatre and Performance Studies offers a diverse spectrum of courses covering the history, theory and practice of theatre, dance, music and performance, both within India and across the world. Introductory courses are offered alongside a wide range of optional courses in music and dance. Covering a vast timeframe from 'living traditions' of rural performances in India and bhakti to the cutting- edge developments in political theatre, gender, globalization, and performance art, the Department is committed to studying theatre and performance both within established traditions of the stage, as well as in relation to the immediacies and contradictions of public culture at national and global levels. Visual Studies : The visual studies courses address \"high\" art forms as well as the larger visual field of popular culture and visual practices. The majority of visual studies courses encourage a critical engagement with aspects of Indian visual culture (including 9.
