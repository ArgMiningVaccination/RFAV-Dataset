Chiropractic has helped millions of people recover from sickness, disease and disability and minimized the use of drugs and surgery in their lives. Chiropractic helps promote health, prevents illness, and alleviates suffering. Chiropractic helps reduce morbidity, increase functional capacity, increase longevity, and reduce health care costs. Chiropractic is a conservative approach to allow the body to heal without the influence of drugs, medicine and surgery. Our main interest is doing what is best for each individual patient. Together with other healthcare professionals, chiropractic care can help patients recover from sickness and disease, while helping patients respond better mainstream medicine. WHAT IS CHIROPRACTIC? Chiropractic literally means \"treatment by hand.\" Chiropractic is an art, science and philosophy of how spinal function and the nervous system affect one's overall health and well being. The nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord with thousands of nerves that branch through the openings between the spine. These nerves feed to different parts of the body, such as organs, muscles and skin. When there is a loss of normal motion between the spine and nerves (often due to subluxations) can affect nerves and surronding tissues which can lead to symptoms you may be experiencing or prevent them from happening. A Doctor of Chiropractic specializes in detecting and correcting the joints that have restrictive range of motion and spinal dysfunction to alleviate the interference so the body can function at its fullest potential. WHAT IS AN ADJUSTMENT? As stated above, the nervous system is protected by the vertebrae. When vertebrae are out of their natural alignment, nerves become stretched or twisted (commonly referred to as a nerve \"pinch\"), and this vital communication system in the body is disrupted. This neurological disturbance is called a subluxation, and it may result in the failure of one or more parts of the body. Instead of treating the symptoms of the disease, adjustments are given to correct the subluxation so that normal body functions may take place. Subluxations can also foster the onset of sickness and disease as the body weakens. Dr. Williams specializes in the detection and correction of subluxations. This is done by gently lining up the vertebrae in their natural position. This process may take weeks or months, depending on the amount of misalignment. As your body heals, the symptoms begin to diminish. "}
