Plastic is out, and safe is in\u2014as in the safest food storage containers, that is. Lately, we've seen a big movement toward more [ sustainable food brands](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-food/sustainable-food-brands/)\u2014which is fantastic!\u2014but we shouldn't lose sight of what our food is stored in either.

The Safest Non-Toxic Food Storage Storage Containers For Food When it comes to cooking, [ Caraway](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/caraway-food-storage-set/) is the master chef in our sustainable kitchen. Their take on safe food storage containers are high-quality glass coated with non-stick ceramic. The lids feature Air Release Technology, ensuring your food is fresh and odorless.

However, because the ceramic coating can be scratched, we're careful to use wood or silicone utensils when scooping from the containers to ensure the coating stays pristine for years. We've also tested them in the freezer, dishwasher, and microwave, and we're happy to announce they perform well in each, but we do follow Caraway's advice to keep the Dot and Dash containers out of the microwave.

We cover the latest in sustainable living, fashion, zero waste, beauty, travel, finance and more... Why Choose The Safest Food Storage Containers? You may wonder, \"Is it really necessary to switch out my old Tupperware?\". Besides getting rid of unsightly pasta sauce stains, switching something more sustainable may benefit more than your cupboard aesthetics. Let's talk about why you shouldn't store food in plastic containers. Hard plastic containers typically contain Bisphenols (like BPA and BPS), while Ziploc bags and softer plastics typically contain phthalates. These toxic chemicals can leach into stored food, making it into the body where they can cause numerous health problems. BPA is [ linked](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/trash-bpa/) to type 1 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and developmental problems\u2014which is why the safest baby food containers should never be plastic. Phthalates are known as [ endocrine disruptors](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/endocrine-disruptors/), meaning they can interfere with normal hormonal function and lead to various health complications, like infertility and cancer. They also lead to high levels of [oxidative stress](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1809291), which is linked to cancer. The body is sensitive to these chemicals, and small amounts can have a major impact. When you store pasta sauce or other leftovers, these harmful chemicals can leach into the food. Leaching can happen under any condition; microwaving and acidic and high-fat foods can increase the number of toxicants that make it into your food. Not to mention, plastic containers contribute to the global plastic waste problem. Many traditional products aren't recyclable or biodegradable, meaning they end up in landfills or pollute sensitive ecosystems with [ dioxins](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/trash-dioxins/), microplastics, and heavy metals. It's critical to select the best food storage container you can to avoid harming yourself, loved ones, and the environment. Which Is The Safest Plastic For Food Containers? Although swapping out your plastic is the safest choice, there are some non-toxic plastic food storage containers available. But some [ types of plastic](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/types-of-plastic/) (like PVC) are far more toxic and less recyclable than others\u2014so which plastics are the safest for food storage containers? - HDPE: High-density polyethylene is a durable, opaque plastic that is widely used for food packaging. It is considered safe for food storage, as it doesn't leach harmful chemicals into the food, even when exposed to high temperatures or acidic foods. HDPE is resistant to impact, chemicals, and UV light. It is commonly used for milk jugs, water bottles, and food storage. - LDPE: Low-density polyethylene is another type of plastic considered safe for food storage. It's flexible, relatively transparent, and used for plastic bags, wraps, and squeeze bottles. Like HDPE, LDPE is also resistant to leaching chemicals into food. It is typically used for packaging foods that don't require high-temperature resistance. When it comes to the safest, best food storage containers, BPA-free and phthalate-free are non-negotiable. However, it's important to handle and use plastic food containers properly as improper use can make safer plastics still toxic. Avoid microwaving plastic containers unless they are labeled as microwave-safe, and do not use them for hot liquids or foods unless specified on the label. Additionally, it's advisable to avoid reusing plastic containers intended for single use, such as disposable water bottles or take-out containers, as they may not be designed for repeated use and could degrade or leach chemicals over time. Ultimately, while HDPE and LDPE are considered safer choices among plastics, exploring alternatives is better choice in the long run\u2014both for you and the planet. So what storage containers are food-safe and planet-safe? How We Chose The Safest Non-Toxic Food Storage Containers If you enter a home goods store or shop online, you'll see countless products labeled as food-safe, BPA-free, or phthalate-free. But are the \"safest\" plastic food storage containers really all that safe? Food-safe plastic containers labeled \"BPA-Free\" may not always be non-toxic. Many products include other kinds of bisphenols, like BPS and BPF, which can be just as harmful. If plastic is a no-go, then what are the safest food storage containers? Glass Glass is one of the best alternatives to the traditional plastic container. Glass is inert, meaning it doesn't leach any chemicals or flavors into leftovers. Not only does this ensure the flavor remains intact, but you also don't have to worry about any hard-to-pronounce baddies entering last night's stir-fry. Glass containers are also non-porous, meaning you won't have any stains or odors from foods. Finally, the safest glass food storage containers, like mason jars, are free of BPA and phthalates, making them non-toxic. Any glass is safe, but borosilicate glass containers have the benefit of being far more durable. Stainless Steel Can you store food in stainless steel? Absolutely! Stainless steel is a safe and hygienic option for storing food. It's non-reactive, meaning it doesn't interact with acidic or high-fat foods. This helps preserve the taste and quality of your items. Stainless steel containers are also durable, resistant to corrosion and staining, and do not leach any harmful chemicals into the food. They are also easy to clean and can be used for both hot and cold food storage. Additionally, stainless steel is recyclable, making it an eco-friendly choice. Silicone If you're looking for the safest plastic food storage containers, may we suggest opting for food-grade silicone instead? While [ silicone is not plastic](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/is-silicone-plastic/), it is a material that's somewhat similar to its lightweight, flexible, and durable properties. In fact, it's MORE of all those than plastic. What's more, it's not petroleum-based, and it's non-toxic, chemically inert, and heat-resistant, making it microwave and oven safe. And if you've ever dropped silicone on the ground, you know how durable it can be. It's reusable, easy to clean, and can create an airtight seal, making it a safer alternative to plastic wraps and bags. Beeswax Wraps [Beeswax wraps](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/beeswax-wraps/) are a reusable and [ compostable](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/what-is-compostable/) alternative to plastic wrap. The material is typically constructed from organic cotton fabric coated in a mixture of beeswax, tree resin, and oil. Beeswax has natural antibacterial properties that help keep food fresh for longer, without exposing them to toxins. Mold the wraps with the warmth of your hands to create a seal directly over food items or containers. Organic Cotton [Organic cotton](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-fashion/why-organic-cotton/) bags provide a safe and environmentally friendly option for storing fruits, vegetables, and dry food items. Because it's organic, it's grown without any synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. This reduces your exposure to harmful substances, making it a safer solution than plastic. The bags also allow your favorite fruits to breathe, reducing moisture build-up and extending the shelf life. Finally, organic cotton storage makes for something that is reusable, washable, and biodegradable at end-of-life, making them a sustainable choice for food storage. Final Thoughts On The Safest Food Storage Containers We know what it's like to get off work, throw last night's spaghetti in the microwave, and flip on your favorite Netflix [ zero waste documentary](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-documentary/) to wind down. Unfortunately, the wrong container may be adding to your stress instead of making your life easier. Swapping to non-toxic storage containers for food reduces your exposure to harmful chemicals that cause health complications like cancer, infertility, and cardiovascular disease. Traditional Tupperware and Ziploc-style bags also contribute to plastic waste, ending up in landfills and sensitive ecosystems. But you may not need to refit your entire cupboard. The key to a [ zero waste kitchen](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/zero-waste/zero-waste-kitchen/) is using what you have where you can. Repurposing old glass mason jars can be a quick way to up your sustainability game. Slowly switching to stainless steel, silicone, or organic cotton is another way to make a positive impact on your health and the environment. While purging all your plastic, look into some alternative uses for [ old Tupperware](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-to-do-with-old-tupperware/) that don't involve immediately chucking them in the landfill.
