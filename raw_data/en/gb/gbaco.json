When smudging a space, you burn plant material. The smoke fills and purifies the environment. As the smoke ascends, our wishes and intentions rise and mingle into the universe, connecting heaven, earth and humanity. Smoke offerings are found in many traditions such as Buddhism, Native American and other spiritual religions. The smoke ceremony creates transformation and blesses a space and the inhabitants. How To Smudge When Smudging make sure you open the windows and/or doors in the house. Start from the front. Walk and smudge the air while saying your prayer, chanting your spell, or just affirming your intentions. Enter and exit every room, still praying. You can walk out the back door to end this smudge or circle back to the front and end it. Either way, you have to walk the smudge outside your home to end the smudge. Very simple. Just step outside and get some fresh air while you finish your prayer. Put the smoke out and store for next time. I would suggest smudging with sage and following up with Palo Santo to put positive energy into the space that was just cleansed. _________________________________________________________________________ About this item - COMPLETE BEGINNER'S SMUDGE KIT is perfect for cleansing rituals, blessing, spiritual ceremonies, and for banishing negative energy in homes, offices, yoga studios, and more.
