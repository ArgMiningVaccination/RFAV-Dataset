Breathing is vital to our survival, and most of us take it for granted. However, only someone who has asthma may appreciate the actual value of this basic life-sustaining process. Fortunately, certain home remedies for asthma can offer much-needed relief. Asthma is a life-threatening condition that should be taken seriously. Breathing issues can lead to bronchitis and asthma, among other things. However, using specific natural home remedies may significantly reduce the frequency of asthma attacks. You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that some staple items on your kitchen shelves can help you avoid asthma episodes. Before we get into the home cures, let's go through some asthma basics. Scroll down. In This Article What Is Asthma? When the airways get inflamed, they become narrower and very sensitive, causing a long-term lung disease called asthma. Even the minutest irritant can trigger asthma as the airways are already inflamed. Also, excess mucus is produced, which may further constrict your airways and cause difficulty in breathing, wheezing, and also a tightness in the chest ( [1](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma)). According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma), asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. It is estimated that asthma affected 262 million people and caused 455 000 deaths in 2019. Types Of Asthma Asthma can develop due to different reasons and under different conditions. The various types of asthma, as classified by doctors, are listed below: - Allergic Asthma - Allergens in the environment can cause allergic rhinitis. When this leads to asthma, it is called allergic asthma ( [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282434496_Allergic_asthma_and_rhinitis_comorbidity)). - Exercise-induced Asthma - When physical exertion leads to asthma, it is called exercise-induced asthma ( [3](https://www.scielo.br/j/rbme/a/fTPdZYxhVsbRZfrvd3yQy4w/?lang=en&format=pdf)). The airways begin to constrict usually between 5 to 20 minutes after starting the exercise. - Cough-variant Asthma - With coughing as the main symptom, this type of asthma affects the airways and may cause inflammation ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182093/)). - Occupational Asthma - When the asthma is triggered only in your work surroundings and caused by an irritant or sensitizer, it is called occupational asthma ( [5](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/DWCPropRegs/2020/MTUS-Evidence-Based-Updates-June-2020/ACOEM-Occupational-Asthma.pdf)). Animal breeders, farmers, hairdressers, and woodworkers are some of the common professionals who develop this type of asthma. - Nocturnal Asthma - Symptoms of asthma are aggravated during the night and can turn out to be very dangerous ( [6](https://apjai-journal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6_AP-231020-0986-1.pdf)). What Causes Asthma? There are many factors that can trigger and cause asthma. These include: - Respiratory infections - Allergens like fur, mold, pollen, dust, etc. - Medicines such as aspirin or similar drugs - Irritants like pollution particles, chemicals in the environment, certain sprays, cigarette smoke, etc. - Physical activity - Certain chemicals in food (for example, sulfites) ( [3](https://www.scielo.br/j/rbme/a/fTPdZYxhVsbRZfrvd3yQy4w/?lang=en&format=pdf)) Signs And Symptoms Of Asthma The signs and symptoms of asthma are: - Coughing that gets worse in the night - Wheezing - Tightness in the chest - Difficulty breathing The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person ( [3](https://www.scielo.br/j/rbme/a/fTPdZYxhVsbRZfrvd3yQy4w/?lang=en&format=pdf)).

How Often You Should Do This Repeat this thrice a day for 10-14 days. If there is no improvement in the symptoms, double the dosage. Why This Works Turmeric contains curcumin as one of its main components. This phytochemical is very beneficial as an add-on therapy to relieve asthma. It modulates the inflammatory response of the body and alleviates the inflammation of the airways. Turmeric is also an excellent antimicrobial agent ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190737/)). 4. Coffee For Asthma You Will Need A cup of hot coffee What You Have To Do Brew a hot, steaming cup of your favorite coffee and drink it.

Many swear by the positive effects of drinking coffee and recommend it as the quickest antidote for asthma. Caffeine in the coffee acts as a bronchodilatori [X]A type of drug that widens the bronchi and opens airways in the lungs to minimize asthmatic symptoms. and opens up the constricted airways ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7053252/)). 5. Vitamins For Asthma You Will Need - Vitamin D supplements - Vitamin C supplements What You Have To Do Take a tablet of each of these vitamin supplements every day. How Often You Should Do This Continue taking these supplements for a month. If there is still no difference, please consult your doctor. Why This Works Vitamin D supplementation has shown effective results in alleviating asthma symptoms. This is because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to enhance the body's innate antimicrobial response ( [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23069123/)). Even though sufficient data could not be collected to know if vitamin C helps in treating bronchial asthma, it did help in alleviating exercise-induced asthma symptoms. It was shown to improve the functioning of the lungs ( [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24154977/)). 6. Ginger For Asthma You Will Need - 1 teaspoon grated ginger - A cup of hot water - 1/2 teaspoon honey What You Have To Do - Grate fresh ginger and add it to the hot water.

And if you are, using them will only prove to be counter-productive in treating the asthma symptoms. If you are still doubtful, consult your doctor before using the remedy. What Exercises Control Asthma? Just because you have asthma, it does not mean that you cannot lead an active life. Exercising daily, doing yoga, or going for walks and swims will help you keep asthma attacks at bay. Cardio workouts like walking, cycling, or light running will keep your body fluids flowing and prevent excess mucus build-up in the airways. - Breathing Exercises Try doing these breathing exercises to keep your asthma under control: - Simple breathing - This is also known as diaphragmatic breathing. Lie down or sit with your back straight. Breathe in and out slowly. Your stomach should expand during inhalation, and not your chest. While exhaling, your stomach should contract. - Buteyko breathing - Sit in an upright position with the chest and belly muscles relaxed. Take a long shallow breath and exhale slowly. Hold your breath for as long as possible. Then, continue breathing gently. - Pursed lip breathing - While in the simple breathing position, exhale through pursed lips like you are blowing a whistle. Exhaling should ideally be twice as long as inhaling. These exercises can also be called chest exercises as they involve your chest muscles. Remember to not overexert yourself and your lungs while doing any type of exercise. - Yoga Research shows that yoga does, in fact, improve the symptoms of asthma ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3275836/)). Yoga therapy may significantly improve the severity and duration of asthma attacks. Hath yoga uses breath and meditation to connect the mind with various parts of the body, making them one united functional unit. This may aid in asthma control. A study involving people with chronic severe airway obstruction found that yoga training could significantly improve the symptoms and reduce asthma attacks ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3275836/)). Many studies in India have shown the many benefits of yoga in bronchial asthma management. Another study involving yoga practice showed substantial improvement in asthmatic symptoms within a short duration of 13 days ( [22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9055100/)). A study conducted in Ethiopia showed how yoga improved asthmatic symptoms ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3275836/)). Twenty-four people dealing with asthma took part in the study. For 4 weeks they practiced yoga for 50 minutes everyday. They had decreased asthmatic attacks and used their medications and the puffer less. Their training consisted of: - A warm up with relaxed breathing techniques and stretching exercises for 5 minutes. - A loosening exercise, for 5 minutes, to relax different joints. - Ten minutes of general yoga postures in standing and sitting positions, along with slow breathing techniques. - Ten minutes of deep relaxation practice involving slow breathing to calm the mind and relax muscles. - A slow breathing technique practice that consisted of slow deep breathing without holding your breath, for 10 minutes. - The sessions ended with a 10-minute discussion on emotional well-being, keeping a general positive outlook, and feeling relaxed and free. You can also try [yoga mudras to manage asthma](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/best-yoga-mudras-for-asthma-patients/). There are also some [yoga asanas you can practice](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/baba-ramdev-yoga-asanas-to-treat-asthma/). - Stress Relief Stress and asthma are known to be linked ( [23](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352983235_A_Study_on_Stress_and_Anxiety_in_Relation_to_Asthma)). Not only is stress a symptom of asthma, but it may also cause the issue. People with asthma may struggle with stress, anxiety, depression, and negative emotions. A study conducted in Korea showed that adolescents with asthma had higher stress levels ( [24](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350428429_The_Association_between_Vigorous_Physical_Activity_and_Stress_in_Adolescents_with_Asthma)). It's important to look for stress-relieving outlets to manage asthma. - Consider speaking to a therapist. - Avoid a stress-filled lifestyle. - Practice breathing and stretching exercises. - Talk to a stress management consultant to help balance your schedule, workload, and lifestyle. - Find a relaxing outlet like dancing, rock climbing, walking, a laughing club, etc. Another extremely helpful way to relieve stress and manage asthma attacks is to exercise. - Physical Activity A common misconception is that people with asthma should not exercise as it leads to asthmatic-like symptoms. However, research shows that physical activity can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and manage stress ( [24](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350428429_The_Association_between_Vigorous_Physical_Activity_and_Stress_in_Adolescents_with_Asthma)). In fact, enhanced physical activity improves asthma control ( [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141291/)). But it is very important to know which exercises to practice. To maintain cardiorespiratory fitness, the World Health Organization recommends 150 minutes (two and a half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercises or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercises throughout the week. However, don't overexert yourself or try extreme workouts. There are safe exercises you can try, like resistance and strength training. To make sure you have an idea of which exercises you should perform and the intensity of workouts, speak to a physical trainer (therapist). - Acupuncture Acupuncture is a holistic treatment method that has been a part of traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. It is said to enhance the immune system and relieve congestion caused by phlegm. Acupuncture can inhibit allergic reactions and exhibit anti-asthmatic activity to relieve symptoms ( [26](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2020/01030/acupuncture_on_treating_asthma__a_protocol_for.12.aspx)). Acupuncture works on the theory that there are pressure points that connect the organ meridians in your body. Energy passes through each of these meridians connecting various organs to each other. Acupuncture uses needles to activate these pressure points. For asthma, there are two acupoints to be aware of: the lung meridian and the heart meridian ( [27](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-020-04844-8)). The lung meridian is directly connected to the lungs, while the heart meridian is indirectly connected to the lungs. These two acupoints are the focus of asthma therapy in acupuncture. - Speleotherapy Speleotherapy is a type of therapy where people confine themselves to subterranean or underground places, like mines or caves. They stay there for a short period of time, like an hour, and practice physical and breathing exercises. It originated as salt therapy in the salt mines of Poland, dating back to the 12th century. The name speleotherapy or halotherapy became popular in the 1960s. The miners who were breathing salty air were free from any respiratory conditions due to the high concentration of salt in the mines. The curative properties of this therapy lies in the air quality, underground climate, and radiation levels of these caves and mines ( [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435215/)). Because of the moderate to high levels of humidity, the air in these underground places is pure. There is little to no pollution, dust, gas pollutants, and pollen to cause breathing issues. There are low levels of bacteria. The climate is constant and the air contains minerals like sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and more. However, more research is needed to solidify the role of speleotherapy in asthma management. - Hypnotherapy In hypnotherapy, people are lulled into a trance-ish state where they are more relaxed, focused, and open. In a hypnotherapy study conducted with 20 patients, 11 patients showed an excellent response in asthma management, while 5 showed a good response to the therapy ( [29](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029157.1968.10401994?journalCode=ujhy20)). Similarly, another study suggested that hypnotherapy might be more effective than breathing exercises in men and women ( [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1912142/)). Research also suggests that hypnotherapy might aid in asthma management in adolescents ( [31](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197007082800284)). But not much is known about how exactly hypnotherapy works in the body to reduce asthma attacks. It is said to inhibit inflammation and allergic responses in the airways by relaxing it ( [32](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107688808101207)). However, while hypnotherapy may be a budding remedy for asthma, there still need to be research conducted to learn its neurophysiological and biomedical affects in the body ( [32](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107688808101207)). Goal List For How To Manage Asthma - To better manage your symptoms, you need to track them. Track your symptoms and triggers. This can also help you understand if a treatment is working for you or not. - Take your medications as prescribed, even if you notice an improvement. Only discontinue the course of treatment after consulting your doctor. - There are different types of asthma breathers, puffers or inhalers. Check with your doctor which one better suits your needs. - The use of air purifiers is recommended to reduce the concentration of dust mites and allergens at home ( [33](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34476917/)). Similarly, using humidifiers may combat dry air that affects the airways and respiratory system. - Have an action plan that is decided by your doctor. This plan not only sets your daily treatment in focus, but it also has red flags to look for so you know if your symptoms are worsening and what you can do about them. - Practice any of the above mentioned remedies: yoga, natural treatments, stress relief, exercising, speleotherapy, acupuncture, and hypnotherapy. But first consult your doctor as they can recommend the best option. Another key factor in managing asthma is your diet. There are certain foods you can eat and some you should avoid. Diet To Follow For Asthma The importance of a healthy diet cannot be contested. Incorporate fresh and organic fruits and vegetables in your daily diet and see the difference. Food rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals will ensure healthy functioning of the respiratory system. Some foods that are good for asthmatics are given below: - Fruits - apples, cantaloupes, bananas, kiwi, pineapple, and berries - Vegetables - carrots, garlic, avocado, broccoli sprouts, spinach, sweet potatoes, ginger, tomatoes, kale, and Swiss chard - Juices - make a healthy concoction by using any of the fruits and vegetables listed above. - Including probiotics like yogurt and cheese can aid in asthma relief due to their anti-inflammatory properties( [34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012369211601931)). Steer clear of junk food and fried fatty food that can act as a trigger for an asthma attack. Consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with reduced asthma symptoms ( [35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338947/)). List Of Foods That Trigger Asthma Foods that are allergens around the world are found to be responsible for triggering an asthma attack. The common ones are listed below: - Soy and its products - Milk and milk products - Peanuts and other nuts - Fish, shrimp, and other shellfish - Wheat - Gluten - Eggs Food additives such as MSG (Monosodium glutamate) can also trigger asthma.
