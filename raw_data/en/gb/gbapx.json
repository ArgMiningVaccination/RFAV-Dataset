Cupping stimulates the flow of Qi and blood within the superficial muscle layers. In this therapy the acupuncturist or massage therapist will place small to large glass \"cups\" over specific areas on the body. A vacuum is created under the cup using heat and suction. They are then moved over a specific area or left in place. Treatment takes about 20 minutes. This technique may cause bruising and redness, the desired result indicating superficial muscle layers have released deep tension to the surface. Treat cellulite, too! The suction and technique can increase the blood flow to increase circulation to break up the adipose tissue. This suction and sliding of cups feels like a deep tissue massage, and can cause bruising and redness. The bruise should dissipate to show smoother looking skin.
