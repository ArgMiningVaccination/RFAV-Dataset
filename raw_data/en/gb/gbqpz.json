Turmeric Turmeric is an orange root from the ginger family originally grown in tropical South Asia. The active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin; thus, the names can be interchangeable. This natural supplement is a natural anti-inflammatory and has successfully reduced acute inflammation. Other studies have shown that turmeric has benefits against depression, a common symptom for patients with Fibromyalgia. Turmeric is jam-packed with nutrients like the following. - Vitamin C - Potassium - Vitamin B6 - Iron - Manganese - Omega-3 fatty acids - Dietary fiber It's unlikely that taking turmeric supplements will result in serious side effects. However, if taken in excess (~8 grams a day), turmeric can cause dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, or an upset stomach. Some of the best turmeric supplements are from brands like BioSchwartz, Pomona Wellness, and Garden of Life. Most turmeric supplements recommend taking three capsules daily, preferably with food. However, some supplements recommend taking one pill in the morning or evening. Turmeric supplements cost between $10 to $30 for a bottle of capsules. Something to keep in mind about turmeric is that it becomes more bioavailable when ingested with black pepper. Many supplements include black pepper in their turmeric capsules. However, if you're using raw or powdered turmeric for a homemade supplement, include black pepper in your recipe to improve its effectiveness. 2. Ginger Ginger is one of the best natural supplements for joint pain. Like turmeric, ginger is a root from tropical South Asia with many antioxidants and vitamins. This spicy and delicious joint supplement is a common ingredient in food and herbal teas. Ginger may reduce chemicals in the body that cause joint pain. How? Ginger helps the body produce salicylic acid, preventing your nerves from producing lipids that cause inflammation. Ginger has the following nutrients. - Vitamin B3 - Potassium - Vitamin B6 - Iron - Zinc - Folate - Vitamin C - Riboflavin - Niacin - Magnesium - Phosphorus There is no recommended maximum dose for ginger supplements. However, if taken in excess (~4 grams per day), ginger may cause gastrointestinal problems. Most ginger supplements recommend taking two capsules a day with food. Nature's Way, Puritan's Pride, and Nat+Well offer some of the best options for ginger supplements for knee pain. A bottle of ginger supplements typically costs between $10 to $30. However, fresh or powdered ginger is an inexpensive alternative to capsules. 3. Glucosamine Glucosamine is a naturally occurring amino sugar that makes up cartilage, the cushion around your joints. The cartilage wears down as you age, contributing to joint pain. Although the body produces glucosamine, supplements help improve cartilage health and offset cartilage degeneration. Most glucosamine supplements recommend taking three capsules daily at mealtimes. When taking the recommended dose, glucosamine is considered safe and potentially beneficial for pain reduction in those with joint pain. Some side effects of glucosamine supplements include nausea, constipation, heartburn, diarrhea, rashes, or headaches. Check out brands like Thorne, Nature's Bounty, NOW Supplements, and Solar for high-quality glucosamine supplements. Bottles of glucosamine capsules usually cost between $15 to $30. Something to remember about glucosamine is it's not always vegan-friendly and may cause allergic reactions. Glucosamine supplements are typically made from the shells of shellfish or synthesized in a lab. Those with shellfish allergies should take caution to purchase lab-synthesized glucosamine when trying this type of joint pain supplement. Glucosamine is a non-vitamin and non-mineral, so it doesn't have nutritional information like other supplements for joint and knee pain on this list. 4. Fish Oil Fish oil supplements are an option for those asking what to take for joint pain. Fish oil or fish liver oil typically comes in gel capsules or liquid form. Fish oil supplements have many benefits, including reduced joint and knee pain symptoms. This supplement helps with joint pain because fish oil contains Omega-3 fatty acids that help reduce inflammation and promote healthy muscle and cell growth. The daily recommended dose of EPA and DHA fatty acids is ~250 to 500 mg. Women need ~1,100 mg of Omega-3, while men require ~1,600 mg. The most common side effect of fish oil supplements is fishy-tasting burps, but some may experience nausea, heartburn, or diarrhea. Fish oil supplements contain nutrients that support healthy muscles and cell growth, such as the following. - EPA and DHA fatty acids - Omega-3 - Vitamin A - Vitamin D Some of the best brands to buy fish oil supplements from include Nature's Bounty, Nova Lucia, and New Chapter. A bottle of fish oil supplements usually costs between $15 to $45. Something to remember about fish oil is that it is purified in a lab to remove traces of mercury. Therefore, most fish oil supplements are safe for women who are pregnant. Of course, always consult a healthcare practitioner before taking supplements when pregnant. 5. SAMe The human body naturally produces S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe, sometimes SAM-e). However, SAMe supplements help the human body produce more to regulate cell functions, improve joint function, and offer pain relief. Doctor's Best, NOW Supplements, and Jarrow Formulas offer some of the best options for SAMe supplements for joint and knee pain. The recommended daily dose of SAMe differs depending on how you use it. For example, those with osteoarthritis should take between 600 to 1,200 mg per day (spread throughout two or three doses). In comparison, those with Fibromyalgia should take 400 mg twice a day. Consult your doctor beforehand to determine the best dosage of SAMe for you. Some people who use SAMe supplements experience side effects like digestive problems, trouble sleeping, dizziness, anxiety, and sweating. Small bottles of SAMe supplements typically cost between $15 to $30, and larger bottles range between $30 to $60. SAMe not only helps with joint and knee pain, but this supplement also helps regulate hormones. So, SAMe supplements can have mood-boosting effects alongside offering relief from joint pain. 6. Boswellia Boswellia, or Indian frankincense, is a plant native to India commonly used for joint supplements.

Chondroitin Chondroitin is a naturally-occurring molecule in cartilage used for arthritis supplements and joint pain medication. Glucosamine is commonly paired with chondroitin because the two work to slow the process of cartilage degeneration and reduce the symptoms of joint and knee pain. There is no one recommended daily dose of chondroitin supplements for treating joint pain. So, those trying this over-the-counter joint medicine should speak to their physician and follow the instructions on the label. Try brands like NOW Supplements, Tropical Oasis, and Nature's Bounty for the best supplement for joint pain with chondroitin. Typically a bottle of chondroitin capsules costs between $15 to $30. Something to remember about chondroitin is that there is no way to supplement chondroitin from food intake. Those seeking this treatment method for joint pain must purchase chondroitin in a pill or liquid form. Taking chondroitin has no serious side effects, though some possible side effects include stomach pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea. Like glucosamine, chondroitin is a non-vitamin and non-mineral and doesn't have a list of nutritional info. 8.

You can ingest MSM in pill or powdered form or apply it to areas on the skin with joint swelling and redness. 9. Avocado-Soybean Unsaponifiables Avocado-Soybean Unsaponifiables (ASU) is one of the best vitamins for joint pain because of its anti-inflammatory effects. ASU is from avocados and soybean oils, which have high amounts of Vitamin E, a powerful anti-inflammatory.

The recommended dose of ASU for Osteoarthritis is 300 mg per day. Discover some of the best ASU supplements for bones and joints with brands like AvaSun, Cosamin DS, and Arthrocen. ASU supplements usually cost between $15 to $30 per bottle. Something to note about ASU is that it is often used alongside Glucosamine and Chondroitin supplements to boost its effectiveness. However, scientists need more evidence to determine if ASU is safe to use when pregnant. 10.
