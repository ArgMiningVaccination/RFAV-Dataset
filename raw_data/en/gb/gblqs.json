Hilary Crowley is the resident energy healer at a general family medical center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Working alongside surgeons, physicians, nurses, and holistic practitioners, she uses energy medicine modalities and hands-on techniques to facilitate her clients' healing. In this book, Hilary sheds light on questions surrounding energy medicine by sharing stories from cases including cancer battles, suicide attempts, and chronic pain. She shares how to find healing through the good medicines in your own cabinet: things like connection, grace, forgiveness, creativity, and more. In a healthcare system that has become increasingly focused on specialization and treating specific ailments or organs, the concepts of energy medicine and treating the whole patient are, unfortunately, often lost. Hilary aims to revolutionize the conversation about our body and spirit in the healthcare industry by speaking directly to patients and medical providers. Our bodies have the power to heal, and simply need guidance and awareness to access this vital energy for prevention and recovery. Through practical insights, inspiring stories, and thoughtful questions posed to the reader, this book is more than a guide to energy healing; it offers you the key to unlocking your good medicine cabinet and discovering holistic health and wellbeing.

Praise For... \"Hilary Crowley's book is my absolute favorite kind: warm and wise, as entertaining as it is enlightening. I loved getting an insider's view of what energy medicine is and how it's practiced\u2014while receiving its gifts. Each word of this insightful book felt like a healing arrow. Crowley's journey at times brought to mind the work of Caroline Myss and Martha Beck, but the fresh, original voice is all her own. Brava!\" \u2014Alethea Black, author of You've Been So Lucky Already and I Knew You'd Be Lovely \"Assured and powerful, Hilary Crowley's voice in mainstream integrative medicine takes us on an unexpected and exhilarating journey immersed in the world of energy healing. . . . A better guide into this field couldn't be found!\" \u2014Lauren Walker, author of Energy Medicine Yoga and The Energy Medicine Yoga Prescription \"The Power of Energy Medicine is a captivating gift of authenticity and wisdom giving each of us insight into the sacred work of energy healing.
