I was slightly nervous to try the detox because I knew I was going to have to make major adjustments to my eating and drinking habits for the next week. Along with the detox, Dr. Neacsu prescribed me an organic skin care plan that included a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, aloe vera tonic, and a personal blend of essential oils. Day One and Day Two were tough. No coffee, no alcohol, no dairy, no grains, and no starches. I just made shakes from the detox kit and took Alpha Base vitamins with a mineral cofactor supplement twice a day. Plus, I had one meal per day with organic green vegetables and lean organic meat. For my one meal a day, I made a small green salad with a lite vinaigrette on top of grilled organic chicken. As my body started to adapt to the new meal plan, by Day Three through Day Seven, I never felt hungry. On the third day, I started mixing my shakes with 3/4 cup of unsweetened, organic almond milk and 1/4 cup of purified water. They were fabulous and filling. I also added PhytoCore Phytonutrients to my daily routine. My overall experience with the seven-day detox was very positive. By the end of the week, my skin was less red, had a better glow, and felt more hydrated. Plus, I lost my belly bloat, became more conscious of my food and drink choices, had more energy, and even lost a few pounds. I would highly recommend visiting Dr. Neacsu at Medical Creations Integrative Medicine if you suspect you have hormonal imbalances, can't lose weight, have digestive problems, or suffer from fatigue.
