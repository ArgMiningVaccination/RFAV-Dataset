Barnes, M.A., and Barbara Bloom, M.P.A., Division of Health Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics; and Richard L. Nahin, Ph.D., M.P.H., National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health Abstract Objective\u2014This report presents selected estimates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among U.S. adults and children, using data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Trends in adult use were assessed by comparing data from the 2007 and 2002 NHIS. Methods\u2014Estimates were derived from the Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplements and Core components of the 2007 and 2002 NHIS. Estimates were generated and comparisons conducted using the SUDAAN statistical package to account for the complex sample design. Results\u2014In 2007, almost 4 out of 10 adults had used CAM therapy in the past 12 months, with the most commonly used therapies being nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products (17.7%) and deep breathing exercises (12.7%). American Indian or Alaska Native adults (50.3%) and white adults (43.1%) were more likely to use CAM than Asian adults (39.9%) or black adults (25.5%). Results from the 2007 NHIS found that approximately one in nine children (11.8%) used CAM therapy in the past 12 months, with the most commonly used therapies being nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products (3.9%) and chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation (2.8%). Children whose parent used CAM were almost five times as likely (23.9%) to use CAM as children whose parent did not use CAM (5.1%). For both adults and children in 2007, when worry about cost delayed receipt of conventional care, individuals were more likely to use CAM than when the cost of conventional care was not a worry. Between 2002 and 2007 increased use was seen among adults for acupuncture, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, meditation, naturopathy, and yoga. CAM use for head or chest colds showed a marked decrease from 2002 to 2007 (9.5% to 2.0%). Keywords: complementary and alternative medicine c National Health Interview Survey Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) covers a heterogeneous spectrum of ancient to new-age approaches that purport to prevent or treat disease. By definition, CAM practices are not part of conventional medicine because there is insufficient proof that they are safe and effective (1). Complementary interventions are used together with conventional treatments, whereas alternative interventions are used instead of conventional medicine. Generally, persons who choose CAM approaches are seeking ways to improve their health and well-being (2,3) or to relieve symptoms associated with chronic, even terminal, illnesses or the side effects of conventional treatments for them (4,5). Other reasons for choosing to use CAM include having a holistic health philosophy or a transformational experience that changes one's world view and wanting greater control over one's own health (6,7). Many types of CAM practitioners try to treat not only the physical and biochemical manifestations of illness, but also the nutritional, emotional, social, and spiritual context in which the illness arises. The overwhelming majority of patients using CAM U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics Page 2 National Health Statistics Reports n Number 12 n December 10, 2008 approaches do so to complement conventional care rather than as an alternative to conventional care (6,8). According to the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), one-third of adults used some form of CAM (9). Commonly used CAM therapies included nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products; massage; and diet-based therapies (9). CAM was most often used to treat back pain or back problems, head or chest colds, neck pain or neck problems, joint pain or stiffness, and anxiety or depression. Although less prevalent, strong associations were still seen for individuals using CAM approaches to treat or provide symptom relief for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and lung diseases (10,11). CAM use was more prevalent among women, among adults who had higher educational attainment or who engaged in leisure- time physical activity, as well as among adults who had one or more existing health conditions or who made frequent medical visits in the prior year (12,13). This report is based on CAM supplements that were administered as part of the Sample Adult and Sample Child questionnaires of the 2007 NHIS, as well as a supplement that was part of the Sample Adult questionnaire of the 2002 NHIS. Due to expanded questions for adults and the inclusion of questions for children, data from the 2007 NHIS should provide additional detail about CAM use by adults, as well as providing the first national data on CAM use by children aged 0-17 years. In particular, this report examines the relationship of CAM use and demographic and health behaviors among groups not previously studied in detail, including racial and ethnic groups and children. In addition, the report provides an update on who uses CAM and the therapies used by examining changes in adult use between 2002 and 2007. Subsequent reports will examine the costs of CAM use and the reasons individuals choose to use, or not use, CAM. Methods Data source The statistics shown in this report are based on data from the Adult and Child Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplements, the Sample Adult and Sample Child Core, and the Family Core components of the 2007 NHIS, as well as the Adult Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplement, the Sample Adult Core, and the Family Core components of the 2002 NHIS (14). The NHIS is in the field continuously, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. It is a survey of a nationally representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized household population of the United States. Basic health and demographic information are collected on all household members. All adult members of the household who are home at the time of the interview are invited to participate and respond for themselves. Proxy responses are accepted for adults not present at the time of the interview but are mandatory for children. Additional or supplemental information, such as the CAM, is collected on one randomly selected adult aged 18 years or over (the ''sample adult'') and one randomly selected child aged 0-17 years (the ''sample child'') in each family. Information on the sample adult is self-reported except in rare cases when the sample adult is physically or mentally incapable of responding, and information on the sample child is collected from an adult who is knowledgeable about the child's health, usually a parent. The 2007 Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplement included questions on 36 types of CAM therapies used in the United States (Table 1). These therapies included 10 types of provider-based CAM therapies (e.g., acupuncture, chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, traditional healers), as well as 26 other CAM therapies for which the services of a provider are not necessary (e.g., nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products; special diets; movement therapies). A list and descriptions of the 36 CAM therapies included in the 2007 NHIS are found in the ''Technical Notes'' following this report. Using the classification system employed by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the 36 CAM therapies were grouped into five broad categories for analytical purposes: Alternative medical systems; Biologically based therapies; Manipulative and body-based Mind-body therapies; and Energy healing therapies. Following the taxonomy of unconventional health care proposed by Kaptchuk and Eisenberg (15), folk medicine practices (e.g., covering a wart with a penny then burying the penny, treating a cold with chicken soup) and religious (faith) healing (e.g., praying for one's own health, or having others pray for one's health) are not included in the definition of CAM used in this report. Inclusion and development of the 2007 supplement was supported by seven Institutes, Centers, or Offices of the National Institutes of Health: NCCAM; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Office of Dietary Supplements; and Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research. The 2007 NHIS CAM supplement varied in several ways from the 2002 NHIS CAM supplement. In order to more accurately record use of CAM in the United States, the 2007 NHIS expanded the number of CAM therapies to 36 from the 27 used in the 2002 survey; in particular, sections were added on traditional healers (e.g., Curandero, Hierbero, Sobador, etc.) and on movement therapies (e.g., Alexander technique, Feldenkreis method, Trager Psychophysical Integration). The 2007 survey also expanded the number of diseases treated with CAM to 81 from the 73 used in 2002. The section on nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products in 2007 was substantially changed from that used in 2002 in two National Health Statistics Reports n Number 12 n December 10, 2008 Page 3 ways: First, the list of products was expanded from 35 in 2002 to 45 in 2007. Second, the reference period for use of these products was reduced from 12 months in 2002 to 30 days in 2007. Finally, the 2007 survey included questions on the prevalence of CAM use by children and the diseases or conditions being treated. There were several reasons for the above changes. First, after publication of the 2002 NHIS data (9), NCCAM received suggestions from the community for additional therapies to be added. Second, a number of nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products became commonly available after the 2002 CAM supplement was designed. Third, the reference period for nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products was shortened from 12 months to 30 days to be more congruent with other national surveys of dietary supplement use, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Finally, pilot testing of the 2007 CAM supplement led to some questions in the 2002 survey being dropped or subsumed into other questions. Statistical analysis In 2007, NHIS interviews were completed in 29,266 households, which yielded 75,764 persons in 29,915 families and a household response rate of 87.1% This report is based on data from 23,393 completed interviews with sample adults aged 18 years and over and 9,417 completed interviews for sample children aged 0-17 years. The final 2007 sample adult and sample child response rates were 67.8% and 76.5%, respectively. In 2002, NHIS interviews were completed in 36,161 households, which yielded 93,386 persons in 36,831 families and a household response rate of 89.6%. This report is also based on 2002 data from 31,044 completed interviews with sample adults aged 18 years and over. The final 2002 sample adult response rate was 74.3%. Procedures used in calculating response rates are described in detail in Appendix I of the Survey Description Document of the NHIS data files (16). All estimates and associated standard errors shown in this report were generated using SUDAAN, a software package designed to account for a complex sample design such as that of the NHIS (17). All estimates for adults were weighted, using the sample adult record weight, to represent the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 18 years and over. All estimates for children were weighted, using the sample child record weight, to represent the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 0-17 years. In tables shown in this report, estimates with a relative standard error of more than 30% but less than or equal to 50% are identified with an asterisk (*), indicating they are statistically unstable due to small sample size. Estimates with a relative standard error of greater than 50% are indicated with a dagger () and are not shown. Most estimates presented in this report were age adjusted using the projected 2000 U.S. population as the standard population (18,19). Age adjustment was used to allow comparison of various sociodemographic subgroups that have different age distributions (see ''Technical Notes ''). Estimates were compared using two-tailed significance tests at the 0.05 level. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Terms such as greater than and less than indicate a statistically significant difference. Terms such as similar or no difference indicate that the statistics being compared were not significantly different. Lack of comment regarding the difference between any two statistics does not mean that the difference was tested and found to be not significant. Strengths and limitations of the data A major strength of the CAM data in the NHIS is that they were collected for a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults and children, allowing estimation of CAM use for a wide variety of population subgroups. The large sample size also facilitates investigation of the association between CAM and a wide range of other self-reported health characteristics\u2014 included in the NHIS, such as health behaviors, chronic health conditions, injury and poisoning episodes, access to medical care, and health insurance coverage. The sample sizes for both the 2007 and the 2002 NHIS allow for detailed analysis of CAM use among Hispanic subpopulations, but not among subpopulations of Asians and other minority groups with smaller populations. The NHIS questions have several limitations. First, they are dependent on respondents' memory or their willingness to report use accurately. Second, the collection of survey data at a single point in time results in an inability to produce consecutive annual prevalence estimates; and it reduces the ability to produce reliable prevalence estimates for small population subgroups, as this would require a larger sample or more than 1 year of data. Third, CAM use among children might be higher than our results indicate, especially among adolescents who may not reveal their CAM use to parents or other household adults. Finally, there is a difference in the reference periods for use of nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products in 2002 (12 months) and 2007 (30 days). Generally, shorter reference periods result in better recall and better data.

Discussion While the prevalence of many individual therapies was similar between 2002 and 2007, acupuncture, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, meditation, naturopathy, and yoga showed significant increases. The increases for acupuncture, massage therapy, and naturopathy may in part be due to the greater number of states that license these practices and a corresponding increase in the number of licensed practitioners between 2002 and 2007. This same time period has also seen large numbers of articles in the lay press extolling the benefits of these therapies, increasing awareness of them in the general population. Together, increased opportunity and increased awareness may explain much of the observed increase in adult use of CAM. While the use of these therapies has increased from 2002 to 2007, scientific research provided only limited evidence of clinical efficacy for these therapies. For instance, the National Library of Medicine journal database, PubMed, identified 40 systematic reviews involving acupuncture, massage therapy, naturopathy, or yoga published between 2002 and 2007. Of these, only 10 (25%) of the systematic reviews found sufficient evidence to conclude that a given CAM therapy was effective for a given condition: acupuncture and yoga for back pain (20,21), acupuncture for knee pain (including osteoarthritis) (22-24), acupuncture for insomnia (25), and acupuncture for nausea or vomiting (including postoperative, chemotherapy- induced, and pregnancy-induced) (26-29). In addition, a systematic review (30) concluded that both acupuncture and, to a lesser extent, massage therapy should be included among recommended therapies for treating back pain. That review served as the basis for joint clinical practice guidelines released by the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society (31). Three types of special diets (Macrobiotic, Atkins, and Zone) saw significant decreases in use by U.S. adults since 2002, with the Atkins diet seeing the largest change. Interestingly, this decrease occurred despite the completion and publication of two well publicized studies in major medical journals demonstrating the short-term safety and efficacy of the Atkins Diet for weight loss (32,33). It may be that the public was influenced by substantial negative coverage of the Atkins diet in the popular press, as well as continuing physician concerns about the diet (34). Besides the NHIS, the only national survey of CAM use covering the full age range of children was the 1996 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS). The 1996 MEPS included questions on the use of several CAM providers (e.g., acupuncturist, chiropractor, massage therapist, etc.), but did not include questions on the use of nonpractitioner CAM therapies (e.g., dietary supplements, relaxation techniques) (35,36). Because very different definitions of CAM were used in MEPS and the 2007 NHIS, direct comparisons of prevalence cannot be made. However, it is possible to compare relative rank order of selected items in the two surveys. For example, the MEPS (36) rank order (highest to lowest prevalence ) of therapist-based CAM interventions used by children was chiropractic care, massage therapy, acupuncture, and homeopathy and naturopathy combined, while the NHIS order was chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, homeopathy and naturopathy combined, massage therapy, and acupuncture. It is not clear whether these differences reflect changes in the patterns of CAM use over time or differences in survey design. The specific sociodemographic factors found to be associated with a child's use of CAM, differed between the 1996 MEPS and the 2007 NHIS, although both surveys found an association with children who were older, white, had multiple visits with a conventional medical provider, or had a parent who used CAM (35,36). Only MEPS identified female gender as associated with CAM use in children. Only NHIS identified non-Hispanic origin, higher education of the parent, National Health Statistics Reports n Number 12 n December 10, 2008 Page 7 higher income (poverty status), not living in the South, and having a usual place of care as associated with a child's use of CAM. In addition to NHIS and MEPS, there have been several limited population surveys of CAM use by children in the United States (37-39). These surveys have varied considerably from NHIS and MEPS in their data collection methods, geographic distribution, age range, reference period, and the choice of therapies defined as CAM. Thus, direct comparisons of the overall prevalence rate of CAM use or the rates of use of any given CAM therapy from these surveys cannot be made with the NHIS. To our knowledge, the 2007 NHIS is the first national survey of nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural product use by children 0-17 years of age. Many of the same products used most often by adults were used most often by children; three of the four most prevalent nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products used by adults (Echinacea, fish oil or omega 3 or DHA, flaxseed oil or pills), were among the top four products used by children. This is not surprising given that children, especially younger children, are dependent on adults for their health care. Children whose parent used nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products were more than twice as likely as children whose parent did not use them to have used this type of CAM (40). Several of the products used most often by children are generally used for heart health or cancer prevention (e.g., fish oil or flaxseed). However, in the NHIS, more than one-half of these products were not used to treat or prevent the child's specific conditions, suggesting ''wellness'' as a reason for use. More widely used CAM therapies such as chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation; nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products; and massage therapy, as well as lesser used therapies such as the Alexander technique, biofeedback, and energy healing therapies have been studied by various researchers (12). The attention given to specific CAM modalities by the scientific community does not correlate with the prevalence of use by the public as measured by the 2007 NHIS. For example, the Institute of Medicine identified 79 systematic reviews of acupuncture and 38 studies of homeopathy (placing them 3rd and 4th among all CAM therapies), yet NHIS found that less than 1.5% of the adult U.S. public used each of these therapies in a given year. In fact, there is no meaningful correlation between the number of published studies of a CAM therapy and its use by the U.S. public. CAM therapies with relatively infrequent use by the public (e.g., biofeedback, hypnotherapy, acupuncture) are those with the highest level of acceptance and referral by physician groups, including pediatricians (41-43), typifying the inadequate communication between patients and providers concerning CAM issues (8). To improve patient-provider communication, the academic health community (44) and NCCAM (45) have initiated programs to encourage and facilitate such discussions. Conclusions Examination of the data from the 2007 and 2002 NHIS suggests that overall use of CAM in the adult U.S. noninstitutionalized population had held relatively steady. However, over this 5-year period there has been substantial variation in the use of specific CAM therapies. The 2007 NHIS contained a number of questions assessing the reasons individuals chose to use or discontinue use of various CAM therapies. Future analyses of these data may help explain some of the observed variation in the use of individual CAM therapies. The 2007 NHIS provided the first data on a nationally representative sample of children aged 0-17 years. It was found that overall CAM use in children is substantially less than in adults. However, children are more likely to use CAM if a parent or other relative used CAM. While pain conditions have remained the primary health problems for which CAM is used by adults, this is less clear in children. In other regards, the characteristics of adult and child CAM users are similar\u2014for example, education, poverty status, geographic region, the number of health conditions, the number of doctor visits in the last 12 months, and delaying or not receiving conventional care because of cost are all associated with CAM use.

Estimates are age adjusted to the projected 2000 U.S. population as the standard population using three age groups: 25-44 years, 45-64 years, 65 years and over. 9GED is General Education Development high school equivalency diploma. 10Poverty status is based on family income and family size using the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for 2006. ''Poor'' persons are defined as below the poverty threshold. ''Near poor'' persons have incomes of 100% to less than 200% of the poverty threshold. ''Not poor'' persons have incomes that are 200% of the poverty threshold or greater. 11Classification of health insurance coverage is based on a hierarchy of mutually exclusive categories. Persons with more than one type of health insurance were assigned to the first appropriate category in the hierarchy. Persons under age 65 years and those age 65 years and over were classified separately because of the prominence of Medicare coverage in the older population. The category ''Private'' includes persons who had any type of private coverage either alone or in combination with other coverage. For example, for persons age 65 years and over, ''Private'' includes persons with only private or private in combination with Medicare. The category ''Uninsured'' includes persons who had no coverage as well as those who had only Indian Health Service coverage or had only a private plan that paid for one type of service such as accidents or dental care (see Definition of terms for more details). Estimates are age-adjusted to the projected 2000 U.S. population as the standard population using three age groups for persons under age 65 (18-24 years, 25-44 years, and 45-64 years), and two age groups for persons aged 65 years and over (65-74 years and 75 years and over). 12Leisure-time physical activity: ''Never or unable to engage in activity'' includes adults who did not engage in any sessions of light or moderate (causes light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate) or vigorous (causes heavy sweating or a large increase in breathing or heart rate) leisure-time physical activity of at least 10 minutes duration or were unable to perform leisure-time physical activity; ''Some activity but less than regular'' includes adults who engaged in at least one session of light or moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity of at least 10 minutes duration but did not meet the requirement for regular leisure-time physical activity; ''Regular activity'' includes adults who engaged in at least three sessions per week of vigorous leisure-time physical activity lasting at least 20 minutes in duration or at least five sessions per week of light or moderate leisure-time physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes in duration. 13Body weight status was based on Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated using self-reported height and weight. The formula for BMI is kilograms/meters2. ''Underweight'' is defined as a BMI of less than 18.5; ''Healthy weight'' is defined as a BMI of greater than or equal to 18.5 and less than 25; ''Overweight'', is defined as a BMI of greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30; and ''Obese'' is defined as a BMI of greater than or equal to 30. 14Lifetime cigarette smoking status: ''Current smokers'' have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke every day or some days; ''Former smokers'' have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, but currently do not smoke at all; ''Never smokers'' have never smoked at all or smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. 15Lifetime alcohol drinking status: ''Lifetime abstainers'' had less than 12 drinks in their lifetime; ''Former drinkers'' had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime, but none in past year; ''Current light or infrequent drinkers'' had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime and 1 or more drinks in the past year, and drank 3 drinks or fewer per week, on average; ''Current moderate or heavier drinkers'' had 12 or more drinks in their lifetime, drank alcohol in the past year, and drank more than 3 drinks per week, on average. 16Number of health conditions is a count variable of approximately 55 chronic and nonchronic conditions found in the 2007 NHIS. These include conditions of the cardio-pulmonary, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurological, and endocrine systems. NOTES: CAM is complementary and alternative medicine. The denominators for statistics shown exclude persons with unknown CAM information. DATA SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, National Health Interview Survey, 2007.

The denominators for statistics shown exclude persons with unknown CAM information. DATA SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, National Health Interview Survey, 2007. Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. a b Z = 2Sa2 +Sb Page 18 National Health Statistics Reports n Number 12 n December 10, 2008 Technical Notes Sample design The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a cross-sectional household interview survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. Data are collected continuously throughout the year in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The NHIS uses a multistage, clustered sample design to produce national estimates for a variety of health indicators. Information on basic health topics is collected for all household members, if necessary by proxy from one adult family member. Additional information is collected for one randomly selected adult and one randomly selected child in each family. Self-response is required for the Sample Adult questionnaire except in rare cases where sample adults are physically or mentally incapable of responding for themselves. Interviews are conducted in the home using a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), with telephone interviewing permitted for follow-up, if necessary. Starting in 2006, the sample design included Asian persons in the oversampling of minority populations in the NHIS; previously, only households with black and Hispanic persons were oversampled. The sample adult selection process was also revised in 2006 so that when elderly black, Hispanic, or Asian persons aged 65 years or older were present, they had an increased chance of being selected as the sample adult. Response rates In 2007, NHIS interviews were completed in 29,266 households, which yielded 75,764 persons in 29,915 families; the household response rate was 87.1%. The Sample Adult questionnaire was completed by 23,393 persons aged 18 years and over, and the Sample Child questionnaire was completed for 9,417 children. The final response rates (which takes into account household and family nonresponse) for the 2007 sample adult and sample child files were 67.8% and 76.5%, respectively. Procedures used in calculating response rates are described in detail in Appendix I of the Survey Description Document of the NHIS data files (16). Item nonresponse In 2007, item nonresponse for each of the sociodemographic indicators shown in this report was about 3% or less, with the exception of poverty status, which is based on detailed family income as ascertained in the family component of the questionnaire. Item nonresponse for the poverty indicator was 18%. Item nonresponse for the health behavior, health care, conditions, and other health related items was about 5.5% or less. For the 2007 complementary and alternative medicine items, nonresponse ranged from 0.0% to 8.1%, with nonresponse for most items being 3.0% or less. For the 2002 complementary and alternative medicine items, nonresponse ranged from 1.7% to 3.2%. The denominators for statistics shown in the tables exclude persons with unknown complementary and alternative medicine information for a given table. The denominators for statistics shown in Tables 7 and 8 exclude persons with unknown sociodemographic characteristics, health behavior items, and hospitalization during the past year and are not shown separately, but counts for these persons are included in the total. Among the 23,393 interviewed sample adult respondents in the 2007 NHIS, 610 adults were missing data for all the complementary and alternative medicine items. Among the 9,417 sample children in the 2007 NHIS, 108 children were missing data for all the complementary and alternative medicine items. Age adjustment Data shown in this report were age adjusted using the projected 2000 U.S. population provided by the U.S. Census Bureau as the standard population (18,19). Age adjustment was used to allow comparison among various population subgroups that have different age distributions. This is particularly important for demographic characteristics such as race and ethnicity, education, and marital status. It is also helpful for other characteristics. The following age groups were used for age adjustment: 0-4 years, 5-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-24 years, 25-44 years, 45-64 years, and 65 years and over (Table II). Estimates for education and health insurance coverage are restricted to certain age groups and are, therefore, adjusted accordingly. Estimates were calculated using software for statistical analysis of correlated data (SUDAAN) (17). The SUDAAN procedure PROC DESCRIPT was used to produce age-adjusted percents and their standard errors. Tests of significance Statistical tests performed to assess significance of differences in the estimates were two-tailed with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. The test statistic used to determine statistical significance of differences between two percentages was |X-X| where Xa and Xb are the two percentages being compared, and Sa and Sb are the standard errors of those percentages. The critical value used for two-sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance was 1.96. Relative standard error Estimates with a relative standard error of more than 30% but less than or equal to 50% are identified with an asterisk. Estimates with a relative standard error of greater than 50% are indicated with a dagger () and are not shown. The relative standard errors are calculated as follows: Relative standard error (as a percentage) = (SE/Est) 100, where SE is the standard error of the estimate, and Est is the estimate. Definitions of terms Demographic terms Age\u2014The age recorded for each person is the age at his or her last birthday. National Health Statistics Reports n Number 12 n December 10, 2008 Page 19 Education\u2014The categories of education are based on the years of school completed or highest degree obtained. Only years completed in a school that advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, General Educational Development high school equivalency diploma (GED), college, university, or professional degree are included. Education in other schools or home schooling is counted only if the credits are accepted in a regular school system. Health insurance coverage \u2014NHIS respondents were asked about their health insurance coverage at the time of the interview. Respondents reported whether they were covered by private insurance (obtained through the employer or workplace, purchased directly, or through a local or community program), Medicare, Medigap, (supplemental Medicare coverage), Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), Indian Health Service (IHS), military coverage (including VA, TRICARE, or CHAMP-VA), a state-sponsored health plan, another government program, or any single service plans. This information was used to form a health insurance hierarchy that consisted of three mutually exclusive categories. Persons with more than one type of health insurance were assigned to the first appropriate category in the following hierarchy: private coverage, public coverage (includes persons with Medicare, Medigap, Medicaid, SCHIP, military coverage, a state-sponsored health plan, or another government program), and uninsured (also includes persons who are only covered by IHS or only have single service plans). Hispanic or Latino origin \u2014 Hispanic or Latino origin includes persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central and South American, or Spanish origins. Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin may be of any race. Marital status \u2014Respondents were asked to choose a marital status category most appropriate for their marital situation. In some cases, persons reporting their marital status as ''married'' may have been living in common-law marital unions. Alternatively, these individuals could have identified their marital status as ''living with partner.'' Adults who were living with a partner were considered to be members of the same family (as if married) and are categorized as ''cohabiting.'' The distinction between ''married'' and ''living with partner'' was made by the respondent. Poverty status \u2014Poverty status is based on family income and family size using the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds. ''Poor'' persons are defined as those with family incomes below the poverty threshold. ''Near poor'' persons have family incomes of 100% to less than 200% of the poverty threshold, and ''not poor'' persons have family incomes that are 200% of the poverty threshold or greater. Race\u2014The 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) federal guidelines (46) for reporting race require that persons of ''single race'' be distinguished from persons of ''multiple race.'' ''Single race'' refers to persons who indicated only a single race group. Estimates for the smaller subcategories of single race persons and multiple race combinations can only be reported to the extent that the estimates meet the requirements for confidentiality and statistical reliability. In this report, five categories are shown for single race individuals (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). Other subcategories of single race persons and multiple race persons are not shown due to statistical unreliability as measured by the relative standard errors of the estimates. In this report, persons of a given race may be either Hispanic or non-Hispanic. The text in this report uses shorter versions of the new OMB race terms for conciseness and the tables use the complete terms. For example, the category ''black or African American, single race'' in the tables are referred to as ''black'' in the text. Region\u2014In the geographic classification of the U.S. population, states are grouped into four regions used by the U.S. Census Bureau: Region States included Northeast Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; Midwest Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska; South Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas; West Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii. Health behavior terms Lifetime alcohol drinking status Lifetime abstainer \u2014Adults who had fewer than 12 drinks in their entire lifetime. Former drinker \u2014Adults who had 12 drinks or more in their lifetime, but had no drinks in the past year. Current infrequent or light drinker\u2014Adults who had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime and 1-11 drinks in the past year (infrequent) or 3 drinks or fewer per week, on average (light). Current moderate or heavier drinker\u2014Adults who had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime and more than 3 drinks per week up to 14 drinks per week (on average) for men and more than 3 drinks per week up to 7 drinks per week (on average) for women were moderate drinkers. Adults who had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime and more than 14 drinks per week (on average) for men and more than 7 drinks per week (on average) for women were heavier drinkers. Page 20 National Health Statistics Reports n Number 12 n December 10, 2008 Body weight status \u2014Body weight status is based on body mass index (BMI), which is calculated from self-reported height and weight. BMI is calculated as weight divided by height2 using metric units (i.e., kilograms/ meters2). Underweight\u2014Adults with a BMI of less than 18.5. Healthy weight \u2014Adults with a BMI of at least 18.5, but less than 25. Overweight but not obese \u2014Adults with a BMI of at least 25, but less than 30. Obese\u2014Adults with a BMI of 30 or more. Leisure-time physical activity Inactive\u2014Did not engage in any sessions of light or moderate (causes light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate) or vigorous (causes heavy sweating or a large increase in breathing or heart rate) leisure-time physical activity of at least 10 minutes duration or were unable to perform leisure-time physical activity. Some activity but less than regular\u2014Engaging in light or moderate leisure-time physical activities that cause light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and last 10-29 minutes each time or are done less than five times per week, or engaging in vigorous leisure-time physical activities that cause heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate and are done 10-19 minutes each time and/or less than three times per week. Regular activity \u2014Engaging in light or moderate leisure-time physical activities that cause light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and occur five or more times per week for at least 30 minutes each time, and/or engaging in vigorous leisure-time physical activities that cause heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate and occur three or more times per week for at least 20 minutes each time. Lifetime cigarette smoking status Current\u2014Adults who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke cigarettes every day or some days. Former\u2014Adults who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but currently do not smoke at all. Never\u2014Adults who never smoked a cigarette or who smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime. Health care utilization terms Usual place for health care\u2014Usual place of health care was based on a question that asked whether respondents had a place that they usually went to when they were sick or needed advice about their health. These places include a walk-in clinic, doctor's office, clinic, health center, health maintenance organization, hospital emergency room or outpatient clinic, or a military or VA health care facility. Conditions\u2014Condition is a general term that includes any specific illness (physical or mental) or injury. All data in the 2007 Sample Adult component are self-reported, and most questions ask whether a condition was diagnosed by a doctor or a health professional. The reference periods for the conditions vary. There are four basic reference periods: ever, past 12 months, past 30 days, and currently. Number of visits to a doctor in the past 12 months \u2014This is the number of visits to a doctor's office, clinic, or other place that the respondent has made in the past 12 months regarding his or her own personal health. Overnight hospital stays, hospital emergency room visits, home visits and telephone calls are excluded. Overnight hospital stay\u2014An overnight hospital stay is a measure of the number of times a person was hospitalized in the previous 12 months. Visits to a hospital emergency room that did not result in admission to the hospital are not included. Overnight hospital stays for the birth of a child are counted for both the mother and the child. Terms related to complementary and alternative medicine Acupuncture\u2014Acupuncture describes a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical points on the body by a variety of techniques. American practices of acupuncture incorporate medical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. The acupuncture technique that has been most studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles that are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation. Alexander technique \u2014Alexander technique is a movement therapy that uses guidance and education on ways to improve posture and movement. The intent is to teach a person how to use muscles more efficiently in order to improve the overall functioning of the body. Examples of the Alexander technique as CAM are using it to treat low-back pain and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Alternative provider or practitioner\u2014Someone who is knowledgeable about a specific alternative health practice. This person provides care or gives advice about its use, and usually receives payment for his or her services.
