The Bulletin is a monthly compilation of all administrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. The Bulletin publishes the official rulemaking notices and administrative rule text of state agency rulemakings and other official documents as necessary. State agencies are required to provide public notice of rulemaking activity and invite public input. The public receives notice of rulemaking activity through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and the Legal Notice published monthly in local newspapers. The Legal Notice provides reasonable opportunity for public input, either oral or written, which may be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the Notice of Rulemaking published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted in regard to the rule. Comment periods are not provided in temporary or final rule-making activities. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 07-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2007; Bulletin 08-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2008. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 08-1 refers to January 2008; Volume No. 08-2 refers to February 2008; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2008 is cited as Volume 08-1. The December 2007 Bulletin is cited as Volume 07-12. RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the reader with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are only published in the Bulletin and not printed in the Administrative Code. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. TYPES OF RULEMAKINGS PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The state of Idaho administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interest ed parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requ ired, to engage in this rule making activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate\" a rule in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed and/or temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 3 February 4, 2009 - Vol. 09-2PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the substance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format;d) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; e) the manner in which persons may make written co mments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to whom comments on the proposal may be sent; f) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and g) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to the pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date, even when published in conjunction w ith a temporary rule, and therefore, is not enforceable. An agency may vacate a proposed rulemaking if it decides not to proceed beyond the proposed rulemaking step, and stops the formal rulemaking process. TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit; If a rulemaking meets any one or all of the above requir ements, a rule may become effective before it has been submitted to the legislature for review and the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopte d only if the Governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is approved, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution or when the rule has been replaced by a final rule. State law requires that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, should rescind the temporary rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 4 February 4, 2009 - Vol. 09-2PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\". This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule;b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective; d) an identification of any portion of the rule imposing or increasing a fee or charge. Agencies are required to republish the text of the rule wh en substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are re published. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule reviewed by the legislature and not rejected, amended or modified becomes final with no further legislative action. No rule shall become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule wa s submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

The Idaho Administrative Code , is an annual compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable temporary administrative rules and includes a ta ble of contents, reference guides, and a subject index. Individual Rule Chapters and Individual RuleMaking Dockets , are specific portions of the Bulletin and Administrative Code produced on demand. Internet Access - The Administrative Code and Administrative Bulletin are available on the Internet at the following address : http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/ HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering system. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 February 4, 2009 - Vol. 09-2DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially us ing a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series by a hyphen \"-\", ( 38-0501-0801 ). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-0801\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"0801\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rule-making action published in calendar year 2008. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2008 would be designated as \" 0802\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 0802. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITA TIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of this rule.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsection 201.06.c. of this rule.\" The citation may also include the IDAPA, Title, or Chapter number, as number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. \"201\" denotes the main Section number of the rule to which the citation refers. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 February 4, 2009 -

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: In order to meet the Governor's Executive Order 2008-5 to reduce costs, the Department has been working with the Social Security Admini stration (SSA) concerning the State Supple mental Payment (SSP) program which is a state-funded program that provides financ ial aid to the aged, blind, and disabled population in Idaho. The Department is amending these rules for the following changes to allo w the state to remain in compliance with SSA federal regulations: 1. Cap the SSP at a maximum amount of $53 for AABD participants living in an independent living situation; and 2. Align the AABD citizenship rules for SSP with the Social Security Income regulations regarding non-qualified citizen applicants who apply after March 1, 2009. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropri ate because of his Executive Order No. 2008-5. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year. The anticipated fiscal impact fo r this rulemaking is as follows: 1. Capping the State Supplement Payment (SSP) amount at $53 will net a cost savings over a 12- month period of $1,093,920 in state general funds. 2. Based on the number of qualified non-citizen app licants the past year, aligning AABD citizenship rules with SSA regulations for qualified non-citizens will net a cost savings over a 12-month period of $24,080 in state general funds.
