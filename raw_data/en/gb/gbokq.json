It's such a blessing to be able to turn to the pantry, garden or herb stash to help relieve pain and treat minor ailments. Natural cures are convenient and cost effective - you can even use common weeds for herbal medicine. At Common Sense Home, we've built an extensive natural medicine library, sharing what works for our families. REMEMBER - Always see a trained health care provider if symptoms are severe or last an unusually long time. The posts on the site are for information only. I share what works for us and our readers, as well as the latest research. Jump to: Home Remedies Our Natural Health posts are divided into several categories, grouped below.

Beating Candida and Psoriasis In 2015, I was diagnosed with psoriasis, which covered large areas of my body in red, crusty, peeling skin. It was extremely painful, and made me uncomfortable going out in public. (A large area of my face was affected.) When I went to the dermatologist, she basically said, \"Live with it.\" Thankfully, through research and trial and error, I found a solution that worked for me. My skin is now clear and smooth. (No more scaring small children.) I share my story in the following posts and book. WARNING - graphic images. The \"before\" photos were not pretty.

Store fermented foods are great for convenience, but you can save a lot of money if you make your own. Fermenting at home also allows you to experiment with different flavors and food combinations.

It's darn handy to grab the right leaf out of the garden and slap it on a mosquito bite to relieve the itching. I'm partial to wild plants (weeds), since they grow with little care, but I do cultivate a few favorite herbs. Whether you grow your own or purchase quality herbs, it's worthwhile to make herbal medicine a part of your life.
