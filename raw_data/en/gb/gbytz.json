We begin a chiropractic session by going through an initial client assessment with you, looking at how your body's systems are functioning exclusively and collaboratively with one another. After your initial examination, our chiropractor will construct a detailed plan for the type of pain or disorder you are experiencing. Your physical therapy component will be customized according to your lifestyle. We take your daily activities, sports, and repeated movements into consideration when coming up with physical therapy exercises for you to take home. Whether you are an occasional weekend warrior or a professional athlete, we program our physical therapy exercises according to your skill level. We provide you with the tools you need to prevent future pain from reoccurring. Chiropractic adjustments will be provided to eliminate pain and then a treatment plan will be constructed to help you promote healing outside the office. At Calispine, we understand that the real healing occurs when you are able to \"feel\" the dysfunctional movement or poor posture habit that caused your pain. With our approach, we will separate the specific dysfunction, help you become more aware of this area, and then teach you how to correct the motion with repetition. Through this phase you will be progressed from simple exercises all the way to multi-joint movements with resistance. After completing your recommended phases of care, you will be more educated on how to properly move in your body. These tools will prevent injury and keep you injury-free. Do Chiropractic Adjustments Help with Back Pain? Chiropractic adjustments help increase joint mobility through spinal manipulation. These adjustments can relive pain and improve function in patients with acute low back pain. There are many factors that can contribute to back pain, including your posture, movement patterns, sleeping habits, hobbies, and more. Back pain could be coming from a muscle, joint, nerve, or a combination of two or more of these areas. We will get to the root cause of your back pain and determine the best treatment plan for long-term results.
