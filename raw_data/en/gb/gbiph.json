Here are some essential oils and aromatherapy practices you can try for summer. Essentials for Love and Friendship In Traditional Chinese Medicine, summer is associated with the Fire element, the Heart and the emotion of joy. Florals like geranium, jasmine, ylang ylang, lavender and rose can promote feelings of joy and love. Warmer scents such as patchouli, cardamom, and ginger enhance earthiness and sensuality. Consider using a rose mist facial spray during the hot summer months.

Citrus Oils Citrus essential oils like lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit are refreshing and energizing. They can help uplift your mood and create a vibrant atmosphere. You can use these oils in a diffuser, add a few drops to your cold drinks or create DIY room sprays to freshen up your living spaces. Peppermint Peppermint oil has a cooling effect that can be perfect for hot summer days. It can help alleviate headaches and provide a refreshing aroma. You can add a couple of drops to a spray bottle with water and mist it on your face and body for a quick cooling sensation. Lavender While lavender is often associated with relaxation and sleep, it can also help soothe sunburns and skin irritations. Dilute lavender oil in a carrier oil (such as coconut or jojoba oil) and apply it to sun-exposed areas for a calming and healing effect. Eucalyptus Eucalyptus oil has a pleasant, invigorating scent and can help clear your airways and ease breathing during hot and humid days. Use it in a diffuser or add a few drops to a bowl of hot water to create a steam inhalation.

Outdoor Repellents Summertime often means dealing with pesky insects. Consider using essential oils like citronella, lemongrass, or lavender to make natural insect repellents. You can dilute these oils in a carrier oil and apply them to your skin or use them in candles or diffusers on your patio or outdoor space. Aromatherapy for Travel If you're going on a summer vacation or road trip, bring along a travel-sized diffuser or use aromatherapy inhalers with your favorite essential oils. This can help create a familiar and calming environment wherever you go. Remember to always use high-quality, pure essential oils and be mindful of any allergies or sensitivities you may have. Some essential oils can be photosensitive, so avoid direct sun exposure on areas where you've applied them. Always dilute essential oils with a carrier oil before applying them to the skin, especially for children or individuals with sensitive skin. Source: Mojay, Gabriel.
