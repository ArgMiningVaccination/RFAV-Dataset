This is also what motivated me to learn about crystal clusters. Several years ago, my husband, Bob, and I were in Hawaii meeting with a network chiropractor, who wanted to learn how to incorporate gemstones into his practice. He wondered if it was possible to broadcast a gemstone's energies throughout an entire room. His practice involved working with many people at once. Could one gemstone necklace serve them all? Sometimes when a question arises, the answer reveals itself in my knowing\u2014and it may be new to me, too. Other times, I take the question to bed and fall asleep looking for the answer to come in my dream state. Either I awake with an answer, or it comes to me later on. When I met the chiropractor the next day, we broached the subject once again\u2014this time the answer appeared in a vision. In my mind's eye, a Quartz crystal cluster appeared. I saw how its energies radiated out from its many crystal points to the surrounding area. Its energies filled the room and could affect all within it. I suddenly understood how the presence of a crystal cluster could make a room feel lighter. It fills the space with Quartz energy. In my vision, I then saw a gemstone sphere necklace appear on top of the cluster. To my amazement, its energies began to ride upon those of the Quartz cluster, causing the gemstone energies to fill the room. The Quartz points had picked up the gemstone spheres' energies and carried them along with their own. Interestingly, the Quartz energy became the carrier wave, so only the gemstones' energy was broadcast. Healing Crystals for a Chiropractic Office Once we knew how gemstones could fill a room to uplift all within it, we wanted to find out which gemstones could best support this chiropractor's patients. A natural choice was Lavender Quartz, which is the primary gemstone of our [Master Healer](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/master-healer-necklace/) formula. The Lavender Quartz works with its partner stones, Sugilite and Tanzanite, to encourage alignment\u2014not just within your body, but throughout your entire life. Master Healer helps you feel centered within yourself, including your body, emotions, memory, mind, and spirit. The chiropractor also wanted a gemstone that could help patients feel calm and relaxed. Mother of Pearl, which we combine with Blue Chalcedony, was a natural and effective choice. Our [Mother of Pearl & Blue Chalcedony](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/mother-of-pearl-blue-chalcedony-necklace/) formula represents the metal element of Chinese medicine, which naturally calms as well as aligns. This is especially important for chiropractors. Next, we needed a gemstone to help release stress. Stress in the body is often the result of trapped emotions. The muscles won't let the emotions go and therefore tighten to hold on to them. The presence of any emotional energy in the physical body will be stressful in itself simply because doesn't belong there; it belongs in your emotional body. Working with our formula of [Rose Quartz & Red Spinel](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/rose-quartz-red-spinel-necklace/) can encourage a rhythmic release of these emotional energies, which allows the clearing to go deeper yet be easier to handle. Finally, we wanted to choose some gemstone spheres that could supply all-around clearing and uplifting\u2014something a chiropractor could set on a cluster long-term. Our [Harmony](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/harmony-necklace/) formula, which combines Frosted Quartz with its partner stone, Clear Quartz, is an ideal choice. When you place a Harmony necklace on a crystal cluster, it fills the room with balanced, uplifting, clearing, and healing light. [Since our earliest experiments, we now know of health care providers who place clusters in their patient waiting areas and drape them with the ](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/foundation-five-necklace-set/) [Foundation Five](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/foundation-five-necklace-set/) necklaces. The balancing influence of these five necklaces resolves minor imbalances in patients while they wait. Their more significant concerns then become more obvious to the physician during the visit, which can make it easier to diagnose those patients or choose appropriate courses of treatment. Any gemstone necklace that you want to work with can be experienced differently depending on if you wear it or place it on a cluster. When you wear the gemstones, their energies move outward from your body to fill your aura. Placing the gemstones on a cluster in your room nourishes you from the other direction. It fills your aura first, then fills your body. Both ways are supportive. Clearing Homes and Spaces with Healing Crystal Clusters It's easy to see how [Quartz crystal clusters](https://gemstonetherapyinstitute.org/product/quartz-crystal-clusters/) can serve an important role in Gemstone Therapy. Their multiple crystal points naturally radiate uplifting Quartz energy into the surrounding space, making clusters excellent tools for clearing and brightening the energies of your home. For maximum benefit, place a large cluster in the center of your home, and place smaller ones in each room. The crystals will connect with one another, creating a network of uplifting energies. Quartz clusters also allow you to receive the healing energies of therapeutic gemstone necklaces and single spheres without having to wear them or place them on your body. When you place rounded, drilled gemstones on a crystal cluster, the gemstones' energies are broadcast into the immediate area, or an entire room. A cluster around 2\" x 3\" can fill a space of a few feet, while a cluster that's 5\" x 6\" or larger can fill a small room with gemstone energies. The larger the cluster, the farther the gemstone energies will be broadcast. Over the course of a few hours, the gemstone energies will expand farther than this, but the concentration of energies remains the greatest in the areas specified. Place a gemstone necklace or bracelet on a Quartz crystal cluster to: - Support you while you sleep. - Energetically support an intention. - Support those who cannot wear necklaces. - Add gemstone energies to your healing arts practice. - Uplift rooms. - Rejuvenate gemstones. - Support a Moonstone Healing Ceremony. We've always known that Quartz crystal clusters are uplifting to homes and spaces. Now we know they serve yet another important function: filling that home or space with the energies of your therapeutic-quality gemstone sphere necklaces and bracelets. This is especially helpful for those who cannot wear the necklaces, such as young children. By expanding the gemstone energies' reach, the clusters maximize the gems' healing potential without anyone having to wear them. In this way, Quartz crystal clusters make it possible for healing gemstones to be enjoyed by all. [VIEW OUR SELECTION "}
