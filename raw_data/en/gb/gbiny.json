The prize includes a $50,000 honorarium to each awardee, made possible by a donation to the FNIH by philanthropist Ann Lurie, President of the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Foundation and President of Lurie Holdings, Inc. The winners, selected by a distinguished jury of biomedical researchers, chaired by Solomon H. Snyder, MD, Vice Chairman of the FNIH Board, will be honored at the [FNIH 11th Annual Awards Ceremony](https://fnih.org/fnih-awards-ceremony/) on the evening of October 18, 2023, in Washington, D.C.

Cugell Professor of Medicine, Biochemistry, and Molecular Genetics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Dr. Navdeep S. Chandel showed the expanded role of mitochondria in a cell beyond energy production. His research has revealed how mitochondria function as signaling organelles that control the body's normal functions and impact diseases, including cancer and inflammation. Vamsi Mootha, MD Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, investigator in the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital, institute member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and professor of Systems Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School Dr. Vamsi Mootha has combined genomics and computation with classic biochemistry to gain a holistic and mechanistic understanding of mitochondria. His team has used this approach to discover new disease genes and identified hypoxia as a candidate therapy for mitochondrial disorders. Selection Committee Drs. Chandel and Mootha were selected as the 2023 Lurie Prize recipients by a jury of distinguished biomedical research leaders: - Solomon H. Snyder, MD, Chair Distinguished Service Professor of Neuroscience, Pharmacology & Psychiatry, Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine - Lewis C. Cantley, PhD Meyer Director, Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College Ronald P. Stanton Clinical Cancer Program, New York-Presbyterian - Ronald M. Evans, PhD Professor & Director, Gene Expression Laboratory and March of Dimes Chair in Molecular & Developmental Biology, Salk Institute for Biological Studies Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator - Carl Nathan, MD R.A. Rees Pritchett Professor, Chairman, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Medical College - Susan S. Taylor, PhD Professor, Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego - Xiaowei Zhuang, PhD Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator David B. Arnold Jr. Professor of Science, Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Professor of Physics at Harvard University Previous Recipients [](https://youtu.be/j_3B5n1dEuo) Anne Brunet, PhD, and Andrew Dillin, PhD Dr. Anne Brunet employed a unique multi-organismal approach to investigate the ability of enzymes to regulate genes implicated in aging and has identified genes and pathways critical for maintaining neural stem cells that may help preserve brain function during aging. Dr. Andrew Dillin explored the ability of organisms to sustain proper protein production processes essential to maintaining cellular structure and function in aging.

Arnold Jr. Professor of Science, Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Professor of Physics at Harvard University. Dr. Zhuang's research lab at Harvard pioneered the development of super-resolution microscopy and genome-scale imaging showing new spatial and functional organizations of molecules and cells.

MacGregor Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Sciences, Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Member of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Chen discovered the enzyme cyclic GMPAMP synthase (cGAS) and its corresponding pathway, which solved a century-old mystery about DNA. [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D94-x9CuwKg) David M. Sabatini, MD, PhD Professor of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Dr. Sabatini discovered the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) cellular pathway as a key regulator of growth and metabolism in response to nutrients. [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iIDfRsJ80k) Jeannie T. Lee, MD, PhD Molecular Biologist at Massachusetts General Hospital; Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School Dr. Lee's pioneering work has elucidated how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) control gene expression and chromosome architecture, and how an entire sex chromosome can be turned off. Her work has shown that lncRNAs have a special place in epigenetics regulation, for \u2014 unlike proteins \u2014 lncRNAs can target biological activities to a unique location in our genome.

Chen Professor of Bioengineering and of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University Dr. Deisseroth pioneered the field of optogenetics, which has greatly expanded our understanding of normal behavior as well as of diseases like Parkinson's, schizophrenia and depression by combining genetic manipulation and optics to activate or deactivate precisely targeted brain cells.

In 2012, she and her colleagues at UC Berkeley and Sweden discovered CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a gene-editing technique that gives researchers the equivalent of a molecular surgery kit for routinely disabling, activating or changing genes.
