Have you ever had to abruptly cut short your camping trip because you had an allergic reaction to a leaf that you touched accidentally? Do you find yourself itching and scratching after cuddling with your pet who just walked into your house? Chances are, you or your pet may have come in contact with the dreaded poison oak that is causing you this misery. What is poison oak? How do you deal with this itch? Read this article to know all about the home remedies for poison oak. In This Article What Is Poison Oak? Toxicodendron diversilobum, otherwise known as poison oak, is a vine-like shrub that belongs to the sumac family. Commonly found in the western parts of North America and Canada, this plant is notorious for causing extreme itching in humans and animals. You can identify this plant with its dull green leaves that have several tiny hair-like structures all around them. They bear a similar appearance to that of oak tree leaves, hence the name poison oak. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 90% of the American population would develop an allergic reaction on exposure to poison oak ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282030964_The_Effects_of_Acute_Antioxidative_Ingestion_on_Contact_Dermatitis_brought_on_by_Urushiol_Exposure_in_vivo)). Similar to poison ivy, poison oak also contains a toxic chemical called urushiol that is responsible for causing these allergic reactions. Urushiol is an oil-like substance that is generally present on the leaves and stems of the plant. When urushiol comes in contact with your skin, it can cause severe itching and rashes. According to the CDC, you can also develop rashes, itching, and lung irritation when you inhale the smoke from burnt poison oak ( [2](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-118/pdfs/2010-118.pdf)). You can experience this allergic reaction even through indirect contact when - You touch tools that have been used to cut poison oak. - Come in contact with another person who has been exposed to urushiol. - Touching clothing or surfaces that have been exposed to urushiol. In some cases, the allergic reaction to poison oak may not be instant and it can take up to 24-48 hours for the symptoms to appear. What are these symptoms? Let's find out in the next section. What Are The Symptoms Of Poison Oak Exposure? Urushiol oil is the main ingredient of poison oak that causes an allergic reaction. If you can wash it off immediately, you stand a chance to reduce the severity of the symptoms or even possibly prevent them ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282030964_The_Effects_of_Acute_Antioxidative_Ingestion_on_Contact_Dermatitis_brought_on_by_Urushiol_Exposure_in_vivo)). However if the situation does not permit you to wash it off, these are some of the symptoms you will encounter: - Redness - Severe itching - Swelling - Bumps, patches, and weeping blisters ( [2](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-118/pdfs/2010-118.pdf)) Some of these symptoms can last for a couple of days and in some cases even up to a week or longer. There is no specific treatment for poison oak allergies, but only remedies to make the symptoms bearable ( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282030964_The_Effects_of_Acute_Antioxidative_Ingestion_on_Contact_Dermatitis_brought_on_by_Urushiol_Exposure_in_vivo)). Speaking of remedies, here are a few home remedies for poison oak that you may want to try. Note: There is no one-size-fits-all solution for poison oak itch. If the itch from poison oak becomes unbearable, visit your doctor immediately. Natural Remedies For Poison Oak Itch Acting quickly and being mindful is key in preventing the aggravation of allergic reactions. You may try a few of these natural remedies for poison oak allergy. - Avoid Scratching Your Skin The first and the most important thing to do is resist the urge to scratch yourself. By scratching yourself all over, you are likely to spread urushiol all over your body and increase the number of affected areas. Also by scratching yourself, you may accidentally burst blisters that could be painful ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7733371/)). - Cold Compress Applying a cold compress on the inflamed area may help soothe it and provide temporary relief ( [4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346075542_Role_of_Cold_Therapy_and_Hot_Therapy_in_Sports_Injuries_SPORTS_INJURIES)). You can dampen a towel in ice-cold water and gently place it on the affected area. Repeat this process 3-4 times a day. - Take An Oatmeal Bath Taking a bath with colloidal oatmeal might help reduce the inflammation and relieve the itchiness ( [5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271332623_Anti-Inflammatory_Activities_of_Colloidal_Oatmeal_Avena_sativa_Contribute_to_the_Effectiveness_of_Oats_in_Treatment_of_Itch_Associated_With_Dry_Irritated_Skin)). Colloidal oatmeal has been traditionally used to treat various inflammatory skin conditions. - Try Some Witch Hazel Witch hazel is known to be a natural astringenti [X]The property that helps draw out water from the tissues, causing them to shrink and dry up secretions. and contains anti-inflammatory properties. Topically applying witch hazel extracts on the affected area may help reduce the inflammation and provide momentary relief ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3214789/) [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5661189/)). - Try Applying Some Manuka Honey Manuka honey is a popular choice in home remedies for treating various skin conditions due to its antibacterial properties and anti-inflammatory properties.

Applying manuka honey to the affected area may help relieve the itching ( [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818709095491)). - Try Baking Soda Baking soda may also help provide relief from the effects of poison oak allergy. Research suggests adding a cup of baking soda to lukewarm or cold water and taking a bath to reduce the itching ( [9](https://Impatiens%20Capensis%20The%20Related%20Cultivar%20I.%20Balsamina%20And%20The%20Component%20Lawsone%20In%20Preventing%20Post%20Poison%20Ivy%20Exposure%20Contact%20Dermatitis)). - Try Using Jewelweed Jewelweed or the spotted \"touch me not\" when used as a mash can help relieve the itching caused by poison oak. However, using jewelweed extracts in the form of soaps and gels is not as effective as fresh mash ( [9](https://Impatiens%20Capensis%20The%20Related%20Cultivar%20I.%20Balsamina%20And%20The%20Component%20Lawsone%20In%20Preventing%20Post%20Poison%20Ivy%20Exposure%20Contact%20Dermatitis)). - Apply Chamomile And Lavender Essential Oils Lavender and chamomile essential oils have anti-inflammatory and antispasmodici [X]A medication that relieves, prevents, or lowers the incidence of muscle spasms, especially those of smooth muscle. properties. Topical application of these oils may help relieve the burning sensation and itching caused by poison oak ( [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22809036/)), ( [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21617262/)). - Use Bentonite Clay Studies suggest that bentonite clay could act as a barrier and prevent the spread of toxins to other parts of the skin. Using creams and lotions that contain quaternium-18 bentonite could be effective in treating poison oak allergies ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5632318/)).
