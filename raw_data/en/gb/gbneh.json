She holds an MSc. in Western Herbal Medicine from Middlesex University and is a qualified Ayurvedic Therapist. She has always had an interest in herbs and dedicated herself to the profession after the healing power of plants helped to resolve her own complex health condition. That experience sparked her passion and was the start of her journey towards formal study of the science of herbal medicine. After extensive travel in South India learning about Ayurveda, she returned to the UK to complete her MSc. in Western Herbal Medicine. Her grounding in Ayurveda and Western Herbal Medicine shapes her approach to herbal treatment. In particular, Sara is learned in endobiogenic medicine, a system developed by two French medical doctors, Christian Duraffourd and Jean-Claude Lapraz over the course of 40 years of clinical experience. Endobiogenic medicine makes use of evidence based scientific research in physiology and pathology using plant-based medicine. It also makes use of a unique Biology of Functions blood test, designed to evaluate the functioning capabilities of the neuroendocrine system. Sara practises Endobiogeny because she believes it can provide the bridge to link the concepts found in Ayurveda with the scientific understanding of Western medicine. Sara's legal background means that she has experience working in stressful corporate environments and has seen first-hand how stress at work can impact health and well being. She is a specialist in stress-related conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), hormone imbalances and endocrine conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She is a member of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (NIMH) and the Endobiogenic Medicine Society (EMS), and a former President of Middlesex University's Complementary and Alternative Medicine "}
