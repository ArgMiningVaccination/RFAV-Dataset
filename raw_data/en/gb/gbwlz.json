Nobody asked for your advice. There's a joke in the chronic-illness world: You mention a problem you're having, whether it's back pain, a clogged sink, or fake calls from the IRS. Someone responds, \"But have you tried yoga?\" It comes from our experiences on social media in particular. When we talk about what it's like to be in our tired, achy, unpredictable bodies, or just how we're doing on a given day, we're barraged with unsolicited advice. The most popular recommendation always seems to be yoga, though turmeric, homeopathy, restrictive diets and other notions come up a lot, too. Don't get me wrong. Yoga is great for some people, and for some kinds of aches and pains. But if the original poster says something like, \"yoga made my joint pain worse,\" the advice-giver often acts upset. \"I was just trying to help!\" they'll say. Then the original poster is compelled to soothe the commenter, when they never asked for advice in the first place. It sucks. At the same time, there's this stereotype that folks with chronic illnesses are lazy. That if we only tried this remedy or that therapy, we'd be \"cured.\" But most of us have already tried everything we can think of. In Paula Kamen's All in Your Head, her memoir about a migraine that wouldn't go away, she enumerates every treatment she tried, from seeing a shaman to having surgery. None of it worked, but you can't say she didn't try. Other memoirs by folks with chronic pain or illness are similarly full of failed treatments. But our friends and acquaintances on the internet still think they know better. I'm tired of responding to those comments. I've been tired for a long time, honestly. So here's a list of pretty much everything I've tried, and how it went. Note: this is not an invitation to recommend something you don't see here. Activated charcoal: Great for occasional nausea or gut trouble. Acupuncture: I've been to a few highly recommended acupuncturists. I could always feel the needles. It wasn't relaxing. It didn't relieve my regular migraines, or anything else. And my one experience with [cupping](https://www.healthline.com/health/cupping-therapy) left me sick to my stomach and so dizzy I could barely walk. "}
