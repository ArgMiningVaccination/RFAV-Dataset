Conway, MD, FAAP Wisconsin Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics Jonathan L. Temte, MD, PhD Chair, Wisconsin Council on Immunization Practices Ryan Westergaard, MD, PhD, MPH State Epidemiologist for Communicable Diseases Re: The 2023 -2024 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines Promote Influenza Vaccination Influenza and SARS -CoV -2 viruses are expected to circulate at the sa me time during the upcoming 2023 -2024 influenza season. In this context, vaccination against influenza will continue to be important to decrease the overall impact of respiratory illnesses by reducing influenza -associated illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, and reducing the burden on the health care system. Health care providers should promote and offer influenza vaccine during September or October, using every opportunity during the influenza vaccination season to administer influenza vaccines to all persons aged 6 months and older . Co-administration of influenza , COVID -19, and RSV vaccines may be considered in order to avoid missed opportunities. Seasonal influenza vaccine should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating . Influenza was detected among Wisconsin residents all 52 weeks of 2022 (the most current year for which we have complete data). Immunization clinics should therefore be scheduled throughout the influenza season into 2024 . Updated ACIP Recommendations The 2023 -2024 ACIP recommendations for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines w ere formally issued on August 2 5, 202 3. This document can be downloaded from the MMWR website . Updated ACIP information regarding recommendations or vaccine supply and timing of distribution of influenza vaccine that affect the target groups will be made available, as needed. The 2023 -2024 Vaccine Information Statements are also available . It is important to be aware of the current recommendations and to periodically visit the CDC website for additional information and updates. Access to updated or supplemental information is often necessary throughout the influenza season and the months leading up to it. The CDC and other public health agencies will assess the vaccine supply on a continuing basis throughout the manufac turing period and will inform both providers and the general public in the event of substantial delays or inadequate supply. Vaccines available during the 2023 -2024 season are (Table 1): Quadrivalent) . Vaccination of all persons aged 6 months is recommended. Not all influenza vaccines are uniformly available in any given practice setting or geographic locality. ACIP recommends that adults aged 6 5 years preferentially receive an enhanced influenza vaccine (EIV) to improve their immunity. Any one of the following enhanced vaccines are preferred for this group: quadrivalent high -dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD -IIV4), RIV4, or aIIV4. If none o f these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age - appropriate influenza vaccine can be used. Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product when an appropriate one is already available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations when vaccine is available. See Table 2 for a list of contraindications and precautions to receipt of influenza vaccine. We are not aware of any supply issues. In the event of a shortfall in production or a delay in the delivery of an adequate supply of vaccine, you will be notified of any official prioritization of high -risk groups. If such an event should occur, a Prioritiz ation Plan will be distributed. If needed, this plan will provide a sequence of prioritization for you to follow to assure that high -risk individuals receive their influenza vaccinations first. Because the annual supply and timing of distribution of influe nza vaccine cannot be guaranteed, we continue to stress the importance of local partnerships. The recent history of vaccine delivery delays and shortages emphasizes the need for local coalitions to help coordinate redistribution and administration of influ enza vaccine. Vaccines.gov may be used to identify a location ( for example, clinic or community pharmacy) to receive influenza vaccine . The 2023-2024 ACIP Recommendations include two principal updates: 1. The compositions of the 2023 -2024 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1 )pdm09 -like virus . Cell lineage) -like virus . 2. Regarding influenza vaccination of persons with egg allergy, ACIP recommends tha t all persons aged 6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based or nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient's age and health status can be used. It is no longer recommended that persons who have had an allergic reaction to e gg involving symptoms other than urticaria should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions if an egg -based vaccine is used. Egg allergy along necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administere d in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions are available. Influenza vaccination of children aged 6 months through 8 years All children aged 6 months through 8 years who are recommended to receive two doses this season should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available; these children should receive the second dose 4 weeks later (Figure 1). This practice increases the opportunity for both dos es to be administered during the same influenza season and before the onset of influenza activity. Influenza vaccination of pregnant women Vaccination during pregnancy has been demonstrated to protect infants from influenza, including infants aged <6 mo nths for whom no influenza vaccines are currently licensed. Specifically, infants born to vaccinated women had a 63% reduction in laboratory -confirmed influenza illness during the first six months of life (2,3). The ACIP, the American College of Obstetrici ans and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that all women who are pregnant or who might be pregnant during the upcoming influenza season receive IIV because of an increased risk of serious illness and compl ications from influenza. LAIV is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Information about influenza vaccination during pregnancy and guidance on how to address concerns that patients may have about influenza vaccination is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vaccination -possible -safety -signal.html Influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy For the 2023 -2024 influenza season, ACIP recommends the following: 1. ACIP recommends that all persons aged 6 months with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg based o r nonegg based) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient's age and health status can be used .2. It is no longer recommended that persons who have had an allergic reaction to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions if an egg -based vaccine is used. Egg allergy alone necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccinati on beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment needed for rapid recognition and treatment of acute hypersens itivity reactions are available.

When a contraindication is present, a vaccine should not be administered. When a precaution is present, vaccination should generally be deferred but might be indicated if the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction (see the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/general -recs/index.html ). Package inserts for U.S. -licensed https://www.fda.gov/vaccines -blood -biologics/vaccines/vaccines - licensed -use-united -states . Although a history of sev ere allergic reaction ( for example, anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4, ACIP recommends that persons with a history of egg allergy may receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine that is otherw ise appropriate for their age and health status. \u00a7 Labeled contraindication noted in package insert. \u00b6 If administered, vaccination should occur in a medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who can recognize and manage severe all ergic reactions. Providers can consider consultation with an allergist in such cases, to assist in identification of the component responsible for the allergic reaction. ** Age -appropriate injectable vaccines are recommended for persons with cochlear impla nt due to the potential for CSF leak, which might exist for a period after implantation. Providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning risk fo r persistent CSF leak if an age -appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used . Use of LAIV4 in context of influenza antivirals has not been studied; however, interference with activity of LAIV4 is biologically plausible, and this possibility is noted in the package insert for LAIV4. In the absence of data supporting an adequate minimum interval between influenza antiviral use and LAIV4 administration, the intervals provided are based on the half -life of each antiviral. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance ( for example, renal insufficiency). Influenza antivirals might also interfere with LAIV4 if initiated within two weeks after vaccination. Persons who receive antivir als during the period starting with the specified time before receipt of LAIV4 through two weeks after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with an age -appropriate IIV or RIV4.
