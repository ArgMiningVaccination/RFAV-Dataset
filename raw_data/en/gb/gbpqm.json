In this paper I use these broad perspectives to look at a seri es of medical divinations in a recently discovered archaeological evidence from China. A growing literature has explored the rationality and coherence of divination both as a set of mental attitudes and as a significant factor in the formation of social institutions. 1 These studies emphasize the normalcy of both aspects of divination in civilizations where it was central. It was a coherent part of \"ordi- nary\" social practices such as law, medi cine, or administration (like consulting a physician or a stockbroker). It was constitutive of a wide range of activities beyond the simple sense of predicting the future; divination had profound effects on the origin and development of medici ne, law, philosophy, politics, medicine, and the history of science. To better understand the complex relations between divination and medicine th at accompanied the development of naturalistic medi- cal theories in both contexts, I examine a set of fourth century 2 medical divina- tions from Baoshan in historical and comparative perspective. I begin by com- 1 In particular Vernant (1974) and Chem la, Harper and Kalinowski (eds.), (1999). 2 All dates are BC unless otherwise indicated.

I then turn to two approximately fourth century Greek divinatory contexts : the (late) fourth century stelae from the Asclepian temple at Epidaurus and an (early) fourth century text on dream diagnosis from the Hippocratic corpus . Baoshan Recent archeological excavations have b een an important source for information on the early Chinese divination and medicine. One group of texts was found in Tomb 2 at the village of Wangchangcun in Hubei Province at site on Baoshan hill in April 1986 by archaeologists working in conjunction with the con- struction of the Jingmen-Shashi railroad, in an area rich in Chu burial sites. 3 The tomb contained grave inventory lists, divination records and legal or administra- tive documents on inscribed bamboo slips. Divination records from a period between 350 and 300 have also been excavated from other Chu sites at Wang- shan and Tianxingguan . 4 Li Ling has argued that the divination records in these tombs bear several important resemblances to early divination records from the Shang and Western Zhou. They employed both \"crack making\" ( bu ) and represented the hexagrams numerically, rather than by name or by yin and yang lines, using the numbers one , five six ^, seven and eight . 5 Finally, they used similarly structured divinatory language, including formulaic elements of preface ( xuci or qianci , naming ), and prediction or prognostication (zhanci ), often noting a problem or something to be exorcised. Additional charges and prognostications specified detailed sacrifices to Chu gods and an- cestors, and instructions for future divinations. 6 The charge and prognostication begin with an attempt to determine whether the time is auspicious ( heng zhen ji ), \"it is predominantly decisive and auspicious\"). They also refer to a 3 Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991) and (1991b).

Year Divination and Illness Divination Baoshan Tomb 2 belonged to a high Chu official titled Zuoyin (\"Director of the Left\") and named Shao Tuo /g8.7 The divination slips (197-250) record a series of divinations on his behalf during the last two years of his life over a period between 318 and 316. (Each year is named by an event in the state of Chu dateable from other sources.) 8 All the divinations involve multiple sacrifices to Chu gods and ancestors. The records start in 318 in the fourth month of the Chu calendar, the month xingyi in the first month of summer, with three Year divinations ( sui ) on Shao Tuo's behalf on the day yiwei . Quasi-formulaic Year divinations seek to ascertain (or establish) his fortunes and well-being over the upcoming year, especially his success in service to the king. They take the form: X X At every turn in service to the king (or in the following 10- day period) from the month X [of the present year] to X of the next year, for the whole of the year, may his physical person be without calamity. 9 The first Year divinations express a \"slight concern\" about his physical person, probably a standard part of Year divination, rather than any reference to illness as such. 10 The individual diviners express those concerns somewhat differently. One (Gu Ji) requests \"release from the hum an serpent,\" possibly a curse. Two others (Shi Beishang and Ying Hui) give detailed instructions for sacrifices to Chu gods and ancestors. 11 Ying Hui transfers from Shi Beishang's divination, 7 Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (1991), notes 28 and 341. 8 The year after the Song ambassador She ng Gongbian paid a formal visit to Chu (318); the year after the Eastern Zhou ambassador Xu Ying presented ceremonial meats at the Chu capital (317); and the year after the Grand Marshal Zhuo Hua came to the rescue of Fu (316). See Li Ling (1993), p. 257, and Weld (1999), p. 83, note 30. 9 Slips 197-198, 199-200 and 201-204 in 318; slips 232-233, 236-238 and 239-240 in 316. 10 One slip (199-200) refers to \"a concern a bout a slightly distant day,\" that is, a day beyond the divination decade. Cf. Li ji, chap. 3, p. 14b. 11 This is written on the back of slip 202. See Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991), note 386, and Weld (1999), p. 90. 81 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece and instructs that the inquiry be transferred to another diviner at the end of the divination period. There are Year divinations for each of the three years covered by the records (three in 318, three in 317 and five in 316). Their overall goal is to ensure Shao Tuo's well-being in service to the king. Of the twenty-seven en tries, eleven are Year divinations. Four other entries do not involve divination, and twelve other divinations concern illness. These begin within the normal sequence of Year divinations, but after the manifestation of a seemingly persistent malady, they take an iatromantic turn, with increasing numbers of specific Illness divinations (jibing ). 12 The sequence of Year and Illness divinations at Baoshan are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Year Divinations and Illness Divinations No. Type Year Month and day Slips 1 3 Year divina- tions 318 xingyi 5 xiayi (5), jihai 249 The normal sequence seems to have been a set of at least three Year divinations in the summer (months three or four, numbers (1), (3) and (5)) and sacrifice without divination either after the end of winter (the first month of spring, dongyi ) or during the autumn (month eight). There was no such sacrifice in 316 because of Shao Tuo's death and inte rment that summer in the sixth month xian- 12 For this distinction see Chen Wei (1996), pp. 152-154. 82 EASTM 24 (2005) gyue (slip 267). The normal sequence seems to have been punctuated by four illness divinations in the third (2) and el eventh (4) months of 317. On one occa- sion, both Year and Illness divinations occur on the same day, in the fourth month of 316 (numbers (5) and (6) above). The last Illness divination (7) also occurs out of sequence a month later in the fifth month, presumably prompted by a medical crisis. The Diviners and their Methods The manuscript names twelve diviners and their methods, which are summarized in Table 2. Nine use tortoise and three use yarrow. 13 No two sequences are the same; most include both methods, with emphasis on tortoise (16 out of 22). Table 2: The Diviners and their Methods Tortoise (L) or Yarrow (R) Diviner Instrument 318 (197-206) yangfou 201-204 Year Ke changce 207-208 Illness 220 Illness Wu Sheng chengde 209-211 Year 232-233 Year 245-246 Illness baojia 247-248 Illness Long Illness 13 The milfoils are possibly connected to dafou milfoil from Tianxingguan), chengde (Receive Virtue) and gongming (Complete Mandate). Each diviner appears to specialize in a tortoise or yarrow divination, and to use one instrume nt. See Li Ling (1990), p. 81, and (1993), pp. 263 and 280-282; Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991). 83 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece Qu Yi tongge 223 Illness Chen Yi gongming 228-229 Year 239-241 Illness Guan Beng changling 230-231 Year 242-244 Illness Guan Yi baojia 249 Illness The diviners do not appear to specialize in Year or Illness divination. Of the eight who perform Year divination, three do it exclusively and five perform both Year and Illness divination. Only Gu Ji performs Year divination in all three years; four other diviners are only employed in one year (the tortoise diviners Shi Beishang and Ke Jia and the yarrow diviners Ying Hui and Chen Yi). Four individuals perform only Illness divinati on, the tortoise diviners Ke Guang, Long Ren, Qu Yi and Guan Yi, and each of them is only employed during one year. Four individuals perform both Year and Illness divination: the tortoise diviners Gu Ji, Ke Guang and Xu Ji a nd the yarrow diviner Wu Sheng. Two (Wu Sheng and Xu Ji) are employed in multiple years and two (Chen Yi and Guan Beng) only once. Frequently, a divination and its sacrifice are transferred from one diviner to another, sometimes after a specific instruction to do so in a previ- ous divination. 14 Most records include Gu Ji and another diviner from a previ- ous sequence. The Illness Divinations The Illness divinations occur on four days, two in 317 and two in 316: (1) In the month yuanyi /g9, day guimao, 317 (slip 207): , There is an illness near the abdomen w ith shortness of breath; may there be no calamity. (2) Four entries in the month cuan, day jiyou , 317: (slips 218 and 220) There is an ailment in the lower abdomen with shortness of breath. [] () ... (slips 221 and 223) There is an ailment near the heart with shortness of breath; he is not able to take in food. May there be no concern. (3) Five entries from the month xingyi, day jimao, 316 (slips 236, 239, 242, 245, 247): 14 There are three methods of prayer to a hi erarchy of gods and Chu ancestors that in- clude Taiyi (Great One), a star god associated with the polar region; and Siming (Director of destinies). See Li Ling (1993), pp. 269-272. 84 EASTM 24 (2005) There is an ailment of the a bdomen and heart along with rising qi and a bad taste [to his food]; and there has been no improvement for a long time. (4) One entry from the same year on the day jihai of the month xiayi (slip 249): There is a miasmal illness and rising qi; may he not die. 15 The first mention of an ailment is made by the tortoise diviner Ke Guang, who describes it as an illness near the abdomen manifesting as a shortage of qi. He adds that It is small but it has not stopped; drive it away according to its cause (slips 207-208). He specifies sacrifices and prayers. Two months later, a sequence of three Year divinations is repeated, by the original diviner Gu Ji and by two new diviners, the tortoise diviner Ke Jia and the stalk caster Wu Sheng. (Normally the next Year divination would not have occurred until the month xingyi of the following year.) These are auspicious, but mention concerns about household matters and baleful oaths ( mengzu , slips 209-211). 16 Another occurs in the eleventh month ( cuan ) of that year on the day jiyou , this time by four diviners. 17 Three diagnose an ailment of the abdomen ( xiaxin ) or near the heart ([ pang] xin [] ) and shortness of breath ( shao qi ). 18 They add that the illness will quickly be cured ( bing su cuo , slip 220). Two records add a difficulty in taking in food ( bu nei (ru) shi () , 221 and 223). There is disagreement about what to do. The tortoise diviner Xu Ji recommends an exorcism at Piyang on the day jiayin , which will be auspicious for a cure (slips 218-219). The tortoise diviner Ke Guang predicts s pontaneous improvement on one of the two days following his divination ( gengxu or xinhai ), and specifically recommends against exorcism at Piyang (slip 220). Perhaps it is this disagree- ment that necessitates additional divinations on this day, to determine which course of action to follow. A new divi ner named Long Ren (221-222) attributes the illness to the angry ghost of a royal ancestor, who can be propitiated by sac- rifice. 15 For zhang see Chen Wei (1996), p. 154. 16 For mengzu see Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu ka ogudui (ed.) (1991), note 410, and Weld (1999), p. 94. 17 The Chu calendar's eleventh month cuan corresponded to the eighth month of the Zhou calendar, see Hubeisheng Jings ha tielu kaogudui (1991), see Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991), note 427. 85 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece Despite both predictions, Shao Tuo's health takes a turn for the worse in the first month of the summer ( xingyi ) of 316. On the day jimao of that month five diviners performed five Year and five Illness divinations, alternating be- tween tortoise and yarrow, and all end with auspicious prognostications. This sequence suggests that diviners did not specialize in Year or Illness divination. The sequence begins with five Year divinations (slips 226-235) by Gu Ji, the new yarrow diviner Chen Yi, the new tortoise diviner Guan Beng, the yarrow diviner Wu Sheng, and Xu Ji (who has switched from the baojia to the boling tortoise). 19 They all mention a \"slight concern\" but disagree over what it is and what sacrifices to perform. Gu Ji refers to Shao Tuo's physical person. The yar- row diviners Chen Yi and Wu She ng both mention domestic and household matters, but from different sequences of numbers. 20 Guan Beng mentions only \"a slight concern,\" and Xu Ji finds \"no calamity\" and nothing to avert. The same five diviners then perform Illness divination (slips 236-248). All describe \"an ailment of the abdomen and heart ( fuxin ) with rising vapor and a bad taste to his food\" and request gradual improvement and no misfortune and recommend an elimination rite to driv e it away according to its cause. Gu Ji describes the illness as \"difficult to cure\" ( ji nan cuo , 236-238). 21 Chen Yi and Wu Sheng divine different number sequences but conclude that the divi- nation is auspicious but the ailment is getting worse. Chen Yi notes that \"the illness alters; there is some evil, ma y he quickly be cured\" (slip 239). 22 Guan Beng also anticipates that the illness w ill quickly be cured (slip 242), but accord- ing to Wu Sheng, \"the illness alters, the ailment has become more severe\" (slip 245) and for Xu Ji, there is some evil ( nie, slip 247). 23 Elaborate sacrifices are also recomme nded, but the requests for release at- tribute the illness to very different agencies. Gu Ji requests that Shao Tuo be released from the power of the god Year; 24 Chen Yi requests release from the 19 Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991), note 455, and Li Ling (1990), p. 80. 20 Chen Yi prognosticates the numbers: 1-6-5-8-6-6 and 1-6-6-1-1-6, which corre- hexagrams , 35) Wu Sheng divines the number sequences 1-6-1-1-6-1 and which (Li ) and17 (Sui ). For gongshi see Li Ling (1990), p. 83, and Zhang Shouzhong (ed.)

(1991), notes 472 (for the gloss bian ) and 473 (for ni or nie ), and 474 (for yue , quickly). Chen Yi's numbers are 1-1-1-6- 8-1 and 1-6-6-8-6-1, corresponding to the hexagrams (25, Wu Wang ) and (27, Yi ). Wu Sheng's are 8-1-6-1-1-1 and 6-6-1-1-1-8, corresponding to the hexa- grams(5, ). 23 Cf. Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991), note 428. Zhang Shouzhong (ed.) (1996), no. 6.6, indicates that this gr aph is similar to one in slip no. 240. 24 Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991), note 470 glosses Sui as the Wood 86 EASTM 24 (2005) curses of those dead in warfare; 25 Wu Sheng requests his release from the curses of the victims of floods; and Xu Ji requests his release from the curses of the innocent dead. A month later, in the second month of the summer of 316 ( xiayi, day jihai ) a crisis occurred. A new diviner performed baojia divination and requests (slip 249) \"that he not die from a miasmal ailment and rising va-por!\" Despite auspicious predictions, a further entry states that he was interred on the day dinghai of the third month of summer ( xiangyue ). Do the Illness divinations refer to one worsening ailment or to a series of in- dependent conditions? 26 All the ailments save the last seem clearly linked, with no improvement for a long time. These ailm ents are: (1) an illness near the ab- domen ( pang fuji ) or in the lower abdomen ( xia xin ), shortness of breath (shao qi ), (2) inability to take in food ( bu ru shi ), and (3) a longstanding ailment of the abdomen and heart ( ji fuxin ) accompanied by rising qi (shang qi ) and inability to eat ( bu gan shi ). Additional references to difficulty in eating and aversion to food suggest an ongoing ab- dominal ailment. References to \"ailments of the heart and abdomen\" ( xinfu, fuxin ) appear in the Zuozhuan both as an actual ailment of the interior and as a metaphorical description of the ailment of a state. 27 By contrast, \"ailments of the mind\" (xinji ) shortness of breath ( shao qi ) in connection with excess pulse in autumn and in wi nter. The \"Treatise on the Precious Mecha- Star (the planet Jupiter). 25 Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu zu as mengzu , swearing an oath directed at the gods , as referring to curses that have caused inauspicious things, see Li Ling (1990) , p. 86. Weld (1999), p. 96, suggests that this series of invocations are designed to release Shao Tuo from the possible influences of a range of unlucky people. 26 Gu Ji (212-215) mentions a concern about ro yal affairs, and specifies sacrifices to Si Ming and Tai Yi, among others. Ke Jia ( 216-217) mentions a slight concern about Shao Tuo's physical person, and prays that he be released from the unlucky influence of the innocent dead. See Hubeisheng Jingsha tielu kaogudui (ed.) (1991), note 426, and Li Ling (1990), p. 86, and Peng Hao (1991). 27 E.g. a description of the state of Yue as \"a disease of the vitals\" ( xinfu zhi ji Wu (Zuozhuan 11, 25a, p. 1018); a discussion of \"an ailment of the abdo- men and heart\" (fuxin zhi ji ) that refers both to the health of the king and the state (Ai 6, 3b, p. 1007). 28 These include pain at deception (Cheng 13, 15a, p. 463), the mental illness diag- nosed by Physician He (Zhao 1, 37b, p. 709), and someone who \"fell into mental distress and died\" (Xiang 3, p. 526). 29 E.g. stomach ache from the fish in the river (Huan 12, 24b, p. 399) and abdominal ailments caused by rain qi ( (Zhao 1, 37b, p. 709). 87 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece nism of the Viscera\" states that in fall, excess pulse results in difficulty in breath- ing, with shortness of breath, cough and blood. 30 The \"Comprehensive Dis- course on Changes [from] Qi Interactions \" discusses, for each year, the climate of the five seasons and five periods, and what happens when the qi associated with the five periods is excessive or inad equate. In a year in which there is ex- cess fire qi will harm the lungs and people will fall ill and suffer from shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. 31 Shang qi also seems to be a shortness of breath or respiratory ailment, also associated with winter. 32 The authors of one medical study descri be these symptoms as heart disease, lower heart disease and abdominal heart disease, with symptoms of shortness of breath, upper abdominal distension and dropsy. In their analysis the sudden and intermittent onset of the disease, Shao Tuo's increasingly severe condition and relatively rapid death suggest that he died of cardiac disease. 33 Other recently excavated texts have be gun to reveal the complex medical en- vironment of the fourth through second centuries. The tortoise and yarrow tech-niques described above coexisted with other iatromantic methods such as dream divination and the consultation of wu shamans. 34 Similar accounts of exorcistic medical divination appear in the Zuozhuan and the Shangshu. 35 Tomb number 1 from Wangshan, Hubei (c. 309 BC to 278 BC) contains some 270 bamboo slips, including Illness divinations on behalf of the tomb's occupant that resemble those at Baoshan. They seem to refer to an ailment of or near the heart ( ji xin ... xin bing , slip 36), of the chest and ribs ( xiong xie ji , slip 37), an inability to eat ( bu neng shi , slips 37-38), as well as ailments of the feet and bones ( zu gu ji , slips 38-39), and head ( shou ji , slips 41- 42). The slips also use similar language to the Baoshan divinations, for example prognostications that are \"decisive not die\" neijing suwen 69, p. 531. The Wang Bing commentary adds that shao qi means that qi is deficient and there is not enough to breathe ( ). See Chen Wei (1996), p. 154, and Unschuld (2003), pp. 394-396. The phrase also appears frequently in the Lingshu in discussions of deficiency of qi and blood in the contexts of yin-yang theory and pulse diagnosis, e.g. Lingshu 4.28, 8.10, 9.28, 10.5 and 6, 12.2, 22.21, 65.31 and 32, 74.9 and 78.42. qi ailments\" ( shangqi ji ) with winter. The com- mentary describes shang qi as an oppositional cough or asthma 73.6, 75.5, and 80.7. 33 Hou and Shi (1994). 34 For medical divination in the oracle bones see Keightley (2001) and Li Zongkun (2001). 35 Chunqiu Zuo zhuan zhushu, Cheng 10, 88 EASTM 24 (2005) , slips 39, 40, 45, 47) and the inst ruction to \"exorcise it according to its cause\" ( , slip 53). Divinatory slip s excavated from a tomb at Tianxingguan, Jianling, Hubei (c. 361 BC to 340 BC) also include Year and Illness divinations similar to those from Baoshan, as well as divinations about changes of residence. 36 There are many unanswered questions about the Baoshan divination records and their counterparts from Wangshan and Tianx- ingguan. We do not know why they were placed in the tomb, and can only speculate from what archives they were copied, and by whom. Hemerology and Yin-yang Iatromancy These texts reflect a prevailing view of disease before the second century, in which disease was seen as the result of invasive influences: animal inflicted injuries, natural forces (wind, heat, cold), and demonic entities and magic. Ora-cle bone inscriptions and Warring States excavated texts describe a range of techniques to identify and mollify these en tities. Such exorcistic and sacrificial divinations contrast with hemerological methods of iatromancy that also emerged in the fourth century. In he merological \"daybooks\" illness are classed into types in order to determine auspicious days for treatment, based on yin-yang and Five Phase schemata. These technique s eventually coexisted with the more systematized Han dynasty yin-yang and Five-Phase medical theories of the Huangdi neijing. A late fourth century manuscript from Jiudian (Jiangling, Hubei, c. 330 BC to 270 BC) is the oldest text known to use horary iatromancy. Here, all ill- nesses that arise on the same day have the same etiology; this makes it possible to predict its course. The text uses three prognoses: respite (slight cure), recov-ery (great cure), and (life and) death. For example, for any illness beginning on a chen day, \"there is respite on day you, recovery on xu, and death on zi.\" 37 It also associates each of the twelve earthly branches with th e origin of a particular illness. As Donald Harper has shown, this new approach totally changed the iatromantic encounter by introducing a new kind of predictability based on the inevitability of the sexagenary cycle. In these texts, prognostication and cure occur mechanically, rather than by divination, propitiation and exorcism. Other medical hemerological manuscrip ts have been excavated from the tombs at Shuihudi (Yunmeng, Hubei, c. 220 BC) and Fangmatan (Tianshui, Gansu, c. 230 BC to 220 BC). 38 Daybooks from Shuihudi also 36 Hubeisheng slip 64. Illnesses be- ginning on a wei day has respite on day zi, recovery on mao , and death on yin (slip 67); for a hai day respite is on day mao , recovery on si , and death on shen (slip 71), trans. Harper (2001), pp. 105-106. 38 For Shuihudi see Shuihudi Qinmu (ed.) (1990), and Kali-89 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece link the progress of ailments to the sexa genary cycle, so any ailment occurring on a day follows a predictable course. They contain the same correlations as those from Jiudian, but are better preserved and include more information. They correlate their stem and branch iatromancy to the Five Phases and their associ- ated colors, directions, etc. The day books show diviners applying Five-Phase theory to hemerological iatromancy centu ries before the cosmological syntheses of Han dynasty physicians. The accretion of earlier medical traditions in the Huangdi neijing suwen or Basic Questions of the Inner Classic of the Yellow Lord marked the beginning of the growth of a naturalistic medicine, in which health and illness were explained by natural processes. Its eighty-one trea tises are of diverse origins, and were probably compiled during the second and first centuries. 39 The text makes an analogy between the body and the cosmos in which yin and yang are \"the dao of heaven and earth,\" the warp that weav es together the myriad creatures, the source of all transformation and change, and the primal polarity whose balance or imbalance causes health or disease. In the transitions between ancestral, de- monological and vessel and yin-yang theories of disease, the later theories did not completely displace or eliminate their predecessors. The chapters \"Harmonizing Yin and Yang\" offers a typology of dreams to diagnose yin-yang imbalances in the body. During sleep, the body was rela- tive vulnerable to heteropathic qi (xieqi ), and dreams could manifest the dreamer's inner qi fighting this external invasi on on the battlefield of the body. Different dream elements indicated different imbala nces, which are summarized in Table 3. 40 nowski (1986). For Fangmatan see He Shuangquan (1989) and (1989b). 3: The Dream Typology of the Huangdi neijing Organ system Excess Deficiency yin fording great waters yang great fire and burning yin and yang murder and harm upper body flying lower body falling liver anger mountains, forests, trees and grasses lungs weeping flying, seeing extraordinary ob- jects, war heart happiness, laughter, fear smoke and fire over hills and mountains spleen song and music, a heavy and clumsy body graves, flooded marshes, wind and rain damage kidneys a loose waist, disjointed from the spine looking down an abyss, sinking, drowning bladder travel and journeys stomach food and drink large intestine fields and open country small intestine villages gall bladder fighting, cutting oneself genitals sex neck beheading shin inability to walk, dwelling in vaults and cellars limbs rituals and prostrations womb urination This hermeneutic draws on analogies be tween the dream image and the Five Phases associated with each or gan or component of the body. Yin corresponds to water, yang to fire. Upward movement is linked to flying, downward movement to falling, etc. In summary, exorcistic and hemerological iatromancy seem to have coexisted during the fourth through second centuries, and that coexistence continued within the yin-yang and Five-Phase theories of the Huangdi neijing. Its system- atic correspondence theories did not comple tely displace older layers of ancestral and demonological theories of disease. These persisted in divinatory elements within the Huangdi neijing , in particular, methods for dream divination. The combined contexts of excavated texts and the Huangdi neijing illustrate an evolving symbiotic relationship between divination and medicine that persist 91 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece to the present day. In their development of theory and practice of the medicine of systematic correlations, Han physicians drew on the expertise of a variety of divination methods. They adapted elements of Five-Phase and yin-yang theory from the expertise of hemerological and astrological diviners, as well as their rhetoric of accurate prediction. The formulae for descriptions of illness, diagno-sis and prognosis from the earliest case studies imitates the rhetoric of divina-tion, and physicians' claims for infallib ility in prognosis mimic the claims of diviners for accurate prediction. 41 Greek Iatromancy: Exorcism, Catharsis and Rationalized Medicine The coexistence of iatromancy and naturalistic medicine also has a counterpart in Greece. Greek diviners and physicians shared a long history in both myth and practice, and iatromancy coexisted with the development of systematic and ra- tionalized medical theories, despite deliberate efforts of Hippocratic physicians to distances themselves from diviners. Mythological accounts reveal close connections between diviners, purifiers and physicians. Melampus, the inventor of both purification and drug therapy, is described as receiving his gifts from the god Apollo, himself described as a mantic healer purifier (katharsios ) of homes. 42 It has been speculated that purification was part of the iatromantic repertoire since archaic tim es, from which purifiers and physicians emerged as heirs to a divided patrimony. The earliest Greek medical theories were exorcistic, in which divine inter- vention caused both disease and cure, unde rstood in moral and medical terms as purification from pollution. This understanding of the nature of disease called for divination to determine the source of pollution in the body or body politic, and sacrifice and purification to effect a cure. 43 This theory first appears in the Homeric poems; the Iliad (1.50) begins with Apollo taking revenge for the dis- honour to his priest by loosing arrows of disease. Here, disease is a god whose anger could be ascertained and propitiated. But the Homeric poems describe rationalized medical treatment of battle wounds. A physician is valued for his ability to cut out arrows and apply soothing ointments ( Il.11.514-15). When the young Odysseus is gored by a boar, he is treated with a combination of expert 41 Raphals (1998), Harper (1999), p. 105. 42 For Melampus see Hom. Od. For see Aesch. Eum. 62. 43 For pollution and miasma in Greek religion see Parker (1983), especially pp. 208- 210. 92 EASTM 24 (2005) bandaging and magical incantation. 44 Herodotus also combines invasive ac- counts in disease and references to nature. 45 Both Chinese and Greek medical divina tion sought to identify and propitiate gods and other divine entities responsible for illness, and in both cases therapies based on invasive theories of disease coexisted with methods of treatment based on systematized accounts of the body a nd the cosmos. But Greek accounts of invasive ailments frequently (though not always) include a specific notion of pollution and corresponding cure by ritual or physical catharsis. 46 The central role of purification in the practices of physicians, purifiers and diviners high- lights another distinctively Greek attitude: that moral and physical corruption are intermingled and indistinguishable, a view that persists from the earliest times into late antiquity. An important use of divination by Greek mantic practitioners (manteis ) was in rituals that sought to determine sources of pollution and to purify individuals or communities from th e effects of bloodshed, murder, sacri- lege, curses and disease. Shared notions of ritual, moral and medical \"pollution\" and purification used the same descrip tive language, and the term purification (katharsis ) encompassed moral purification from crime, ritual purification of the body, and medical purification through the use of purgatives to \"eliminate\" sources of disease from the body. Asclepian Divination The most important locus of Greek iatromancy was in temples of the physician god Asclepius, which appeared throughout the Mediterranean, beginning in the sixth century. The practice became popular during the fourth century, with the establishment of Asclepian temples at Cos, Epidaurus and Pergamum. 47 Unlike Illness divination of the kind recorded at Baoshan and Wangshan, Asclepian divination was therapeutic, rather than visitors practiced incubation ( enkoimesis , Latin incubatio ): a ritual practice of sleeping in the tem- ple after purifications, baths, fasting and sacrifices. The hope was that Asclepius would appear to the patient in a dream and provide either an instant cure or medical advice, interpreted by the temple priests. One account describes a woman who had a tapeworm that \"the cleverest of physicians failed to cure.\" 44 \"They knowingly bound it, and checked the black blood with an incantation\" ( Od. 19.455-58). 45 Herodotus attributes the madness of Cambys es (3.33) to offenses against the God Apis and to \"the disease that some call s acred\" (epilepsy). His long discussion of the madness and suicide of Cleomenes (6.75 a nd 6.84) includes views that there was no divine intervention and that his madness was due to alcohol. 46 Robin Yates (1997) has argued for a noti on of pollution and purification in early China, but he does not discuss medical notions of pollution. 47 See Herzog (1931) and Edelstein and Edelstein (1945). 93 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece She came to Epidaurus and begged the god to heal her. The temple attendants made her lie down in the place where suppliants were healed, and prepared to cure her. The account continues that they removed her head from her neck and removed a huge tapeworm, but were unable to reattach her head. This angered the god, who attached her head to her body and raised her up. 48 A few other examples: 9. A man came as a suppliant to the god. He was so blind that of one of his eyes he had only the eyelids left\u2014within them was nothing, but they were entirely empty. Some of those in the Temple laughed at his silliness to think that he could recover his sight when one of his eyes had not even a trace of the ball, but only the socket. As he slept a vision appeared to him. It seemed to him that the god prepared some drug, then, opening his eyelids, poured it into them. When day came he departed with the sight of both eyes re-stored. 29. Hegestratus with headaches . He suffered from insomnia on account of headaches. When he came into the Abaton, he fell asleep and saw a dream. It seemed to him that the god cured him of his headaches, and, making him stand up na- ked, taught him the lunge used in the pankration. When day came he departed well and not l ong afterwards he won in the pankration at the Nemean games. 39. Agameda of Cos. She slept in the sanctuary, in order to have children and saw a dream. She thought that a snake lay on her stomach while she slept. After this five children were born to her. 42. Nicasibula, a Messenian, slept in the sanctuary in order to have children and saw a dream. The god seemed to come to her carrying a snake that went towards her and that she had intercourse with the snake. After this she bore two male children within the year. 49 Stelae from the temple at Epidaurus (lat e fourth century) give forty-three ac- counts of cures. The most frequent ailment was blindness (7 cases) followed by worms or other parasites (5), paralysis (4), failure to become pregnant (4), lame- ness (3), termination of unnaturally long pregnancy (2), stones (2), spear wounds (2), growths or malignancy (2), and abs cesses or pus (2). Other conditions in- cluded dumbness, skin marks, baldness, dropsy, headaches, consumption, and 48 Ael.

Accounts of cures included spontaneous cures after incubation (9), surgery (8), application of a drug (5), manipulation or touch by the god (4), actual cure by an animal (4), and a dream of some kind of sexual relations (3). Other meth-ods dreamed included bandages or poultices (2), instructions or orders (2), cleansing (2), massage (1) and purgatives (1), many of the same techniques as Hippocratic physicians. 50 Here purification and prayer were purely therapeutic, and there was little emphasis on identifying the source of an ailment. Hippocratic Divination and Prayer The connection between diviners and physicians continues even in the Hippo- cratic corpus, which attributes the medical arts to the gods. The Hippocratic Oath was sworn to Apollo and the other gods of health. 51 The Letters (15.33-15.36) name Apollo as the common link between divination and medicine: \"The medi- cal arts and the mantic arts are of the same lineage, since th ese are two children of one father, Apollo.\" 52 Yet Hippocratic texts criticize divinati on and seek to distance physicians from diviners. The author of Prorrhetic asserts that he will \"not divine\" ( ou manteusomai , 2.1.21). The author of Regimen in Acute Diseases remarks that physicians' prescriptions vary so much that people consider them \"no better than divination\" (3.20). The author of On the Sacred Disease ridicules the ritual puri- fications (katharmoi ) and incantations of temple purifiers, and uses notions of pollution and purification to argue against the possibility of a \"sacred\" disease. 53 But Hippocratic physicians also practiced katharsis by the prescription of purga- tives ( katharsies ).54 The term is also applied to several conditions specific to women, such as menstruation ( Aph.5.59-61) and to the discharge after childbirth (Aer. 7.28). Despite both rhetorical attacks and substantive differences in prac- 50 One cure even includes a specific instruction not to follow the treatment recom- mended by physicians (Herzog (1931), Case 48k, as cited in Lloyd (1979), p. 46, note 197). 51 Hippoc.

See Lloyd (1979), pp. 37-49, By contrast, Plato (Soph. 226cd) distinguishes between the \"purging\" of bodies and souls. He describes katharmos as an aspect of discrimination ( diakritikein ), the activ- ity of retaining what is better and expelling what is worse, in practical matters such as carding, sifting and the like. 95 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece tice, Hippocratic and temple medicine fl ourished together through the Hellenistic period, and shared methods of prayer, drug therapy and regimen. Divination also occurs in Hippocratic texts, but its purpose is diagnostic rather than therapeutic, and its major use is in dream diagnosis. On Regimen 4 (late fifth or early fourth century) provides a theory of dream diagnosis, and detailed instructions for practicing it. In the cases of such dreams as are divine and presage good or of bad fortune, to poleis or to private individuals, those who know how to judge them have a precise art. But in cases where the soul presages disease of the body\u2014surfeit, depletion, excess of something natural or change to some- thing unaccustomed\u2014those who judge these things some-times get it right but sometimes miss the mark (4.87.1-4). Here the author claims to offer a true account of dreams that presage physiologi- cal events, including explanations of their causes and interpretations of their meaning. The text attributes medical significance to a wide range of dreams through microcosm-macrocosm analogies that correlate signs in the heavens, revealed in dreams, to physical conditions. It also provides an explanation for their diagnostic power: during sleep, the soul is freed from the body and the distraction of physical sensations, and is able to perceive comprehensively. Fi-nally, it refers to specialists at interpretation of \"God-given dreams\" to individu-als or cities. Its prescriptions always include prayer, with dream signs determin-ing which gods should receive prayer. The text also notes different kinds of dreams. The text distinguishes between dreams that are merely continuations of daily activities and signs of bodily disturba nce, in which dreams show conflict or victory over daily activities. (The seriousness of the conflict signals the serious- ness of the condition.) Dreams that are contrary to the dreamer's quotidian activities or with motifs of conflict or victory signify disturbance in the body. It presents a detailed \"lexi-con\" of individual dream motifs and imbalances in particular parts of the body they signify. Significant elements in Hippocratic oneiromancy included the ap-pearance of celestial bodies, mists, clouds and other atmospheric phenomena, land and water formations, and free or c onstrained movement, and clothing. In general, normal position indicated that the body was free from disturbing influ-ences; and changes in position indicated dis ease, with the details of the anomaly indicating the nature of the disease. The presence and position of stars, the sun or the moon indicated specific treatment regimens of exercise and diet. Other configurations of the sky such as a fiery atmosphere or the wandering of the heavenly bodies, indicated mental disturbance. The meaning of falling stars depended on the direction of motion (4.89). Bright stars moving east indicated health; dim starts moving west or downward presaged illness. The direction of movement also indicated the location of the illness in the body: upward move-ment indicated a head ailment; seaw ard movement, the bowels; earthward 96 EASTM 24 (2005) movement, tumors. Dreams of clarity, moistness and gentle rain were positive signs. Other signs of health included dreams of clear sight and hearing; free movement, walking or runni ng; fertile earth, good fields; and normal water flow. Disturbances in these patterns indicated particular diseases: of the head (poor sight and hearing), flesh (rough land), fluids or semen (stunted trees or flooded land), blood (abnormal rivers), bladder (spr ings and wells), or bowels (the sea). Dreams of normal clothing of the correct size, white color, and good shoes indi-cated health (and vice versa). Similarly, the appearance of the dead was a sign of health if they appeared in clean, white clothes, or gave the dreamer something clean. Conversely, dreams of the dead naked, in dark clothes, or taking anything from the house were bad signs. Other dire signs included monstrous creatures, drinking impure water, flight in fear, fighting, injury, being bound, fording riv-ers, or enemy soldiers. An impending change of health (positive or negative) was indicated by dreams of earthquakes or new clothing. The dream lexicon includes entries on dream s as directions for prayer to the appropriate gods, as determined by the na ture of the dream (4.88). Positive signs indicated Zeus, Athena, Hermes, and A pollo (all gods of sky, medicine, and wisdom); negative signs indicated prayers to protector gods, gods of the earth, and heroes (4.89.92-94 and 4.90.45-47). 55 On Regimen 4 asserts that whoever correctly understands dream signs ( tek- mer) holds the greatest power. It presents a theory of dreams as a basis for both diagnostics and preventive medicine. Whereas divination proper (the interpreta- tion of dreams of divine origin) is a precise techne , dream diagnosis is not. Conclusions The Chinese and Greek medical divinations examined above attest to a transfor-mation from divinatory me dicine, accomplished through prayer and sacrifice toward a more systematic and naturalistic medical system. The divination re-cords from Baoshan and Epidaurus both desc ribe attempts to cure illness through prayer and sacrifice, but with signifi cant differences. The Baoshan records per- tain to the ongoing iatromancies of one individual, who offers prayers to a vari-ety of gods and ancestors through rituals presumably conducted at or near his own home, but using a wide variety of personnel who use distinct techniques. Extensive sacrifices are made to a variety of Chu gods and ancestors in order to prevent calamity. Records from Wangshan and Tianxingguan suggest a similar pattern, although in no case do we know who compiled the tomb records, from what source, or for what specific purpos e. The stelae from Epidaurus, by con- trast, record the iatromancies of a number of individuals from various parts of Greece, directed toward one god, at a sacr ed site proper to him, and interpreted by the staff of that one temple. After (not before) successful encounters, they 55 For other references to dream diagnosis see Epid. 1.3.10, and Hum. 4.11-14. 97 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece dedicated offerings to the god. Several inscriptions record punishments by the god of those who failed to do so, or who denigrated his activities. These differences contexts suggest different loci of iatromantic activity. A primary problem for the Chinese diviners is diagnostic; they must understand the cause of the ailment in order to ascertain what kind of exorcistic sacrifice to use, and to whom it should be directed. There is no such need in the Asclepian tem-ple divinations. The aid of only one god is being sought, so there is no need for human diagnosis. Instead, several inscrip tions record initial attitudes by suppli- ants that range from devotion and belief to skepticism and ridicule, including some accounts of individuals made ill by the god because of their attitudes or actions. Chinese and Greek medical divination thus differ both in their techniques and in the role of the gods (and ancestors ). Both evolved and included tensions between physicians and divination specialists, but in both cases, systematizing and naturalistic medical systems overs hadowed, but did not entirely displace earlier methods of divination and prayer. In both the Huangdi neijing and the Hippocratic corpus, the preferred method of divination was oneiromancy, but with very different particulars. Dream diagnosis is a striking case of an interaction in which divination served as a resource for, rather than an opponent of, the growth of naturalism in both China and Greece. The Chinese rationale of dream divination lacks the Greek preoccupation with a dichotomy between body and soul. Its account of dreams as a language of signifiers for disturbances in the body and correlates dream elements to imbalances of yin and yang. On Regimen 4 and the dream taxono- mies of the Huangdi neijing both contain lexicons and remedies for systems in disequilibrium. Both explain the diagnostic symbolism of dreams by analogies in which changes in the macrocosm of the cosmos are mirrored in the microcosm of the body. In this sense both create a hermeneutics of \"signifiers\" (dream ele-ments) and \"signifieds\" (somatic elements). Within this similar structure, the choi ces of signifiers and signifieds are very different, and reflect very different unde rstandings of the body in early Chinese and Greek medicine. Chinese diagnostic dreams reflect yin-yang and Five Phase transformations in the visceral systems of the body; Greek diagnostic dreams mirror the condition of the body in the circuits of the heavens and the appear-ance of sun, moon, sky or stars. The Hippocratic signifiers are the heavenly bodies, the gods, water (both rain and terrestrial bodies of water), flora and fauna, various items from quotidian life, (s uch as clothing and diet), and more \"extreme\" elements of the dead, monstrosities, and warfare. The Chinese lexicon include some of these elements\u2014warfare, fires and floods\u2014but they are organ-ized more systematically around a binary system of correspondence of yin and yang, hot and cold, etc. These complementar y dream pairs include (great) rivers and fires, flying and falling, giving and taking, anger, weeping, laughter, and music. 98 EASTM 24 (2005) In both China and Greece, the close c onnections between medicine, divina- tion, magic, spirit mediumship and incantation have become clearer as historical inquiry has recognized the rationality of these practices, and shifted away from the vexed categories of \"myth,\" \"reason,\" \"evolution,\" \"superstition.\" Such categories had misrepresented fourth-cen tury medicine in both Greece and China by creating a false polarity between the view that disease was caused by gods and cured through divine intervention and the view that diseases had natural origins and should be treated by natural means. 56 But the realities in both con- texts are much more complex. In Greece, records of both exorcistic and rationalized medicine appear as early as the Homeric poems. Herodotus describes both natural and divine causes and cures of disease. Greek physicians made deliberate attempts to distance themselves from diviners, magicians, and other technical specialists, but Hippo-cratic physicians also shared much common ground with their competitors, in- cluding the common language of purifi cation and prognosis. The definitive break comes only with Aristotle, who argues systematically against the theory that dreams come from the gods, and introduces a psychobiological explanation that dreams arise from physical and psychic processes, and residual perception during sleep, when normal perceptual capacities are dormant. 57 Chinese physicians also developed naturalistic and physiological theories of illness, based on yin-yang and Five-Phase models of disease as imbalance, cor- relative cosmology, and sophisticated therapeutics that applied these schemata to herbal remedies and acumoxa therapy. The evidence of both tomb texts and the received tradition makes it clear, however, that these new models of disease coexisted with invasive and demonological theories. Iatromantic and hemerological texts from tombs at Baoshan, Fangmatan, and Yinqueshan show that divinatory, ma gical and occult practices were wide- spread among Warring States, Qin and Ha n elites. Anthologies such as the Huainanzi freely combined fang texts, hygienic, medical, philosophical, artisanal and magical knowledge. When the Han physician Chunyu Yi attacks competing practitioners, his targets are other physicians, not diviners. Physicians seem to have adopted, rather than attacked, the di vinatory rhetoric of their predecessors. Historical and anthropological studies continue to describe the continuation of a wide range of divinatory medical practices in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singa-pore. It has been suggested that, by th e quantitative measure of numbers of pa- 56 The Greek version of this naturalism was part of a broader claim by the physi- ologoi or \"inquirers into nature\" that all natural phenomena followed regular laws. See Lloyd (1979), (1987), and (1999). 57 argues for the importance of dreams as signs, and introduces a humoral theory of dreams . Excess yellow bile (hot and dry) manifests in dreams of con- flagration; black bile in dreams of smoke, mi st, or darkness (cold and dry); phlegm (cold and moist) in dreams of rain storms, snow, ice, and hail. 99 Lisa Raphals: Divination and Medicine in China and Greece tients treated, ancestral and demonological therapies were the most successful therapies in Chinese so ciety until quite recently. 58 Abbreviations and Bibliography Abbreviations Ael.
