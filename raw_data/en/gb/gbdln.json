There is a rapidly growing body of evidence showing that there might be more to ancient medical practices than we in the West tend to give it credit for. Mushrooms can be poisonous? Yes, few are. Mushrooms can make you high? Yes, some can. However, there are a group of exceptional mushrooms with incredible potential, and these are known as the \"medicinal mushrooms\". You may have heard of Shiitake, Enoki, Lion's Mane, and Oysters - not only do these all taste great, but they're also packed full of medicinal compounds. Turkey Tail, Agarikon, and Cordyceps are just a handful of others which also boast incredible benefits. Mushrooms have become my passion, and medicinal mushrooms, my fascination. After years of reading, research, and anecdotal evidence, I feel that it's time to bring this to the forefront of people's attention, as I believe they truly can provide an abundance of benefit to everybody's lives. That is why I decided to write this comprehensive healing mushrooms audiobook.

The narration should be edited a bit more professionally. - Overall - Performance - Story Mushrooms! Mushrooms are awesome! I've been a hobby grower for many years and have just started recently looking into their potential medicinal benefits. I particularly like the look of Turkey Tail and Chaga which seem to have some pretty solid evidence behind them. I enjoyed the structure of the audiobook where the author breaks down each of the mushrooms and then supplies the evidence which backs up the claims about which conditions they treat. - Overall - Performance - Story - [Jack Hoffman](/listener/amzn1.account.AECMAFYWDMUTKSXKHMDKIMRIKYFQ?ref=a_pd_The-Mu_c15_rvlsnl_2&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=BSWTVJNCWZD7TMGNN0ZK&pageLoadId=P7QPNh3LXNpOMVEc&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-18-23 Fab easy listening. I love learning about a new topic that is super interesting where you can learn a ton of new information. This audiobook was certainly that.

Too much emphasis is placed on popping pills which are synthetically created in labs. Often nature has the answer to many of our ailments. In Asia they have been preaching this for centuries but it looks like finally the west is catching up. This book has done a fantastic job at highlighting the incredible potential that mushrooms have in the treatment of a variety of different conditions from Parkinsons to cancer to diabetes. Each of the different medicinal mushrooms has a unique makeup of compounds which act on different conditions. The first step to mushrooms or any herbal medicine alternatives to actually understand the science behind them. The author has done a great job at collating the evidence for the different mushrooms he went over and laying it out in a way that is easy to understand from the readers/listeners point of view. Time to spread the word of mushrooms, listen and you won't be disappointed! - Overall - Performance - Story Excellent Audiobook! A great use of 1 credit. I have for a while known that some mushrooms are thought of as having medicinal properties but have never got a full understanding of them. This was a really great source of detailed information from a trusted source. Kris seems to have a wealth of knowledge with mushrooms and has quite clearly done his research into their medicinal properties. I've gone ahead and ordered some Lions Mane capsules which have medicinal properties to help neurological capabilities.

WOW! Such an amazing book on a topic I previously had no knowledge of. My friend first introduced the idea of medicinal mushrooms just last week when she read this book (read not listened to it) and told me to read it. I'm not much of a reader so opted to go down the audible route instead. First off, the book covers the 12 mushrooms that have medicinal properties and for each mushroom they are broken down in a digestible amount of detail. There is first of all an overview of the mushroom itself, its appearance and where you would usually expect to find it. It then goes onto list what conditions it can help treat and then backs this up with the science behind the claims. This section was particularly fascinating as it really let you understand how the compounds contained within the mushrooms acted on specific conditions to help with the symptoms. I loved the book and can honestly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in herbal medicine or the sort. - Overall - Performance - Story - [Elsie Brown](/listener/amzn1.account.AEX7LXTJ3XC5F4D7EHSRYXFFPKPQ?ref=a_pd_The-Mu_c15_rvlsnl_6&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=BSWTVJNCWZD7TMGNN0ZK&pageLoadId=P7QPNh3LXNpOMVEc&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-18-23 Fascinating, who knew! I had no clue that mushrooms had any medicinal properties at all. This audiobook was packed full with info on the various mushroom varieties which have been proven to have the most medicinal properties of all. Shiitake, Lions Mane, Turkey Tail and many others were all discussed at length by the author.

The content is good if you need an introduction to the world of medicinal mushrooms, but the narration was so bad I couldn't listen to it anymore.

Yes, there are 1 or 2 narration mistakes but for me not enough to warrant it being a major blip. Overall, I absolutely loved it and can't wait try buy some of my own mushroom extracts. - Overall - Performance - Story - Evelyn Chapman - 02-01-23 Mushrooms are medicine It's quite amazing to think that mushrooms could help with so many ailments. Western medicine has long cast doubt over Eastern practices but it looks as though things are starting to change.
