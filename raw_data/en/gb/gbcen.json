Gaynor1, Corbin Quick1, Jarvis Xihong Background: Identifying county-level characteristics associated with high coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) burden can help allow for data-driven, equitable allocation of public health intervention resources and reduce burdens on health care systems. Methods: Synthesizing data from various government and nonprofit institutions for all 3142 United States (US) counties, we studied county-level characteristics that were associated with cumulative and weekly case and death rates through 12/21/2020. We used generalized linear mixed models to model cumulative and weekly (40 repeated measures per county) cases and deaths. Cumulative and weekly models included state fixed effects and county- specific random effects. Weekly models additionally allowed covariate effects to vary by season and included US Census region-specific B-splines to adjust for temporal trends. Results: Rural counties, counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation, and counties with more people with no high school diploma and with medical comorbidities were associated with higher cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates. In the spring, urban counties and counties with more minorities and white/non- white segregation were associated with increased weekly case and death rates. In the fall, rural counties were associated with larger weekly case and death rates. In the spring, summer, and fall, counties with more residents with socioeconomic disadvantage and medical comorbidities were associated greater weekly case and death rates. Conclusions: These county-level associations are based off complete data from the entire country, come from a single modeling framework that longitudinally analyzes the US COVID-19 pandemic at the county-level, and are applicable to guiding government resource allocation policies to different US counties. Keywords: COVID-19, Health disparities, Resource allocation Background COVID-19 has had significant medical, social, and eco- nomic impacts on all communities in the United States (US), and efficient allocation of limited resources has been a constant challenge [ 1-8]. Concerns about access to testing and personal protective equipment arose dur- ing the beginning of the pandemic in January -February2020, and more recent challenges in winter 2020 -2021 in- clude vaccine distribution, deployment and uptake [ 9-14]. The high counts of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US further highlight the need to develop effi- cient resource allocation strategies. This will allow for bet- ter control of the pandemic, ensure an equitable response, and reduce burdens health care systems. Current US resource allocation efforts typically use individual-level factors to prioritize high-risk people. For example, US national COVID-19 vaccine guidelines pri- oritized healthcare workers and long-term care residents \u00a9 The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

However, studies looking at influenza and COVID-19 vaccine resource allocation strategies have found that additionally prioritizing regions in which dis- ease activity has been the greatest can further reduce the number of deaths, possibly by even a factor of two [ 17, 18]. In addition to vaccine distribution, education efforts to promote confidence in and compliance with COVID- 19 vaccines and outreach efforts to encourage the con- tinued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions can help save even more lives [ 19,20]. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of counties with high COVID-19 case and death rates can help ensure a more equitable distri- bution of resources such as vaccines and also guide community education and outreach efforts. There are also additional advantages to performing county-level analyses. Studying county-level associations can better account for regional trends not captured by individual data, as individual geographic data are often unavailable or more difficult to obtain due to data priv- acy restrictions [ 21]. Furthermore, some counties may have an underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths for various reasons [ 22,23], so there is value in consider- ing county-level characteristics in addition to reported case and death rates for making policy decisions. In this study, we use county-level demographic, race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic, and medical comorbidities var- iables synthesized from various data sources to build re- gression models that i) study county-level covariate associations with COVID-19 total case and death rates and ii) explore season-varying county-level associations with COVID-19 weekly case and death rates. These identified county-level risk factors for high COVID-19 burden can be used to inform government policy making for more efficient resource allocation to counties. Methods Data sources We obtained demographic, socioeconomic and comor- bidity data from a COVID-19 GitHub repository that drew from the US Department of Agriculture, Area Health Resources Files, County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Kaiser News Health [ 24]. We obtained COVID-19 county cases and deaths from 1/22/20 -12/21/20 from USA Facts [ 25] and additional demographic data from the US Census Bureau [ 26]. USA Facts is a non-profit organization providing data about government tax rev- enues, expenditures, and outcomes [ 25]. Area Health Resources Files is a part of the federal government 's Health Resources & Services administrations that in- cludes data on population characteristics, economics, hospital utilization, and more [ 27]. County Health Rankings & Roadmaps is a collaboration between theRobert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin that provides local community health data [28]. All data used in analyses are publicly available and can be found on our lab GitHub page ( https:// github.com/lin-lab/COVID-Health-Disparities ). County-level variables County-level cumulative and weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths as of 12/21/20 were directly obtained from USA Facts [ 29]. USA Facts aggregates data from the Centers of Disease Control and state and local public health agencies. County-level data were confirmed by referencing state and local agencies. Demographic variables were obtained from the US Census Bureau and US Department of Agriculture and included county percentage ages 20 -29 years, percentage ages 60+ years, percentage male, and metro/nonmetro status classification. US Department of Agriculture rural-urban continuum codes were grouped into three categories for the metro/nonmetro categorical variable: metro, population 1 million (code 1); metro or near metro, population 20,000 to 1 million (codes 2 -4); non- metro, population < 20,000 (codes 5 -9) [30]. County-level population distribution by race/ethnicity, including American Indian/Native Alaskan, Asian, Native Hawai- ian/Pacific Islander proportions, were directly obtained from 2019 US Census Bureau estimates [ 26]. County residential racial segregation indices of dissimilarity were obtained from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps [31]. These indices were originally calculated from data from US Census tracts from the American Community Survey 2014 -2018. Counties with less than 100 Black/ non-white residents had the index of dissimilarity set to be equal to 1. Socioeconomic variables were obtained from Area Health Resource Files [ 27] and included average house- hold size, percentage of individuals between 18 and 64 years old without health insurance, percentage in pov- erty, percentage of people aged > 25 years without a high school diploma, and percentage of people working in education/health care/social assistance. Prevalence rates for several comorbidities were ob- tained from County Health Rankings & Roadmap [28]. Comorbidities included c ounty-level percentages for: smoking, obesity, asthma, cancer, chronic ob- structive pulmonary diseas e, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, kidney disease, and stroke. Kaiser News provided total intensive care unit beds and nursing home beds. Log transformations were applied to heavily skewed variables. Additional covariate information is available in Additional Table 1.Liet al. BMC Public Health (2021) 21:1007 Page 2 of 10Cumulative county rates models We used a Poisson mixed model to model cumulative case and death counts for all 3142 US counties through 12/21/20. We included fixed effects for each state to ac- count for state-to-state variation not explained by vari- ables in the model (such as state testing rates) ,a random effect for each county to account for overdispersion and county testing rates, and an offset term for log county population (2019 US Census estimates). Continuous co- variates were scaled to have mean zero and standard de- viation one for modeling. To explicitly define the cumulative case rate model, as- sume Rijis the number of reported cases and Pijis the population of county jin state i.Rijcan be modeled by a Poisson mixed model with expected cases ij: lnij/C0/C1 \u00bclnPij/C0/C1 \u00fei\u00feX0 ij\u00feeij; where iis the state a vector of covariates, and the eijare county-specific random effects. The death and case fatality rate models follow the same structure. Total death rates modeled total deaths instead of total cases. Total case rates additionally used log total cases as an offset instead of log population size. For case fatality rate models, counties with total case counts of zero were set to one so the log offset would be defined. Univariable models included a single covariate for Xij, and separate models were fit for each outcome and each covariate combination. Multivariable models included all covariates for Xijand a single model was fit for each out- come. Estimates and confidence intervals for were used to explore associations between county-level covar- iates and COVID-19 rates. Weekly county rates models Additional modeling of weekly county case, death, and case fatality rates from 3/23/20 -12/21/20 (40 repeated measures per county) were performed to investigate how county-level associations varied by season. To define our weekly rate model, let Pijbe the population size and Rijt be the reported cases in county jof state ion week t. Then Rijtcan be modeled by a Poisson mixed model with expected cases ijt: lnijt/C0/C1 \u00bclnPij/C0/C1 \u00feX0 ijt\u00feSt\u00f0\u00de0s\u00fe~bij\u00febijt; where Xijtis a vector fixed effects (not time-varying) and covariate season interac- tions, is a vector of regression coefficients, S(t)sis a cubic spline basis for time with knots every 14 weeks (di- vides 40 repeated measures into three approximately equal windows) that varies by US Census region, ~bijare independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) county specific random effects with ~bij/C24N\u00f00;2 1\u00de, and bijtarecounty specific longitudinal random effects with AR-1 correlation structure biji.i.d N(0,V(2)). Estimation and inference proceed using penalized quasi-likelihood as implemented in the \"glmmpql \"command from the MASS package in R [ 32-34]. The weekly death rate model is the same except weekly new deaths instead of weekly case counts are the outcome variable. A time-invariant population size offset is still used. For the weekly case fatality rate model, due to delays between COVID-19 diagnosis and official re- cording of death, we explored using a one-week and three-week lag for weekly COVID-19 deaths. To illus- trate, for the one-week lag, weekly deaths on 12/21/20 were shifted back to have an offset for weekly cases on 12/14/20. Exploratory analyses suggested a one-week lag would roughly match national death peaks with case peaks (see results for additional information). One study had reported the median time from COVID pneumonia confirmation to death in a clinical setting was 13 days [35]. Giving an additional week for death certificate pro- cessing, we also chose to explore a three-week lag. For case fatality rate models, counties with total case counts of zero were set to one so the log offset would be de- fined. Additionally, if the number of weekly deaths was greater than the number of matched weekly cases, we set the weekly cases offset to be equal to the correspond- ing weekly deaths outcome. Only the metro/nonmetro categorical variable and white/non-white segregation covariates from total rates modeling were used for weekly modeling. We consoli- dated additional variables as follows. The variable non- white percentage was directly obtained from the US Census Bureau. A composite socioeconomic disadvan- tage variable was calculated as the mean of the no health insurance, poverty, and no high school diploma vari- ables. A composite comorbidities variable was calculated as the mean of the smoking, obesity, asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, kidney disease, and stroke vari- ables. Multivariable models included all covariates and their interactions with season for Xijtand a single model was fit for each outcome. Estimates and confidence in- tervals for linear contrasts of were used to explore season-varying associations between county-level covari- ates and COVID-19 rates. Data analysis All analyses were conducted in R. The following pack- ages were used in formatting data: data.table, dplyr. The following packages were used in and creating plots: ggplot2, usmap, gridExtra, tidyverse, (2021) 21:1007 Page 3 of 10these analyses is available as described in the code avail- ability section. Results Associations of county-level characteristics with cumula- tive case and death rates. There is substantial heterogeneity in total case and death rates among counties across the US. Figure 1 shows heatmaps of observed total case and death rates for all 3142 US counties as of 12/21/2020. Cumulative case and death rates tended to be highest among Midwestern and Southern states. Associational relative risks fo r the multiplicative increase in county COVID-19 cumulative case, death, and case fatal- ity rates were calculated for a one standard deviation in- crease of a county-level variable. Figure 2shows univariable and multivariable case rate RR (relative risk). Figure 3shows univariable and multivariable death rate RR. Univariable analyses show that more rura l counties and counties with more racial minorities, racial segregation, socioeconomic disadvantage, and increased health comorbidities tend to have higher total case and death rates. After adjustment in multivariable analyses, more rural counties, and counties with increased white/non-whit e segregation, poverty, no high school diplomas, diabetes, heart failure, and hyperten- sion tended to have higher total case and/or death rates. Many variables that were statistically significant in uni- variable analysis were not in multivariable analysis. Add- itional Fig. 1plots Spearman correlations for all covariates and shows how many of these variables are correlated. More rural counties tend to have more males residents, residents 60+ years, and fewer minorities. Black/African American percentage tended to be positively correlated with socioeconomic and health comorbidity variables. So- cioeconomic and health comorbidity variables tended to be positively correlated. Spatial patterns among different covariates also exist. Covariate heatmaps are in Additional Figs. 2and 3. Black percentages, stroke, heart failure,hypertension, and kidney disease percentages are all great- est in the Southern states. Hispanic percentages are great- est along the Southwestern states. Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease percentages are elevated along the Appalachian Mountains. We also explored including state testing rates as a covari- ate for modeling. However, we found this did not change any estimated associations ad justed for demographic, race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic, and comorbidity variables be- cause we already controlled for fixed state effects using state dummy variables. Adding state testing rates only changed the estimated state fixed effects through re- parametrization. Additional details are in the Additional Methods . Season-varying associations of county-level character- istics with weekly case and death rates. We further explored how county-level covariate asso- ciations with COVID-19 rates varied over the course of the pandemic. Figure 4shows total case and death rates were highest in the Northeast during the spring, in- creased in the South during the summer, and increased everywhere including rural areas during the fall. Longitudinal modeling of weekly county case and death rates was performed. Table 1shows multivariable relative risks for weekly case and death rates. During the spring, more urban counties and counties with more racial mi- norities and racial residential segregation tended to have greater case and death rates. As the pandemic progressed, during the fall, more rural areas tended to have greater case and death rates. Socioeconomic variables such as no high school diploma and medical comorbidity variables such as hypertension were associated with increased case and death rates throughout the fall, summer, and spring. Associations of county-level characteristics with cumulative case fatality rates Next, we performed exploratory total case fatality rates analyses. Assuming the ascertainment rates of reported Fig. 1 Observed total case and death rates. Observed cumulative case and death rates through 12/21/2020 for all 3142 US countiesLiet al. BMC Public Health (2021) 21:1007 Page 4 of 10cases vary by state or county, and by including fixed state effects and county random effects, the case fatality rate and infection fatality rate regression analyses pro- duced identical results for covariate associations (see Additional Methods for further discussion). Observed case fatality rates did not appear to have any obvious geographic patterns (Additional Fig. 4). The case fatality rate results had similar directions to the primary deathrate results, and counties with more residents age 60+ years were associated with increased case fatality rates on both univariable and multivariable analyses (Add- itional Fig. 5). However, these analyses are likely subject to bias due to several factors, such as differential under- estimation of the total number of cases by race and eth- nicity and selection bias of subjects who have been tested [ 22,36].

BMC Public Health (2021) 21:1007 Page 5 of 10Season-varying associations of county-level characteristics with weekly case fatality rates Lastly, we look at case fatality rates over time. Additional Fig.6shows longitudinal trends of COVID-19 case fatal- ity rates over time. Additional Fig. 6A shows that na- tional death rates lagged by about 1 week peak at the same time as national case rates for USAFacts data, likely due to delays between COVID-19 testingconfirmation and official recording of COVID-19 deaths. Additional Fig. 6B does not show any distinct geographic case fatality rate patterns, but case fatality rates appear to be decreasing in all regions over time. Longitudinal modeling of case rates adjusted for a one-week reporting lag (ex. weekly deaths ending on 12/ 21/20 were matched with weekly cases ending on 12/14/ 20) and three-week lag.

BMC Public Health (2021) 21:1007 Page 6 of 10multivariable season-varying weekly case fatality relative risks. Counties with more racial minorities and segrega- tion tended to have increased case fatality rates in the spring, whereas rural counties tended to have greater case fatality rates during the fall. Counties with larger percentages of medical comorbidities tended to have in- creased case fatality relative risks throughout the spring, summer, and fall. Results were similar using either the one-week or three-week lag. However, just as with the cumulative case fatality rate analyses, various reporting biases exist. Additional challenges include matching in- dividuals death and case dates using aggregated data and instability from low weekly case count offsets, especially for sparsely populated areas. Discussion Using county-level data obtained from various govern- ment and nonprofit sources, we explore associations be- tween county-level covariates and total case and death rates. We find that rural counties, counties with more white/non-white segregation, and counties with in- creased socioeconomic disadvantage and medical co- morbidity percentages all tend to have greater cumulative case and death rates. These county-level findings are consistent with individual-level results from other studies but are more directly applicable to inform- ing government resource allocation policies to counties. Improving public health resource distribution to vulner- able US counties can help reduce the total COVID-19 burden. To provide a resource allocation example, these county-level associations can be used to inform state policies for optimal and equitable vaccine distribution to counties. The Center for Disease Control and Preven- tion 's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices releases recommendations for vaccine distribution [ 15, 16], but state governments ultimately decide how to dis- tribute vaccines and encourage vaccine uptake [ 37]. Be- cause we included state fixed effects in modeling, our county-level associations are with respect to counties within a state. State government policy makers can thus consider increased allocation of vaccines and other re- sources to counties with greater poverty rates and lower higher school graduation rates (and other important identified features). Increased education and outreach programs may also be directed at such counties. Our county-level association analysis results are con- sistent with and complement results from various individual-level studies. Racial minorities have been found to have increased COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates in the spring [ 23,38-41]. Older patients are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and have greater mortality rates [ 42]. Household size is known to affect COVID-19 contact and transmissionrates [ 43]. Heart failure, hypertension, and stroke are im- portant biological and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality [ 42,44]. However, county- level results are more directly applicable to guiding re- source allocation policy at a county level, so there is still additional value in quantifying such associations at the county-level. Our analyses of weekly COVID-19 case and death rates substantiate how COVID-19 has disproportionately af- fected various vulnerable populations at different times. The early stages of the pandemic in the spring had dispro- portionately affected racially diverse and socioeconomi- cally disadvantaged urban areas. More recently in the fall, predominately white, rural, socioeconomically disadvan- taged areas have been hit harder. Most research on the COVID-19 pandemic has focused on urban areas, and more studies of rural areas are needed to better characterize the experience of these diverse 46 million in- dividuals [ 5,45]. Strengths, limitations, and future work We are primarily interested in studying how county- level characteristics are associated with their cumulative case and death rates. These county-level associations should not be interpreted as individual level associations. Associations observed at an aggregated level may be in the same direction, different direction, or not exist at the individual level [ 46]. As seen in Additional Figs. 2and3 and noted earlier in the results section, most county- level covariates have a clear geographic pattern that likely makes estimating individual-level associations dif- ficult. For example, counties with more residents age 60+ years were associated with lower case rates on uni- variable and multivariable analyses. It is possible that elderly people are more careful to avoid exposures so there might a negative association between age 60+ years and case rates at the individual-level. However, nursing homes have also been a publicly known and tragic means of COVID-19 transmission, and one might hypothesize this factor would contribute to a positive as- sociation between age 60+ years and case rates at the county level. Ecological estimates capture both individ- ual and county-level effects, and it is difficult to separate these estimates without individual-level data [ 47]. Future work may additionally account for clustered exposures among vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents and prisoners. Multiple covariates are correlated in multivariable modeling and further complicate confounding issues in estimation and inference. For example, county smoking percentage is positively associated with cumulative case and death rates on univariable analyses, but is negatively associated with both rates on multivariable analyses. Per- centage smoking is highly correlated with percentageLiet BMC Public Health (2021) 21:1007 Page 7 of 10chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hypertension (Spearman correlation 0.62, 0.59, and 0.51 respectively), and these strong correlations may partly contribute to the flipped association observed in multi- variable analyses when all variables are simultaneously adjusted for. For exploratory weekly case fatality rate analyses, we used a one-week and three-week lag in modeling weekly deaths. However, the delay between a reported case and death is likely to have changed across time (as treatment efficacy and government reporting infrastructure im- proved), and this delay may also vary between counties (different counties have different processes for reporting cases and deaths). Additional methodological research is needed to better account for this important issue. Lastly, as with all observational studies, associational findings do not imply causality. However, the focus of our study is on identifying county-level characteristics of vulnerable counties to help guide resource allocation ef- forts, not estimating individual-level associations. There- fore, while very important to keep in mind, these limitations are less relevant to our primary study goals. There are various strengths to this study. Studying county-level associations can better account for regional trends not captured by individual data, as individual geo- graphic data are often unavailable due to data privacy re- strictions [ 21]. Because of reporting biases in COVID-19 cases and deaths [ 22,23], there is value in considering county-level characteristics in addition to reported case and death rates for making policy decisions. In the cu- mulative rates model, state fixed effects can account for varying reporting rates between states and county ran- dom effects can account for varying reporting rates that occur between counties (see Additional Methods for more detailed discussion). Next steps to improving ana- lyses can include obtaining data at finer geographic reso- lution such as at the US census tract or zip code level. Additional variables such as neighborhood testing rates, health literacy, political polarization, and access to COVID-19 treatments are worth investigating. Conclusion Multi-faceted efforts are needed to combat the pandemic and optimize COVID-19 resource allocation. Rural counties and counties with more residential racial segre- gation, less residents with high school diplomas, and greater prevalences of medical comorbidities have been significantly impacted by COVID-19. Such counties are important to prioritize and may require increased sup- port. Intervention measures can include policies requir- ing face coverings, providing personal protective equipment to essential workers, and ensuring prioritized and robust testing, tracing, and isolation infrastructure. Outreach efforts can include vaccination and maskwearing education by engaging community leaders and health care providers. Our identified county-level associ- ations are applicable to the entire US and can help in- form equitable resource allocation, reduce burdens on health care systems, and minimize additional loss of life.
