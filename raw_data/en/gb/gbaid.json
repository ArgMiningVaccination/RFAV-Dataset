PhD; KabatZinn, Jon PhD; Schumacher, Katherine MA; Sheridan, John F. PhD Abstract Objective:: The underlying changes in biological processes that are associated with reported changes in mental and physical health in response to meditation have not been systematically explored. We performed a randomized, controlled study on the effects on brain and immune function of a wellknown and widely used 8week clinical training program in mindfulness meditation applied in a work environment with healthy employees. Methods:: We measured brain electrical activity before and immediately after, and then 4 months after an 8week training program in mindfulness meditation. Twentyfive subjects were tested in the meditation group. A waitlist control group (N = 16) was tested at the same points in time as the meditators. At the end of the 8week period, subjects in both groups were vaccinated with influenza vaccine. Results:: We report for the first time significant increases in leftsided anterior activation, a pattern previously associated with positive affect, in the meditators compared with the nonmeditators. We also found significant increases in antibody titers to influenza vaccine among subjects in the meditation compared with those in the waitlist control group. Finally, the magnitude of increase in leftsided activation predicted the magnitude of antibody titer rise to the vaccine. Conclusions:: These findings demonstrate that a short program in mindfulness meditation produces demonstrable effects on brain and immune function. These findings suggest that meditation may change brain and immune function in positive ways We Teach Mindfulness meditation in one day workshop For it Contact 919422054551,919146364940 or send mail to 2sipeedu@gmail.com The meditation techniques that we teach are non-religious and not based on the teachings of any particular group or philosophy. They are meant to be accessible to a wide range of people and easy to practice. Our broad experience has shown us that every person \"connects\" to meditation differently - what works for one person may not work for another. That is why we teach a variety of meditation and relaxation techniques, so that everyone can find at least one that works for them ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` - Meditation Increases cortical thickness in areas related to paying attention See the research paper Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness [Sara W. The publisher's final edited version of this article is available at [Neurorepor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=16272874)t Abstract Previous research indicates that long-term meditation practice is associated with altered resting electroencephalogram patterns, suggestive of long lasting changes in brain activity. We hypothesized that meditation practice might also be associated with changes in the brain's physical structure. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between-group differences in prefrontal cortical thickness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age-related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for experience-dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice. Introduction Meditation is a form of mental exercise that has become a popular in US health practice. Regular practice of meditation is reported to produce changes in mental state and resting electroencephalogram patterns that persist beyond the time-period of active practice [ [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R1)]. We hypothesized that regular meditation practice should also result in significant changes in the cortical structure in regions that are routinely engaged during this mental exercise. To test this hypothesis, we used magnetic resonance imaging to visualize differences in the thickness of the cerebral cortex of experienced meditation practitioners. This form of meditation does not utilize mantra or chanting. Rather, the main focus of Insight meditation is the cultivation of attention and a mental capacity termed 'mindfulness', which is a specific nonjudgmental awareness of present-moment stimuli without cognitive elaboration [ [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R2)]. Formal practice involves sustained mindful attention to internal and external sensory stimuli. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that between-group and experience-dependent differences in cortical thickness would be found in brain regions involved in attention and sensory processing, thereby showing evidence of cortical plasticity. Participants and methods Twenty participants with extensive training in Insight meditation were recruited from local meditation communities. These participants were not monks, but rather typical Western meditation practitioners who incorporate their practice into a daily routine involving career, family, friends and outside interests. Two participants were full-time meditation teachers, three were part-time yoga or meditation teachers and the rest meditated an average of once a day for 40 min, while pursuing traditional careers in fields such as healthcare and law. On average, participants had 9.1 \u00b1 7.1 years of meditation experience and practiced 6.2 \u00b1 4.0 h per week. Participants were required to have participated in at least 1 week-long Insight meditation retreat, which entails approximately 10 h of meditation per day. Fifteen control participants with no meditation or yoga experience were also recruited. The meditation and control participants were matched for sex (meditators 65% male, controls 67%), age (meditators 38.2 years old, controls 36.8 years old), race (both groups 100% Caucasian) and years of education (meditators 17.3 years, controls 17.4 years). All participants were physically and psychologically healthy. Two meditation participants were left-handed; exclusion of the left-handed participants did not significantly alter results. All participants provided written, informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The present methods utilized a well-validated computational approach to measure the thickness of the cerebral cortex [ [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R3), [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R4)]. Cortical thickness was estimated from two magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) structural images collected from each participant that were then motion-corrected and averaged together to form a single high-resolution image [ [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R3)- [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R5)]. An initial estimate of the gray/white matter boundary was constructed by classifying all white matter voxels in a magnetic resonance imaging volume using a combination of geometric and intensity-based information. A surface-deformation procedure was then used to obtain subvoxel resolution in the gray/white boundary and in the pial surface using a combination of smoothness constraints and intensity terms. The resulting cortical surface models for all participants were aligned to an atlas of cortical folding patterns using a high-dimensional nonlinear registration technique. Results The mean thickness across the entire cortex did not differ significantly between the groups for either hemisphere (P>0.10), indicating that it was not the case that the cortex of meditators is nonspecifically thicker everywhere. Statistical thickness-difference maps constructed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff statistics (one-tailed, -level P=0.05), however, indicated that significant differences in the 'distribution' of thickness existed between groups across both hemispheres (k=3.89, P=0.0001), and in each hemisphere separately (k=3.02, P=0.0025 for left hemisphere; k=2.49, P=0.013 for right hemisphere). This finding indicates that the pattern of relative thickness across each hemisphere was different between groups. Protected by significant unidirectional results for the omnibus test for each hemisphere, an unpaired t-test was performed to test for specific loci of significant between-group differences in regional cortical thickness. Specifically, we tested the a priori hypotheses that differences would be observed within prefrontal, interoceptive and unimodal sensory cortical regions. A false discovery rate of 0.05 corresponding to an uncorrected P=3.5 \u00d7 10-4 was used to correct for multiple comparisons [ [6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R6)]. Within the search territory, a large region of right anterior insula (P=1.2 \u00d7 10-5) and right middle and superior frontal sulci corresponding approximately to Brodmann areas (BA) 9 and 10 (P=1.8 \u00d7 10-5) were significantly thicker in meditators than in 10-4) and a small sulcus, (BA 3a, somatosensory cortex, 10-4) showed trends towards a significantly thicker cortex in meditation participants than in controls. Analysis of the right frontal BA 9/10 subregion resulted in a significant age by group interaction, F(1,31)=10.85, P=0.002, with typical age-related decreases observed in the control group [r(13)=-0.76, P=0.001] but not in the meditation group [r(18)=-0.05, P=0.83]. Significant interactions were not observed in any other brain region. Discussion Our data indicate that regular practice of meditation is associated with increased thickness in a subset of cortical regions related to somatosensory, auditory, visual and interoceptive processing. Further, regular meditation practice may slow age-related thinning of the frontal cortex. We hypothesized that meditation practice should promote neural plasticity in regions that are routinely engaged during formal practice. Many factors including age, sex, genetics, neuropathology and psychopathology [ [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R4), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R5), thickness of cortex nonspecifically, confounding these analyses. Perhaps the largest of these confounds is the effect of age. The rate of age-dependent thinning is highly variable across the cortical surface [ [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/#R5)]. We teach Mindfulness meditation in one day workshop.
