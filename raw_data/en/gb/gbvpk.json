A person is considered as autistic when he/she has an unusual and atypical development of [communication](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/communication-essays) skillfulness, societal dexterity and reasoning. This condition is more common in men as compared to [women](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/women-essays). An autistic child demonstrates the [symptoms](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/symptoms-essays) of autism until he/she is about two to three years old. In some cases, children are identified as autistic even before the mentioned age group (\"autism,\" 2013). The controversy over the association between autism and childhood vaccinations is still a hot issue since the idea was published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield, a British researcher and gastroenterologist, in The Lancet. According to him, the MMR (a very common vaccine for children) that is used to help children fight against measles, mumps and rubella, was perhaps the cause of increasing rates of autism. After a [research](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/research-essays) of fourteen years, his [theory](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/theory-essays) was debunked by numerous experts as an unsubstantiated one. They rejected his idea in 2012 claiming it as 'bad [science](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/science-essays)' as they were not successful in finding any legitimate association between autism and vaccinations (childhood). However, the controversy has not calmed down and a lot of [parents](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/parents-essays) worldwide still think of vaccinations as a frightful step for their children [safety](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/safety-essays) (Mattson, 2000). After the so-called \"discovery\" by Wakefield, some parents made a declaration that several vaccines contain a mercury-containing preservative which was the main cause of autism. On the other hand, it has been testified by scientists over and over again that childhood vaccines are not harmful and autism is not a result of childhood vaccinations. Nevertheless, parents have continued to be fearful of vaccines (Offit, 2010). The rejection couldn't help to recover the damage that Wakefield's theory had done. The world witnessed a drop in immunization rates and rise in disease rates. In particular, the parents in the United Kingdom rejected the idea of getting their children vaccinated. Despite the fact that autism is not caused by childhood vaccinations, the medical researchers and other concerned groups are still confused about the autism causes and the increasing autism rates. There is not a single person who can claim to know the root cause of this mental/brain disorder due to which a child is unable to communicate, interact and reason appropriately and normally (Mattson, 2000). In some cases, the possible causes of autism are identified to be \"prenatal factors such as exposure to rubella, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down's syndrome, or postnatal factors such as infantile spasms and herpes simplex, encephalitis\" (Mattson, 2000). However, the theory that has gained popularity regarding the causes of autism is connected to a genetic variant that triggers in the womb of the [mother](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/mother-essays) by a toxin/virus found in the [environment](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/environment-essays) (Mattson, 2000). The advocates of Wakefield's theory consider it as an authentic and plausible theory due to the autism-occurrence timing. They support the theory for the reason that the communication and behavioral problems that are demonstrated by a child are easily observable around the same age when he/she gets his/her vaccination shots that also include the MMR. However, the experts who have debunked this theory consider this [scenario](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/scenario-essays) as a total coincidence. Another reason that is given by the advocates of Wakefield's theory for its credibility is that autism rates have increased apparently in the recent years. Although it was in 1943 that this abnormal brain disability was described, its prevalence was never studied or published as far as United States is concerned. The U.S.A. officials always depended on the estimates of researchers or the studies conducted in other [countries](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/countries-essays). However, the increase in the rate of autism is apparent in the course of time (Mattson, 2000). The Wakefield's Theory is also supported by a lot of parents whose experiences convinced them that their children became autistic with the involvement of the vaccines. Although no scientific theory supports the theory presented by Andrew Wakefield, there is a marked increase in the disease rates that consequently dropped the vaccination rates. On the other hand, experts firmly believe that immunizations are the most significant achievement in pediatrics (Mattson, 2000). As far as the credibility of Wakefield's theory is concerned, it was rejected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The reason was simple. The research group that was led by Andrew Wakefield was not able to find the symptoms of any measles virus in the autistic patients' bowel tissues (in subsequent studies). The Wakefield Theory also lost its authenticity when about five hundred children and teens were studied by the British government as a response. The results debunked the theory completely as no evidence was obtained in the months after vaccination regarding the regression of [children's](https://www.paperdue.com/topic/children-essays) [ ...

Some of these children were even part of Wakefield's original study. (Schreibman, 2005) This disclosure may have laid some doubts to rest but is still not enough to answer the question whether there is actually a link between MMR and MMR vaccination and relationship to autism among children study proposal Background The MMR vaccine is meant to give protection against measles, mumps and rubella diseases. The vaccine contains live measles, mumps and rubella viruses which have been significantly weakened or attenuated. These attenuated viruses trigger or stimulate the human immune system but does not cause disease in a healthy individual. This vaccine should not be given to individuals with suppressed immunity or Autism is one of the most severe and disruptive of all childhood disorders. It is a communicative disorder that interferes with an individual's ability to form social relationships, as well as to communicate with others. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD's) officially belong to a group of illnesses known as 'developmental disabilities'. They are characterized by problems with social and communication skills of varying degrees (Schechter & Grether, 20). Autistic people also V. ANALYSIS The work of Maxwell McCombs entitled: \"The Agenda-Setting Function of the Press\" relates the fact that the press plays a primary role in the life of the public and influences the focus of attention of individuals and makes provision of the \"facts and opinions that shape perspectives on topics of the day.\" (2005) McCombs explains that 'agenda-setting' of the press works to influence the issues in the news and The Article concludes by reiterating the IOM's recommendation to continue with the current immunization programs in the absence of any strong and concrete evidence on the contrary. [Michelle Meadows] The last few years have triggered intense debate on the autism and vaccination topic with research results supporting both sides. A study by weibel et.al (1998) concluded by stating a rare but important link between measles vaccine and brain encephalopathy among Vaccine and Austism Parents have every right to be concerned about their child's health and well- being and for this reason; it's not very hard to fathom why they got seriously worried over an important research study that established a link between MMR vaccine and autism.
