In the midst of the busyness and stress of our daily work and personal life, many professionals find refuge in practicing Meditation either to improve their well-being (e.g. manage stress, calm down, improve productivity, or any other therapeutic usages), for spiritual purposes, or both. In his amazing book (Practical Meditation: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide), Giovanni Dienstmann takes us through a whirlwind tour covering many meditation techniques and practices from different traditions and schools, in highly accessible and readable format and language. Although his coverage of the topic is very comprehensive one, I would like to see Stoic meditation techniques and the Relaxation Response techniques (i.e. Dr. Herbert Benson) in the future edition of the book. Likewise Giovanni's blog (https://liveanddare.com/) is one of the best I know about these topics. Gratsie Giovanni Dienstmann The major gripe I have with this book is the font and font weight - the text is sometimes nearly invisible to the eye within much of the colored illustrations. A sensible contrast would have also helped lift the text from the background. Regarding the content, this is a fine book. It is basically a survey of nearly all the different meditative practices (such as Vipassana and Mindfulness) and a gentle and practical guide to getting into a regular meditative practice. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone curious about meditation having questions like \"how do I meditate?\", \"which kind of practice is best for me?\", \"why would I even When I got this book I thought how many ways of meditating can their be. One or two different ways. I thought this book was great. I liked the pages about meditation positions. I thought I could do the Burmese. No, I could not do it. maybe some day. Reading about the different meditations was fun. So many to chose from. I also liked the two pages about how to be more creative. A fun book to read. Good (if brief) overview of the many types of meditation practice. Probably a good starting point for those just starting out, if they aren't overwhelmed by the number of different styles. Some illustrations were not showing up the EPUB version, at least with my ebook reader (Aldiko). Probably ~50 pages worth of content, with lots of drawings and white space. This being the first book on meditation for me and I could not have stumbled upon a better one considering my preference for a introductory, secular, rational and most importantly comprehensive overview on Meditation. My compliments to the author for the brevity and lucidness in the writing- it was fun...finally thanx for the extensive bibliography. Title/Author: Practical Meditation by Giovanni Dienstmann Series/Standalone: standalone Subject/Topic: meditation for beginners Book Format: print Length: 185 pages Well Written/Editor Needed: Well written Would I Recommendy?: Yes Personal Thoughts: This is a great book for those new to meditation or those interested in learning about different types of meditation. I liked the formatting, which made it fun and easy to understand. I wish he'd gone into more details on the Tai Chi section, because Tai Chi is so much more than one movement. I also wish he'd given more examples of mantras in that section for those who need suggestions to aid in coming up with their own. But other than that, this is a really great book and I have found several types of meditation I would like to try for myself. "}
