At Balance Chiropractic our goal is to find the cause of your problem and fix it, not just mask the symptoms. Chiropractic care is a safe, gentle, and natural way to alleviate stress from nerves and optimize health and wellness. Drs. Matthew & Amanda Ostrowski have been chiropractors since 2002 & 2003 and want to help you and your family live a pain-free, healthier, and happier life! HAPPY PATIENTS As a mom of two young children I do a lot of lifting, bending, and carrying. The treatments I receive have really helped alleviate my neck and lower back pain and stiffness. My husband suffered whiplash in a car accident and is still being treated. He is making good progress. Lana C. When I first contacted the office I was suffering severe lower back pain, moderate upper back pain, and neck pain. It was negatively impacting my work and my life at home. My life was being controlled by pain. On my initial visit I was greeted by welcoming and friendly staff. I was assessed by Dr. Amanda and she was exceptional, knowledgeable, and professional. After only a couple of treatments I saw and felt positive results and progress. Within a month my mobility was full, I was sleeping through the night, and I was no longer having problems at work and at home. My overall sense of well-being has improved since chiropractic care. I have more energy, my focus & concentration have improved and I am able to move about and continue my physical activities with ease. My headaches have diminished as well. My body functions are also improving including digestion and elimination. I also sleep better at night. Connie M.
