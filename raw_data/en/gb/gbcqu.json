Previous studies showed that [exercise]activities could enhance the anti-viral [neutralizing antibody]titers after [vaccination]. We developed a novel digital [device], a [mobile application]based on an [algorithm]to regulate [physical activity]which are boosting innate and adaptive [immune systems]against [virus]. SAT-008 aimed to improve the activity of immune [cells]and the [immune response]in the body, which can be induced by [software]-designed levels of daily [physical activities]. [Method](s) A randomized, open-label, and controlled study was conducted for 13 weeks (Oct 20 to Jan 21). A total of 42 healthy [adults] [aged]24 to 46 years were recruited for this study and 32 among them served for [analysis]. Subjects were administered a single- [dose] [quadrivalent influenza vaccine]. The [control group]maintained daily [life]without using SAT-008, while the experimental group used SAT-008 during the study. Result(s) Compared to the [control group], the experimental group showed a significant increase in [neutralizing antibody]titers of [antigen]subtype B Yamagata lineage after 4 weeks of [vaccination]and [antigen]subtype B [Victoria]lineage after 12 weeks of [vaccination](P < 0.05), whereas the controls did not reach a significant level in any antibody titer. In the case of type 'A' [influenza], there was no significant difference in [neutralizing antibody]titers between control and experimental groups. Stimulated [NK cells]of subjects in the [control group]decreased significantly between 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the [vaccination](P < 0.05) while the subjects in the experimental group slightly increase the NK activity between 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the [vaccination], however, there was no significance. The interaction effect was observed between control and experimental groups at weeks 4 and 12 by subsequent [analysis](P < 0.05). Conclusion(s) We conclude that a novel approach using the digital [device]may [play]an important [role]to enhance the ... LILACS LIS "}
