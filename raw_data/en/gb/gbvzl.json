The following substances are recommended for neutralizing covid injection spike proteins, rendering them unable to cause further damage to cells: N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) Fennel tea Pine needle tea Comfrey leaf Glutathione Star anise tea St. John's wort Vitamin C The plant compounds from the above list contain shikimic acid, which may help to counteract the formation of blood clots while reducing some of the toxic effects of spike proteins. Spike proteins attach to ACE2 receptors in the cells, impairing their normal function. This blockage can alter tissue functioning and trigger autoimmune disease, as well as cause abnormal bleeding or clotting, including jab-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine (with zinc), quercetin (with fisetin (a flavonoid) all help to protect ACE2 receptors from being flooded with damaging spike proteins. Covid injections also trigger a spike in interleukin 6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine. The following substances may help to detox and remedy this situation: Boswellia serrata (frankincense) Black fatty acids Jasmine tea extract Curcumin Cinnamon Apigenin Resveratrol Vitamin D3 (with vitamin K) Magnesium Spices Black pepper Sage In order to gain entry into your cells, SARS-CoV-2 must first bind to either an ACE2 or CD147 receptor on the cell. The spike protein subunit must then be proteolytically cleaved, or cut - without this cleavage, the virus would simply attach to the receptor and stop there. It turns out that SARS-CoV-2 has a novel furin cleavage site that is not present in natural coronaviruses, which is why many believe it was created in a laboratory. Some powerful natural furin inhibitors proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, enabling host cell fusion of the virus.\" Inhibiting serine protease could help to prevent spike protein activation and viral entry into cells, which can be done with the following foods and substances: Green tea Blue green algae N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) Potato tubers Soybeans (organic, of course!) Boswellia As you probably noticed, many of the above remedies are foods. All you have to do is eat them and your body takes care of the rest. (Related: Broccoli and especially broccoli sprouts have [been shown](https://naturalnews.com/2022-02-02-molecule-broccoli-brain-repair-spike-protein-damage.html) to repair spike protein damage throughout the body.) With that said, cutting out processed and other pro-inflammatory foods is a great place to start in ridding your body of spike proteins and other jab toxins. This includes cutting out vegetable (seed) oils, many of which are highly refined and highly inflammatory. Restricting when you eat to a six- to eight-hour window, also known as time-restricted eating, is also helpful because it has been shown to improve mitochondrial health and metabolic flexibility. Time-restricted eating also increases autophagy, an important process by which your body vacuums up and cleans out damaged cells. WCH explains it like this: \"This method ... is used to induce autophagy, which is essentially a recycling process that takes place in human cells, where cells degrade and recycle components. Autophagy is used by the body to eliminate damaged cell proteins and can destroy harmful viruses and bacteria post-infection.\" Using a sauna, preferably with infrared capability, is another powerful way to rid your body of toxins while increasing longevity. The heat stress from a sauna increases plasma volume and blood flow to the heart and muscles, which in turn increases athletic endurance. Sauna-induced heat shock also increases muscle mass by enhancing protein uptake and the production of human growth hormone (HGH). If you need a simpler place to start on the diet front, WCH recommends adding the following 10 essential compounds to your health strategy: Vitamin D NAC Nigella seed Zinc Curcumin Vitamin C Ivermectin Quercetin Magnesium Milk thistle extract It is also highly recommended that you check out the [full WCH spike protein detox guide](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/spike-protein-detox-guide/) for specific dosage information. This is especially important for ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, as both of these are pharmaceutical drugs. Be sure to read the dosage information for the natural remedies as well since it is based on optimal therapeutic potential.
