It is the state of complete physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease. What is Holistic Medicine? Good cell health is essential for the body to function properly. When you don't take the correct measures to nourish the millions of cells that make up your body, the internal process will become sluggish and lead to poor health. The whole person is made up of interdependent parts and if one part is not working properly, all the other parts will be affected. Physical, emotional and spiritual imbalances can negatively affect overall health. Holistic Medicine is a form of healing that considers the whole person. The word holistic means, \"dealing with the whole.\" A holistic practitioner not only gives attention to the physical ailment or condition, but also the emotional, mental, and even spiritual aspects that aggravate the condition. The holistic practitioner bridges the gap between traditional medical treatment and natural preventive care in one well rounded healthcare practice. Having an integrated approach means preserving and maintaining a healthy body, mind, and spirit. The primary goal of Holistic Medicine is to gain proper balance in life. Herbalism: LEAVES + FLOWERS + ROOTS = MEDICINE Herbal medicines are plant-based medicines made from different combinations of plant parts such as leaves, flowers or roots. Each part can have different medicinal uses and the many types of chemical constituents require different extraction methods. Herbal medicine is not alternative medicine. Herbal Medicine is the \"original\" medicine. Synthetic medications were discovered roughly 100 years ago. Humans have been using herbal remedies for thousands of years. When used correctly, medicinal plants can help treat a variety of conditions, and in many cases, have fewer side effects than conventional drugs. Herbal Medicine is suitable for people of any age. Each patient is treated as an individual - a Medical Herbalist recognizes that no two patients are the same.
