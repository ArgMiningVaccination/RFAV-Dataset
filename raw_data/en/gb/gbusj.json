Why Naturopathic Medicine? Why Now? Today, the health of Americans and the nation's healthcare system are significantly challenged by an increasing incidence of non-communicable and lifestyle-related preventable diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, compounded by a sharp escalation1 in multimorbidities that present specific challenges2 to primary care environments. With declining life expectancy3 and decreasing access to care, especially for vulnerable individuals, the US has been engulfed by a global pandemic that further burdens its population and health system. In addition to millions of lives lost and monumental pressure on its heroic healthcare workforce, the profession of medicine and the public it serves remain vulnerable to this and to other unpredictable threats to public health. Licensed naturopathic physicians contribute an accessible, effective model of primary and specialty clinical care4 to address these unprecedented current and future healthcare challenges. Its comprehensive systems approach to clinical decision making addresses underlying contributions to disease and incorporates behavioral, lifestyle, and other interventions to support disease prevention and to improve patient outcomes. To achieve their patients' goals this model supports the interprofessional collaboration of naturopathic physicians with other healthcare professionals. Naturopathic physicians working in integrative settings provide an exceptionally well qualified experience base for fostering high performance, cost effective team-based care.The guiding principles and models of naturopathic medicine include: The Naturopathic Therapeutic OrderTM 5, a clinical heuristic of whole person assessment and treatment that addresses underlying causes of disease, and uses the least invasive means necessary to achieve optimal patient health. The Naturopathic Determinants of Health5 a comprehensive focus on the complex internal and external factors that affect health, and help both physician and patient target health optimization, as well as disease prevention. Six Principles of Naturopathic Practice6 that guide the way in which physicians apply their clinical model in practice that include and support its 'Whole Person, Whole Health' approach to clinical care, leading with the healing power of nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae7) that recognizes that with the proper support, the body has the natural capacity to recover from injury and illness (both physical and mental/emotional). Naturopathic Medicine Is: Comprehensive in its approach to whole health, whole person primary care. Focused on addressing underlying causes of acute and chronic diseases. Dedicated to health promotion, minimally invasive therapies, and reducing healthcare costs. Individualized to engage patients and to support health-related lifestyle and behavioral change. This white paper provides supporting evidence for the profession's significant and unique contributions to preventive, whole person care and models of integrative clinical practice, to: Inform readers about the naturopathic medical profession in order to strengthen the US healthcare workforce by delineating the unique clinical practice of naturopathic physicians, and their contribution to both individual patient and population health.

The profession stands ready to provide training for its model of care to collaborate with other healthcare professionals and to share its knowledge, while working toward the collective goal of enhancing whole health care for an increasingly receptive public. * For details about the global practice of naturopathic medicine, please see: Overview of international naturopathic practice and patient characteristics: results from a cross-sectional study in 14 countries.8executive summaryexecutive summary ...cont. Naturopathic Physicians: Collaborative Partners to Address Current Health System Needs Can naturopathic physicians help address current healthcare challenges? Despite its world-class technological and scientific advancements, there is widespread evidence that the US healthcare system requires our collaborative effort to rectify its greatest barriers. With the highest spending9 on health of any other developed nation, the US still incurs the highest rate of hospitalizations, preventable deaths, and incidence of chronic disease. A brief review of recent system-wide government, industry, and private initiatives throughout the last decade reveals an array of barriers in rectifying this healthcare crisis: Workforce Decline : A rapidly declining workforce of physicians and other providers - a longstanding issue that has weakened a system encumbered by pandemic requirements:The Future of Whole Person Health Care A highly fragmented and complex healthcare system, especially for those with chronic conditions, has led to decreased care quality, lapses in care, higher healthcare costs13, and numerous initiatives to redress the organization and delivery of primary care14. Studies indicate US physicians17 are challenged by the diagnostic complexities2 and psychosocial factors18 these present, and can benefit from a greater educational focus in preventive healthcare19.These disparities were most recently targeted by the US DHHS in Healthy People 203012 \"Expanding access to health services is an important step toward reducing health disparities... factors like economic, social, cultural, and geographic barriers to health care must...be considered,\" Multimorbidities account for 50% or more of the primary care patient load.15 This contributes to clinical inertia16 (the lack of treatment intensification when therapeutic targets aren't met), a \"potentially leading cause\" of preventable adverse events, morbidity, mortality, and excess healthcare costs.\" 6 naturemed.orgHealthcare Disparities: Continuing disparities, such as inadequate access to services and coverage: Chronic Conditions & Multimorbidities*: Mounting social and economic burden from numerous chronic conditions and multimorbidities, such as heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and type 2 diabetes, continue to decrease quality of life and longevity for individuals, and to increase healthcare system spending:Naturopathic Physicians: Collaborative Partners to Address Current Health System Needs continued... *The presence of two or more noncommunicable diseases22 Naturopathic Physicians as Whole Health SpecialistsNaturopathic Physicians: Collaborative Partners to Address Current Health System Needs ...continued... naturemed.org 7These challenges are system-wide and intersubjective; consequently, weakness in one area tumbles into others like a stack of dominoes.

Use of these terms varies widely among healthcare professions and has evolved concomitant with attempts to respond to healthcare challenges. Definitions have developed independently, which has resulted in some ambiguity, given the variations inherent within isolated professional silos. Naturopathic physicians have contributed extensively in the literature32a for many years toward clarifying these definitions. A recent systematic literature review32b into how these terms are used among primary care providers (PCPs) illuminated six themes of usage, but their ubiquitous use in health care still enhances confusion about professional domains and clinical approaches for both patients and providers. The figure here illuminates this.The Future of Whole Person Health Care naturemed.org10Whole Person Care, in some cases, refers to integrating systems of care: namely, primary care and behavioral health33, and in some models, social services34. The nursing profession's model of whole person caring35 focuses on domains of care (physical, emotional, social/relational, mental, spiritual), and on 'therapeutic partnering' with patients. This term also is used to refer to health care that incorporates the social determinants of health36. A 2018 study by Thomas, et al.37, found primary care doctors use the term to refer to, \"...an approach that considers multiple dimensions of the patient and their context, including biological, psychological, social and possibly spiritual and ecological factors, and addresses these in an integrated fashion that keeps sight of the whole.\" Despite a multidimensional emphasis meta analysis showed the physicians didn't consider 'whole person care' necessarily to include CAM practices. Whole Health Care, as described by the National Institute of Whole Health38, addresses five main aspects of care (similar to those identified by whole person care): physical/structural, emotional/ mental, nutritional/chemical, environmental, and spiritual health. As an approach to care, the US Veterans Administration39 focuses on patient- centered, personalized care in its description of whole health as \"...what matters to you, not what is the matter with you.\" Holistic Care encompasses similar body-mind-spirit domains, but also is described by the American Holistic Health Association40 as conceptualizing individuals as interdependent living systems. Although holistic care includes complementary and alternative medicine therapies, it is foremost, \"...an approach to health and disease that transcends any particular therapy.41\" It incorporates 'more recent scientific discoveries' such as psychoneuroimmunology41a that is used effectively to reduce stress, inflammation processes, etc. and biofield coherence41b therapies used effectively for mental health wellness41c and pain, and that show promise in chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc.41d What differentiates the whole health, whole person care delivered by naturopathic physicians? Naturopathic physicians approach whole health, whole person care according to the profession's foundational theory44. This theory, first proposed in 1913 and then expanded from 1997 to 201345, and its clinical models are based on the profession's characterization of living organisms as adaptive46, allostatic47, autopoietic48, and emergent49 systems. For every individual patient, therefore, naturopathic physicians conceptualize 'whole person and whole health' as: supporting the factors that enhance health, decreasing the factors that disturb health and increase susceptibility to illness, and supporting the body's individual process to optimize and/or return to health.The Importance of Integration Regardless of the nuanced differences among these terms, Thomas' 2018 survey37 emphasizes that whole person care, \"...requires both multidimensionality and integration... particularly where multiple providers are involved in care.\" Integration is achieved, according to the Integrative Health Policy Consortium42 with, \"...a collaborative, comprehensive, person-centered approach to health creation43 and disease care that addresses all factors impacting health ...and embraces all evidence-informed disciplines, both conventional and complementary, in order to achieve optimal well-being.\"Naturopathic Physicians Offer: A Whole Health, Whole Person Approach to Primary Care continued...Naturopathic Physicians as Whole Health Specialists naturemed.org11The naturopathic clinical model emphasizes not only wellness, disease prevention, and health optimization, but also potential recovery from intractable illness - a once-rejected concept that now is gaining increased recognition from contemporary research, such as the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention (IJDRP)55.Naturopathic clinical theory also extends these concepts to address all determinants of health5 (all components of the individual's external and internal environment, in addition to those defined by the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention50). This includes not only the environmental, social, and economic determinants well-known in the public health arena, but also notably (1) the body's internal chemical, mechanical, and cellular components and (2) life or spiritual crises where individuals have lost touch with a deeper sense of purpose and place from living in a disconnected world. This is a comprehensive model that belies its seemingly old-fashioned terminology, 'terrain.' This term, once widely used in 19th-century medicine51, is now expanded in naturopathic clinical theory to include contemporary empirical and research evidence from genetics, epigenetics, systems biology, immunology, bioelectric signaling52, mechanobiology53, and psychoneuroimmunology54. Naturopathic Physicians Offer: A Whole Health, Whole Person Approach to Primary Care ...continued... To apply this model in clinical practice, NDs rely on the profession's conceptual hallmarks of its clinical theory (terrain, disease, and healing): Terrain is a focus on numerous and complex determinants of health5 rather than on pathology, alone. A key feature of this model is its complex systems approach56: the continuous interplay between and among internal systems and external environments, and the factors that support or detract from an individual's health. It is this conceptualization of living organisms that dictates the multi-modality approach of naturopathic medicine. 1 2 1Determinants of Health: Genetic (and Immunity) Psychosocial Behavioral 2Determinants of Health: Environmental, Social, EconomicHow do naturopathic physicians apply 'whole health, whole person' care in clinical practice?The Future of Whole Person Health Care naturemed.org12Disease and Healing as Process is conceptualized as a systematic process, in addition to a pathologic entity.

Low-dose histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) 3. Incrementally increase potency of medication for symptom control 4. Concomitant antacids and/or sodium alginate as needed Phase 2 Continued GERD 1. Increase dose of H2RAs to standard dose, twice daily for a minimum of two weeks 2. Persistent symptoms: replace H2RAs with once-daily proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at a low dose, increase to standard doses if required. 3. Once symptoms are controlled, treatment continues for at least eight weeks. Phase 3 Diagnostic and Surgical Intervention 1. Severe GERD may require one of more of the following: 2. X-rays of upper GI tract 3. Esophageal manometry 4.

NDs rely on the six naturopathic principles of practice to guide them in applying their clinical theory to individual patients: The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae7), Identify and Treat the Causes, First Do No Harm, Doctor as Teacher (Docere), Treat the Whole Person, and Prevention. Docere is the main principle guiding naturopathic physicians' interaction with patients.Naturopathic Physicians Offer: A Whole Health, Whole Person Approach to Primary Care ...continued The Clinical Encounter A standard naturopathic clinical encounter begins with a comprehensive, systems-based assessment that is highly individualized to each patient and that addresses underlying mechanisms driving the disease process. Physicians address individual signs and symptoms, as well as the many determinants that influence health and illness. This is measured against an understanding of the multiple physiological systems in question, and evaluation of circumstances and conditions that create clinical dysfunction, including: comprehensive personal history (medical, psychosocial, socioeconomic) family history genetics and epigenetics environmental and occupational exposures medication history (including medications, supplements, and botanicals) diet and lifestyle psycho-emotional health (including trauma history, stress resilience, coping style, and psychosocial support) systems function (digestive, hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, immunological, neurological) Lack of purpose (commitment to something meaningful provides a motivation for change)NDs may use a range of naturopathic, conventional, functional, and specialized diagnostic tests to perform this comprehensive evaluation, including but not limited to: comprehensive physical exam, including skin, pain, cognitive, communication, posture, gait, activities of daily living, fitness, GYN/prostate, etc. psycho-social-spiritual evaluations including diet, activity, sleep, spiritual practices standard tests, such as blood analysis, urinalysis, stool tests, and diagnostic imaging specialized tests, such as food sensitivity testing, biochemical analyses (e.g., methylation, oxidation, detoxification), metabolic pathways, comprehensive stool analysis, toxins and toxic load, advanced hormone testing, neurotransmitter testing, and advanced cardiometabolic testing) We believe that naturopathic medicine, with its unique principles and practices, has the potential to reverse the tide of chronic illness that overwhelms existing health care systems and to empower people to achieve and maintain their optimal lifelong health.The Future of Whole Person Health Care naturemed.org18 Naturopathic Physicians Offer :Naturopathic Physicians Offer : Whole Health, Whole Person Therapies Naturopathic physicians prioritize early intervention and non-invasive treatments designed to address clinical systems and underlying causes of dysfunction, rather than focusing primarily on symptom management. This includes instituting not only therapies that support health, but also approaches that eliminate sources of dysfunction. Treatment choices include evidence-based natural therapies, and may include necessary and appropriate pharmaceutical and/or other interventions. Treatment plans emphasize principles of healthy living and encourage patient engagement through education and advocacy, while offering additional perspectives and therapeutic options for both acute and chronic diseases. Where's the evidence for naturopathic concepts and its approach to medicine? There is a strong predilection to evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)58. In addition, naturopathic practice embraces empirical evidence gained from observation and extrapolation of consistent patterns occurring in populations. Historically59, medical evidence was largely empirical and informed mainly by retrospective case series. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) approach now underpins much of current medical research as the 'gold standard.' In 1992, evidence-based medicine (EBM) was introduced in an effort to utilize RCT evidence, provide a consistent approach to treatment for both clinicians and for patients, and to \"put an end... to the disparities in treatments which make it that certain patients do not benefit from the best medicine available.\"60 Although assessment of evidence in EBM should include 3 components (RCT As primary care providers, naturopathic physicians coordinate treatment plans to involve families, caregivers, and other physicians or health providers to ensure patients receive collaborative, comprehensive, and effective treatment.Guided by the naturopathic medical school curriculum and scope of practice and informed by the Therapeutic OrderTM 5 clinical methodology addresses treatment at several levels, based on the individual's needs: Foundational support: healthy diet, movement and exercise, stress management, emotional and spiritual health, toxin exposure management, social and environmental determinants Therapeutic diets and nutrition therapy Botanical medicines and dietary supplements Restorative therapies: hydrotherapy, manual medicine, homeopathy, etc. Evidence-based, disease-targeted therapy: therapeutic use of nutrients, vitamins, herbs, and (where state regulations include it in the profession's scope of practice) pharmaceuticals Physical medicine modalities: massage, acupuncture, physical therapy, regenerative injection therapy (trigger point therapy, prolotherapy, platelet therapy, etc.) Mind-body techniques: mindfulness meditation, yoga, relaxation modalities, sensory-based therapies, behavioral modification, biofeedback, etc.Naturopathic Physicians as Whole Health Specialists naturemed.org19evidence, the physician's clinical experience, and patient preferences), the clinical guidelines developed to implement EBM have relied overwhelmingly on RCTs, creating a 'prevailing conceptual framework'60 that precludes other forms of evidence. Consequently, EBM has more recently become weighted by its own limitations: an over-reliance on 'technical rationality' that allows little room for individual clinical judgment and that relies on the concept of the 'average patient' in lieu of embracing the individual variabilities inherent in living organisms. As use of clinical guidelines became more ubiquitous, studies began revealing an increasing lack of use among physicians. One study of PCPs, for example, showed that 30% of treatment decisions were based on RCTs and 50% on, \"convincing non-experimental evidence.\"60 Conducting practice that is based only on the clinical guidelines of EBM has been criticized as being too restrictive, time consuming, not applicable to patients, interfering with the physician-patient relationship, and \"too distant from clinical reality.\" (pg 59).60 Clinical guidelines have been cited as an underlying cause of the clinical inertia that contributes to the increasing healthcare burden of chronic conditions. Naturopathic physicians employ RCT evidence58 as well as tacit knowledge61 and heuristics62 (increasingly being recognized for their value) to guide clinical decisions, including those that, \"...help physicians to work in the context of uncertainty... \" (pg 63)60 The Naturopathic Therapeutic OrderTM is one such heuristic that guides NDs' clinical decisions, along with empirical and RCT evidence, when assessing modalities for individual patients. New approaches to expanding epistemologies and types of research There is an acute need for dedicated naturopathic medical research63 in clinical settings64. However, conducting randomized controlled trials 'paradigm shift' is required to successfully implement naturopathic research methodologies, but that the unique characteristics of naturopathic practice also can influence other areas of health research. As one possible solution to this issue, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine proposed a new study design (N-of-1 trials67 ) in 2020 as a model for researching individual treatment interventions, but using rigorous research methods of group clinical trials. This approach may be useful to the emerging practice68a of personalized medicine68b and for addressing complex clinical approaches, such as those required to treat chronic illnesses. In 2004, the profession completed a 2 year naturopathic medicine whole-system, multi-modality research agenda69a involving 28 research scientists in the US, Canada and Australia. In 2019, a systematic review of the ensuing research showed that naturopathic medicine \" is effective for treating cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal pain, type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, anxiety, and a range of complex chronic conditions.\"69b Already over 2,200 peer-reviewed journal articles have been published by the naturopathic research community between 1987 and 2019. 81% of these were published from 2010 to 2019.

First Do No Harm : Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies.Identify and Treat the Causes: Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause.The Institute for Natural Medicine promotes naturopathic medicine which is defined by six principles that honor the body's innate wisdom to heal. This approach provides patients with tools for lifelong wellness. Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that encourage individuals' inherent self-healing process. The practice of naturopathic medicine includes modern and traditional, scientific, and empirical methods. [AANP House of Delegates Position Paper, Amended 2011 ]. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: 6 5 4Prevention: Focus on overall health, wellness and disease prevention.Doctor as Teacher: Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health. Treat the Whole Person: View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical and spiritual dimensions. Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: Clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing, nutritional medicine, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine (including naturopathic manipulative therapy), public health measures, hygiene, counseling, minor surgery, homeopathy, acupuncture, prescription medication, intravenous and injection therapy, and naturopathic obstetrics.The Principles of Naturopathic Medicine: Whole Health, Whole Person Therapies ...continuedNaturopathic Physicians as Whole Health Specialists naturemed.org25 Naturopathic Physicians Offer :Naturopathic Physicians Offer : Focused Patient Engagement Naturopathic physicians engage patients in their own healthcare by providing guidance and clinical support in the areas of nutrition, exercise, stress prevention, environmental toxin exposure, and other lifestyle measures. Its Principles of Practice6 (illustrated on pages 23 and 24), guide NDs in applying naturopathic clinical theory to practice with patients. The Principle, Docere, refers specifically to teaching and guiding patients in their care. It is widely known that clinical outcomes improve through collaborative patient engagement83 that enhances patients' self efficacy84 (the ability to undertake required self-care tasks) and self-agency85 (the feeling of having a level of control within the experience of illness). Research Highlights: Patient satisfaction with & demand for naturopathic care Patient-reported experiences with first-time naturopathic care for type 2 diabetes, Oberg, et al. 2012.72 Conclusion: The routine clinical approach used by NDs is consistent with behavior change theory and clinical strategies found most effective in promoting self-efficacy and improving clinical outcomes. The Role for Naturopathic Medicine in Hospital-Based Care Bernhardt, et al. 2017.87 Conclusion: The study of 1,711 acute-care inpatients with an average hospital stay of 11.9 days showed a high degree of patient satisfaction with combined care from naturopathic and academic medicine providers. Patient teams were composed according to specific patient needs and included: general medicine specialists, naturopathic physicians, anesthesiologists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and allied healthcare providers. Integration of naturopathic medicine into acute inpatient care: an approach for patient-centred medicine under diagnosis-related groups. Romeyke, et al. 2017.88 Conclusion: A majority of patients rated integration of naturopathic practice into hospital settings positively.

Regulatory and Oversight Organizations Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) - accredits four-year, in-person doctoral programs in naturopathic medicine (ND programs) that qualify graduates for licensure in the US and Canada. These minimum standards and competencies are delineated in the CNME Handbook of Accreditation, Part 496 and include a mandate for the program of study to include at least 4,100 program hours of specified content. CNME's accreditation process is recognized by the rigorous educational standards of the US Department of Education97. North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) - qualifies applicants to take the two-part Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX), administers the exam, and sends exam results and transcripts to regulatory authorities. Only graduates of CNME-accredited ND programs are qualified by NABNE to take the NPLEX and a passing grade is required to be eligible for licensure. NPLEX is a case based exam98 that comprehensively tests for competencies specified in the CNME Handbook of Accreditation96. Federation of Naturopathic Medicine Regulatory Authorities (FNMRA) - provides coordination and technical assistance to regulatory boards in states that license naturopathic physicians. It also accredits CE providers who produce CEs to address new information or practice gaps. The Future of Whole Person Health Care naturemed.org32Naturopathic Physicians Support: Nationwide Regulation & Licensure ...continued Regulatory and Oversight Organizations ...continued Where are NDs regulated? Naturopathic physicians currently are licensed or regulated 99 in 25 jurisdictions, including 22 states and three US territories. Licensed and registered NDs have a specific scope of practice as defined by their state's law, and must fulfill State-mandated continuing education and reporting requirements. There is increasing momentum to license naturopathic physicians in all 50 states. From 2014 to 2020, 6 states have enacted licensure laws, 9 states have filed or pending bills for licensure, and 8 states plan to file bills in the next two years. Insurance Coverage Coverage varies in states providing licensure, as you can see on this map of Regulated States and Regulatory Authorities100. For example, all insurers in Vermont cover NDs as primary care providers (PCPs). In Oregon, however, all NDs are covered, but some plans cover them as PCPs and some as specialists. In Arizona, NDs are licensed with a robust scope of practice, but are not eligible as insured providers. Many insurers offer direct access to NDs as PCPs. Patients also may self-refer to NDs for specialty care. Credentialing Most private insurers use standard provider applications to credential NDs. Some insurers credential NDs only as 'complementary and alternative' providers, even though many of those NDs provide primary care. This can cause significant barriers to patient access to care. Some Managed Care Organizations credential NDs as PCPs, using standard provider applications. Typically, these are naturopathic physicians who work in Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers. Some Managed Care Organizations also cover ND patient visits as 'out-of-network' providers. Billing Naturopathic physicians are represented on the Healthcare Professionals Advisory Committee of the AMA's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Editorial Panel and use the same diagnostic codes (CPT and ICD-10) and medical procedure forms (HCFA-1500 / CMS-1500) as other providers. NO LEGISLATION LEGISLATION PENDING LEGISLATION PLANNEDLAWS ENACTED STATE AND TERRITORY COUNTND LICENSURE & REGISTRATION LAWS ENACTEDLIST STATE ABBREVIATIO NS22IN US & TERRITORIES September, 2021Naturopathic Physicians as Whole Health Specialists naturemed.org33Naturopathic physicians are educated as medical specialists in lifestyle, behavioral, and preventive medicine, which should be the central focus of primary care in this country. The future of US healthcare must focus on health professionals partnering with patients for their adoption of health habits that support prevention of chronic diseases and reduce the morbidity associated with chronic illness, informed by appropriate genetic considerations, nutritional analysis, mind-body health, and physical activity, while addressing other determinants of health5 as defined in this white paper. Naturopathic physicians are medically trained in addressing all these determinants of health to improve patient outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a shift in patient accountability and a greater interest in self-care. It is likely that the lengthy duration of the pandemic, and the understanding of how general health impacts the body's response to the virus, has led to and created a deeper appreciation and understanding of the importance of whole person health and lifestyle choices. Health status and outcomes like underlying conditions, supporting immunity, improving metabolic health, reducing stress, and making mental health a priority have all entered the public conversation. The education and training of naturopathic physicians qualifies them as specialists in this whole person approach to patient health. Even the way conventional medicine is practiced has changed: Large healthcare systems like the Veterans Administration have embraced a Whole Health approach to health care that is considered a \"cutting edge approach to care\" which is beginning to see impressive outcomes. The incorporation of new healthcare services, such as telemedicine, continue to evolve, creating greater opportunity for access to licensed naturopathic physicians. Healthcare policy and public health are also impacted by the pandemic. Now is the time for naturopathic physicians to contribute their unique expertise to these changes and to critical forward-looking conversations occurring throughout the country. Here is what we know today: 1. COVID-19 has created a new awareness about individual health and the role overall health has in vulnerability to infectious disease. These changes further advance the opportunity for those committed to supporting the integration of naturopathic medicine and conventional health care. 2. Chronic lifestyle conditions such as type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, stress, and other metabolic disorders play a key role in overall immune health, including the body's ability to combat infections, such as COVID-19. 3. After months during which health has become a focus of daily conversation, the public is embracing the need for self-care and personal accountability. This will likely change the way the public perceives health and the future healthcare they receive for generations to come.

This paper presents a vision for the future, one in which naturopathic medicine is welcomed as an essential ally to conventional medicine. In a model that integrates naturopathic physicians and the principles and practices of naturopathic medicine, the following will occur: 1. The least invasive means necessary approach of the naturopathic Therapeutic OrderTM5 will be used in primary care and specialty practices to help patients achieve optimal health and well-being. 2. Naturopathic physicians will play a key role in teaching conventionally-trained physicians in academic and medical system settings. 3. Academic and clinical experts and teachers will benefit from learning how to utilize the six Principles of Naturopathic Medicine6 and the Naturopathic Determinants of Health5 in medical schools, teaching hospitals, and clinical settings. 4. Naturopathic physicians will be universally regulated throughout the U.S. 5. Naturopathic physicians will be Medicare and Medicaid eligible providers. 6. Naturopathic physicians will be an integral part of the staffing team in hospital, community health, and integrated medicine clinics, where their training and perspective will be a sought-after component to an integrative medical model. 7. Naturopathic physicians will help foster high performance, cost effective team-based care in hospitals, centers, FQHCs/CHCs, and other multi-provider settings. 8. Medical research across all disciplines will be co-produced with naturopathic physicians. 9. Clinical settings will support treatment of the behavioral aspects of chronic disease as outlined in the Naturopathic Determinants of Health. 10. Naturopathic physicians will provide leadership for the ongoing training and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusiveness in regard to ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, religion and spirituality, income, and physical ability.In order to fuel genuine change in the health of Americans, it is imperative that stakeholders recognize that most chronic conditions that make one more vulnerable to COVID-19 (and whatever next novel new virus is around the corner) are somewhat preventable. Through a scientifically-based and whole person oriented understanding of individual health, sustainable lifestyle-based strategies can be implemented to enhance resilience. Naturopathic medicine is ideally suited for teaching scientifically- informed self-care and treating lifestyle-based and preventable ailments. A focus on the underlying cause, whole person health and prevention could reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 and may help to prevent and address \"long-hauler\" symptoms in the post-COVID patient population. How Will the Acceptance and Integration of Naturopathic Medicine Change Health Care?Naturopathic Physicians as Whole Health Specialists 35 naturemed.orgNaturopathic Physicians Support: A Future Partnership for Whole Health, Whole Person Care ...continued Future of Clinical Research To truly measure the evidence of an integrated system, outcomes research must be developed to capture a multivariate approach for treatment of chronic diseases. The clinical evidence for naturopathic research is nuanced and therefore, the interconnectedness of multiple disciplines is essential. For example, there is now good evidence related to lifestyle medicine, specific nutrients or botanicals for particular ailments, the efficacy of body-mind medicine, etc. Presently, it takes much too long to get from laboratory to clinic. NDs are leading the way in some of these areas, bringing to light some of this research. The following is suggested as a model for future research: Outcomes research captures a multivariate approach, including clinical effectiveness, quality-of-life measurements and cost-effectiveness analysis with detailed comparisons of conventional care. The type of research will identify pragmatic solutions to chronic and complex illnesses that plague society101. Naturopathic research will make use of artificial intelligence capabilities as a means to aggregate complex data from multivariate studies. Virtual care models will offer extensions of clinical research to target underserved and hard-to-reach populations that have typically been left out of research. Applied research in regard to The Social Determinants of Health, to which the Naturopathic Profession has expertise (lifestyle and environment). Conclusion The future of healthcare in this country needs the input of all licensed healthcare professionals, including naturopathic physicians. As teachers and clinicians, the naturopathic medical community is ideally suited for integration into primary care settings, hospitals, academic centers, and public health entities. The main difference between the naturopathic doctor's approach and that of conventionally trained doctors is that NDs are taught to use methods that build on the extraordinary ability of the body to heal itself.The Future of Whole Person Health Care naturemed.org EndorsementsEndorsements Lise Alschuler, ND, FABNO, Associate Director, Fellowship in Integrative Medicine Professor of Clinical Medicine Naturopathic doctors have a resonant belief and deep expertise in natural medicine and whole person healthcare. Good healthcare is built upon collaboration. As specialists in natural medicine, naturopathic doctors are pollinators, spreading the essential principals and practices of naturopathic medicine for the betterment of healthcare. We have inherited this responsibility based on the profession's legacy of visionaries - Benedict and Louisa Lust, John Bastyr, Joseph Pizzorno, and many others - all of whom share a deep belief in the healing capacity of the healthcare system and the patients it serves. Susan E. Cavleff, PhD, Professor Emerita San Diego State University, Author of Nature's Path: A History of Naturopathic Healing in America (2016) As a nation we are at a crossroads with our individual and collective health. Naturopathic medicine gives each person the skills and knowledge to identify and control their physical and psychological well-being. It also offers insights into environmental toxins and their problematic health implications. Naturopathic physicians promote optimal wellness over time through prevention, healthy living and remedies that strengthen one's overall well-being. Now is the time for an enlightened paradigm that values wellness over organ-specific symptomatic treatment managed through pharmacology. Natural medicine offers self-determination and healthy well being through research, positive outcomes, and lower costs. It allows you to lead a more robust and full life. 36Naturopathic Physicians as Whole Health Specialists naturemed.org37 ReferencesReferences 1. Buttorff C, Ruder T, Bauman M.
