To enhance intracellular drug delivery, CD was chemically conjugated to an 18-carbon chain cationic gemini surfactant which undergoes self-assembly to form nanoscale complexes. The novel gemini surfactant-modified CD carrier host (hereafter referred to as 18:1CDg) was designed to combine the solubilization and encapsulation capacity of the CD macrocycle and the cell-penetrating ability of the gemini surfactant conjugate. Melphalan (Mel), a chemotherapeutic agent for melanoma, was selected as a model for a poorly soluble drug. Characterization of the 18:1CDg-Mel host-guest complex was carried out using 1D/2D 1H NMR spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The 1D/2D NMR spectral results indicated the formation of stable and well-defined 18:1CDg-Mel inclusion complexes at the 2:1 host-guest mole ratio; whereas, host-drug interaction was attenuated at greater 18:1CDg mole ratio due to hydrophobic aggregation that accounts for the reduced Mel solubility. The in vitro evaluations were performed using monolayer, 3D spheroid, and Mel-resistant melanoma cell lines. The 18:1CDg-Mel complex showed significant enhancement in the chemotherapeutic efficacy of Mel with 2-3-fold decrease in Mel half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values.

Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 132,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed annually [ [2](#B2-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In its early stages, melanoma can be treated by surgical incision with high survival rate. In the stage of in-transit metastases, in which the metastases are >2 cm from the primary lesion but within the nodal basin, the response to local and systemic therapeutic options is moderate with 5-year survival of 32.8% [ [3](#B3-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. However, advanced metastatic melanoma shows limited response to current therapeutic options with very low survival rate of less than 5% over 5 years [ [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Systemic chemotherapy is the first-line option for most patients with metastatic melanoma. [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)a) metastatic melanoma [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. The lipophilic nature of Mel requires the use of a co-solvent (e.g., propylene glycol) for parenteral administration. Propylene glycol is known to cause toxicity that includes nephrotoxicity, cardiac arrhythmia, and metabolic acidosis [ [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. As a result, the use of Mel in melanoma therapy is limited to isolated limb perfusion/infusion which is an invasive method that requires special medical care [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Therefore, attempts to improve the solubility and stability of Mel were conducted by either chemical modification of the molecule or by engineering novel drug delivery systems, such as nano-systems [ [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [10](#B10-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [11](#B11-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. A nanoscale drug delivery system has several advantages, it can: (1) improve solubility of poorly soluble drugs, (2) enhance chemical/biological stability, (3) improve pharmacokinetic profile and biodistribution, (4) increase tumor-specific uptake (passive targeting), (5) minimize drug resistance, (6) achieve drug controlled release, and (7) afford delivery of multiple drug components [ [12](#B12-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Our strategy is to create delivery systems that could improve the therapeutic use of Mel addressing both issues of solubility and biological activity at the same time. Cyclodextrins (CDs) form stable host-guest complexes with a variety of organic and inorganic molecules and have been widely employed as versatile carriers for poorly soluble drugs [ [14](#B14-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. CDs ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)b,c) are naturally occurring cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of 6 (CD), 7 (CD), or 8 (CD) -d-glucopyranose units linked by (-1,4) glycosidic bonds [ [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. CDs form a truncated cone with a toroidal structure ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)c) in which the hydroxyl groups of glucopyranose units reside at the narrow (primary) and wide (secondary) tori of the CD annular structure. The CD macrocycle has a hydrophilic outer surface and lipophilic inner cavity that is capable of forming noncovalent inclusion complexes with a large variety of guest molecules [ [16](#B16-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Capitalizing on the ability of the CDs to form host-guest inclusion complexes, such systems have been used in pharmaceutical formulations to increase the apparent water solubility of poorly soluble drugs so as to improve their bioavailability. In addition, CDs and its derivatives serve to provide: (1) enhanced drug stability (thermal, photosensitivity, and chemical), (2) reduced drug mucosal irritation, (3) reduced drug resistance, and (4) controlled release of the drug [ [17](#B17-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Several synthetic strategies have been employed to engineer CD-based carriers with enhanced pharmaceutical properties along with reduced systemic toxicity [ [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. For example, the introduction of bulky derivatives can limit the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, consequently enhancing the aqueous solubility of CDs while improving their inclusion capacity [ [14](#B14-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Luke et al. reported a 35-fold increase in aqueous solubility for a sulfobutyl-ether--cyclodextrin (SEB--CD) derivative relative to native CD [ [19](#B19-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In addition to chemical derivatization, CDs have been chemically conjugated to a variety of functional moieties (i.e., polymers, lipids, and peptides) to create biofunctional and complexes [ [20](#B20-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. For instance, several amphiphilic moieties have been conjugated to CDs to create self-assembling supramolecular structures with improved drug loading capacity and enhanced cellular uptake [ [22](#B22-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [23](#B23-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [24](#B24-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [25](#B25-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)d), as a potential advanced drug delivery system for Mel in melanoma therapy. The objectives of the current study are generally two-fold: 1) to synthetically engineer a novel CD-based carrier for Mel with improved therapeutic efficiency and low carrier-cellular toxicity, and 2) to characterize the structure of the host-guest interaction between the carrier and drug. The host-guest complex of the 18:1CDg-Mel system was investigated using NMR spectroscopy in the formation of well-defined carrier-drug inclusion complexes. We previously reported a cationic gemini surfactant-CD conjugate with 12-carbon chain (12 CDg) for the delivery of a poorly soluble drugs including curcumin analogs [ [26](#B26-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [28](#B28-pharmaceutics-11-00427)] and Mel in a melanoma cell line model [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. The 12 CDg-Mel complex significantly improved the efficiency of Mel drug and showed no intrinsic toxicity as it did not alter the cellular death triggered by Mel [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. However, the stability of the formed host-drug inclusion complex and the efficiency of the produced 12 CDg-Mel system were limited due to the self-inclusion/self-assembly of the terminal alkyl chains of the carrier agent within the CD cavity [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [28](#B28-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Therefore, the newly developed delivery cationic gemini surfactant-CD conjugate with 18-carbon tail (18:1CDg) is anticipated to overcome these limitations. The in vitro efficiency of the 18:1CDg-Mel complex using monolayer, 3D spheroid, and Mel-resistant melanoma cell lines demonstrates the potential applicability of the 18:1CDg delivery system as a safe and efficient carrier for poorly soluble chemotherapeutic in melanoma therapy. This study is anticipated to provide a greater understanding of the structure-function relationship of 18:1CDg as a carrier agent for poorly soluble drug with optimal therapeutic properties. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Preparation of Inclusion Complexes [26](#B26-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [30](#B30-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)shows the chemical structures of Mel, CD, and 18:1CDg. For physicochemical characterization, the complexes of Mel with CD or 18:1CDg were prepared in different carrier-to-drug molar ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1). A stock solution of Mel (1 mg/mL) was prepared in acidified ethanol (0.1% HCl). Stock solutions of CD and 18:1CDg were prepared in Milli-Q water at 10 mM concentration. An appropriate volume of Mel solution was mixed with CD and an aqueous 18:1CDg dispersion to yield the required carrier-to-drug molar ratios. Formulations were frozen at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h and transferred to a cascade freeze dryer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) at 80 \u00b0C and 0.03 mBar vacuum and lyophilized for 24 h. The lyophilized formulations were rehydrated in water (or in deuterium oxide for 1H NMR and 1D/2D ROESY experiments) and shaken in the orbital shaker for 1 h at room temperature prior to evaluation. 2.2.

Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) in Monolayer Cell Vitro Efficiency in Spheroid Melanoma Cell 2.3.3. In Vitro Efficiency in Mel-Resistant Melanoma Cell Lines [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In brief, A375 cells cultured in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks and treated with increasing concentrations of Mel from 100 nM to 60 \u00b5M over 9 weeks to induce drug resistance. The Mel-resistant cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. After the incubation period, cells were treated with Mel alone and with 18:1CDg-Mel complexes at 2:1 molar ratio with final Mel concentrations of 30 and 80 \u00b5M in quadruplicate. The MTT assay, as described above, was used to determine % cell toxicity (compared to nontreated cells). 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Physicochemical Characterization 3.1.1. H spectroscopy is a powerful tool for elucidating the molecular level structure and host/guest stoichiometry by analyzing the complexation-induced shifts (CIS). In particular, two-dimensional NMR affords an understanding of the through-space dipolar interactions and inclusion geometry of the guest within the CD cavity [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [33](#B33-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [34](#B34-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In 2D ROESY NMR, the nuclear \u00d6verhauser effect (NOE also ROE) is employed to elucidate the noncovalent interactions between nuclei that reside in close spatial proximity \u00c5) [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [36](#B36-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Although related to NOE, other correlations may arise due to chemical and conformational (rotational) exchanges [ [37](#B37-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f002)were assigned according to previous reports [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [38](#B38-pharmaceutics-11-00427)] and the simulated spectra (cf. [Figures S1 and S2 Supporting information](#app1-pharmaceutics-11-00427)). Starting with the 18:1CDg carrier molecule, evidence of the formation of the gemini surfactant-grafted CD is shown by the substantial broadening of the CD resonance lines (~3.0-4.5 ppm) relative to the native CD ( [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f002)a,c, respectively), along with the emergence signals at ~0.5-1.0 ppm ( [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f002)c). Similar line broadening effects were reported previously for grafted CD-based hosts in D2O (i.e., H1, H4, and H6; cf. [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)b) indicate induced conformational change of the CD macrocycle upon grafting. The internal cavity protons H3 and H5 moiety of the 18:1CDg carrier ( [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f002)highlighted area and 0.08 ppm; cf. [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t001)) that indicate a possible inter- or intramolecular inclusion of part of the gemini surfactant moiety (cf. [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f002)c), consistent with shielding [Figure area I) are characterized by substantial broadening and upfield shift indicating a change of conformation and/or environment upon drug complexation as described above. [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t002), indicating that the 18:1CDg carrier forms 1:1/2:1 stoichiometry with the drug. The 1D 1H NMR spectrum of the 18:1CDg-Mel complex at the 2:1 mole ratio is represented in [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f002)d and reveals substantial shielding of the CD (~3.7-4.0 ppm) and the gemini surfactant (~0.5-1.0 ppm) resonances. This provides evidence for the inclusion of the Mel within the cavity of the CD moiety with possible involvement unbound 18:1CDg carrier displayed cross-peaks due to typical interactions between the backbone H1 proton of CD with the cavity interior (panel a). Furthermore, various cross-peaks are arising from intra-/intermolecular interactions of the 18:1CDg carrier ( [Figure 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f003), panel c). More recently, the self-inclusion of a 12-carbon chain gemini (12 CDg) within the CD cavity was reported [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In [Figure 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f003), cross-peaks between the CD cavity and the alkyl chain of the gemini surfactant (highlighted area b) are relatively weak and characterized by positive correlations (green contours in [Figure 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f003)) due to possible conformation (rotational) and chemical exchanges [ [37](#B37-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. The formation of host-guest inclusion complexes is expected to be thermodynamically more favorable for a saturated long hydrocarbon chain than shorter ones [ [39](#B39-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. However, intermolecular aggregation of the gemini surfactant chain is anticipated to be more prominent in the case of 18:1CDg due to the presence of the unsaturated bond that causes the tail to bend with less flexibility, which can reduce the self-inclusion of the tail region within the CD cavity. [Figure 4](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f004)). According to the 2D ROESY spectra in [Figure 4](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f004), the increased carrier-drug interactions at the 1:1 and 2:1 mole ratios are evidenced by the intense cross-peaks and suggest optimal solubilizing conditions for the drug, more so at the 2:1 mole ratio due to the much greater intensity. It is noteworthy that the interaction between the gemini surfactant and the CD moiety of the carrier in the presence of the Mel drug as a co-guest illustrates the importance of \"cooperativity\" in the host-guest inclusion complex. Evidence of cooperative association was reported recently for other CD-based complexes [ [37](#B37-pharmaceutics-11-00427), [40](#B40-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In the present study, the \"cooperative interaction\" only occurred when Mel was added to the 18:1CDg. The foregoing solubility results inferred from the 2D NMR agree with the CIS data herein ( [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t001)) and with solubility evaluation results using mass spectrometry [ [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. The 1H NMR CIS data in [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t001)provide evidence of destabilization of the carrier-drug inclusion complex due to hydrophobic effects and conformational motility of the 18:1CDg at higher carrier loading, as indicated by the downfield shifts of the CD extracavity (or framework) nuclei (i.e., H1, H6, and H4). The efficiency of 18:1CDg to increase the aqueous solubility of Mel was evaluated using mass spectrometry, where the highest aqueous solubility was determined at the 2:1 host-guest mole ratio [ [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Increasing the 18:1CDg-Mel mole ratios to 3:1 and 5:1 caused significant reduction in Mel solubility, consistent with the attenuated CD-Mel signals at the expense of the CD-gemini surfactant signals for these systems (cf. [Figure 4](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f004)c,d). The foregoing discussion suggests increased interaction of the gemini surfactant moiety with the CD cavity at higher host ratio, whereas an alternate geometry involves one 18:1CDg unit interacting with another 18:1CDg unit inter-molecularly in a rotaxane-like fashion (cf. [Scheme 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-sch001)). The growing interactions between the CD interior/exterior protons at the higher host ratios indicates a possible intermolecular aggregation of the gemini surfactant around the CD and further support the rotaxane-like structure depicted in [Scheme 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-sch001). These proposed structures are further supported by the shielding and deshielding CIS trends of the external and internal CD resonances, respectively (cf. [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t001)). It is noteworthy to mention that the increased gemini surfactant-CD interaction at the 3:1 and 5:1 mole ratios of 18:1CDg-Mel correlate with the limited solubility drug at conditions ( [Scheme 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-sch001)c). [Figure 5](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f005)and reveals NOE correlations due to interactions between the internal cavity of the CD moiety (H3, H5) and the aromatic moiety of the drug at the H'1 and H'2 positions (cf. [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f001)a and [Figure 5](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f005)). These results provide unequivocal evidence for the formation of the 18:1CDg-Mel complexes with well-defined binding and geometry that are consistent with the 1D 1H CIS data. The more intense cross-peaks at H5 compared to H3 in [Figure 5](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f005)suggests that Mel is directionally encapsulated within the CD cavity of the 18:1CDg carrier, as depicted in [Figure 5](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f005)(see insets). Similar geometry was deduced from the inclusion complex of Mel with pure CD according to 2D ROESY NMR results of [Figure S4](#app1-pharmaceutics-11-00427)) [ [42](#B42-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. This method examines the effect of a solubilizer (CD or ligand) on the drug being solubilized (substrate). The phase-solubility relationship describes only the solubilizing effect of the CD on the drug molecule but not the actual formation of inclusion complexes. Based on the phase-solubility diagram of Higuchi and Connors, the solubility evaluation results reported previously using flow-injection mass spectrometry of 18:1CDg-Mel [ [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-11-00427)] and the NMR results discussed herein, we propose that the relationship between the solubility of Mel and the concentration of the host (18:1CDg) follows either AN or A-BS-type model. AN-type model indicates the formation of a host-drug soluble complex with negatively deviating isotherms, whereas the A-BS-type indicates the formation of a complex with limited solubility [ [43](#B43-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. CD-drug complexes usually follow a B-type model as a result of the limited aqueous solubility of CD (1.85 g/100 mL). On the other hand, 18:1CDg exhibits behavior characteristic of both CD and cationic gemini surfactant (amorphous molecule). The solubilization effect of 18:1CDg is combination of formation of host-guest inclusion complex and the association complex formation that involve moieties that lie in the extracavity region of the 18:1CDg (i.e., the gemini alkyl chain) as shown by the instance, optimal endocytosis requires particle size of the nanoparticles to be within the range of 100-200 nm [ [47](#B47-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In the current work, the particle size was measured for the 2:1 18:1CDg-Mel complex with size of approximately 160 nm ( [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t002)). Similarly, the 18:1CDg carrier possesses an average size of ca. 170 nm characteristic of nanoparticles. At identical concentration conditions, CD-Mel complex and unbound CD failed to form particles with measurable particle sizes ( [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t002)). In a previous report, much greater particle size was measured for a 2:1 12 CDg:Mel complex (ca. 225 nm) in the presence of 0.5% methylcellulose as a suspending agent [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In the current work, the reported particle size of 18:1CDg-Mel complex was measured in an aqueous medium without the need of a suspending agent and no visible precipitation was observed even after 24 h. It is hypothesized that the replacement of saturated 12-carbon tails with unsaturated 18-carbon alkyl tails in the case of 18:1CDg results in the formation of a stable inclusion complex. [48](#B48-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t002), the zeta potential () data reveals much larger positive charge ( = 46 mV) for the 18:1CDg-Mel complex compared to the uncomplexed 18:1CDg carrier ( = 14 mV). This effect can be explained by the difference in the measured pH values between the complex (pH 2.8) and the 18:1CDg aqueous dispersion (pH 4.7). Low acidic pH can lead to the protonation of melphalan, causing more positive -values [ [49](#B49-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. 3.2. In Vitro Evaluation [Table 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t003), [Figure S5](#app1-pharmaceutics-11-00427)). The concentration of Mel required to induce cell death in the presence of 18:1CDg carrier at the 2:1 (18:1CDg-Mel) molar ratio was significantly lower with IC50 values of 27 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M compared to Mel- alone with IC50 = 98 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M (P < 0.05). Additionally, the IC50 value for the unbound carrier 18:1CDg was ~89 \u00b5M. These results indicate that the 18:1CDg-Mel complex can significantly improve the efficiency of Mel with low carrier-specific toxicity of the cells. Recently, we reported that CD-gemini system did not alter the cell death pathway induced by Mel, as shown by apoptosis and cell cycle analyses, indicating that the CD-modified gemini surfactant bears no intrinsic toxicity to the cells [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. [Figure 6](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f006)). These results are based on the differences in IC50 values for Mel (98 \u00b5M) and 18:1CDg-Mel (27 \u00b5M) in monolayer A375 [Table 3](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-t003)). Similarly, treatment of spheroid melanoma cell culture at greater Mel final concentration of 80 \u00b5M (recapitulating the IC50 value of naked Mel in monolayer) showed 24% cell toxicity with 18:1CDg-Mel complexes, compared to 14% for Mel-alone at the same conditions ( [Figure 6](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f006)). While cell toxicity for 18:1CDg-Mel complexes (at both 30 and 80 \u00b5M) are lower than cell death in A375 monolayer cell lines, the results are encouraging for future formulation development upon accounting for the higher complexity of the spheroid cell culture and smaller direct contact area with the drug dispersed in the cell culture medium compared to monolayer cultures. Nevertheless, formulating Mel with 18:1CDg caused a significant increase in the cytotoxicity of the drug at both concentrations. In our previous work, 12 CDg did not improve the delivery of Mel in the tumor spheroids of A375 cells as no such difference were found between the IC50 values between Mel-alone and the Mel-12 CDg formulation [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Thus, we hypothesize that the 18:1CDg, with unsaturated 18:1 tail, forms more favorable inclusion complexes with Mel than the 12 CDg with 12-carbon alkyl tail. This may be attributed to the combined effect of a more prominent inclusion binding along with secondary interactions due to association of the non-included C18:1 gemini chain that resides in the interstitial region of 18:1CDg, as described in the NMR results ( [Scheme 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-sch001)). [50](#B50-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. Previously, we reported that formulating Mel with 12 CDg significantly improved the efficiency of the drug in Mel-resistant A375, whereas Mel alone showed minimum cell death at the same concentration, in line with the anticipated effect [ [29](#B29-pharmaceutics-11-00427)]. In the current work, we evaluated the capability of newly designed CD-modified gemini surfactant (18:1CDg) to enhance ( [Figure 7](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f007)). Mel-resistant A375 cells showed low cell toxicity toward melphalan even at the highest concentration that was evaluated here (500 \u00b5M of melphalan). Therefore, we used 30 and 80 \u00b5M melphalan based on the known IC50 values of melphalan and the corresponding IC50 values of 18:1CDg alone in Mel-alone at 30 and 80 \u00b5M caused low cell death (4% and 27%, respectively). However, after treating the Mel-resistant cells with 18:1CDg-Mel complexes at final Mel concentration of 30 and 80 \u00b5M, a significant recovery of the activity was observed (46 and 76% cell death, respectively), as shown in [Figure 7](#pharmaceutics-11-00427-f007). These results suggest that the 18:1CDg delivery system was able to overcome the apparent drug resistance and enhance the treatment efficacy. 4.
