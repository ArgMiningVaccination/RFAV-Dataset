With all the changes that take place physically, socially and emotionally, Mindful Pediatrics gives special attention to what teenagers need. Many parents ask how long their teen should continue to see a pediatrician. Some young adults continue to be patients until they reach 21 years of age or graduate from college. Since many of our adolescent patients have been with us since birth or early childhood, they have had the opportunity to establish a comfortable and trusting relationship with our providers. This ongoing relationship often makes it easier for teenagers to discuss sensitive concerns. Adolescent Care & Teen Mental Health visits include: Comprehensive health history Physical examination Nutrition evaluation and advice Psychosocial assessment: stress, self-esteem, bullying Acne and other skin conditions Screen time and social media use discussion Holistic ADHD/ADD evaluations and treatment Sleep hygiene evaluation and guidance Teen risk assessment and management (substance use and high risk behavior) Anxiety and depression screening and integrated treatments Vaccine Consultations Many confusing and controversial issues are associated with the decision about whether or not to vaccinate your child. There seems to be two opposing sides, both of which seem to be backed up by \"scientific\" data. In our experience, vaccines seem to be well tolerated by healthy children in the short run. That being said, we believe it is far too complicated to evaluate the real long-term impact at this time. For this reason, we are cautious. We believe that one size does not fit all and that a vaccination schedule should be tailored to a specific child's exposure and risk. We use evidence-based research to help guide our patients and their family's decisions. Consultations for Chronic Illness & Diagnostic Dilemmas Understanding and treating complicated illness can be very challenging. We believe we must see both \"the trees and the forest\" to find the cause of an unusual or longstanding illness. We have an unwavering determination and commitment to solving your child's difficulties. We also support our patients by coordinating and connecting the family with the appropriate referrals and therapies for their child when needed. Each family and child requires a personalized approach.
