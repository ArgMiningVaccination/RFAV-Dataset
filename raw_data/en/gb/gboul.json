Tempe is also a sports mecca with the ASU Sun Devils, Phoenix Rising, Insight Bowl, spring training for Major League Baseball, the annual Rock 'N' Roll Ariz ona Marathon, and the Ironman Arizona Triathlon. Phoenix is fortunate to be a growing city with a hea lthy economy. Uniquely, the cos t of living in Phoenix and Tempe is lower relative to other metropolitan cities housing naturopathic colleges. SCNM Community The Tempe campus includes the SCNM Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regen erative Medicine located in the SCNM Community Commons, which convey the excitement and enthusiasm that the staff, faculty, and students bring to the SCNM community .

The SCNM campus also generates clean electricity, provides shade, and reduces energy costs through the install ation of solar -panel -covered structures over 80% of all parking spaces. Abundant light, evidence - based design, and sustainable and non -toxic materials create an atmosphere that delights the eye as it inspires healing, learning, and community engagement. Th e top -of- the-line Steelcase furnishings are functional and environmentally sustainable, providing students, patients, and the public comfortable and ergonomically sound seating throughout the Community Commons. The academic buildings are well equipped to serve the needs of the community. SCNM classrooms, SCNM medical facilities, and the Community Commons are equipped with presentation technology and wireless internet. In addition, computers are available for student use throughout the College library a nd at the SCNM Medical Center. To top it all off, the beauty of the medicinal gardens creates an atmosphere for community learning, campus events, and medical conferences. The gardens also provide botanicals for classroom instruction and lab experiences. Founded principally by naturopathic physicians Michael and Kyle Cronin, SCNM is one of only five recognized schoo ls of naturopathic medicine in the United States.

The SCNM Medical Center creates a clinical environment unique to any naturopathic clinical setting. Hydrotherapy, a core modality in naturopathic medicine and an important component of European water spas, comprises nearly thirty percent of the Center and includes a custom -designed steam area, two saunas (far infrared/radiant), and a hydrotherapy/color therapy suite. There are also two minor surgery suites with high definition video equipment for recording or transmitting c ertain procedures, with patient consent, for learning purposes. Intravenous therapies, which can be a prominent treatment method for many health conditions, are provided in the IV Suite. Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine For two generations the name Riordan has been synonymous with medical advances harnessing the body's innate healing ability. The Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine at SCNM will build on this legacy, turning the tide from symptom suppression to regeneration and healing . Open ed in late 2018 and replacing the Pain Relief Center, the Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine is located in a beautiful 6,200 -square foot space on the ground floor of the SCNM Community Commons building. Through patient care, research , and medical education, the Neil Riordan Center for R egenerative Medicine helps to usher in a new era in the treatment of pain and chronic disease by: Developing innovative, safe, effective and promising practices for patients suffering from pain Training the n ext generation of physicians skilled in Regenerative Medicine Building the foundation for in vitro and clinical research in regenerative medicine to explore new treatments and explicate their mechanisms of action Equipment and Technology In addition to serving patients' health needs, the S CNM Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine are the primary site s for naturopathic medical students' clinical training. Designed with video technolog y in each of the 6 classrooms and 27 exam rooms, the se SCNM medical facilities support student learning in the clinical environment. Corporate sponsors donated large LCD monitors to each classroom which enhance the physicia ns' ability to use online resources, display a patient's electr onic health record (EHR), and closed -circuit observation of exam rooms when appropriate. This technology allows students to gain immediate feedback from their attending physician. In addition, state -of-the-art medical equipment in each exam room was donate d by Welch -Allyn. Naturopathic medical student learning is supported through the Clinical Resource Center, a specialized clinical collection that is an extension of the SCNM Library. The collection features resources in naturopathic modalities including acupuncture, botanical medicine, nutrition, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and environmental, physical, and mind -body medicine. The SCNM Library subscribes to electronic books, journals, and specialized medical and naturopathic databases that supplement the on -campus print resources. Thanks to a generous contribution from American Medical Solutions (AMS), one of healthcare's premiere Electronic Health Records (EHR) companies, SCNM became the first naturopathic medical school to implement EHR. The utilization of EH R increases medical research opportunities and enhances patient benefits through electronic record keeping and communication among the SCNM Medical Facility physicians and other healthcare providers.

This card is good for 6 years as outlined by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The MS Nutrition Business Leadership program prepares students to be eligible to attain the following certif ications: Current Good Manufactu ring Practice ( CGMP Preventive Controls Qualified Individual (PCQI) , and Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) . Ancillary program expenses are paid directly to outside agencies and organizations. Certifications are administered by third -party organizations. Should students opt to pursue certification, all application and examination fees associated with these certifications are paid directly to the outside agencies and organizations . Please check the specific program expenses on MySCNM for a mo re detailed list of additional costs. Financial Policies Tuition and Fee Payment All tuition and fees listed are in U.S. currency. Tui tion and fees for each term are payable in full by Friday of the first week of the quarter. Students who have not paid t heir tuition and fees in full by the end of the first week of a term will be notified of SCNM's intent to drop the student from all registered courses and clerkships , and the student will not be considered enrolled and participating. Depending on the amoun t of time lapsed, students may be given permission to re-register for courses/clerkships after payment of tuition and fees are received in full. Late registration and clinical drop/add fees may apply. Throughout the course of a term, students may incur additional fees and fines for which payment is due upon notice of debt. The SCNM Business Office will place a hold on student accounts until debts are paid in full. Further : Any debt or returned check may revoke a student's current enrollment. Permission to register for subsequent terms will be blocked until all student debt is paid in full for previous terms. Course credit will not be given until all student de bt is paid in full. Transcripts or diplomas will not be released until all student de bt is paid in full. Students are responsible for keeping SCNM informed of their current address and should update their personal information on MySCNM or submit address changes to the Registrar's Office immediately upon moving. Students enrolled in online distance learning programs will also be required to confirm their current address at the beginning of each quarter. It is each student's responsibility to review their accounts on MySCNM and to read and maintain email communication with the SCNM Business O ffice when accounts are not in balance . Payment Options Student payments must be in U.S. currency by cash, credit card, personal check, or bank check. Students who receive federal financial aid are not allowed to prepay tuition and fee charges using a pers onal credit card. Financial Aid Recipients In accordance with the U.S. Department of Education (E D) 34 CFR 668.1 64 (c), federal student aid shall be posted to student accounts for allowable tuition and fee charges pr ior to crediting student accounts for ot her costs such as living expenses. Further, student verification of attendance in classes or clerkships must be documented prior to financial aid disbursement. Once student aid is applied to student accounts and attendance verification is received, the net difference between aid and tuition and fee charges results in an amount due to student or an amount due from student. Amounts due to students are provided in the form of a paper check or directly deposited in student bank accounts. Amounts due from studen ts are due and payable according to the payment guidelines outlined previously . Finan cial Policies Page 14 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Foreign Financial Aid or Third - Party Payer Recipients Proof of official promissory note and/or offer letter from a third -party payer must be delivered to the SCNM Business Office prior to the first day of a term in order to avoid being dropped from all registered courses and clerkships and having to re -register for courses, as outlined previously . Financial Aid Students in eligible programs seeking federal funding for their educational needs will receive assistance through the Financial Aid Office . The Federal William D. Ford Direct Loans are available to those who qualify, based on federal regulations. General Eligibility Require ments All students seeking financial aid must meet general eligibility requirements regarding citizenship, selective service, financial need , and satisfactory academic progress. Students who are currently in default and have not made satisfactory loan rep ayments or owe a refund on a Title IV program do NOT qualify for any form of federal aid. Financial Aid Procedure Students in eligible programs interested in obtaining financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the D irect Master Promissory Note (MPN), and Federal Stafford Entrance Counseling Exam . Approximately two to three weeks after submission of the FAFSA, the results of the compilation of information, including the estimated family contribution, is sent to the student and SCNM. Once the student's file is reviewed for eligibility, federal funding is determined. The student will receive an award letter reflecting the cost of attendance based on the student's credit hour load reflected in their final registration and the type of aid offered based on the student's eligibility. Loss of Eligibility Due to a Drug Conviction A student who is convicted of a state or federal off ense involving the possession or sale of an illegal drug that occurred while enrolled in school a nd receiving Title IV aid is not eligible for Title IV funds . (Please see SCNM's Alcohol and Drug A buse Policy in the SCNM Student Handbook ). A borrower's eligibility is based on the student's s elf- certification on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Convictions that are reversed, set aside , or removed from the student's record, or a determination arising from a juvenile court proceeding do not affect eligibility and do not need to be reported by the student. A student convicted of a drug -related offense while enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid loses Title IV eligibility as follows: 1. For the possession of illegal drugs: First offense: one year from the date of conviction Second offense: two years from the date of the second conviction Third offense: indefinite period 2. For the sale of illegal drugs: First offense: two years from the date of conviction Second offense: indefinite period A school must provide a student who loses Title IV el igibility due to a drug -related conviction with a timely, separate, clear, and conspicuous written notice. The notice must advise the student of hi s or her loss of Title IV eligibility and the ways in which the student may regain that eligibility. Regaining Eligibility after a Drug Conviction Students denied eligibility for an indefinite period can regain eligibility after completing any of the fol lowing three options: 1. Successfully completing a rehabilitation program (as described below, which includes passing two unannounced drug tests from such a program); 2. Having the conviction reversed, set aside, or remove d from the student's record so that fe wer than two convictions for sale or three convictions for possession remain on the record; or 3. Successfully completing two unannounced drug tests which are part of a rehab program (the student does not need to complete the rest of the program). A drug reh abilitation program is considered approved for these purposes if it includes at least two unannounced drug tests and meets one of the following requirements: The program received or is qualified to receive funds directly or indirectly under a federal, state, or local government program. The program is administered or recognized by a federal, state, or local government agency or court. The program received or is qualified to receive payment directly or indirectly from a federally or state licensed insuran ce company. The program is administered or recognized by a federally or state -licensed hospital, health clinic, or medical doctor. When a student regains eligibility during the award year, SCNM may award campus -based aid for the current Financial Policies Page 15 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog payment period (qu arter) and Direct Loans for the period of enrollment (academic year). Federal Student Aid Handbook. (201 8-2019). School -Determined Requirements. 22-23. Retrieved from: https://ifap.ed.gov/fsahandbook/attachments/1819FSAHbkVol1Ch 1.pdf Federal Work Study Federal Work Study (FWS) awards are need -based. Campus - based s tudents in eligible programs are required to indicate their desire to participate in the FWS program when completing their FAFSA or communicate their desire to the SCNM Financ ial Aid Office to ensure FWS awarding is an option. Available positions are advertised each quarter. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for additional information at finaid@scnm.edu. International Students Although international students do not qualify for U. S. federal financial aid, there are other options to help fund the ir SCNM education. Private student loans are available to foreign students; however, they must have a United States citizen or permanent resident as a co -signer. In addition, Canadian students may be eligible to apply for Canadi an student loans through their respective provincial governments. Canadian students receiving financial aid from their provincial governments will be held to the sam e payment deadlines for tuition . Tuition must be paid in full by Friday of the first week of the quarter . If provincial financial aid is received by SCNM after the student has paid, a refund of excess tuition will be issued to the student within ten busine ss days. Canadian students are responsible for initiating the process of financial assistance from their province. Documentation will be sent to the Financial Aid Office at SCNM for completion and returned to the appropriate provincial government. Distance Learning Page 16 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Distanc e Learning In addition to traditional campus -based courses, SCNM offers courses via distance or online learning. Online learning can occur in different forms , from 100% online (online) to partially online (hybrid or blended) courses. Online learning, whether offered at a distance, locally through a 100% online course , or a hybrid course, comprises directed learning processes and facilitates student interaction with the content. Directed learning processes generally involve educational information (articles, videos, images, and web links), communication (messaging, discussion forums), and assessment used to measure students' achievement. Online Courses Online lea rning consists of all e -learning (web -based) instruction and activities . In 100% online courses ; there are no face -to-face requirements within the course. All communication and coursework are completed through the learning management system. Hybrid Course s Blended (hybrid) learning consists of traditional fa ce-to-face instruction mixed with e -learning (web -based) activities. Face -to-face time is scheduled along with web-based or out - of-class work; typically, face -to-face class time is replaced with web -based or out -of-class work. Communications and coursework are enhanced by making use of Canvas, MySCNM , and other online tools. Course Accessibillity Students will have access to online courses upon registration; however, course content may not be available prior to the start of the quarter. Technology Requirements Students enrolled in SCNM courses must have access to the following minimum requirements: Operating System: Microsoft Windows Operating System (Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10) or Mac OS 10.95 or above with the operating system's minimum requirements for processor, memory, and hard drive. Audio: A working sound card and speakers will be required. Webcam and Microphone: Some classes may require a microphone and webcam to complete assignments/ projects and interact with classmates. Display: 1024 x 768 monitor with a 16 -bit or greater video card Storage: At least 10.0 GB of free hard -drive space will be necessary to ensure that you are able to download course materials when necessary . Internet Access: High -speed internet connection, such as DSL or a cable modem. An internet connection is necessary for viewing course materials and supplemental videos in Canvas. Internet Browser : Chrome or Firefox is recommended for accessing all onlin e courses in Canvas. Other acceptable internet browsers include Internet Explorer and Safari. Word Processor and Required Applications : Microsoft Office is required and available for free to student s through their Office 365 account . Student Authenticatio n The United States Federal Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008, Public Law 110 -315, mandates that institutions validate that the person enrolled in and receiv ing credit for the online course is the same person participating in and completing t he online course. To authenticate student identity in online courses , SCNM use s a secure login with username and password to authenticate student identity. In accordance with Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), methods used to authenticate s tudent identity in online and distance learning courses will protect the privacy of student information. Privacy Students should be aware that information posted using course tools in courses with online components, including discussion forums, blogs, or videos, are available to the instructor and fellow students. Students should refrain from posting personal or confidential information to safeguard their privacy. Institutional Policies Page 17 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Institutional Polic ies Enrollment Policy Once matriculated, a student must be continuously en rolled unless the student is taking an approved leave of absence. International students attending SCNM on an I -20 must maintain full -time enrollment at all times unless otherwise following the articulat ed program of study. All exceptions require approval from the Dean of Students. Please direct any questions regarding international student status to the Dean of Students' Office. Students who fail a course may not be eligible to progress in their prescrib ed program of study until the failed course has been successfully completed. Students may not take courses in advance of their program as outlined in the program of study without the approval of the Academic Policy and Progress Committee ( APPC ). Students a re not allowed to attend, nor will credit be awarded for, courses for which they are not registered. Students will not be a llowed to have concurrent enrollment or register for courses for which they do not have prerequisites or co -requisites without prior approval from the APPC. SCNM confers degrees only following the end of each academic term. SCNM does not guarantee the award of the degree to students enrolled in the program. The award of degree s is contingent upon satisfaction of all current degree and instructional requirements at the time of such award, compliance with SCNM regulations, as well as performance and conduct meeting bona fide expectations of faculty. No member of the faculty is obliged to provide students or graduates with an evaluation or letter of recommendation that does not accurately reflect the faculty member's true opinion and evaluation of the student's academic performance and conduct. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) This federal law is designed to protect the con fidentiality of the student 's educational records. The Act affords the student certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights ensure that eligible students have access to their educational records for inspection and review and to requ est amendment if the student believes they are inaccurate or in violation of the student 's privacy. Further, this law protects the rights of a student to privacy by limiting access by others to education records without express written consent of the stude nt and the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Dep artme nt of Ed ucation concerning alleged failures by SCNM to comply with the requirements of FERPA. SCNM may release information from an education record without the consent of the student to officials o f another college or university where the student seeks or intends to enroll, as permitted by FERPA \u00a799.31 (a)(2). SCNM may release information from an education record without the consent of the student to another educat ional institution in which the stud ent is enrolled. For example, SCNM may release academic records for a \"dual enrollment\" without prior written consent (FERPA \u00a799.34 (b)). SCNM may disclose information from an education record without the consent of the student if the informatio n is necess ary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals (FERPA \u00a799.36). Student records are open to other school officials, including faculty and administr ation, and local and state education agencies that have been determined to have a leg itimate educational interest, including those specified by the Act as amended January 3, 2012. Students have the right to review and inspect their education records, including their application, except for confidential recommendations. Photo identification must be presented before access to education records will be permitted. An appointment must be made with the Registrar's Office to access an education record. Directory Information SCNM may release information that has been defined under the Directory Inf ormation Provision of FERPA. SCNM defines directory information as name, address, photo/photo -ID, phone number, e -mail address, dates of attendance, program of study, degree conferral date, enrollment status, grade level, previous educational institutions attended, and degrees/awards earned. Forms are available at the Registrar's Office for a student to request that SCN M withhold all directory information . Proper Disclosure Student information of a private, personal, or confidential nature that is provided to SCNM faculty and staff will not be disclosed improperly. Faculty are expected to provide accurate evaluations of students. For the purposes of monitoring and recording student progress, evaluatio ns include the strengths and weaknesses of academic, clini cal, communication, and professional skills. The evaluations also include observations and opinions regarding academic effort and professional conduct. Although not required, faculty and staff may provide judgments of a student's Institutional Policies Page 18 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog abilities and character to others in appropriate circumstances in accordance with the SCNM policy on student records. Change of Name The name used by a student on all educational records, including their diploma, must be the student's legal name. T o change the name reflected on s tudent records, a student must complete the name change form and provide one of the following legal documents to the Registrar's Office: A copy of the student's social security card A certified copy of a court decree dissolving a marriage/restoring maiden name A certified copy of the court order directing a change of name A valid motor vehicle driver's license The student's request is recorded after all materials are submitted. Registration Pre-registration All SCNM programs are cohort -based ; therefore , students are automatically registered for core courses (not electives or selectives) , including labs and clinical clerkships /courses . Students may not deviate from their prescribed program of study. Following registration and prior to the start of the term, students enrolled in campus -based courses will have the opportunity to trade course/lab sections or clinical clerkships ( see SCNM C linical Handbook) according to published deadlines for their prescribed program of study. Registration New campu s-based students will provide one form of legal photo identification \u2014such as driver's license or passport \u2014at orientation. Registration for ND selective courses is available to students online 24/7 during the open registration period. Registration dates for each program of study are published in the academic calendar unless posted otherwise. Registration is the responsibility of the student. S tudents may not register for courses after the second week o f classes (see Adding and Dropping Courses). Students who fail any courses may not be eligible to progress in their prescribed program of study, will be dropped from the post - requisite course(s), and must meet with the student advisor to amend their registration. Students must have the required prerequisites or co-requisites to be registered for the next quarter's courses. Students who fail milestone, capstone , or sequence courses are not eligible to progress until the course is repeated with a passing grade. Students must be final registered for courses in order to attend. Students complete the online Registration Term Agreement to finalize registration each term. As part of fall quarter registration, all students are also required to review and update their personal and emergency contact information. Students en rolled in online distance learning programs are required to verify their current address and indicate the state in which they will be taking courses, if different from their address, prior to the start of each quarter. Students who do not complete the agre ement (and information update when required) during the designated time period will be charged a Late Registration F ee and may not be registered for the next quarter's courses . (See Tuition and Fee s.) Registration Holds A registration hold may be placed on a student's record to prevent the student from registering for courses in future quarters for financial, administrative (including failure to comply with SCNM's Everfi requirement , current NPLEX policies , or address verification requirement ), or academic reasons. Any registration hold must be resolved before a student is registered. Attendance Students are expected to attend all classes, laboratories, and clinical clerkships. It is the faculty member's prerogative to determine attendance requirements for campus -based lecture sessions. Attendance requirements are stated in the course syllabus. Attendance at laboratories and clinical clerkships is mandatory. Attendance for online distance learning courses is determined by active participation within a distance course such as submitting an assignment or exam, attending an online chat, or posting to a discussion forum. Simply logging into the course is not considered participation. Participat ion will not be c ounted for assignments submitted prior to the official first day of the quarter. Class participation by the end of the 3rd day of the course is required to verify attendance and to release financial aid, if applicable. Students who do not maintain active p articipation in a distance course, as outlined in the syllabus, are encouraged to withdraw from the course to avoid failure of the course . (See Adding and Dropping Courses. ) Students receiving Title IV financial assistance, including assistance from the Ve terans Administration (VA), are responsible for meeting VA and/or applicable federal aid attendance requirements. Adding and Dropping Courses Institutional Policies Page 19 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog SCNM programs of study are track program s. Changes to the student's prescribed program of study must receive appr oval from the Academic Policy and Progress Committee (APPC) . Schedule changes requested after the start of a quarter are only permitted as detailed belo w: Students who fail to drop any course for which they are registered and fail to attend/participate in that course are subject to failing the course and the academic policies pertaining to failing a course . (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study .) Students dropping a course after the course census date ( ND program, end of week t wo; MS programs, third day of course) may impact their academic performance/academic progress. All courses dropped after the census date require the approval of the APPC. Courses dropped after the census date through the fourth week of the course will resu lt in a grade of WD (withdrawal) on the student's official transcript and have no impact on the student's GPA; courses taken again after a WD grade was earned for that course will be noted as a repeat on their official transcript. Following the fourth week of the course, students receive the grade earned at the time of withdrawal; faculty will assign a grade of WD if the student is passing the course, or if the faculty cannot certify that the student is failing the course at the time the course is dropped. The faculty will assign a grade of WF (withdrawal fail) if the faculty can certify that the student is failing the course at the time the course is dropped. (See Leave of Absence Policy for exceptions .) Courses that are taught in a 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8 -week fo rmat stand independent of the withdrawal timeframe outlined above. Courses dropped after the census date of the course (week two) and before the 60% completion of the course receive a grade of WD. Dropping after 60% completion of the course results in a grade of WD if the student is passing or if the faculty cannot certify that the student is failing the course at the time the course is dropped. The faculty will assign a grade of WF (withdrawal fail) if the faculty can certify that the student is failing th e course at the time of the withdrawal. (See Refund Policy/Drop Courses for prescribed program of study .) If the student has completed all course requirements prior to the student's withdrawal date, the grade earned at that time will be assigned by faculty as the final grade for the course. A WD grade may be administratively assigned if no grade is submitted by faculty prior to the end of the term's grading period. Changes made to a student's schedule may result in appropriate tuition and/or fees being app lied to their account. (See Tuition and Fees .) See the ND Program Add/Drop Requirements for additional program requirements . Auditing Courses Students may audit a course if they have already received credit for the course, met the course prerequisites , and have registered for the course. A student may not audit a course for which they have not already received credit. A student cannot audit laboratory courses or clinical courses. Non - degree students may not audit courses (exception applies for SCNM Alumni ). When auditing a course, students do not earn a grade, nor do they receive credit. Courses taken as audit will appear as an AU on the student's official transcript. (See Tuition and F ees.) Academic Policy and Progress Committee The Academic Policy and Progress Committee (APPC) is comprised of faculty, administration, and staff members. The APPC makes academic decisions regarding students' progress throughout the ir program. The decisions of the APPC are final with the exception of decisions regardi ng academic dismissal, which may be appealed to the Vice President of Academic Affairs . Leave of Absence A leave of absence (LOA) may be granted to any student maintaining satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed program of study and who has met all financial obligations to SCNM. All LOA s will be approved by the APPC . While on LOA, students are not eligible to attend c ourses or clinical clerkships, nor receive fi nancial aid. The Financial Aid Office will be notified of the student 's intended last date of attendance when s tudents request an LOA. If students are unable to complete a quarter, tuitio n and fee refunds will be issued according to the Add/Drop Policy ; and final grades will be issued according to the Grading Scale Policy. (See Adding and Dropping Courses and Grading Scale Policy .) LOA is a period of non -enrollment where students are not considered to be working toward the completion of their degre e. The length of time allowed for LOA va ries depending Institutional Policies Page 20 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog on type of leave (see Types of Leave of Absence) . Students on LOA are not eligible for financial aid and are subject to federal regulations pertaining to current loans. Upon return from LOA, the stud ent must continue to meet technical standards and graduation requirements for their prescribed program of study. 1. Students will initiate the LOA process through the student advisor or Dean of Students . 2. Requests for LOA will be considered individually by APPC using the following guidelines: a. LOA will only be granted to students demonstrating satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed program of study . b. LOA should be requested prior to the beginning of a term and be approved before the term for which it is requested. c. In cases of death , serious illness in the family, or serious personal injury, a hardship withdrawal may be granted during any academic term; students will be administratively withdrawn from all coursework in progress at the time of approved LOA. Hardship withdrawals must be approved by APPC. 3. Leave time will be considered a portion of the total time limit for the degree. (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study.) 4. Students who do not return to active enrollment at th e end of the granted leave are administratively withdrawn from SCNM. Students who are absent in excess of one year must go through the admission process for re - entry. Students are responsible for any outstanding tuition, fees, medical center bills, and lib rary fines. Types of Leave of Absence Administrative Leave of Absence (ALOA) The Administrative Leave of Absence (ALOA) policy assists and supports students who are unable to progress in their prescribed program of study due to failure of a required cours e by streamlining the leave of absence process. Students will receive an official notification of the ALOA from the Registrar's Office . The general policies for a student on LOA included previously typically apply to a student on ALOA and are also included in detail in the SCNM Student Handbook. Personal Leave of Absence Students who are temporarily unable to continue their program of stud y for personal reasons may request a Personal LOA for a specific period of time not to exceed two consecutive quarters in a 12 -month period. Students on a personal LOA that exceeds two quarters must request an extension from APPC or they may be officially withdrawn . Medical Leave of Absence Students who are temporarily unable to con tinue their program of study for medical reasons may request a Medical LOA for a specific period of time not to exceed a 12 - month period. Students requesting an LOA for medical reasons must provide documentation by a clinician qualifi ed to diagnose in the appropriate area of specialization. Documentation must be based on a current evaluation, provided on letterhead, typed, dated , and have an original signature. The same documentation is required when a student wishes to return from the medical LOA, indicati ng the student is now able to resume their academic program. All documentation must be attached to the LOA form. For information regarding medical accommodations, please see Accesibilty Office pages on MySCNM. Military Leave of Absence Any student who is a member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States and is called to active duty will be granted a Military LOA for the period of active duty and one year thereafter. Students will submit th e student's notification of duty requirements from the military . Upon return from a Military LOA, the student will be reactivated with the same academic status and without loss of academic credits earned, scholarships or grants awarded, or tuition or other fees paid prior to the commencement of active duty. Leave of Absence and Financial Aid The U.S. Department of Education requires that a student maintain a minimum status of half -time enrollment to receive federal financial aid. Therefore, students who are on ALOA/LOA will be considered withdrawn according to financial aid regulation 34 CFR 668.22 (d). If students are unable to complete a quarter, tuition and fee refunds will be issued according to the Add/Drop Policy for their prescribed program of study ; and final grades will be issued according to the Grading Scale Policy. Leave time will be considered a portion of the total time limit for degree completion. (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study .) Institutional Policies Page 21 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Exit Interview Students who are enrolled less than half time, withdraw , or graduate from SCNM are required by the U.S. Department of Education to complete the online exit counseling. The exit counseling is to help borrowers understand their responsibilities when repaying on their federal student loans . To complete the exit counseling , visit www.StudentLoans.gov . Leave of Absence and Library Resources Students in good standing with SCNM are allowed to use the library resources. The library provides ample opportunity for all patrons to resolve account issues. The Registrar's Office notif ies the library of students approved for a leave of absence (LOA) . Students on a n LOA must return all library materials and pay any outstanding fines prior to LOA approval. (See Library P rivilege s during a Leave of Absence .) Reactivation of Enrollment after Leave of Absence Students wishing to be re -activated within a year from the last date of attendance must submit a Reactivation Application form, along with any supporting documents as dete rmined by the type of LOA. The student must contact the student advisor to initiate reactivation and for assistance on requirements. All reactivation requests must be approved by the APPC. The APPC will review the request and determine the student's readin ess to re -enter the program. Upon return from LOA, the student must continue to me et any technical standards and all graduation requirements for their prescribed program of study . If a student enrolled in a n ND clinically -based program ceases to be enrolle d, including LOAs, Arizona ND statutes require that the certificate to engage in clinical training hel d by that student be automatically canceled. This requires that ND students returning from a n LOA must re -apply for a new clinical training certificate (CTC) prior to their return to SCNM as required by the Arizona Naturopathic Medi cal Board. A CTC is required to be current, and it is the responsibi lity of the ND student to ensure that they have a valid CTC during their enrollment . ND c linical students who return from an LOA may be required to attend Clinical Skills Development Sessions (CSDS) to ensure they are prepared for reentry into the clinical program . Returning ND clinical students will onl y be scheduled in onsite clerkships during the term they reactivate. The time during which the student was on ALOA/LOA and/or withdrawn will be considered a portion o f the total time limit for degree completion. Academic Standing , Leave of Absence , and Wit hdrawals Students cannot avoid academic action by taking a n LOA or withdrawing. Each student's a cademic standing is finalized at the conclusion of each quarter after a review of the term 's final grade submissions. A student who meets the criteria for proba tion and/or dismissal will be notified at the end of the term . (S ee Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of stud y.) Administrative Withdrawal SCNM is required to verify the enrollment and participation of students who participate in Feder al Title IV student aid programs and/or who receive educational benefits through alternate funding sources. Students may be administratively withdrawn from the college under the following circumstances: Failure to pay tuition and fees for the prescribed program of study by the published deadline Failure to return to active enrollment at the end of the granted leave Failure to complete Registration Term Agreement, Personal Information Update (when required), and/or necessary authorizations for registration t o occur Complete Withdrawal /Refund Policy Complete withdrawal is defined as completely withdra wing from all c ourses (including a leave of absence). In the case of a complete withdrawal, the following tuition refunds apply and are dependent upon the withdrawal date. For calculation purposes, the date of complete withdra wal is the date the student provides a formal writt en notice to the Registrar's or Dean of Students' office. Written noti ce via e - mail is sufficient if the e -mail is sent from the student's SCNM e -mail account. In the case of a student who fails to notify the College of intent to withdraw, the date that is the midpoint of the term or the student's last documented date of an academically related activity will be considered the withdrawal date, whichever is the longest time. Courses that are taught in a condensed format (i.e. , selective courses offered as intensives or courses that precede the term) will be considered as stand -alone courses for the purpose of withdrawal and refunds. Refunds are determined based upon the last date of attendance in relation to the course's offici al start date. The percentage of time enrolled in each course will dictate the refund amount. Institutional Policies Page 22 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Withdrawal Date Refund Calculations Complete withdrawal before the start of the term. 100% tuition and fees with the exception of non - refundable fees as noted i n Tuition and Fees Complete withdrawal after the start of the term, or before 60% completion of the course. % of tuition and refundable fees will be based on the federal guidelines formula as shown belo w, with the exception of non- refundable fees as noted in Tuition and Fees After the 60% completion point of the course/term. 0% tuition and fees refunded Federal Formula 1. Refund Ra te = Calendar days completed in the period of enrollment divided by total calendar days in the period of enrollment 2. Refund Amount = Tuition charges for the period of enrollment X the percentage of unearned Title IV aid This calculation determines the percen tage of federal funds that have been earne d by the school at the time of withdrawal and the amount of unearned funds that must be returned to the federal program. For more information contact the Financial Aid Office at finaid@scnm.edu . Dropped Courses/ Refund Policy Students who do not completely withdraw from t he college but drop a c ourse /clerkship during the published drop period will be refunded the difference in the tuition paid and the tuition rate applicable to the reduced number of hours, including course -specific fees assessed to the c ourses dropped. There is no refund due to a student who partially withdraws from courses after the official census date of the prescribed program of study course add/drop period. Tuition paid for intensive courses will not be refunded once the course has begun. Special drop d eadlines may apply for certain courses . Deadlines will be included in quarterly registration notifications . Testing and Examinations Examination Standards When taking in-person or online examinations, students: Are required to leave all books and other aids in an inaccessible spot, such as in the front of the room or in another room (exception: open -book tests) Must refuse to assist other students in cheating Should encourage honesty and discourage dishonesty amo ng other students May not receive/send answers from or to other students (via text, instant message, phone, email, etc.) Are not allowed to talk to each other during an examination Should place as much space between themselves and other students as possib le, when necessary Are encouraged to use a blank sheet of paper placed over their work and take the initiative to prevent others from copying their work , when necessary May not leave the room and return to the test or hand test/papers to faculty/proctor without express permission Students speaking to one another or appearing to engage in academic dishonesty during an exam will have their exams confiscated, will receive an automatic zero for the examination, and may be subject to disciplinary actions. For more information, see SCNM Student Handbook , Integrity and Academic Honesty . Final Examinations Final examinations will be conducted at the conclusion of every quarter during the period (s) designated in the academic calendar. Courses that conclude prior to the end of the quarter will conduct final exams during the final week of the course. A final examination schedule for campus - based courses specifying days and times for each course will b e established and published each quarter by the Academic Coordinator. All final examinations must be conducted according to the schedule. Exceptions to this schedule are only made for conflicts that may arise for students, for required or approved take -hom e final exams, online distance learning exams , or for special projects that will be due during the appropriate period set by the faculty member. A student may not take an examination at other than the designated time without petitioning and being granted p ermission to do so by the faculty member under the Special Exam policy. The appropriate form is available electronically on MySCNM. Special Exam ination Fee(s) apply. (See Tuition and Fees .) Institutional Policies Page 23 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Missed Examinations Students are expected to sit for all examinat ions at the scheduled time and day or complete examinations by the published deadline . This includes academic and clinical tests, quizzes, midterms, and finals. As a standard policy , all exams scheduled outside of the original time and day are subject to t he Special Examination Fee, depending on the circumstances . If students know ahead of time that they will miss an examination, it is up to the student to direc tly inform the faculty member teaching the course and the Dean of Students of their absence at le ast one week prior to the administration of the examination. If such contact is not reasonably possible, the student must contact the faculty and Dean of Students as soon as possible after the examination and attempt to work out a solution with the faculty member. The Dean of Students ' office reserves the right to require written justification (doctor's note, hospital discharge, etc.) with appropriate documentation for waiver consideration. Waivers will be granted only for extenuating circumstances out of the student's control. In the case of a medica lly excuse d absence , the student must be seen by the physician within 24 hours before or after the missed exam and submit the doctor 's note to the Dean of Students. A doctor's note from a p hysician in the SCNM medical centers is acceptable for a missed exam. If the Dean of Studen ts determines there were rare and extenuating circumstances (i.e., serious illness, accident, etc.) that prohibited the student from both attending the examination a nd from informing the faculty member prior to the examination, a waiver can be issued; however, the faculty member must approve that the examination is eligible for make -up. Students who are not allowed to make up a missed examination and believe they were not provided fair treatment by the faculty member can utilize the normal grade appeal and/or grievance procedures. Students may also request an alternatively scheduled exam for a non -emergency/non -medical reason with a legitimate and academically -related reason . However, the examination will be different in content than the originally scheduled examination , and the time and place for the rescheduled exam is non-negot iable once set. The student must contact the relevant faculty member as soon as they are aware of the potential request to discuss the possibility for this alternate examination. There will be no waiver of the Special Examination Fee (see Tuition and Fees ) for this type of exam . Abuse of this policy and privilege will result in the privilege bei ng withdrawn. Competency Examinations Students may request to take a competency examination for select course transfer credit if a similar course has been completed more than seven ( 7) years prior to the start of the course . Competency examinations must be requested and approved prior to matriculation. Competency e xams for all first-quarter courses must be completed prior to matriculation; all other competency exams for courses must be completed prior to the start of quarter two. Eligibility is determined on a case -by-case basis by the Registrar's Office, in conjunction with the faculty and the acad emic dean. A syllabus or other relevant documentation is required to determine eligibility. The competency examination appl ies only to the course requ ested and may not be used for another course. Students may request to take a competency exam by submitting a request to Admissions or the Registrar's Offi ce. Students may attempt a competency examination only once per approved course. If a student fails th e competency examination, the student must complete the course. Course credit given through passing a competency examination may be reflected as transfer credit or grade of \"S\" Satisfactory on the transcript. Competency Examination Fee(s) apply ( see Tuitio n and Fees ). Clinical credits are not eligible for competency examinations. Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress SCNM is committed to excellence in educational quality and learning outcomes by providing a supportive academic environment to students. Federal regulations require SCNM to develop and apply a consistent policy of academic progress, which includes a quantitative measure (credit hours completed) as well as a qualitative measure (grade point average). To make satisfactory academic progress, SCNM students must take and successfully complete a cumulative number of required credits by the end of every calendar year and maintain a minimum career GPA (see Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study ). Failure to maintain either o f these requirements will result in a student being placed on academic probation and/or being academically dismissed. At Risk for Unsatisfactory Academic Progress SCNM students have the responsibility to recognize when they are experiencing academic difficulties and to initiate requests for assistance. Students are encouraged to seek assistance from their faculty members and the SCNM Student Success Center . When a s tudent's c ourse attendance, demonstrated competence, and/or rate of academic progress indicates he or she is not succeeding in a course, the faculty member may discuss the situation with the student and report the student's concerns to the Dean of Institutional Policies Page 24 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Students . The Dean of Students will then connect the student with the appropriate resources to support his/her success. These may include, but are not limited to, support from peer mentors, advisors, tutoring services, and counseling. Grading Scale Policy Faculty members are required to provide students with a course syllabus that outlines course requirements, including methods of evaluation that assess mastery of course content. Core courses in the ND program will be graded A/B/C/F ; clinical clerkships and lab/medicinary posts are graded satisfactory/ unsatisfactory (S/U). S/U graded courses have no effect on GPA and are noted in the course syllabus. Core courses in the MS program s will be graded A/B/F . Grade Point Averages The Grade Point Average (GPA ) for each quarter is calculated by multiplying the point value of the grade received (see following table) by the number of credits for each course. To calculate the GPA, add the credits, then add the grade points and divide the total points by the total credits. The same principle applies to the cumulative GPA reflected on the transcript. If a course is repeated, all grades earned are used in determining the GPA. Grades received at another institution are not included in the SCNM G PA. Grades specific to the Naturopathic Doctorate (ND) pro gram are indicated next to the grade . Grades specific to the Master of Science (MS) program s are indicated next to the grade . Grade Description Points Percentage A Outstanding 4 90-100% B Very Good 3 80-89% C (ND) Average 2 70-79% F (ND) F (MS) Fail Fail 0 0 69% or less 79% or less AU Audit Taken I Incomplete Additional work required I/R Incomplete/ Remediate Additional work required S (ND) Satisfactory Pass/Credit earned U (ND) Unsatisfactory Fail/No credit earned T Transfer Graduate transfer WD Withdrew Withdrew passing WF Withdrew failing Withdrew failing WV Waived Requirements waived WIP Work in Progress Continuing course Grade of Fail or Unsatisfactory A grade of Fail \"F\"/Unsatisfactory \"U\"/Withdrawal Fail \"WF\" can seriously affect the student's academic progress and the student's eligibility for financial aid. An \"F\"/\"U\"/\"WF\" in a prerequisite for other courses precludes the student from entering those courses unt il the \"F\"/\"U\"/\"WF\" has been rectified. In order to rectify the grade of \"F\"/\"U\"/\"WF,\" the course must be repeated at the next available offering in th e student's prescribed program of study (with the exception o f selectives). A course may be repeated one time only. Both the original \"F\"/\"U\"/\"WF\" and the grade given in the repeated course appear on the student's transcript. If a second \"F\"/\"U\"/\"WF\" is earned for the repeated course, the student may be academically dismissed. (See Academic Probation and Acad emic Dismissal for prescribed program of study.) Grade of Incomplete A grade of incomplete \"I\" is given by faculty teachi ng the didactic course/clerkship when a student has satisfactorily completed 70% of the course and its requirements as stipulated in th e syllabus but is unable to complete the course during the term enrolled, and only if the student has a legitimate extenuating circumstance (i.e., serious illness, bereavement, or circumstances beyond the student's control). The Grade of Incomplete request form is required and submitted to the faculty for didactic courses. A legitimate reason must be corroborated by communication with the Dean of Students and/or student advisor and faculty teaching the course. Incompletes for ND clinical clerkship s will fol low the Incomplete/Make -up Policy and process outlined in the SCNM Clinical Handbook. The student must complete the course/clerkship by the Friday prior to the start of the next quarter unless an extension is granted by the faculty member who has also informed the Registrar's Office of the extension deadline. All incompletes must have a final grade submitted by the faculty member no later than the end of the following quarter (please refe r to course syllabus) with the exception of documented medical or military leave. (See Medical Leave of Absence or Military Leave of Absence. ) Institutional Policies Page 25 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Students may not request an incomplete for didactic courses under the following circumstances: if they are not currently passing the course after taking the final exam in a didactic course if it is a repeated course, unless otherwise approved by APPC and the course is completed prior to the start of the next term if the student is currently on Probation II, unle ss otherwise approved by APPC and the course is completed prior to the start of the next term . It is the responsibility of the student to complete and submit the remaining work before the assigned deadline. Upon submission of the completed work, the facul ty member submits a grade change to the Registrar's Offic e, converting the Incomplete to a letter grade. If the student does not meet the deadline, the Incomplete will automatically be converted to a final grade of Fail or Unsatisfactory. Students on docum ented medical leave or military leave may carry the Incomplete for four acade mic quarters. If the student on medical or military leave does not return to courses within four quarters, the Incomplete will change to Withdrawal. Grade Reports Grade reports ar e available within two weeks of the end of the quarter for the prescribed program of study . Grades are considered a part of the student's educational record and will not be released to anyone other than the studen t or posted in any personally identifiable form. Grade reports are available upon request through the Registrar's Office and online through MySCNM. Grade Appeal Procedures Grade appeals must be initiated no later than two (2) business days from when grades are posted . Students are responsible for c hecking final grades on the Wednesday following the close of the quarter. Final grades are posted to the Student Services, Academic Records section in MySCNM. Students should consider the following evidence when initiating a grade appeal: Final grade inclu ded a miscalculation of the overall course grades or final exam Final grade deviated from the assignment / calculation of course grades as outlined in the course syllabus First Appeal The student must submit an appeal in writing to the course faculty withi n two (2) business days of the posted grade. The first stage of a grade appeal process will be a meeting between the student and the course faculty. At that time, the student will have an opportunity to voice concern(s) about the grade received. The course faculty may elect to obtain additional information to further evaluate the student's concern(s) and will decide whether to maintain the original grade or submit a grade change form to the Registrar 's Office . A written notification of the decision will be provided to the student from the faculty within two (2) business days. Note, if the faculty is unavailable for the first ap peal, the process will proceed to the next step. Final Appeal If the grade appeal is denied by the course faculty, the student may appeal in writing to the appropriate Department Chair , Division Director or Vice President of Academic Affairs (DC, DD, VPAA ) within two (2) business days of notification of denial from course faculty. Should the course faculty also be the DC, the student may make the second appeal to the DD. The DC, DD, or VPAA may make a decision regarding the grade appeal with or without meeting the studen t directly. If a meeting is granted, the DC, DD, or VPAA may also request the course faculty be present for this meeting. The student will again have an opportunity to voice concern(s) a bout the grade received. The DC, DD, or VPAA will have the chance to review the criteria by which the final grade is determined. The DC, DD, or VPAA may elect to obtain additional information to further evaluate the student's concern(s ) and will decide whether to maintain the original grade or submit a grade change form to the Registrar 's Office . A written notification of the decision will be provided to the student within two (2) business days. Academic Probation First Academic Probation A student is subject to the first level academic pro bation (Probation I) if any of the f ollowing occur: The student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their prescribed program of study .

Students are encouraged to meet with the Dean of Students to obtain additional academic assistance. Institutional Policies Page 26 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog A student whos e cumulative GPA (CGPA) projections shows an inability to recover from a low CPGA in subsequent terms may be subject to dismissal after being placed on the first level of probaton. Second Academic Probation Students are placed on a second and final level of academic probation (Probation II) if any of the following occur: The student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their prescribed program of study . (See Cumulative GPA Requirement for prescribed program of study .) The student does not meet the minimum academic requirements (See Minimum Academic Requirements for prescribed program of study .) The student fails a course after being placed on the first level of academic probation Students placed on academic probation for the second time will receive notification from the Registrar's Offic e, along with a notation on their transcript, and will be requ ired to meet with the student advisor and the Dean of Studen ts to discuss an academic agreement intended to impr ove performance. The student advisor will report recommendations to the APPC to review and make additional recommendations as deemed necessary. A student whose cumulative GPA (CGPA) projections shows an inability to recover from a low CPGA in subsequent te rms may be subject to dismissal after being placed on the second level of academic probaton. Students on the first or second levels of academic probation who plan to continue the program at SCNM will be requ ired to complete an Academic Agreement during the ir meeting with the student advisor. If the student is unable t o continue in their prescribed program of study, the student may be placed on an Administrative Leave of Absence (ALOA) and may not be eligible for financial aid. The student ma y be eligible to reenter their prescribed program of study as determined by the APPC and SCNM's ALOA policy. (See Administrative Leave of Absence policy.) The Academic Probation notation remains on the student's transcript indefinitely. Students return to good standing when their cumulative GPA returns to 3.0 or higher and/or they pass previously failed course(s). Academic Suspension A student may be subject to suspension due to the sa me reasons as academic dismissal (see Academic Dismissal policy). The APPC makes the deci sion for suspension or permanent academic dismissal. Except where prior approval has been granted by the Dean of Students, a suspended or dismissed student will not participate in any SCNM - sponsored activities and will be barred from the College 's property during the suspension period and/or after dismissal. Academic Dismissal Students demonstrating unsatisfactory academic progress will be considered for dismissal. After being placed on academic probation for the second time, a student will be considered fo r dismissal if any of the following occur: The student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their prescribed program of study . (See Cumulative GPA Requirement for prescribed program of study .) The student does not meet the minimum academic requirements (See Minimum Academic Requirements for prescribed program of study.) The student fails a course after being placed on the second level of academic probation The student fails the same course for the second time during any portion of their enrollment at SCNM (a course includes any didactic or clinical course in the prescribed program of study) At any time in the program, SCNM reserves the right to dismiss a student when his/her academic record is deemed unsatisfactory. Likewise, a student whose total record shows considerable ability and marked improvement may be given special consideration. Students may be subject to disciplinary actions, including suspension and dismissal, for failure to follow the Code of Student Prof essional Conduct and Academic Honor policies as outlined in the Student Handbook (see Student Handbook). Students subject to dismissal will receive a letter from the Registrar's Office. A copy of this letter will be for warded to the Dean of Students, Acade mic Policy and Progress Committee, and the Vice President of Academic Affairs . Dismissal Appeal Process The student will be informed that they have five (5) business days in which to request an appeal to the APPC regarding dismissal.

Students who have been dismissed will not be readmitted to the college under any circumstances. Academic Honor List A full -time student who is enrolled in at least 12 didactic credits for the ND program or 4 didactic credits for the MS programs and earns a quarter GPA of 4.0 shall be placed on the honor list for that quarter and will receive a letter from the Dean of the program . Students are not eligible for the honor list in any quarter in which they receive an \"I\" incomplete or an \"F\"/\"U\" grade. When an \"I\" is resolved , however, students who are otherwise eligible shall be added retroactively to the academic honor list for that quarter. Student Course Evaluations The purpose of course evaluatio ns is to provide opportunities for the improvement of instructional methodology and the enhancement of the learning environment. Students are encouraged to complete evaluations near the end of each quarter. The Academic Affairs Department tabulates the inf ormation from these evaluations and provides the aggregated results to SCNM faculty , administration , and students . Transcripts A transcript is a student's official academic record of courses taken and grades earned. An official transcript will bear the sig nature of the Registrar as well as the official SCNM seal and will be mailed directly to the address provided by the student. An unofficial transcript issued by SCNM is marked \"unofficial.\" The degree earned by the student at SCNM is recorded on the transc ript after conferral of the degree and completion of all graduation requirements for the prescribed program of study . Students are considered to be in good academic standing unless noted. The academic status of a student (such as suspended, academic dismis sal, etc ), will be noted on the transcript. Students may obtain unofficial transcripts via MySCNM. To request official transcripts to be sent to other institutions, students must complete and sign the appropriate form available on MySCNM or in the Registrar's Office. Requests by mail must include the following information: name, identification number, date of birth, first and last dates of attendance, current return address, daytime phone number, signature, and specific mailing address for each transcript ordered . Transcripts are issued within one week from the date the request is received. The Registrar's Office may not release transcripts or any certifications for non -enrolled students or graduates who have a financial encumbrance. Only SCNM transc ripts may be released. Transcripts and documents from other institutions are the property of SCNM and, as such, are under the control of the Registrar's Office . Under Federal policy, a student has the right to view the docu ments in his or her file; the College is not required to provide ( or allow the making of) copies of these documents . Transcripts submitted for admission or credit transfer become the property of SCNM and cannot be copied by or returned to the student or forwarded to other institutions. Institutional Graduation Requirements Candidates for all program s must fulfill the following institutional graduation requirements: Satisfactory completion of all courses in the prescribed curriculum Satisfactory discharge of all academic and/or disciplin ary sanctions Fulfillment of all financial obligations to SCNM Recommendation from the Faculty Senate See ND Graduation Requirements for additional program requirements .

ND Program Informa tion Page 37 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Doctor of Naturopathic (ND) Program Philosophy Naturopathic medicine concentrates on whole -person wellness; the medicine is tailored to the patient an d emphasizes prevention and self -care. Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. Naturopathic doctors cooperate with all other branches of medical science, ref erring patients to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are primary care physician s clinically trained in natural therapeutics with a philosophy derived in part from a Hippocratic teaching more than 2, 000 years old: vis medicatrix naturae \u2014nature is the healer of all diseases. Their practice is based on the same basic bio - medical science foundation as that of allopathic pra ctice. However, their philosophies and approaches differ considerably from their c onventional counterparts. Naturopathic doctors diagnose disease and treat pati ents by using natural modalities such as physical manipulation, clinical nutrition, herbal medicine, homeopathy, counseling, acupuncture, and hydrotherapy, among others. They cho ose treatments based on the individual patient, not based on the generality of symptoms. This approach has proven successful in treating both chronic and acute conditions. The precepts that guide the practice of naturopathic medicine include the Seven Prin ciples of Naturopathic Medicine, The Therapeutic Order, and The Components o f Patient Centered Care. Naturopathic Principles These seven principles guide the therapeutic methods and modalities of naturopathic medicine. First Do No Harm - primum non nocere Naturopathic medicine uses therapies that are safe a nd effective. The Healing Power of Nature - vis medicatrix naturae The human body possesses the inherent ability to restore health. The physician's role is to facilitate this process wi th the aid of natural, nontoxic therapies. Discover and Treat the Cause, Not Just the Effect - tolle causam Physicians seek and treat the underlying cause of a disease. Symptoms are viewed as expressions of the body's natural attempt to heal. The origin o f disease is removed or treated so the patient can recover. Treat the Whole Person - tolle totum The multiple factors in health and disease are considered while treating the whole person. Physicians provide f lexible treatment programs to meet individual he alth care needs. The Physician Is a Teacher - docere The physician's major role is to educate, empower, and motivate patients to take responsibility for their o wn health. Creating a healthy, cooperative relationship with th e patient has a strong therapeutic value. Prevention Is the Best \"Cure\" -praevenire Naturopathic physicians are preventive medicine specialists. Physicians assess patient risk factors and heredity susceptibility and intervene appropriately to reduce risk and prevent illness. Pre vention of disease is best accomplished through education and a lifestyle that supports health. Wellness - Salus Establish or re -establish health and well -being. Therapeutic Order Re-establish the basis for health Remove obstacles to cure by establishing a healthy regimen Stimulate the healing pow er of nature Use various systems of health such as botanicals, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, nutrition, and mind -body medicine Tonify weakened systems Use modalities to strengthen the immune sy stem, decrease toxicity, normalize inflammatory function, optimize metabolic function, balance regulatory systems, enhan ce regeneration, and harmonize life force Correct structural integrity Use therapeutic exercise, spinal manipulation, and massage, crani al-sacral to return to optimal structural condition Prescribe specific natural substances for pathology Use vitamins, minerals, and herbs to return to and p romote health Prescribe pharmacotherapy for pathology Use pharmaceutical dr ugs to return to and promote healthND Program Informa tion Page 38 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Prescribe surgery, pharmacotherapy Use aggressive therapies to attempt to maintain heal th Taken from \"A Hierarchy of Healing: The Therapeutic Order\" Pamela and Stephen Myers, ND, BMed, PhD. Components of Patient - Centered Care Exploring the disease and the patient's illness experience Understanding the whole person Finding common ground with the patient regarding management/treatment options Incorporating prevention and health promotion Enhancing the doctor -patient relationship Being realistic Adapted from: Huang, WY. Fam Med 2002;34 (9):644 -5 Licensure At the time of this printing, 22 states, the District of Columbia, the U .S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U .S. Virgin Islands, and five Canadian provinces have lice nsing laws for naturopathic physicians. In these states naturopathic physicians are required to graduate from an approved four -year naturopathic medical school an d pass extensive postdoctoral board examinations in order to receive a license. The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) administers and provides the Naturopathic Physician Licensing Examination (NPLEX) which is comprised of biomedical sc ience and clinical science examinations that are used in North America to license graduates of approved naturopathic medical schools. Once licensed, naturopathic physicians must practice within a specific scope of practice defined by their state's law and fulfill state -mandated continuing medical education requirements annually. It is the responsibility of the student/graduate to determine the licensure laws or scope of practice in the state in which he/she intends to practice. Naturopathic physicians pract icing in the state of Arizona enjoy one of the broadest scopes of practice within the United States. The state of Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board (NPMB) regulates the practice of naturopathic medicine in the state of Arizona. This includes applications and fees for students planning to enter clinical training and new graduates applying for licensure.

The SCNM Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine offer opportunities for students to work with a diverse group of medical practitioners including naturopathic physicians , Theraputic Life Cahnges Vis Medicatrix Naturae Naturopathic ND Program Informa tion Page 39 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog medical doctor s, an Oriental medical doctor, acupuncturists, neurofee dback / biofeedback specialists, and cranial sacral therapists . SCNM is committed to providing students diverse clinical settings to deliver patient care. In addition to clinical clerkships at the SCNM Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine , SCNM physicians and students provide care to underserved patient populations a t a variety of community clinics. These clinics are staffed by faculty members who oversee both the students' education and the patients' care. The community clinics p rovide students access to a broad range of patient populations an d disease conditions not regularly seen at the SCNM medical facilites . (For a list of these clinics, see Extended Sites Community Clinics .) The legal aspects of practicing naturopathic medic ine vary by state in the U nited States and by province in Canada. In those states and provinces in which naturopathic physician s are licensed, NDs may see patients for general healthcare and for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions. Their scope of practice may include nutritional science; botanical medicine; naturopathic manipulative therapies and other physical medicine; medicine; homeopathy; mind -body medicine; natural childbirth; minor surgery; prescriptive authority, including immunizations; an d all methods of laboratory, x -ray, and clinical diagnoses. The state of Arizona offers one of the widest scopes of prac tice for naturopathic physicians in the United States. Practicing Without a License In Arizona, practicing naturopathic medicine without a license involves the diagnosis or treatment of any patient by an unsupervised naturopathic medical student or any other unlicensed person where money may or may not be exchanged. Arizona Revised Statutes (ARS Title 32) defines practicing without a license as any conduct involving the unauthorized, intended, or perceived practice of any of the healing arts, including b ut not limited to the unauthorized practice of naturopathic medicine or other healing arts, regardless of whether the violation ultimately results in conviction or prosecution under relevant laws, and regardless of whether the violation results in any sanc tion or other formal or informal action by any administrative or regul atory body outside the College.

Selectives may only be added up through week one of a quarter and in week two with the permission of the instructor (some exceptions may apply). Clinical Clerkships Clinical clerkships do not follow the same add/drop policy as didactic courses noted above, clinical students must refer to the Clinical Ha ndbook regarding policy for adding and dropping clerkships. (See Add/Drop Refund Policy.) An add/drop fee will be charged for any clerkship ch anges after the clinic add/drop period has ended (see Tuition and Fees). Students are not able to drop clerkships after the clinical add/drop period without approval from the APPC. Students awaiting decisions are required to attend assigned clerkships and meet current clinic policies until otherwise notified in writing. NPLEX Board Examinations The licensing of naturo pathic physicians to practice medicine is a function of an individual state or pro vince. The states and provinces that license naturopathic physicians recognize the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE), which certifies candidates as eligi ble to register for the licensing exam that is administered as the Naturopathic Physicians Licensure Examination (NPLEX) . It is the student's responsibility to be familiar with NABNE and NPLEX policies and procedures. SCNM considers the NPLEX Parts I and I I to be significant measures of professional achievement toward becoming a naturopathic physician. Student performance on the NPLEX provides the faculty and administration an external measure of the level of understanding students have in a broad number of subject areas. This performance offers SCNM important information on curricular content and teaching methodology. Student scores also provide SCNM and the patients they see with a level of assurance that they can perform with basic competency as student p hysicians. To qualify for the NPLEX Part I, students must have satisfactorily completed all basic science coursework, including GNMD 6044, be currently enrolled or on an approved leave of absence, and be certified by the Registrar's Office as eligible to sit for the exam. NPLEX Part I Students are required to take NPLEX Part I to be eligible to participate in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine clinical training program. Students must take the NPLEX Part I at the first offering of the exam immediately follo wing their 8th quarter in the 4 -year POS and 12th quarter in the 5 -year POS or completion of the basic science courses, including GNMD 6044, whichever comes first. Students who do not pass NPLEX Part I must take it again at the next offering . Students who do not take NPLEX I at the next offering will be dropped from the following quarter's clinical clerkships and may no t be allowed to continue in clinical clerkships until they have taken NPLEX I. In order to register for future clinical clerkships, all stud ents must submit the original examination results from NABNE to the Registrar's Office each time it is taken. Appeals to any part of this process follow the norma l SCNM grievance procedures. This policy applies to all students, including professional trans fer students. NPLEX Part II Passing NPLEX Part II examination is not a graduation requirement of SCNM, but it is required to become licensed. Students should be aware that NABNE may modify its policies and procedures at any time. It is the student's respon sibility to be aware of NABNE/NPLEX policies and procedures. Satisfactory Academic Progress - Completion The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) program is designed to be completed in four calendar years or 15 academic quarters (five calendar years or 19 academic quarters for the 5 -year track).

ND Academic Coursework Page 52 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog ND Academic Coursework The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program at SCNM is a cohort -based program that follows a prescribed track. All academic credit is computed in quarter hours (see Credit Equivalence ). All students are guided by the curriculum as outlined in their prescribed program of study. Students are pre-registered for core courses, including labs and clinical clerkships. Students may not deviate from their prescribed program of study. SCNM reserves the right to make curriculum changes that are applicable to all students, if necessary. Students are admitted to either a 4 -year or 5 -year track program. The 4 -year trac k offers students a traditional path to graduation. The 5 -year track offers support for students who may want more time to complete the basic and pre - clinical sciences. The 5 -year track distributes the first year of basic sciences and pre -clinical medicine courses across two years. The remaining 3 years of both the 4 -year and 5 -year tracks of the ND curriculum are the same. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress on the 4 -year track may be transitioned into the 5 -year track. Students cann ot move to the 5 -year track after completion of year 1 of the 4 -year track. In addition , students cannot move back to the 4 -year track after starting the 5 -year track without approval from the APPC . If a student stays on track with the program, taking all courses as they are offered in sequence, students can expect to graduate within 15 consecutive quarters, or four calendar years, if on the 4 -year track (or 19 consecutive quarters or five calendar years, if on the 5 -year track). After matriculation, approv al by APPC is required for track changes. First Calendar Year (First Two Calendar Years in the Five- Year Track) The first calendar year begins with the basic medical science curriculum in the study of biochemistry and normal structures and functions of the body, including anatomy and physiology. This material is organized by systems. Courses in research and the natu ropathic modalities, history, and philosophy are introduced; and early clinical experiences begin with an introduction to clinical practice. These experiences include opportunities to work with standardized patients in clinical settings and shadow physicia ns in private practice during field observation. (See Five -Year Track Program of Study for outline of courses). Second Calendar Year (Third Calendar Year in the Five- Year Track) The second calendar year continues the basic medical science curriculum and f ocuses on the body's pathological transitions through disease, along with clinical recognitio n of these processes using physical, clinical, and lab dia gnosis. Courses in the naturopathic modalities such as nutri tion, mind -body medicine, homeopathy, and Ori ental medicine are explored during the second year. Third and Fourth Calendar Years (Fourth and Fifth Calendar Years in the Five- Year Track) In the final two calendar years, clinical methods of naturopathic medicine are presented and expanded in both the c lassroom and the clinical setting. Students have the opportunity to work with various patient populations at the SCNM Medical Center, Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine , and SCNM affiliated sites . In the final academic year of the program, stude nts concentrate on clinical training and take fewer didactic credits. For a detailed list of required courses, see the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program of Study Selectives SCNM offers selectives, or required electives, in the naturopathic medical d egree program as part of the core curriculum. Selectives are advertised prior to registration, and an enrollment of 10 students is required before most selective s will be offered (see Adding and Dropping Courses for prescribed program of study). Students w ill register for selectives online during the published registration timeframe. (For a list of potential selectives, please see ND Selective Course Descriptions.)

MSCN Program Information Page 95 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Nutrition Program The M aster of Science in Clinical Nutrition (MSCN ) program transforms students who are passionate about nutrition into leaders and healers in the field of clinical nutrition . Students gain the professional knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to dev elop and implement effective and evidence - based nutrition -related services to support individual and public health. The innovative and 100% online curriculum has been developed with input from experts and thought leaders in the field of nutrition. The MSCN trains students in nutritional sciences, self -care, whole food nutrition, and the responsible use of dietary supplements while also coverin g emerging topics such as nutrigenomics and microbiomics. Additionally, the program includes a novel Virtual He alth Center Experience where students practice applying n ew skills and knowledge safely in a virtual training environme nt. Graduates will be prepared for success in private cl inical practice or to be employed in integrative practices, community health, or corpo rate settings. The program also introduces students to innovative ways to leverage their training from developing a telemedicine practice to becoming an entrepreneur in the multi -billion -dollar natural foods and dietary supplement industry. In addition to their MSCN degree, opportunities to earn industry specific certifications are embedded within the curriculum to help students increase their competence and further distinguish themselves in their field. Program Mission To educate and inspire the next gener ation of leaders and practitioners in the field of clinical nutrition to use evidence - based practices to safely, ethically, and effectively enhance the health and well -being of the people and communities they serve. Scope of Practice Requirements for the p ractice of nutrition vary from state to state (and country to country), with a wide range of certification types available. Currently, the state of Arizona has no regulation for Dietetics and Nutrition practice. There is currently no licensure law in this state outlining restrictions and/or regulations for the field of nutrition. The MSCN program supplements students' existing clinical training/credentials with expertise and an advanced degree in nutrition. Graduates may wish to work as consultants, write rs, educators, or business leaders rather than clinicians; still others may opt to go on to earn a PhD or a clinica l doctoral degree. This degree program does not lead to additional licensure for practice in the field of nutrition As of June 2019 , fifteen states require a Registered Dietitian (RD) credential to practice and be licensed / registered to practice nutrition and do not offer a pathway to licensure for non-dietitian nutritionists. Thirteen states (including Arizona) do not regulate dietet ics and nutrition practice/licensure, and another seventeen states do not regulate dietetics and nutrition practice/licensure but require a physician referral or RD credential to be eligible for insurance reimbursem ent. Five states require the RD credentia l to be licensed but offer a pathway to licensure for Certified Nutrition Specialists (CNS). For current updates on state laws , we recommend visiting the Center for Nutrition Advocacy's website at http://nutritionadvocacy.org/laws -state . SCNM's MS CN progra m has been developed to meet the eligibility requirement of several national board certifications, most notably the Certified Nutrition Speciali st (CNS). SCNM's MSCN program fulfills the didactic requirements to sit for the CNS certification exam offered through the Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists (BCNS). Before qualifying to sit for the CNS certification exam, applicants must complete 1,000 hours of supervised practice experience. SCNM does not offer this post -graduate experience. The CNS credential is the most frequent, non -RD credential recognized in state nutrition regulations. The CNS is The only non -dietetics credential and examination widely named in state nutrition licensure laws Listed by the U .S. Government's Department of Labor as an advanced nutrition credential in the definition of the \"Dietetics and Nutritionists\" profession in its Occupational Outlook Handbook Listed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid as among those potentially eligible to order therapeutic diets in hosp itals Fully accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) MSCN Program Information Page 96 | 201 9-2020 Course Catalog Private professional associations awarding nutrition credentials currently recognized by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies include: Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists (BCNS) American Clinical Board of Nutrition (ACBN) Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) Both BCNS and CDR are recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in its Occupational Handbook definition of Dietitians and Nutritionists . Since certifying organizations may change eligibility requirements, students are advised to contact the appropriate board with any questions and to verify eligibility. Students are advised to also review licensing requirements by state for the most up-to-date information. Program Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of th e MSCN program, graduates will be able to: 1. Utilize knowledge of nutritional sciences to describ e the relationship between nutrients and human health and disease 2.
