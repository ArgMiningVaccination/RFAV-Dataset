A Rose Healing Ceremony is a powerful healing tool. Roses carry one of the purest and highest vibrations (320 MHZ); the human body vibrates around 62-78 MHz. We will tap into those vibrations and invoke their energies, connect to their power, and allow their healing to move through your body. You will learn about Rose healing, have space for gentle mindful movement, and relax in guided meditation. During meditation, the roses are placed on your body in an intuitive way. As you rest, you will be guided into a state of deep relaxation and Reiki healing energy will be sent to help nurture and support you.
