(Superville, 10/24) [ Scientists Find Genetic Links To Dyslexia ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/scientists-find-genetic-links-to-dyslexia/) Media outlets cover what's said to be the largest genetic study of dyslexia ever made, which has uncovered 42 genetic variants linked to dyslexia and established a link between it and ambidexterity. Other research news includes positive impacts from video gaming on kids' brains. [ Fox News: New Study Finds Dyslexia Is Linked To 42 Genetic Variants ](https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-study-finds-dyslexia-linked-genetic-variants) Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Australia, the U.S. company 23andMe Inc, and the University of Edinburgh conducted what is considered the largest genetic study of dyslexia to date and published their findings recently in the journal Nature Genetics.

Video games might not be responsible for those differences \u2014 the study can't say what the causes are \u2014 but the findings add to a bigger body of work showing gamers have better performance on some tests of brain function. That lends support to efforts to develop games that can treat cognitive problems.

Past mind-reading techniques relied on implanting electrodes deep in peoples' brains. The new method, described in a report posted Sept. 29 to the preprint database bioRxiv, instead relies on a noninvasive brain scanning technique(opens in new tab) called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Essentially, PTSD is a mental health condition that impacts your ability to regulate your fear response. While not every traumatic event will result in PTSD, it impacts around 12 million people yearly, with women being more likely to have PTSD symptoms. On the surface, PTSD can seem like an emotional response to stimuli. But that's not the full picture. Trauma changes how your body and brain work. PTSD is as much a physiological injury as a psychological one. That's a big claim, but let's dig into how PTSD is associated with changes in your brain and physical health.

Deferring contact football shortens the time that children are taking hits to the head and lessens their lifetime risk of CTE. (Leana S.

I had just turned 30, was in perfect health and living \"my best life.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told me it would take two weeks to bounce back. But it's been 2\u00bd years, and I've spent my entire 30s disabled by a post-infection illness \u2014 housebound and barely holding onto what little I can of my former life.

We saw this in a recent New York Times essay that claimed the change in Covid-19 death rates is a laudable example of the U.S. overcoming racial injustice. (Marina Del Rios, Nathan T.
