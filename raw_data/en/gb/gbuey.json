As our lives get more hectic, we're all waking up to the importance of starting our day with the right frame of mind. Whether its light stretches coupled with meditation, eating a healthy breakfast, or just taking a few deep breaths, it's important to try different routines to start our day in the best way possible. Apart from getting our zen on, we can start our day right by incorporating various rituals into our [morning routine](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/healthy-morning-routines). Morning rituals can consist of a lot of practices, and we can choose the ones that work best for us and our schedule, while being as elaborate or as basic as we want them to be. Including crystals in our morning ritual practices can amplify their effects and allow us to carry their beautiful energy throughout the day. Following are some of the easiest morning ritual ideas to get your spiritual groove on! The Sun, the Outdoors, and the Morning Air Coffee is a great way to wake up and get ourselves ready to go, but stepping outside and soaking in the morning sun can give us this much needed boost as well. The morning sun is easy on the eyes, while giving us a dose of Vitamin D, which is integral to maintaining good mental and physical health. On the mystical side, the sun can infuse us with the universal life energy, setting us off to a great start for the day ahead. If that wasn't enough, the clear morning air is sure to pump us up and get us excited for the day ahead, making it an excellent practice to include in our morning rituals.
