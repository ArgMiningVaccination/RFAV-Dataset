Huge progress has been made through international collaboration with 200 vaccines in development and a number in trials that look promising. However the report, [SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development & implementation; scenarios, options, key decisions](https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/10/01/covid19-vaccination-report.html) highlights the challenges involved, including that the initial vaccines might be only partially effective, might not be effective for some groups, might provide only short lived immunity, and have many problems to be solved around rapid scale-up in manufacture, distribution and acceptability. Dr Fiona Culley of the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London and one of the lead authors of the report said: \"Vaccines are held up as our best chance of getting our lives back to some sense of normality, but we have to be realistic. The path to successful vaccines is filled with potential problems in finding vaccines that will work effectively in the ways we need and in being able to roll them out. Planning now for the different scenarios that might play out will give us the best chance of taking rapid advantage of any vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective.\" Key issues identified in the report include: The report outlines different ways in which vaccines might be used to fight the pandemic. [The report concludes](https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/10/01/covid19-vaccination-report.html) that, should effective and safe vaccines be developed; global coordination of vaccine purchase, production and distribution is needed; availability, uptake, effectiveness and long term safety must be closely monitored; financial support must be maintained for the development of a second generation of vaccines; the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be closely monitored for vaccine-escape mutations; and that global collaboration to invest in research training and the infrastructure to deliver vaccine programmes is maintained to ensure preparedness for future pandemics.
