Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants for their therapeutic properties. The oils are used for treating medical and non-medical conditions. Although it may appear to be a relatively new therapy, plant oils have been used for their health benefits for centuries. Aromatherapy is the systematic use of essential oils in holistic tr eatments to impr ove physical and emotional well - being. Essential oils, extracted from plants, possess distinctive therapeutic properties which can be used to improve health and prevent disease. Both their physiological and psychological effects combine we ll to promote positive health. These natural plant oils are applied in a variety of ways including massage, baths and inhalations. They are readily absorbed into the skin and have gentle physiological effects. Aromatherapy is an especially effective treatm ent for stress - related problems and a variety of chronic conditions. The name dates from the 1920s but different cultures and civilisations, such as the Ancient Egyptians and the Roman Empire, have used plants and herbs for religious, medical and cosmetic purposes, as well as in rituals, embalming and preserving, for centuries. L.1 OBJECTIVES Describe the history, philosophy and role of massage therapy and its relationships to other massage traditions. Describe the objectives and possible benefits of body mass age treatment. OBJECTIVES OF THIS LESSON Describe the history and origins of aromatherapy. Describe the objectives and possible benefits of aromatherapy. Page 8 The Cradle of Medicine' The Egyptians are known to have used plant resins and essences in preserving the dead. Cedar and myrrh were used in embalming and jars of frankincense and s tyrax have been found by archaeologists in tombs dating from 3000BC. The antiseptic and antibacterial qualities of the oils and essences helped to prevent dead bodies from rotting so that, when mummies were discovered thousands of years later, they were pe rfectly pre served. In a hot country with little sanitation, plant extracts and oils made life more pleasant! Some of the prescriptions and formulae were inscribed onto stone tablets which is one of the reasons we know so much about them today. The Greeks The Nile Val ley in Egypt was known as the 'Cradle of Medicine' and other cultures, especially the ancient Greeks gained much of their knowledge from travelling to this area and taking the information home. Hippocrates (born around 460BC) was a Greek and he was an impo rtant person in the development of the use of plants in medicine. He also wrote on the subject, thus helping others to understand the useful properties of plants and herbs. The Arab influence Any history of aromatherapy should mention a Persia n called Ab d Allah ibn Sina (980 - 1037), usually referred to as Avicenna, who contributed a great deal to medicine both past and present . Firstly, he described accurately about eight hundred plants and their uses. Secondly, he devised very detailed instruc tions on ma ssage and thirdly, he is credited with discovering the process of distillation by which most of our essential oils are obtained. The first scented baths? The Romans had a huge Empire, which existed for over 500 years (from 27BC until around the fifth century AD). They had conquered many other countries and had access to all the plants and oils of those countries. Oils and essences were an important part of Roman culture. For example, they were used at the public baths, in the water and in massag e. This might not seem very significant to us, but baths were a central part of a Roman's daily life. They were like present -day caf\u00e9s and pubs: this was where you we nt not only to get a wash and massage but also to chat to friends, family and business ass ociates. Page 9 Four millennia of experience China and India both have a long history of using plants and herbs and their extracts for medical purposes. In India medicine is aimed at healing the whole body i.e. treating physical, spiritual and psychological pro blems all at the same time. Traditional Indian herbal medicine known as Ayurvedic medicine, dates from thousands of years ago as does Chinese medicine. Now, in 2020AD , 4000 years later, the use of Chinese medical treatments such as acupuncture, shiatsu or herbal remedies is becoming widespread. From the Crusades to the Great Plague: Europe's role Europe learnt about the health benefits of plants and herbs through the t ravels of knights and soldiers who brought back news of their use, especially after the Cr usades (from the eleventh to the thirteenth century). Gradually, Europeans began to experiment with herbal remedies made from plants and herbs that grew in their own countries, like sage, lavender and rosemary. In the Middle Ages people protected themselve s against infection by carrying plants, wearing herbal bouquets and throwing both over the floor. Through the ages, all classes of society used herbal medicines. A great advocate was Henry VIII, who in 1543 established a charter protecting the rights of herbalists to practice. By the 17th century the knowledge of herbal medicine was becoming widespread with publications such as The English Physician' by Nicholas Culpe per and The Great Herbal' by John Gerard documenting plants and their uses. During the Gre at Plague perfumers and apothecaries were thought to be immune from the disease. Using flowers and plants against germs might sound superstitious but think of how man y lavender, pine and sandalwood disinfectants and cleaning products we now have in our liv es! Other natural healing systems were developed during the 18th and early 19th centuries from traditional backgrounds such as the water or nature cure. Naturopathy, a therapy based upon the use of diet, exercise, herbalism and hydrotherapy to prevent ill health was one such therapy which is still practised today. The role of science The development of chemistry and printing in the nineteenth century helped herbal a nd plant medicine in two ways. New chemical processes made it easier to extract oils and the invention of printing meant that lots of books on the subject, called herbals, were published. However, science helped both to develop the use of plants and herb s in medicine and to destroy it. It became easier and cheaper to discover some of the elem ents of plant oils, and their qualities, and attempt to produce synthetic versions of them. So commercial, mass -produced products and remedies using artificial ingred ients replaced the natural formulas created for the Page 10 individual person and problem. Allopat hy was a term coined by homeopath Samuel Hahnnemann, to describe the new way of treating disease with medicines that produced effects different to those caused by the disease itself. Allopathic or conventional medicine gained popularity, with the new manuf actured drugs seen as more effective than old remedies; conventional, scientific based medicine became the norm. Herbal medicine, using ancient and tested traditions was no longer taken seriously and was even considered 'quackery' compared to 'real' scient ific medicine. The invention' of aromatherapy The term aromatherapy was coined by a French chemist called Ren\u00e9 Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9 in the 1920s. He was a chemist and perfumier who worked in his family perfumery business. One day he burnt his hand and plu nged it into a vat of lavender oil to cool it down. He discovered that the lavender oil helped his burns to heal and prevented scarring. During the First World War (1 914-1918) he used oils on soldiers' wounds and discovered that they helped heal wounds muc h faster. He went on to research the therapeutic properties of essential oils and first used the phrase aromath\u00e9rapie in a scientific research paper he delivered in 1 928. Several other French scientists, including Dr Jean Valnet, continued the research int o the effect of essential oils on physical burns and wounds as well as psychological disorders. Valnet also used oils on soldiers' wounds, through his work as an army doctor during the war in Indo - China (1948 -59), using their antiseptic qualities and abili ties to combat disease to great effect. Valnet also advocated taking essential oils internally and the management of health through a natural diet. Aromatherapy reach es Britain Marguerite Maury, an Austrian biochemist and follower of the work of Valnet, is the person responsible for bringing aromatherapy to Britain. She had discovered that when she used essential oils in massage the skin absorbed the oils very well. In the 1940s she brought her ideas for massage treatments using essential oils to this count ry and, with the help of several people (including Micheline Arcier, Dr W. E. Arnould -Taylor, Eve Taylor and Dr Jean Valnet) she set up aromatherapy practices. Her s tudents then set up their own practices and the interest in this method of treatment has b een growing ever since. Furthermore, although first established as a beauty therapy treatment, aromatherapy was developed as a clinical (i.e. medical) therapy by Robe rt Tisserand who published \"The Art of Aromatherapy' in 1977. Full circle Thanks to Gatte foss\u00e9 and his followers, aromatherapy began to be taken seriously again. The reputation of complementary therapies is now coming full circle. A move away from orthodo x medicine and commercial drugs has coincided with, or perhaps Page 11 caused a surge of interest in the use of natural complementary therapies. Traditional medicine is now beginning to recognise the value of complementary therapies. Aromatherapy is now offered al ongside orthodox practices in many healthcare settings worldwide. The establishment of vol untary regulatory bodies and formal training programmes have raised the standards within the industry and increased public and professional awareness of the therapy. A healthy lifestyle is now recognised to prevent ill health and is actively encouraged. Ar omatherapy continues to play an important part in the holistic management of health and wellbeing. Research As aromatherapy becomes increasingly popular, the demands to prove the claims for its efficacy become more pressing. Scientific research is seen a s validation of a therapy, meeting and protecting the needs of interested parties. However, there are many difficulties encountered when undertaking clinical re search procedures to test complementary therapy and its applications. The human factor, placebo effect and natural variations in the quality of oils may all affect aromatherapy test results. Aroma therapists need to be aware of developments and analysis wi thin their field and the results, both positive and negative. Ongoing research is essential and has important implications for the legislation and regulation of the industry. Page 12 Objectives and effects of aromatherapy In order to understand how essential oils work on the body, it is helpful to remember that we are complex chemical beings full of fluids, especially water. It is therefore logical that essential oils, which are also complex chemical fluids, are likely to affect our own body chemistry. What are t he specific effects of aromatherapy? Using essential oils affects the human body - Pharmacologic ally Essential oils are chemical and so are humans. Once essential oils have been absorbed into the body, either through the skin or inhalation, the chemicals in the oils enter the blood and other body fluids and interact with the chemistry of our bodies. For example, h ormones, enzymes and neurotransmitters (which enable the nervous system to work) are all chemicals and the presence of another chemical (the essential oil) can affect the way they work. Physiologically Physiology is the way our body works. Es sential oils c an affect this by changing the chemical messages and impulses sent around the body and thus changing the way the systems of the human body function. For example, if an oil has relaxing and de -stressing properties, it may help to relieve the s ymptoms of str ess displayed by our bodies e.g. slowing heart rate and breathing rate or encouraging tense muscles to relax. Psychologically The way essential oils affect our mind is more difficult to describe, mainly because everyone's mind is different. However, our s ense of smell is closely linked to our memory so that particular smells can cause particular responses: for example, if you dislike the smell of roses, rose oil is unlikely to relax you; if jasmine reminds you of a good holiday then its smell will bring ba ck happy memories and provoke a positive response. What are the general effects of aromatherapy? There are certain general effects from using essential oils which result from most treatments, especially sin ce relaxing an d/or hands -on application methods like massage and baths are very common in aromatherapy. General effects include: Reduction in stress and tension Feeling of well -being, balance and calm Antibacterial effects of oil help the body heal and sup port the immun "}
