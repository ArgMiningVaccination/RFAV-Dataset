Remedies for hair loss Hair loss, thinning of hair and balding is some of the common hair problems. Many of us suffer from these ailments due to our modern lifestyle and diet. Ayurveda can be very beneficial in treating these conditions as it investigates the root cause of the problem. The causes for these hair conditions are: - Excess of Pitta dosha in the body is the chief cause of hair problems. Pitta is increased by excessive intake of tea, coffee, alcohol, meats and excessive smoking. Pitta is also aggravated by eating too much fried, oily, greasy, spicy, sour, and acidic foods. - Intake of too many chemical medicines, low blood circulation, anemia, and general weakness after disease, stress, anxiety, and mental tension are also prime causes of hair loss. - Chronic diseases like typhoid fever, presence of dandruff or lice and hormonal imbalance also cause hair loss. So watch out carefully for these reasons! You may be overdoing one of them, and thus losing your beautiful hair. Treatment - The first step is to locate the root cause in your diet or lifestyle that may be increasing the Pitta dosha. Once you locate it, try to give up or at least reduce the diet, habit, or activity responsible for increasing Pitta. - Always use a natural shampoo or soap to clean the hair. As most soaps and shampoos have chemicals, they might be the cause of your problem. Usually the chemicals have a heating effect, and increase Pitta locally. Amla (embilica officinalis), Shikakai (Acacia concinna) are very commonly used in India for washing the hair. - Oiling and massaging of scalp is very beneficial for stopping the hair loss. Use Neelibringadi coconut oil or kayyonnyadi oil at least three times in a week. Also medicated oils like 'Mahabhringraj oil ',' Amla oil and 'Arnica oil' are very useful. Put oil on the scalp, and massage gently in the roots of the hair. - The person should maintain a regular bowel movement everyday. In case of constipation, a mild natural laxative can be taken. Triphala, an Ayurvedic herbal powder, is also useful. - The diet should contain more green leafy vegetables, salads, milk, fruits and sprouts. Take more proteins, milk, buttermilk, yeast, wheat germ, soybean and vitamin A. - Regular physical exercise is very beneficial as it helps in balancing the aggravated doshas. - Rub your scalp vigorously after washing the hair. It increases the blood circulation, and activates the sebaceous glands. - Daily application of coconut oil mixed with lime juice on the hair is also beneficial. For Balance, Well Being, Weight Management - Use freshly prepared natural foods, made with wholesome grains, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Make home made vegetable broth and use it in your cooking instead of heavy oils or dairy products. For optimal digestion, reduce or eliminate the use of meats in your diet. - Chewing aniseeds or fennel seeds with coconut powder or cardamom seeds with sugar after a meal encourages the secretion of saliva and aids digestion. The mouth becomes refreshed and one feels joyful. - Include all the six tastes, sweet, salty, sour, bitter, pungent and astringent in all the meals, to create natural and nutritional balance and decrease cravings in between meals. - Certain foods are healthy when consumed alone, but when taken in combination with other foods, generate harmful chemicals in the body. (For example radishes or cucumbers should never be taken with water.) - Eating food at regular time each day is helpful in regulating the chemicals in the body. - Resting after lunch and walking after dinner is helpful. - Regular use of milk, yogurt, cheese or cream is good for one's health.

Ayurveda diet and recipes Introduction Ayurveda has its roots in India, dating back to about five thousand years. Essentially, it is a science that encompasses the health benefits of herbs, meditation, yoga, and massage. Ayurveda is based on the principle that every being on this earth, be it animate or inanimate, is the outcome of five basic elements, or Pancha Mahabhootas - Water, Air, Fire or Energy, Earth, and Sky. Ayurveda embodies the methods that help to achieve a balance between the body, mind and soul, which is absolutely crucial to stay in unison with nature. Ayurvedic Diet and Nutrition According to Ayurveda, 'We are what we eat'! This ancient branch of science believes most of the common ailments are a result of poor nutrition. Ayurvedic nutrition is concerned importantly with the dietary requirements of individuals. Any anomaly in the body is thought to emanate in the digestive system, and therefore it become crucial not to cast aside even minor digestive complaints, as it could be indicative of a disease. Ayurveda does not distinguish between food and medicine, the underlying belief that the absence of nutritive food or diet causes disease in the body. This can only be remedied with appropriate food, which becomes the medicine to heal the body of its ailment. All the same, Ayurveda holds sacrosanct, that each one of us are distinct, and our health is determined by our attitude and response to the conscious and unconscious inputs in life that one is subjected to. Ayurvedic diet is centered on treating life's experiences as 'food' (for the body and the mind), which is assimilated into the body and contributes to its nourishment. This transformation of 'food' into nutrition is termed as 'Agni' or fire, which forms the edifice upon which the Ayurvedic system is built. Spices and herbs form an integral part of Ayurvedic healing, mainly because of its power to be easily absorbed in the body. On the one hand, this enhances the digestive capacity of the body and on the other, cleanses it of its toxins, ensuring the cells in the body are empowered with the nutrition available in the diet. Ayurveda recommends that spices be consumed only after they are cooked. An Ayurvedic diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fibrous food, which contribute to keeping the body energetic, glowing and in good health. An Ayurvedic diet is miserly with salt to prevent potential fluid retention and also discourages the intake of coffee, sodas, and alcohol. Benefits of an Ayurvedic diet - Ayurvedic diet is low in fat and helps to maintain an optimum body weight. - Ayurvedic diet is endowed with minerals that charge the body with energy and radiance. - Ayurvedic diet is rich in vegetable proteins that are quickly digested and assimilated into the body. - Ayurvedic meals are easy to digest due to the inclusion of spices - garlic, ginger, cumin, cayenne, and black pepper. - Fresh organic foods that Ayurveda relies upon, are high on nutrition, and endow the body with strength and vitality.
