Their safety continues to be checked while in use. NHS Scotland will only use a vaccine if it meets the required standards of safety and effectiveness. The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved COVID-19 vaccines for use in the UK and they continue to monitor the safety profile.

The World Health Organization (WHO) have produced a statement for healthcare professionals about [how COVID-19 vaccines are regulated for safety and effectiveness (external website)](https://www.who.int/news/item/11-06-2021-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness). Guidance for getting the vaccine if people have recently had COVID-19 infection Even if someone has already had COVID-19, they could still get it again. The vaccine will reduce the risk of getting COVID-19. If someone does get it again, the vaccine can reduce how serious the symptoms will be. If you're unwell on the day of your vaccination appointment, wait until you've recovered to have your vaccine. You should not attend an appointment if you have a fever or think you might be infectious to others. Reporting side effects The MHRA runs the Yellow Card scheme which collects and monitors information on suspected safety concerns or incidents involving vaccines. The scheme relies on voluntary reporting of suspected safety concerns or incidents by healthcare professionals and members of the public. Suspected side effects of vaccines and medicines can be reported through the Yellow Card scheme by: - using the [Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency website (external website)](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) - downloading the Yellow Card app "}
