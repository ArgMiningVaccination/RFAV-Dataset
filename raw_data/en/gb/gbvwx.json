Yesterday, the CDC provided a risk assessment of a new COVID-19 variant, BA.2.86 (nicknamed \"Pirola\" by some), which it reports may be more capable of causing infection in people who have previously had COVID-19 or who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, the recently emerged EG.5 (also referred to as \"Eris\") is the dominant variant in the U.S., infecting more people than any other single strain. [According to CDC data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklyhospitaladmissions_7dayeddiagnosed_00), weekly new hospitalizations jumped 21.6% this past week, marking a fifth straight week of increasing admissions. The CDC also forecasts an acceleration in new COVID-19 hospitalizations over the coming month, with 1,100 to 7,500 daily COVID-19 hospital admissions likely on September 18. This replaces a previous projection that admissions would \"remain stable or have an uncertain trend.\" [The CDC also reports](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/covid-19-variant.html) it has detected the new COVID-19 variant BA.2.86, for which it released a risk assessment yesterday. Only two cases have been identified in the U.S. so far, but the variant is notable because it has multiple genetic differences from previous variants, potentially posing new challenges for immunity from prior infections and vaccinations. The CDC notes scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of the forthcoming, updated COVID-19 vaccine (expected to be released next month) but that its current assessment is the vaccine will be effective at reducing severe disease and hospitalization. Right now, the EG.5 variant, a descendent of the Omicron strain, is dominant in the U.S. It isn't setting off any alarms as far as disease severity, although early reports show it may be more transmissible. With these developments, the question is what precautions need to be taken. While far from previous peaks seen of the virus, the worsening trends translates to nearly 10 million Americans now living in areas the CDC deems to be at \"medium\" COVID-19 levels. For these places the CDC recommends people who are at high risk of severe disease wear a high quality mask when indoors in public. For the general public, it says Americans should consider self-testing and masking for contact with others who are at high risk. And of course, the CDC continues to urge people to get updated COVID-19 shots and stay home if they are sick. In some places, schools and businesses are responding by reinstating mask mandates, typically in situations where cases have been reported among students and employees.

May 3, 2023 New Research Sheds Light on COVID-19 Variant Dynamics COVID-19 variants showed high diversity in their spread based on factors like vaccination rates, the number of co-circulating variants, and immunity from previous infections, according to new research recently published by a team from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. With COVID-19 still with us and the real risk of future pandemics, the researchers' work can help to inform modeling approaches that forecast how future variants and viruses may behave. The team looked at 16 COVID-19 variant transitions for 230 countries and regions from October 2020 to January 2023. They found variant transition dynamics differed substantially between locations and were associated with vaccination rates, prior infection rates, the time since the last COVID-19 peak, population demographics, and the number of co-circulating variants in competition with the emergent variant. Their research further demonstrated the effect vaccines had on the virus, noting they helped slow the speed of new variant transitions prior to the emergence of the Delta variant. However, continuing viral evolution contributed to new waves of disease spread, with viral variants that became progressively more infectious and resistant to protective antibodies, such as Omicron. The team also found stronger immunity acquired from prior infection, due to higher prior infection rates and a shorter time since the last COVID-19 peak, was associated with later and lower peak-prevalence variant transitions. This suggests that new variant transitions may be slower in locations with a large recent disease outbreak. There have been over 660 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, leading to 6.7 million deaths. The virus continues to evolve, and global transitions to new variants can generate waves of disease spread, adding to the importance of the researchers' efforts.

The public health emergency (PHE) was set to expire on April 11 and the national emergency was scheduled to expire on March 1. The White House extended both to May 11, at which time both will end. It explained doing so is consistent with its plan of giving at least a 60-day notice before ending the PHE given the implications doing so will have. Given the emergency declarations provided additional funding to Medicaid and Medicare and the states, when they end access and costs associated with vaccines, tests, and treatments will be affected. For many, these services will continue to be provided through Medicaid and Medicare and private insurance, although there may now be costs involved. The White House's announcement comes at a transition time as the U.S. and the world move from a more acute phase of the pandemic to a more endemic spread pattern. On the same day as the White House's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern, although it acknowledged the pandemic is at an \"inflection point.\" Additionally, Dr. Ashish Jha, White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said there are other reasons for ending the two emergencies. He said the nation is in a better place with managing the virus and is getting through the winter without a big surge or a run on hospitals. He also said the nation has the tools for managing the virus.

January 5, 2023 Experts Tracking New COVID Variants That Could Drive Next U.S. Surge Scientists are investigating strains descended from COVID's Omicron variant to predict the shape of the next wave. Currently the variant families BQ and XBB are the most cause for concern, with XBB1.5 in particular spiking in number of infections at the start of 2023. This trend is due to two factors researchers believe could make the XBB family particularly resilient: high immune evasion and better ability to penetrate cells. XBB1.5 was found to be \"49 times less likely to be neutralized\" by antibodies compared to the most infectious COVID variants of summer 2022. A unique mutation also allows XBB1.5 to better enter cells, making it easier to transmit. However, while experts are concerned about XBB1.5's overall infectiousness, it does not appear to be any more severe than other COVID strains.

The report contains a collection of essays that explore topics of critical importance and identify actions that can be taken. In its second essay, regarding the role (and potential role) of government agencies in detecting and warning about an impending health crisis, the report comments on the advantage of using wastewater surveillance systems to get a near-real-time picture of disease spread. According to the report, public health officials in Houston and New York City used this technology to detect the Omicron variant 11 days before anyone in the U.S. tested positive for it. This system contrasts with the lagging indicators provided by looking at hospitalizations and deaths but unfortunately is not widespread throughout the U.S. Other essays in the report discuss lessons learned from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus was first detected; reforming global pandemic preparedness and response institutions; meeting medical supply needs for future pandemics; and more.

When discussing the boosters earlier this week, White House coronavirus coordinator Ashish Jha said the expected cadence of delivering them in upcoming years would be similar to that of the annual flu shot, which could be administered at the same time. The updated booster shots, one by Moderna and another from Pfizer, are called \"bivalent\" and tailored to combat the two most prevalent omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, as well as the original strain. The previously approved vaccines were developed just for the original strain and demonstrated an inability to prevent reinfections and to trigger long-term protective immunity, prompting the need for the reformulated vaccines. In announcing the federal government's intent for annual COVID-19 boosters, Jha said staying up to date on vaccinations can get the country back \"to a more normal set of rules,\" allowing businesses and schools to stay open. Heading into the third fall of the pandemic, Jha and other Biden administration health officials urged eligible Americans to get an updated booster. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky cited modeling projections that were presented last week to the agency's vaccine advisory committee showing that if the public embraces the boosters early this fall at a rate similar to that of annual flu shots, about 100,000 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths could be prevented.

August 25, 2022 Government Planning for Fall COVID-19 Booster Campaign with Updated Vaccines The Biden administration has signaled it will offer updated boosters to people ages 12 and older soon after Labor Day, according to media reporting. Updated shots from Pfizer and Moderna will target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, in addition to the original coronavirus strain, in a single shot. BA.5 is still the dominant subvariant, accounting for nearly 90 percent of all new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the currently authorized vaccines only targeted the original strain of the virus, U.S. health officials are looking toward more finely-tuned boosters as a way to blunt possible surges in the fall as schools resume and as more people gather indoors. Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC must authorize the updated boosters before they can be administered, but both authorizations are expected to be granted very quickly. If the authorizations happen based on the timeline discussed, vaccinations with the updated shots could begin as early as the day after the national holiday. Both Pfizer and Moderna noted they have rapidly scaled up manufacturing to be ready, if authorized, to deliver doses.

August 16, 2022 CDC Streamlines COVID-19 Guidance Late last week the CDC released simplified COVID-19 guidance, detailing measures the public should take in terms of getting vaccinations and boosters and quarantining and self-isolating for positive cases and potential exposures. With this updated guidance, the CDC emphasizes the pandemic is not over but that the country is in a different place than before, with tools for reducing the severity of the disease and cutting the number of hospitalizations and deaths that translate into it not needing to severely disrupt daily lives. It promotes the importance of staying up to date with vaccinations, noting that the protection provided diminishes over time. One of the biggest changes is quarantine guidance for people exposed to the virus. Instead of quarantining, the CDC recommends wearing a high-quality mask, watching for symptoms for 10 days, and getting tested on the fifth day. People who are mildly sick with COVID-19 should still isolate for at least 5 days while wearing a high-quality mask. After isolating, people who are recovering should avoid contact with vulnerable people for 11 days. The CDC recommends longer isolation periods for people with moderate and severe illness. Another major change is that the CDC no longer recommends screening asymptomatic people who don't have known exposures. It urges people to consider their risks in particular settings, keeping in mind community transmission levels and ventilation, when gauging needed distancing measures.

May 3, 2022 With Abundant Evolutionary Space to Explore, Coronavirus Threatens to Become More Contagious and Evade Vaccines The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has had billions of chances to reconfigure itself over the past 2 plus years, and it continues to evolve, changing its structure and chemistry in ways that confound efforts to bring it fully under control. In the early days of the pandemic, scientists were optimistic the virus would mutate slowly and that mutations would be inconsequential. In such a scenario, vaccines might not need regular updating. Not only did that prove to be overly optimist, but scientists now say the virus still has abundant evolutionary space to explore. This could enable the virus to evade vaccines as well as to become even more contagious than some of its subvariants already are. \"This virus has probably got tricks we haven't seen yet,\" virologist Robert F. Garry of Tulane University said. \"We know it's probably not quite as infectious as measles yet, but it's creeping up there, for sure.\" Case in point, preliminary research suggests the latest strain, BA.2.12.1, is 25 percent more transmissible than the BA.2 subvariant that is currently dominant nationally. Both emerged from the highly transmissible Omicron variant. The Omicron subvariants keep coming: scientists in South Africa have identified BA.4 and BA.5, which have mutations that were seen in earlier variants and are associated with immune evasion. In newly published research, the authors concluded these strains have the \"potential to result in a new infection wave.\" [Read more at the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/01/coronavirus-more-mutations/) March 29, 2022 FDA Authorizes Second Booster for People 50 and Older and Immunocompromised Individuals; Omicron Subvariant BA.2 Becomes Dominant in the U.S. Today the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized a second booster shot of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for people 50 and older and immunocompromised individuals. The announcement comes as \"BA.2,\" a more transmissible version of the Omicron variant, has become the dominant strain in the U.S. The second booster can be given at least four months after a first booster dose and is expected to become available immediately after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reaches a decision on who should get it. The CDC is expected to say people may get a fourth shot, instead of explicitly recommending they do so, a reflection of the ongoing debate about the benefits of additional doses and uncertainties about the future of the pandemic. But so far the federal government has emphasized the importance of older and immunocompromised persons getting the booster. \"Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals. Based on an analysis of emerging data, a second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Evidence in support of a second booster is limited and mixed, based largely on data from Israel \u2014 where people 60 and older have been able to receive a second booster. Israeli studies have supported the idea that an additional shot could be lifesaving for people older than 60 but have also suggested the shots will have marginal benefits for young, healthy people and offer only short-term and modest protection against getting infected.

The BA.2 strain now accounts for nearly 55 percent of new cases, based on [CDC data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) for the week ending March 26. That is up from about 27 percent two weeks earlier. BA.2 is thought to be about 30 percent more transmissible than the original Omicron strain, BA.1, which itself was already more contagious than earlier versions of the virus. Experts say there is no evidence that BA.2 causes more severe disease than the original Omicron strain or that it evades the protection from vaccines to a greater degree. \"I can be pretty confident in saying that vaccines will continue to work really well at keeping people away from the hospital if they are boosted,\" said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. When fully vaccinated and boosted, a person's cells adopt memory and are able to detect similar variants, preventing extreme illness if infected, he added.

March 8, 2022 COVID-19 Test to Treat Initiative Fact Sheet Today the Department of Health and Human Services published a fact sheet about the \"Test to Treat\" initiative that is included in the Biden Administration's [National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/) that was announced last week. In this program, people will be able to get tested, and - if they are positive and treatments are appropriate for them - receive a prescription from a qualified health care provider, and have their prescription filled all in one location. These \"One-Stop Test to Treat\" locations will be available at hundreds of locations nationwide, including pharmacy-based clinics, federally qualified community health centers (FQHCs), and long-term care facilities. People will also continue to be able to be tested and treated by their own health care providers who can appropriately prescribe these oral antivirals at locations where they are being distributed. The antiviral pills include Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's Molnupiravir, which can help prevent severe illness and hospitalization when taken soon after symptom onset. HHS has already been distributing COVID-19 treatments, including oral antivirals, to states and territories for free on a weekly basis. Beginning yesterday (March 7), HHS also began distributing oral antiviral pills directly to participating Test to Treat pharmacy-based clinics, making more treatments available to more people in more locations. The fact sheet also includes a list of frequently asked questions about the initiative, such as where to find Test to Treat sites. It notes a federal Test to Treat website is in development with anticipated launch in mid-March.

There are four main goals in the 96-page plan: 1) protect and treat COVID-19, 2) prepare for new variants, 3) prevent business and school shutdowns, and 4) help vaccinate the rest of the world and save lives. The newest feature of the plan, which is covered in the first goal, is to offer a one-stop \"test to treat\" system at hundreds of pharmacies, community health centers and other sites starting in March \u2014 places where people can confirm whether they have COVID-19 and, if they're at high risk, get treated with antivirals on the spot, at no cost. As part of the second goal, the White House aims to give businesses guidance, tests, and supplies to stay open, including tools to improve ventilation and air filtration. It also notes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will update workplace guidance to better equip employers with the tools they need to ensure safe workplaces. The White House's plan also notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its framework for recommendations on preventive measures like masking, so masks are recommended when and where they matter the most and Americans will be wearing masks less often. Read [the plan at the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/) and [a relevant article at NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/02/1083905865/the-white-house-has-a-new-plan-for-covid-19-aimed-at-getting-things-back-to-norm). January 25, 2022 WHO Director General Warns Conditions Conducive for More COVID-19 Variants; Workers Share Attitudes about Workplace Safety Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General warned conditions around the world remain conducive for the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, potentially tempering some of the optimism about the future of the pandemic as cases in some areas of the U.S. and other parts of the world have recently declined. Meanwhile, a new survey sheds light onto workers' attitudes about the safety of their workplaces, offering potential helpful information to leaders given that COVID-19, in some fashion, is expected to remain with us for some time. \"It is dangerous to assume that Omicron will be the last variant, or that we are in the endgame,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at an executive board meeting. \"On the contrary, globally the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge.\" Striking an optimistic tone, he said it's possible to end the emergency phase of the pandemic this year if countries use tools and strategies known to drive down cases, including vaccination, increasing testing and sequencing, using targeted public health measures when needed, and using new solutions as they surface. In the U.S., one of the new solutions employed during the pandemic that has involved the sector is the testing of wastewater as an early indicator of COVID-19 prevalence in a community. Samples from wastewater taken from 83 US cities suggests the latest surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant may have already peaked in major urban areas. New York, Boston, Denver, Minneapolis and St. Paul, and San Diego have all likely peaked, according to the level of virus detected in sewage samples. Of all the measures, however, Tedros emphasized bridging the vaccine access gap across countries as a key step for ending the emergency phase. Read more at the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy ( [article Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/24/covid-omicron-variant-live-updates/). Given the likelihood that COVID-19 will remain with us for some time, even if the world ends the emergency phase, organizations must continue to factor in the virus for their workplace safety and resilience plans. One aspect of this is managing risks at the workplace for employees. To help inform discussions and decisions on this topic, Honeywell recently released the results of a comprehensive study on workers' perceptions and feelings on the health and safety of their workplace. The study surveyed 2,000 workers that typically work in buildings with 500 or more employees across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and the Middle East. The findings show that a staggering majority of the global workforce (68 percent) does not feel completely safe working in their employer's buildings. This number is even higher for those working remotely (75 percent), who are especially skeptical about the safety of work sites. In fact, nearly 1 in 4 remote workers (23 percent) would look for a new job rather than return to a site that did not implement necessary safety measures. January 18, 2022 Supreme Court Ruling Blocks OSHA Vaccine Mandate; Program for Ordering Free, Rapid COVID-19 Tests Begins Last week the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) vaccine-or-test mandate that would have applied to many American workplaces. This week, Americans can begin ordering free rapid COVID-19 tests online through a program recently announced by the Biden administration. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 against the OSHA employer mandate, blocking it from taking effect while other legal challenges play out. Meanwhile, it allowed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services vaccine mandate for health care workers to go into effect, by a 5-4 opinion. The cases now return to the courts of appeals for further proceedings, where it is very unlikely there will be a conclusion different than the Supreme Court's. Given a statement released following the Supreme Court's decision, it seems the White House recognizes the attempt to finalize the OSHA vaccine-or-test mandate is effectively blocked, noting \"it is now up to States and individual employers\" to institute vaccination requirements. The White House statement observed nearly one third of Fortune 100 companies had implemented such requirements. A limited number of places have adopted the equivalent of the federal rule for companies within their borders, such as Illinois and New York City. Outside of these places, requirements for workers at private companies from local and state officials are few and far between. And even states with plans to adopt the vaccine-or-test standard announced they would not move forward with the rule at this time. Meanwhile, almost a dozen states have adopted rules to prevent workplace vaccine mandates - from seeking to ban the mandates entirely or imposing specific restrictions on specific programs.

Officially beginning tomorrow, January 19, Americans can order free rapid COVID-19 tests online through COVIDTests.gov, part of a new program announced by the Biden administration in which the federal government is purchasing one billion tests. Each residential address is limited to four tests. Tests will usually ship within 7-12 days of ordering. Additionally, the White House announced a series of other steps intended to expand access to free testing, including by requiring private insurance companies to cover at-home COVID-19 tests, making more tests available at schools, standing up new federal testing sites, increasing the number of tests authorized in the U.S., and more.

Meanwhile, the CDC is said to be weighing updating its mask guidance to recommend that people opt for the highly protective N95 or KN95 masks. Tuesday's total of 145,982 people in U.S. hospitals with COVID-19 passed the record of 142,273 set on January 14, 2021, during the previous peak of the pandemic in this country. More troubling still, those numbers are expected to continue to rise. Disease modelers are predicting total hospitalizations in the 275,000 to 300,000 range when the peak is reached, expected for later this month. The sheer number of cases has put pressure on hospitals, which are also contending with workers having to take off due to illnesses or quarantine requirements. Some facilities are leaving some beds empty, because they don't have enough staff to safety fill them with patients. Currently, about 24 percent of hospitals report critical staffing shortages, the highest of the pandemic, and many facilities are starting to limit elective surgeries and consider crisis standards of care.

With the highly transmissible Omicron variant spurring the current surge, the CDC is said to be weighing updating its mask guidance to recommend that people opt for the highly protective N95 or KN95 masks worn by health-care personnel, if they can do so consistently. Experts have recommended these masks vs. cloth coverings and have emphasized the importance of masking in general. The updated guidance is expected to say the best mask is one worn consistently and correctly and that if people can \"tolerate wearing a KN95 or N95 mask all day, you should.\" [Read more at the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/10/cdc-weighs-n95-kn95-masks-guidance-omicron/) January 6, 2022 \"Flurona\" Co-infections of COVID-19 and Flu Reported in the U.S.; Supreme Court to Hear Arguments about OSHA Vaccine Mandate Tomorrow In COVID-19 pandemic updates, recent cases of \"flurona\" - when a person has both COVID-19 and the flu - have been reported in the U.S., and the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments tomorrow on whether to allow OSHA's workplace vaccine mandate to go into effect. Some of the recent flurona cases in the U.S. have been reported in Houston and California, in cases involving children. Cases of flurona are actually not new, although the term was recently coined following infections in Israel. Instances of co-infection were reported in the U.S. almost two years ago. Additionally, flurona is not a distinct disease. But more cases of flurona could occur this winter as the highly contagious Omicron variant surges in the U.S., and around the world. According to Reuters reporting, the U.S. reported nearly 1 million new COVID-19 infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world and nearly double the previous U.S. peak set a week ago. So what are the symptoms of flurona? Both COVID-19 and flu are respiratory infections, which can cause similar symptoms such as fever, coughing, fatigue, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea, along with muscle and body aches. Both infections can be fatal, although the severity of each diagnosis depends largely on an individual's immune system. And for both, health experts and doctors stress that vaccines remain the best way to protect against severe infections. Given the emergence of the cases, as well as because it's flu season anyways, it's a good time to check the [CDC's information and guidance on the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm). Read more at [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/05/flurona-coronavirus-flu-symptoms/) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-reports-nearly-1-mln-covid-19-cases-day-setting-global-record-2022-01-04/). The Supreme Court's decision following tomorrow's arguments may effectively decide whether OSHA's vaccine mandate, as well as the one from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that applies to health care facilities, go into effect at all. The outcome will have implications for private and non-profit water and wastewater systems, as well as for public systems in some states. The challengers for the OSHA mandate argue that nothing in the Occupational Safety and Health Act expressly gives OSHA the power to require vaccination or weekly testing of many American workers and that the mandate will lead to economic and political consequences, including for individual organizations. The federal government, by contrast, points to the Occupational Safety and Health Act's requirement that the agency regulate \"agents\" and that are \"physically harmful\" and argues that SARS-CoV-2 fits that definition. The challengers also attack OSHA issuing its mandate through its \"emergency temporary standard\" authority without notice and comment. The federal government responds that an emergency standard is appropriate any time there is a \"new\" hazard and that SARS-CoV-2's recent emergence meets that standard. It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will rule following the arguments. The public can listen to the arguments on the Supreme Court's homepage: [https://www.supremecourt.gov/](https://www.supremecourt.gov/).

Recent analyses and research have helped shed additional light on the relatively new strain, in some cases bringing encouraging news. For one, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci observed that hospitalizations, which are not rising as fast, were a more important barometer than reported cases for the severity of the Omicron wave, a sharp distinction after nearly two years of tallying daily case counts. \"As you get further on and the infections become less severe, it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases,\" Dr. Fauci said. Relatedly, a large British study has determined people who contract COVID-19 due to Omicron are far less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with the Delta variant. Other studies found that Omicron may not spread as easily to the lungs, a possible explanation of why its effects appear less severe. The British study also underlined the risk of hospitalization was significantly lower for people who had received two or three vaccine doses, compared with unvaccinated people. Among COVID-19 cases who developed symptoms, people who had three doses were 88 percent less likely to be hospitalized than those who had not had any shots. The number of cases is still staggering and in many places is expected to continue to grow. A tool some public health authorities have for projecting upcoming cases is testing wastewater for traces of the virus that causes COVID-19. In Boston, Massachusetts, for example, levels of the virus detected in wastewater have reached new highs, with the seven-day average for last week more than tripling the previous period. According to the company that tests the wastewater coming into the treatment plant, the amount of virus is correlated with newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases four to ten days later.

December 21, 2021 President Biden to Deliver Address and Announce New Steps for Now Dominant Omicron Variant Today President Biden is announcing new actions intended to address Omicron, building on the plan he released earlier this month when the variant's presence had just been detected in the U.S. In data released yesterday, [the CDC noted](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) Omicron now accounts for 73 percent of all COVID-19 cases, a nearly six-fold increase in its share of infections in only one week. Although President Biden will make the announcement later today, some details of the actions have already been shared [in a statement released by the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-americans-and-help-communities-and-hospitals-battle-omicron/). The actions include expanding access to free testing, including at-home tests; increasing capacity for vaccinations and boosters; and providing increased support for hospitals, including with mobilizations of military personnel. Reflecting language already in the statement, Biden is expected to emphasize the benefits of vaccinations and the risks posed to unvaccinated individuals. In its [updated Omicron webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html), the CDC notes while breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated are likely to occur, vaccines have remained effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. It adds the emergence of Omicron further emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters. Public health officials and experts have added to the calls for more people to get vaccinated and boosted given Omicron's arrival. \"All of us have a date with Omicron,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"If you're going to interact with society, if you're going to have any type of life, Omicron will be something you encounter, and the best way you can encounter this is to be fully vaccinated.\" Omicron's arrival and surge comes at an unfortunate time, during the holidays when many are expected to travel and interact with others. It has already altered some travelers' plans, and it has also led to the cancelation of numerous events, such as in the sports and entertainment world, and to the reimposition or extension of mask mandates. Eight states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico require most people to wear masks in an indoor public setting, coinciding with [current CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). The federal government has extended its mask mandate to March 18. It was originally set to expire on January 18 and includes public transportation settings, such as on buses, trains, and airplanes.

December 16, 2021 Omicron Continues to Spread, Could Bring a Wave of Infections as soon as January The Omicron variant has quickly gained a foothold in most of the country, with cases now detected in 36 states. During a CDC briefing with governors and health officials earlier this week, data was presented that showed a wave of infections, caused by both the Omicron and Delta variants, could hit the U.S. as soon as next month. This time last week, Omicron was in just 21 states. Delta is still the dominant strain, with just three percent of all national cases caused by Omicron. But there are hotspots in parts of the country, such as in parts of New York and New Jersey where the percentage jumps to 13 percent. In Ithaca, New York, Cornell University reported 903 COVID-19 cases among students from December 7 through 13, and a high percentage are Omicron. The outbreak led school officials to shut down its campus. The CDC expects Omicron to become more prevalent in the coming weeks, assisted in part by it seeming to be more transmissible based on early data. Omicron's spread and the greater impacts it could soon have on the nation were highlighted during a CDC briefing on Tuesday, when two scenarios for how Omicron may spread through the country were presented. The worst-case scenario is a winter surge that arrives in January, at the same time as flu activity increases. In the second scenario, a small wave of Omicron cases occurs in the spring. Omicron has begun to influence the nation's mood: 36 percent of Americans say they are worried or extremely worried about themselves or a family member being infected with COVID-19, up from 25 percent in October. Despite the worry, respondents report taking fewer precautions than they did in the spring and are planning a return to normal activities. Roughly half of those polled say they currently stay away from large groups, wear a face mask, and avoid nonessential travel, down from 70 percent in February.

December 9, 2021 CDC Provides Need-to-Know Information on Omicron Variant The CDC has posted a webpage with need-to-know information on Omicron, updating the resource as more is learned on the variant by its own scientists and other researchers. While information on Omicron is still being developed, CDC provides what is known or expected in terms of transmission, illness severity, vaccine effectiveness, and more. In terms of transmission, the CDC notes Omicron likely spreads more easily than the original COVID-19 virus but that how it compares to the Delta variant remains unknown. The CDC notes more data is needed to know if Omicron infections result in more severe illness or death as compared to other variants but adds that it expects current vaccines protect against these situations (while acknowledging breakthrough infections are likely to occur). The CDC also emphasizes vaccines are the best public health measure to protect people from COVID-19, slow transmission, and reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging. With research on Omicron still being conducted, the CDC also stresses the importance of using all tools to protect yourself and others, including by using face masks, getting tested when appropriate, and frequently washing hands. The CDC webpage also provides a map showing the U.S. states where Omicron cases have been confirmed, which now includes 21 states. [Access the webpage at the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html) December 2, 2021 Biden Administration Announces New Actions to Address Omicron, Variant Confirmed Present in the U.S. Today President Biden will announce new actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic given the recent emergence of the Omicron variant, which has been confirmed in cases in California and Minnesota, as well as the continuing prevalence of the Delta variant and the onset of winter. Although President Biden will make the announcement later today, some details of the actions have already been shared [in a statement released by the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-americans-against-the-delta-and-omicron-variants-as-we-battle-covid-19-this-winter/). The actions include efforts to increase vaccinations, including for boosters and initial doses; expanding access to testing resources; implementing new protocols for international travel; extending the requirement to wear a mask on airplanes, rail travel, and public transportation; and supplying treatment pills to help prevent hospitalizations and deaths, among other steps. Officials in California and [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html) the first U.S. Omicron case yesterday, in an individual who recently returned from South Africa. And today, [the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) confirmed](https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2021/covid120221.html) an Omicron case, the second in the U.S. The individual in that case recently returned from travel to New York City, where they attended a convention. In both cases, the individuals had been vaccinated and were reported to have mild symptoms, with the symptoms for the Minnesota case having already resolved. Echoing the messaging of other public health authorities, the MDH acknowledged scientists are still working to determine how Omicron compares with the Delta variant in terms of transmissibility and disease severity and the degree to which existing vaccines and therapies protect against the newest variant. They also emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated (and a booster shot, when applicable) given Omicron's emergence, as the CDC did in [a statement](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1129-booster-recommendations.html) earlier this week. November 30, 2021 CDC Emphasizes Booster Shots for \"Omicron,\" Variant of Concern Recently Detected in North America Yesterday the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [announced](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1129-booster-recommendations.html) it was strengthening its recommendation on COVID-19 vaccine boosters given the recent emergence of \"Omicron,\" noting early data for [the newly classified \"variant of concern\"](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1126-B11-529-omicron.html) suggests it has increased transmissibility. No cases in the U.S. attributed to Omicron have been confirmed yet, but Canada announced it had detected two cases on Sunday. In its statement, the CDC encourages everyone in the U.S. 18 and older to get a booster shot six months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series or two months after their initial Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It also encouraged those not yet vaccinated to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to vaccinate children and teens. The CDC also said it is examining the effectiveness of current vaccines on Omicron. [According to a White House statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/28/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-with-covid-19-response-team-on-the-omicron-variant/), Dr. Anthony Fauci has said while it will take approximately two more weeks to have more information on the transmissibility, severity, and other characteristics of the variant, he believes existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of COVID-19. During an interview with the media, Dr. Fauci also noted that while the Omicron variant has not yet been confirmed in the U.S. it could be here already and that it's inevitable there will be cases at some point. Meanwhile, Omicron is spreading to other parts of the world, including Australia. November 18, 2021 Some States Authorizing COVID-19 Boosters for All Adults ahead of FDA Authorization; OSHA Suspends Enforcement of Business Vaccine Mandate while Health Associations Urge Compliance Several states have expanded access to COVID-19 vaccine boosters for all adults ahead of a formal authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that could come as soon as this week. Additionally, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced it is suspending enforcement of the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for large private businesses, while numerous health care associations called on employers to voluntarily implement the mandate. Yesterday, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, and Vermont joined several other states, including Arkansas, California, Colorado, and New Mexico (as well as New York City), in announcing they had expanded COVID-19 vaccine booster access to all adults. Currently, federal regulators say people who received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and are 65 or older, or adults who are considered to be at special risk because of their medical conditions, jobs, or living environments are eligible for boosters. Anyone who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot can already get a booster. Eligible people can select from any of three vaccine brands as a booster. State leaders have used various justifications for choosing not to wait for federal decisions on boosters, ranging from concerns about holiday season gatherings and winter temperatures pushing people indoors to rising cases and confusion among residents about eligibility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) advisory committee is scheduled to meet Friday afternoon to discuss Pfizer's booster shot. The committee typically makes a formal recommendation after FDA authorization, and then the CDC director signs off on the decision. In its filing last week, Pfizer said new data from a large clinical trial of more than 10,000 fully vaccinated people found that a booster dose was over 95 percent effective against COVID-19 compared to individuals who were fully vaccinated but had not received a booster dose. A press release issued by Pfizer said that during the study period, \"there were 5 cases of COVID-19 in the booster group, and 109 cases in the non-boosted group.\" Read more at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/us/kansas-kentucky-maine-vermont-boosters.html), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pfizer-booster-fda-could-approve-third-dose-for-all-adults-this-week/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-expected-authorize-pfizer-booster-adults-week-rcna5783). OSHA recently announced it was suspending its activities related to the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for private businesses, which applied to those with 100 or more employees, given pending litigation. \"The court ordered that OSHA 'take no steps to implement or enforce' the ETS [Emergency Temporary Standard] 'until further court order.' While OSHA remains confident in its authority to protect workers in emergencies, OSHA has suspended activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ETS pending future developments in the litigation,\" OSHA said. In a 22-page ruling last week, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the administration's COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandate was \"fatally flawed\" and ordered that OSHA not enforce the requirement \"pending adequate judicial review\" of a motion for a permanent injunction. Meanwhile, the American Medical Association and more than 60 other health care associations today called on employers to voluntarily implement the mandate, saying businesses had no time to waste ahead of the busy holiday season. \"We \u2014 physicians, nurses and advanced practice clinicians, health experts, and health care professional societies \u2014 fully support the requirement that workers at companies with over 100 workers be vaccinated or tested,\" the organizations wrote in a joint statement. \"From the first day of this pandemic, businesses have wanted to vanquish this virus. Now is their chance to step up and show they are serious.\" Read more at [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/582022-osha-suspends-enforcement-of-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/18/doctors-health-groups-urge-businesses-adopt-vaccine-rule/). November 9, 20210 Biden Administration Announces Details of Workplace Vaccination Policies Late last week the Biden administration released details of its plan to require full COVID-19 vaccination or weekly testing for two-thirds of the nation's workforce by January 4. Included in the vaccination or weekly testing mandate are companies that have 100 or more employees, a program that is administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA has posted [the Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/05/2021-23643/covid-19-vaccination-and-testing-emergency-temporary-standard) that addresses the requirement, which notes businesses do not need to pay for testing or face masks, the latter also a requirement in most circumstances under the policy. Additionally, OSHA has released [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixxkn3Y8z6g), [frequently asked questions webpage](https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets2/faqs), and [other compliance materials](https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets2) to help guide businesses through the transition. The plan is facing legal challenges, however, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit halted the requirements on Saturday pending review, writing that \"the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate.\" It's unclear which court (perhaps even the U.S. Supreme Court) will ultimately decide the case, and when. In the meantime, the White House said businesses should move forward.

October 26, 2021 Boosters Approved for All COVID-19 Vaccines in the U.S. There are now booster recommendations for all three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. following CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky's endorsement late last week of recommendations from the agency's outside advisory panel. More than 50 million Americans are now eligible to get a booster from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Combined with Pfizer recipients, there are now nearly 100 million Americans who are over the age of 65, or otherwise at risk of severe disease, who are eligible for a booster shot. Currently anyone who received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than 2 months ago can be boosted. People over 65 who completed an mRNA series (either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine) more than 6 months ago, or are 18 and older with an underlying medical condition or working or living in an environment that puts them at high risk for infection, can also get a booster. Additionally, eligible Americans can choose any booster they want, either sticking with the vaccine used in their primary series or mixing and matching.

October 12, 2021 Compendium of U.S. Wastewater Surveillance to Support COVID-19 Public Health Response EPA has released A Compendium of U.S. Wastewater Surveillance to Support COVID-19 Public Health Response, which details various COVID-19 wastewater surveillance programs across the nation from 2020 to early 2021, led by federal, state, local, and tribal agencies and associations, universities, and the private sector. It explores federal and other funding sources, developing and implementing wastewater surveillance programs for the virus that causes COVID-19, and uses case studies to provide implementation insight and lessons learned. The document additionally guides those interested in implementing wastewater surveillance in the future by elaborating on funding, project management, results, and potential actions to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19.

Public Health Authorities Bracing for Potential \"Twindemic\" of Flu and COVID-19 Some public health authorities are worried the flu will come roaring back this season after not materializing last year when most of society was shut down. Combined with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the flu could contribute to a \"twindemic\" and create challenges for workplace manning as well as put more strain on hospitals. Part of authorities' concerns stem from low rates of flu vaccinations, with recent survey data showing slightly more than half of American adults plan to get vaccinated against the flu. That's not much of a change from pre-pandemic surveys. But experts say Americans have built up less natural immunity against influenza because so few were infected in 2020. Flu viruses may also roar back with more opportunities to spread this fall and winter in reopened schools, workplaces and businesses, especially where masks are not mandated. [Read more at the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/10/08/flu-season-covid-shot/) October 5, 2021 The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has updated its [COVID-91 Vaccination Hesitancy within the Critical Infrastructure Workforce \"Insights\" document](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/covid-19-vaccination-hesitancy-within-critical-infrastructure-workforce) with information from the July 2021 iteration of the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) COVID-19 Monitor, which compares participants' changes in vaccine attitudes from January to June 2021 and the reasons for these changes and other COVID-19 vaccination news from the summer of 2021. As CISA observes, the recent iteration of the Monitor found that people who changed their attitude and received their first vaccine shot did so because they saw family and friends safely receive the vaccine and heard pro vaccine messages from people they trust. By hearing about the safety of the vaccine rather than the dangers of getting COVID-19, these personalized community-based efforts proved to be most effective in convincing the hesitant KFF poll participants to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This finding reinforces a message CISA included in the first version of this document, published in March 2021, that employers of frontline essential workers have an opportunity to encourage and lead their critical infrastructure workforce in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CISA also observed that building and sustaining public trust and confidence in immunization systems is essential and the critical infrastructure workforce can play a vital role. September 28, 2021 In the past week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed providing some COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, giving the Biden administration the authority to start administering doses. The administration had originally said all Americans would receive a third shot. But for now the booster plan is more narrow, focused on the populations most likely to develop severe symptoms from COVID-19 and those who face more exposure because of their work. The extra dose is available only to Pfizer vaccine recipients who are people 65 and older, long-term care facility residents, and individuals aged 18-64 who either have underlying medical conditions or are at an increased risk for COVID-19 because of occupational or institutional setting. The latter group includes first responders, education staff and workers in the agriculture, manufacturing, grocery store and public transit industries and Postal Service. The federal health agencies did not endorse a \"mix-and-match\" approach to vaccine boosters, citing a lack of evidence on the potential effects of using two different shots. Those who were immunized with Moderna's or Johnson & Johnson's vaccines will have to wait.

September 23, 2021 The surge of COVID-19 cases associated with the Delta variant appears to be peaking nationally, and cases and deaths will likely decline steadily now through the spring without a significant winter surge, according to a new analysis by a consortium of researchers advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For its latest update, the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub combined nine different mathematical models from different research groups to get an outlook for the pandemic for the next six months. The modelers developed four potential scenarios, taking into account whether or not childhood vaccinations take off and whether a more infectious new variant should emerge. The most likely scenario is that children do get vaccinated and no super-spreading variant emerges. In that case, the model forecasts that new infections would slowly, but fairly continuously, drop from about 140,000 today now to about 9,000 a day by March. \"Any of us who have been following this closely, given what happened with delta, are going to be really cautious about too much optimism,\" says Justin Lessler at the University of North Carolina, who helps run the hub. \"But I do think that the trajectory is towards improvement for most of the country,\" he says.

Some of the opponents of the new mandate have threatened to challenge it in court, prompting questions of whether it will stand. The mandate has not yet been written by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), but several legal experts anticipated the focus of lawsuits. According to one expert, OSHA making a new rule when accommodations for unvaccinated employees have already been made presents an issue, but the Delta variant's spread could address that question. Experts also point out the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of vaccine mandates before, while acknowledging the current justices may view this case differently. There's also the question of what happens in states where vaccine mandates are banned. As another expert observed, in such cases the federal rule would preempt the state rule.

September 7, 2021 An article recently published in the journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness documents California's efforts to address oxygen supply issues that emerged because of high numbers of COVID-19 patients needing ventilator support. While some rationing and troubleshooting did occur, the state was largely able to create a centralized request and allocation system, which included regional oxygen depots, procurement contracts, and tip sheets on oxygen safety and conservation. While the findings and recommendations are tailored to mass patient care situations, they also speak to efforts that can be taken state-wide and by individual end-users to address oxygen shortage issues. \"Oxygen plans are required at every level of disaster and pandemic response, from logisticians to end-users,\" said Dr. Asha Deveraux, one of the researchers. \"Assumptions that oxygen is an endless supply are erroneous, and oxygen conservation and supply should be part of every current and future planning efforts,\" she added. Other states have also contended with oxygen shortages brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes resulting in impacts to water utilities.

Researchers from Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center led the study, which consisted of analyzing vaccine surveillance data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) on 6.2 million vaccinated members of eight US health plans from Dec 14, 2020, to Jun 26, 2021. Of 6.2 million participants, 57 percent received the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and the remainder received Moderna.

Over half of the employers surveyed (52 percent) said that by the fourth quarter of 2021, they could have one or more vaccine mandate requirements in the workplace. This ranges from requiring vaccinations for employees to access common areas (such as cafeterias) to requiring the jab for a subset of specific employees to requiring it for all employees. This is a major hike from the current 21 percent of firms that have some type of vaccine mandate in place for employees. The survey was conducted between August 18 and 25, in the wake of the spread of the more contagious Delta variant. Respondents included nearly 1,000 U.S. employers that together employ nearly 10 million workers.

The authors determined that \"patients with the Delta variant had more than two times the risk of hospital admission compared with patients with the Alpha variant.\" The study observed that vaccinated patients infected with the Delta variant had a lower risk of hospital admission. The scientists examined more than 40,000 COVID patients in the U.K. between March and May of this year. The results also found that \"emergency care attendance combined with hospital admission was also higher for patients with the Delta variant, showing increased use of emergency care services as well as inpatient hospitalization.\" With deaths from COVID up 355 percent since early July, this study illustrates the significance of vaccines in helping to combat the persisting pandemic.

The Axios-Ipsos poll published today found 20 percent of Americans said they either are not very likely or not likely at all to receive a vaccine. That represents a new low in the survey and is down from a combined 34 percent in March and 23 percent two weeks ago. The factors driving down vaccine hesitancy, the survey found, were a surge in delta variant cases, the return of children to schools in recent days and the Food and Drug Administration's granting of full approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine earlier this month.

Delta Air recently became one of the first high-profile companies to impose a health-insurance surcharge for unvaccinated employees, charging them $200 a month starting in November. Delta also requires newly hired employees to be vaccinated, but not existing workers. Such tactics are generally legal, according to experts, but they do carry risks for companies. Employees upset about the changes could quit, and businesses need to be mindful of laws such as the Affordable Care Act that set strict limits on rewards and penalties under wellness programs.

The shortage is due to a surge of COVID-19 inpatients, resulting in liquid oxygen that ordinarily goes to water treatment being diverted to hospitals. The utility typically goes through ten trucks of liquid oxygen a week but its supplier recently said that it would be cut back to five to seven trucks a week to accommodate hospitals, according to Linda Ferrone, OUC's chief customer and marketing officer. In its advisory to customers, OUC notes that if liquid oxygen supplies continue to be depleted and water usage isn't reduced, water quality may be impacted. It added that it believes this will not happen if everyone does their part to conserve water, and in its latest update noted there has been a moderate reduction in water demand. OUC also advises residents to be prepared to follow the conservation measures for at least two weeks and lists other water conservation measures, which include limiting car washes, taking short showers, and repairing leaking faucets and toilets, among others.

August 24, 2021 Yesterday the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted full approval to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a move that is expected to increase vaccination rates by prompting some previously vaccine hesitant individuals to get the shot and motivating more employers to issue vaccine mandates. Unlike an emergency use authorization, a full approval lasts indefinitely, unless an unexpected side effect develops. To get a product approved, a company must provide vastly more data and details on the manufacturing process and relevant facilities and is subject to in-depth inspections by the FDA. The FDA redoubled its efforts to expedite the approval process, increasing staff and computer resources dedicated to the review. In the end, the vaccine approval was the fastest in the agency's history, coming less than four months after Pfizer filed for approval on May 7. Meanwhile, Moderna, the second most widely used vaccine in the U.S., filed for full approval June 1. Johnson & Johnson, the maker of the third COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use, has said it plans to apply for approval later this year.

Oil producer Hess said it will require workers at U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations to be fully vaccinated by November 1. In a statement, the company pointed to the \"highly infectious nature\" of the Delta variant and rising number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Defense is moving forward with a vaccine mandate for all service members, a move it recently indicated it planned to do.

The analysis illustrates how the latest surges of activity, which until recently was concentrated in areas with local vaccination numbers, has quickly developed into a nationwide problem. According to the analysis, on July 4th just four percent of residents of highly vaccinated communities lived in hot spots, compared with 13 percent of people in low-vaccination areas. The gap narrowed in recent weeks as cases surged in major West Coast cities, South Florida urban centers, and the New York-to-Boston corridor. By August, it closed. Public health leaders have attributed these outbreaks to several reasons. Even urban areas that can boast high vaccination rates have susceptible unvaccinated residents who are at greater risk of contracting the virus than during earlier spikes because businesses have reopened, masks are often not required in public, and the Delta variant spreads more easily. Additionally, breakthrough infections do not appear to be as extremely rare as hoped, accounting for more than a fifth of new recent infections in Los Angeles; New Haven, Connecticut.; and Oregon.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that breakthrough cases are \"expected\" and that \"there will be a small percentage of fully vaccinated people who still get sick, are hospitalized, or die from COVID-19.\" In addition, new COVID-19 strains, such as the highly infectious Delta variant, have complicated the efficacy picture. There is also incomplete data into how long immunity lasts following vaccination. It must be emphasized that studies show that fully vaccinated people are much less likely to suffer from a COVID-19 infection \u2014 or to contract the virus in the first place.

An estimated 2.7 percent of adults in the United States are immunocompromised, according to the CDC, which includes organ transplant recipients, people undergoing cancer treatment, and people with HIV, among others. Doctors say it is increasingly clear that many such patients are still vulnerable to Covid following vaccination because they may not mount an effective immune response to the shots. Following the FDA's action, a CDC advisory group is scheduled to meet and may vote on whether to officially recommend a third shot for immunocompromised people. The panel's signoff is needed before doctors can start prescribing extra doses.

The spike in Infections, which began just after July 4, has been fueled by the highly-transmissible Delta variant. Especially in areas with large numbers of unvaccinated persons, it has spread quickly and in many cases has stressed or exceeded the capabilities of local healthcare infrastructure. Much of the focus is on the southern U.S., where states like Florida and Louisiana have emerged as epicenters of activity, with each setting new seven-day records of infections as hospitals fill up. Tennessee is also reporting hospital strain, and in Mississippi the state's top health official said yesterday there are no beds available in intensive care units. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has emphasized that the spike in cases and hospitalizations is occurring largely among the unvaccinated. \"In places that are well vaccinated, we have quite good protection and we don't have a lot of surge.

On Thursday, the White House announced that all federal workers will have to be vaccinated (or undergo weekly testing), and a growing number of cities and states that had not already taken that step followed suit. This included San Diego County, which announced a vaccine requirement for its public workforce, and North Carolina, where the governor issued an executive order for state workers to get vaccinated and called on businesses to also demand that workers receive the vaccine. Businesses across the country have been increasingly mandating vaccines, including Disney and Google. Many of the companies that are requiring shots have mostly office workers who are already largely vaccinated and are reluctant to work alongside those who aren't. In contrast, major companies that rely on blue-collar workers, such as Walmart and Amazon, are shying away from mandates for fear of driving away employees and worsening labor shortages.

In other updates: - For organizations considering vaccine requirements a question is whether doing so is legal. Though there are certain limitations, the short answer is likely yes. The Justice Department recently released an opinion stating that federal law does not prohibit businesses from requiring vaccines even if the vaccines have only been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have not received full regulatory approval. Earlier guidance from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said that federal laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace \"do not prevent an employer from requiring all employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated for COVID-19.\" But a full approval from the FDA could prompt more businesses to feel comfortable issuing vaccine mandates. Enforcement mechanisms for these types of policies, however, are not yet clear. Some businesses might require employees to simply pledge that they are vaccinated while others could require proof.

The goal set by Biden in May is seen by federal health officials as a crucial step toward reaching so-called herd immunity. While the milestone is a significant achievement, it should be seen as a floor, rather than a ceiling, especially as the highly contagious delta variant spreads, health experts say. \"We need to have at least 80 percent of the population vaccinated to truly have some form of herd immunity,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a voting member of the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said in a recent interview.

At the time, cases were dropping sharply, and the more transmissible Delta variant had not gained significant traction in the U.S. However, the U.S. has been experiencing a new surge of COVID-19 activity in recent weeks fueled by the Delta variant, with hotspots emerging in places across the country. Due to this, some places in the U.S. have already reinstituted or are considering reinstituting public health mandates and guidance, including regarding face masks. But the game-changer for the CDC's decision is said to be new data showing that vaccinated people infected by the Delta variant carry the same viral load as unvaccinated people who are infected. Vaccinated people are unlikely to become severely ill, but the new data raises questions about how easily they might transmit the disease. Such transmission did not happen in any significant way with earlier strains.

In other updates: - The current COVID-19 surge in the U.S. fueled by the Delta variant will steadily accelerate through the summer and fall, peaking in mid-October, with daily deaths more than triple what they are now, according to a model's new projections. The projections were released last week from the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, a consortium of researchers working in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help the agency track the course of the pandemic. In the most likely scenario, at the peak in mid-October, there would be around 60,000 cases and around 850 deaths each day. Commenting about the projections, experts said the impacts of the ongoing activity will depend on the level of vaccinations and should lead states and local governments to rethink mask mandates and other public health measures.

A total of 172 new local cases were detected, up from 145 a day earlier. Australia has been contending with an outbreak of new cases in recent weeks largely attributed to the more transmissible Delta variant, with New South Wales experiencing much of the activity. Nearly half of Australia's population of roughly 25 million is under some form of lockdown as Delta-fueled outbreaks have hit cities and communities that until recently were largely spared the worst of the pandemic. Although Australia's infection and fatality rates remain far below global hot spots such, authorities worry that the country's slow vaccine rollout will make this wave harder to control. Less than 13 percent of Australians have been fully inoculated since the country's vaccine program began in February.

July 20, 2021 New COVID-19 cases have increased 140 percent in the past two weeks, according to an analysis. Additionally, hospitalizations and deaths have increased by 34 and 33 percent, respectively. And just today, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the Delta variant now makes up 83 percent of all sequenced cases in the U.S., a dramatic increase from 50 percent the week of July 3. With the increase in activity and continued spread of the highly transmissible variant, there are concerns the U.S. could be on the cusp of a fourth wave, and some places are reimposing public health mandates and guidance that had been lifted not long ago. In California, Los Angeles County officials recently reimposed a mask mandate. In the Bay Area, health officers on Friday recommended that residents of seven counties and the city of Berkeley resume wearing masks indoors. Mask mandates are being discussed, too, in COVID-19 hot spots, such as Arkansas and Missouri. While public health officials and experts debate and consider next steps at this juncture of the pandemic, they are unequivocal in their messaging that vaccines are the best protection against severe illness and hospitalization.

July 15, 2021 Today the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, will release the first advisory of his tenure highlighting the \"urgent threat\" posed by \"health misinformation\" regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of this misinformation relates to the safety and efficacy of vaccines, which have been a powerful contributor to vaccine hesitancy. In an interview ahead of the advisory's release, Dr. Murthy commented, \"Every life that is lost to COVID-19 when we have vaccines available, is a preventable tragedy.\" He emphasized the importance of every American doing their part to fight misinformation, such as by not sharing with others something questionable found online and having simple one-on-one conversations with friends and family who are reluctant to get the vaccine. The surgeon general's advisory comes at a time when COVID-19 cases are rising again after months of decline. The number of new cases per day has doubled over the past three weeks, driven by the fast-spreading Delta variant that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says now accounts for 58 percent of infections.

July 13, 2021 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are maintaining their position that a booster shot is not presently needed for fully vaccinated Americans, following a meeting yesterday with representatives of Pfizer. The CDC and FDA made their assertion in [a joint statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/08/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-vaccine-boosters.html) last week, noting that the boosters aren't needed at this time because the current vaccines are highly effective. Their statement was a response to comments made by Pfizer earlier in the week in which it said the efficacy of its vaccine was waning and boosters would be needed within six months to a year. The CDC and FDA have not ruled out the need for booster eventually, however, noting they will continue to review new data and will be prepared for the doses if and when the science demonstrates they are needed. Meanwhile, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus criticized the push for boosters when many countries have had little access to vaccines thus far.

July 8, 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus warned that the world is at a perilous point in the pandemic during a briefing yesterday, adding that variants are winning the race against vaccines. While his comments were directed mostly towards countries where vaccines have yet to be made widely available, he pointed out the dilemma of other countries dropping public health measures despite ongoing the ongoing activity with fast moving variants. In the U.S., although new cases have decreased significantly from previous levels, there have been recent upticks in some places, with many of the new infections attributed to the Delta variant. Many public health officials and experts are concerned about the vulnerability of unvaccinated people, especially in places where there are significant clusters of such individuals. Officials and experts also fear the possibility these places could become breeding grounds for potentially more transmissible and deadly variants, some of which might be less susceptible to current vaccines.

July 6, 2021 Twenty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam met President Joe Biden's goal of vaccinating 70 percent or more of adults with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by July 4th, according to an analysis. Fourteen states have vaccinated 60 to 65 percent of adults, and 16 states are below 60 percent. Meanwhile, there's been a slight increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases, which have been largely attributed to the highly transmissible Delta variant that now accounts for 25 to 50 percent of cases in U.S. communities. In two places that have seen recent increases, California and Arkansas, officials say most new cases are in unvaccinated residents. In promising news concerning the Delta variant and vaccines, Johnson & Johnson released data that showed its one-dose shot is protective against the strain and provides immunity for at least 8 months. Approximately 11 million Americans have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine thus far.

[In Australia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/28/australia-covid-delta-lockdown/), officials have said it's a \"critical time\" for the nation given recent outbreaks attributed to the Delta variant. By yesterday, the country's most populous city, Sydney, and its smallest capital, Darwin, were in lockdown. Mask mandates were introduced in the federal capital, Canberra; in Queensland; and in Perth. Victoria imposed restrictions along its borders with several states. In the U.S., where the Delta variant now accounts for about one in every five new COVID-19 cases, it's forcing officials to rethink public health measures. [In Los Angeles County](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-28/as-delta-variant-spreads-l-a-county-recommends-everyone-mask-indoors), for example, the variant's spread has motivated officials to reinstate mask guidance for public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status. Experts have said that evidence points to vaccines like those from Moderna and Pfizer providing high amounts of protection against the variant, but LA Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said it is not clear what the future of the variant will be as it becomes more prevalent.

In other updates: - Nearly all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. now are in people who weren't vaccinated, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. Its review of available government data from May shows that \"breakthrough\" infections in fully vaccinated people accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 853,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations (about 0.1 percent). And only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people. That translates to about 0.8 percent, or five deaths per day on average. Earlier this month, Andy Slavitt, a former adviser to the Biden administration on COVID-19, suggested that 98 to 99 percent of the Americans dying from the disease are unvaccinated. And CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Tuesday that the vaccine is so effective that \"nearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19, is, at this point, entirely preventable.\" [Read more at the Associated Press.](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187) - Over the weekend, the White House launched a week-long blitz to encourage vaccination against COVID-19. The administration had hoped 70 percent of Americans over age 18 would have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by July 4, but last week officials said they expect to miss that mark. Now, top officials from the administration and even celebrities are being used to court what the Associated Press calls the \"moveable middle,\" roughly 55 million unvaccinated American adults, many under age 30. These people are considered persuadable and open to the idea of vaccination but have not made it a priority.

Until formal approval is gained, some fear the vaccines will always be thought of as risky or experimental. Pfizer began submitting data for full approval May 7, but it is unclear when the FDA will act. Moderna applied later, on June 1. Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that while there should not be \"political pressure\" on the FDA, \"I would be interested in knowing what the holdup is.\" \"It could have a big impact on people getting [vaccinated] if it is FDA approved,\" she said. \"I think it's worth asking why it hasn't happened yet.\" [Read more at The Hill.](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/560316-calls-rise-for-fda-to-fully-approve-covid-19-vaccines) - The COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna could provide long-term protection, including for \"years,\" according to a study published in the journal Nature yesterday. The study found the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines produce a \"persistent\" immune response and give a sign of long-lasting protection. The study centers on what are known as germinal centers, what Ali Ellebedy, the study's senior author and an associate professor at Washington University in St. Louis, describes as \"boot camps for immune cells\" and the \"the key to a persistent, protective immune response.\" He explained, \"The longer we have a germinal center, the stronger and more durable our immunity will be,\" and he noted the study \"found that germinal centers were still going strong 15 weeks after the vaccine's first dose.\" He added, \"We're still monitoring the germinal centers, and they're not declining; in some people, they're still ongoing.

It notes that unlike individual testing, wastewater testing captures virus shed by symptomatic and asymptomatic people alike, and can test en masse the 80 percent of households connected to a sewer system. Such testing can detect exactly when dangerous viral variants enter a community and provide an early warning to public officials. It can even predict new outbreaks with a lead time of one to two weeks. The articles cites the CDC's partnership with other federal agencies, states, and utilities to develop a National Wastewater Surveillance System (previously discussed by WaterISAC on its [COVID-19 general webpage](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/coronavirus-pandemic-updated-june-22-2021)). To support the development of a fuller system, it proposes a three-pronged plan that involves deploying wastewater sampling at strategic sentinel sites, identifying or setting up reliable testing labs near the sampling sites, and moving wastewater testing from an academic enterprise to an operational policy tool. To help accomplish this, it proposes federal funding to help upgrade the sector's physical infrastructure.

[In one study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7025e1.htm?s_cid=mm7025e1_w), the CDC found 80 percent of adults older than 65 had been immunized compared with less than 40 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds. The study also noted weekly vaccination rates among 18- to 29-year-olds are declining, going from 3.6 to 1.9 percent a week from April 19 to May 22. [In the second study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7025e2.htm), the CDC found that nearly 25 percent of 18 to 39-year-olds reported they probably or definitely would not get vaccinated while 23 percent were probably going to get vaccinated or were unsure. Overall, the CDC reported adults aged 18-39 years with lower incomes, with lower educational attainment, without health insurance, who were non-Hispanic Black, and who lived outside of metropolitan areas had the lowest reported vaccination coverage and intent to get vaccinated. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the primary reported reasons for not getting vaccinated.

Delta has been reported to be the most contagious variant yet and accounts for at least 14 percent of all new infections, responsible for more than 242,000 cases nationwide over the last six months. All the vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. appear, in general, to provide powerful protection against all the variants, including Delta. But given Delta's rapid spread and the large number of people who remain unvaccinated, there are concerns it could trigger yet another moderate surge of infections through many parts of the U.S. [Read more at NPR.](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/06/22/1008859705/delta-variant-coronavirus-unvaccinated-u-s-covid-surge) June 17, 2021 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the COVID-19 Delta variant, which is highly transmissible and currently sweeping through the U.K., now makes up at least 10 percent of all domestic cases. On May 22, the variant had made up only 2.7 percent of cases. The CDC also now designated Delta as a variant of concern, which means it officially recognizes the variant may carry a risk of more severe illness and transmissibility. The rapid rise of the variant in the U.K. - where it now accounts for 90 percent of cases - has slowed that nation's reopening efforts by 4 or 5 weeks. The risk posed by Delta has public health officials stressing the benefits of vaccines, which have been shown to be highly effective against the variant. In one recent study, researchers in the U.K. found that a two-dose regimen of the Pfizer vaccine was 88 percent effective against symptomatic disease from Delta. \"If you are vaccinated, you're going to be protected, which is another very good reason to encourage people strongly to get vaccinated,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"If you are not vaccinated, you are at risk of getting infected with the virus that now spreads more rapidly and gives more serious disease.\" Read more at [the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/cdc-delta-variant-now-10-us-covid-19-cases) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/06/17/1007493934/the-delta-variant-is-the-most-contagious-of-covid-19-strains). June 14, 2021 Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine has slowed down so much in some states they have stopped requesting shipments and even given millions of doses back to the federal government, even though significant portions of their total populations are not vaccinated. In some cases the returned shipments are sent to other states where demand remains high. The U.S. averaged about 870,000 new injections per day earlier this month, down sharply from a high of about 3.3 million a day on average in mid-April, according to the CDC. President Joe Biden wants to have 70 percent of the adult U.S. population at least partially vaccinated by July 4. But the U.S. could well fail to meet that target. As of last Friday, 64 percent of Americans 18 and older had had at least one dose, by the CDC's count. Amid the glut, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June and also buy 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine and donate them to lower-income countries.

Scientists took blood from volunteers who had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and looked at the levels of neutralizing antibodies, the kind that prevent a virus from entering cells. \"What we showed is that the neutralizing antibodies are reduced about fivefold to the [Beta] variant,\" said Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \"That's very similar to what other investigators have shown with other vaccines,\" he says. \"But what we also showed is that there's many other types of immune responses other than neutralizing antibodies, including binding antibodies, FC functional antibodies and T-cell responses.\" And it's that last immune response, the T-cell response, that Barouch says is critically important. Because T cells, play a crucial role in preventing illness.

Fortunately vaccines appear to be highly effective against the variant, with Dr. Anthony Fauci pointing to data from the U.K. that shows two doses of the vaccine made by Pfizer are 88 percent effective in preventing symptomatic disease caused by the new variant. He said in an interview that the Pfizer data would be similar for Moderna's product, which also is an mRNA vaccine. The Delta variant quickly spread in the U.K., which Dr. Fauci referenced to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated. \"It's essentially taking over [in the U.K.],\" Dr. Fauci said at a briefing for reporters. \"We cannot let that happen in the United States, which is such a powerful argument\" for vaccination, he added.

The slowdown is national, with every state down at least two-thirds from its high. But overall levels of vaccination vary considerably across states. Thirteen mostly East and West Coast states have already vaccinated 70 percent of adult residents, and an additional 15 states and Washington, D.C. are over 60 percent. Where vaccination levels are lagging, such as in many states in the South, experts are concerned there could be a case surge over the summer. If there is a surge, experts believe it won't be as serious as last summer's because at least some people are vaccinated and treatments have improved. Another worry is testing, for which a similar decline would make it difficult to contain outbreaks ahead of a potential surge.

Based on the guidance, companies can require vaccines of employees returning to the workplace. Companies must give the same legally required considerations that company-wide vaccine requirements entail, like making accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act for employees who can't receive the vaccine. The EEOC acknowledged in its guidance that other laws, such as state laws, may offer opposing views. Employers can offer vaccine incentives, as long as they are not coercive. Incentives can include paid time off to get vaccinated, rewards for employees who show proof of inoculation, and the opportunity to go mask-free at the office as a type of inducement.

The share of people saying they will \"wait and see\" fell from 15 percent to 12 percent. The KFF also observes one potential avenue for further increasing vaccine uptake is full FDA approval of one of the vaccines currently authorized for emergency use, with about one-third (32 percent) of unvaccinated adults saying such approval would make them more likely to get vaccinated.

Delta Airline mandated that all new hires in the U.S. be vaccinated, unless they qualify for an accommodation. The company said it will not be putting in place a company-wide requirement that current employees to be vaccinated, but noted that more than 60 percent of its employees have already been vaccinated. In its most-recent guidance updated last December, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said employers can legally require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with exceptions for those who have a medical or religious accommodation.

People have myriad reasons for continuing to wear a mask. For some, they are still worried about new virus variants and the off-chance they might contract the virus and pass it along to others, though the risks of both are greatly reduced for those who are fully vaccinated.

The CDC noted that some settings may still require masks, including due to federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, as well as local business and workplace guidance. For example, the relaxation of restrictions does not apply to airplanes or health-care settings. And the CDC urges those who are immune-compromised to speak with their doctors before giving up their masks. CDC officials cited a growing body of real-world evidence demonstrating the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines and noted the shots offer protection even against more contagious variants circulating in the U.S. They said they also factored in the country's declining cases, and the rarity of breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated. Nonetheless, officials cautioned the guidelines could change again if the pandemic worsens.

But according to a new report from research organization Advance Democracy, with the exception of Facebook, nearly all of them are losing the war against COVID-19 mis/disinformation. As the pace of the nation's immunizations slows, the report found that debunked claims sowing unfounded fears about the vaccines are circulating largely unfettered on Twitter and TikTok. Twitter began labeling tweets that include misleading or false information about COVID-19 vaccines in March. It also started using a \"strike system\" to eventually remove accounts that repeatedly violate its rules. Yet none of the top tweets on Twitter using popular anti-vaccine hashtags like #vaccineskill, #novaccine, #depopulation and had labels as of May 3. On TikTok, anti-vaccine lies and conspiracies are still surging despite a company crackdown. TikTok says it prohibits content that's false or misleading, including misinformation related to COVID-19 and vaccines. It has also banned the hashtags #VaccinesKill and #plandemic. Yet, as of May 3, TikTok failed to consistently apply labels to anti-vaccination hashtags used in videos with millions of views. In recent months, Facebook has moved more aggressively to combat misinformation. The company said in March that it would add labels to posts about vaccines. As of May 3, all of the top 10 posts discussing COVID-19 vaccines that used the #vaccineskill hashtag were labeled, compared to only two of the top 10 on March 28.

We're averaging about 43,000 a day. We've got to get it much, much lower than that. When that gets lower, the risk of any infection indoor or outdoor diminishes dramatically,\" Dr. Fauci said.

The effort is expected to be detailed in a call today between White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients and state governors. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until July 4, when President Biden set a target of 70 percent of the U.S. adult population getting at least one vaccine dose. While the companies were already providing free or discounted rides in some circumstances, the rides will now be free to anyone in the U.S. who is going to a vaccination site to get the shot, and Lyft and Uber will promote the rides to and from tens of thousands of vaccination sites through their apps.

It removes obstacles for school reopenings by reducing the threat of transmission in classrooms and for parents who have been grappling with how to conduct their lives when only the adults in a household are immunized. However, the F.D.A.'s go-ahead is not the final hurdle. An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to meet shortly to review the data and make recommendations for the vaccine's use in 12- to 15-year-olds. If the committee endorses the vaccine for that age group, as expected, immunizations in theory could begin immediately. Clinical trials have shown that these children may safely receive the dose already available for adults.

Biden announced his goal during [remarks on Tuesday](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/04/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-covid-19-response-and-the-vaccination-program/), when he acknowledged \"the pace of vaccination is slowing\" and predicted the vaccination effort is \"going to be harder\" when it comes to convincing \"doubters\" of the need to get shots. Biden's push comes as his administration has shifted away from setting a target for the U.S. to reach \"herd immunity,\" instead focusing on delivering as many shots into arms as possible. To that end, the Biden administration is shifting the government's focus toward expanding smaller and mobile vaccination clinics to deliver doses to harder-to-reach communities. It is also spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to boost interest in vaccines through education campaigns and greater access to shots through community organizations that can help bring people to clinics.

The CDC report is not a prediction or forecast. Rather, it is a set of four scenarios based on modeling of the pandemic, using different assumptions about vaccination rates, vaccine efficacy and precautions against transmission. Each scenario shows an epidemic curve in which the national increase in cases that began in early March hits a peak and then plummets in late spring, leading to a dramatically improved viral landscape this summer. Under the most optimistic scenario, deaths from COVID-19 could drop into the low 100s per week in August and into the \"tens\" per week in September. In the less optimistic scenarios, hospitalization numbers will vary significantly from state to state.

Two published studies found that the Pfizer vaccine was extraordinarily effective against severe disease caused by two variants, including B.1.1.7 that was first identified in the U.K. and B.1.351 that was first identified in South Africa. And the results of an early-stage trial of the Moderna vaccine \u2014 though not published or vetted by scientists \u2014 suggested that a single dose given as a booster was effective against B.1.351 and P.1, which was first identified in Brazil.

The announcement was welcome news for the many parents and children whose lives have been upended by the pandemic. Several provinces and territories began the school year with in-person learning. But as cases in many provinces surged, schools have on multiple occasions reverted to online learning, severing children from their social networks, keeping them out of extracurricular activities and putting stress on parents. Pfizer has sought authorization for similar use in the U.S., which the Food and Drug Administration is expected to do by early next week.

The nation is administering about 2.3 million shots per day, the lowest since March 11. Daily vaccinations peaked in mid-April at nearly 3.4 million per day. One of the contributing factors to the slowdown appears to be that a significant number of people who received their first doses of the two dose vaccines - the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - haven't returned to get their second shot. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported this applies to almost 8 percent of those who received their first shot. The CDC said the number of people missing doses - 5 million - may not be exact. If a person got the two doses from different reporting entities \u2014 for example, first from a state-run clinic and then from a local health clinic \u2014 the two doses may not have been linked by databases. But some people are certainly missing their second dose. Fear of the side effects of the second dose - which are reportedly more severe than after the first dose for some people - along with trouble getting an appointment and finding the time for it are among the reasons people have given for missing second doses.

The term signifies the point when enough Americans would be protected to be rid of the pathogen. Early on, the target herd immunity threshold was estimated to be about 60 to 70 percent of the population. Most experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, expected that the U.S. would be able to reach it once vaccines were available. But given the contagiousness of new variants, experts now calculate the herd immunity threshold to be at least 80 percent. If even more contagious variants develop, or if scientists find that immunized people can still transmit the virus, the calculation will have to be revised upward again. More than half of adults in the U.S. have been inoculated with at least one dose of a vaccine. But daily vaccination rates are slipping, and polls show that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is still reluctant to be vaccinated. That number is expected to improve but probably not enough.

The vaccine is currently authorized for use in people 16 and older. Families and pediatricians have been eager for a vaccine to become available for children, particularly in advance of the next school year. Follow-on trials testing the Pfizer vaccine in younger children are ongoing. Moderna is conducting a similar trial of its vaccine in teens, with results expected in the summer. Moderna is also testing its vaccine in younger children. Johnson & Johnson is planning pediatric trials of its single-shot vaccine.

During a briefing on Tuesday, she noted new reported cases fell by 21 percent over the past week, with the most recent seven-day average coming in at just over 54,400 cases per day. Walensky called the figure \"a really hopeful decline.\" Hospitalizations also fell by 9 percent, with an average of more than 5,100 hospital admissions per day over the past seven days. Walensky partly attributed the recent trends to the ongoing nationwide vaccination campaign. \"Each day more and more Americans are rolling up their sleeves and getting vaccinated, and likely contributing to these very positive trends,\" she said. The CDC director's optimism stands in stark contrast to her remarks one month ago, when she warned of \"impending doom\" and pleaded for continued vigilance as COVID-19 cases rose steadily in the U.S., as WaterISAC reported on in [the March 30 Security & Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-insider-threats-us-critical-infrastructure-dhs-secretary-discuss).

According to the report, the countries sensationalized vaccine safety concerns, publicized unfounded links between vaccines and deaths, and promoted their own vaccines as superior. Written by the EU's disinformation unit, the report said Russian and Chinese vaccine diplomacy \"follows a zero-sum game logic and is combined with disinformation and manipulation efforts to undermine trust in Western-made vaccines.\" It added, \"Both Russia and China are using state-controlled media, networks of proxy media outlets and social media, including official diplomatic social media accounts, to achieve these goals.\" [Read more at Sky News.](https://news.sky.com/story/russia-and-china-trying-to-sow-distrust-in-western-covid-vaccines-12289862) - In spot checks across the country, people seeking vaccines and officials dispensing them appear eager to resume using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires just one dose and is also easier to store and transport. On Tuesday, for example, 1,355 people chose Johnson & Johnson at the clinic run by Indiana University Health, while 407 took the Pfizer vaccine.

The CDC stopped short of telling those people they could shed their masks altogether in outdoor settings, citing the risk that remains for transmitting the coronavirus, unknown vaccination levels among people in crowds, and the still high-caseloads in some regions of the country. The guidance includes a color-coded chart that shows activities that fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people can do indoors and outdoors, and which ones can be done without masks. For activities that involve crowded outdoor settings, such as sporting events, live performances, and parades, the guidance indicates that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals should wear masks. The guidelines address growing calls from infectious-disease and other public health experts to relax mask mandates for the outdoors because of the dispersion of virus particles in the air, distancing is easier, and humidity and sunlight render the coronavirus less viable.

In other updates: - The risk of being exposed to COVID-19 indoors can be as great at 60 feet as it is at 6 feet in a room where the air is mixed and even when wearing a mask, according to a new study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers. The study's findings challenge the CDC guidelines that recommend 6 feet of distance between people, pointing out that staying 6 feet away from another person may not be enough when people are inside for prolonged periods of time. \"We argue there really isn't much of a benefit to the 6-foot rule, especially when people are wearing masks\" since everyone in the room is breathing the same air, said MIT professor Martin Z. Bazant, who teaches chemical engineering and applied mathematics. \"It really has almost no physical basis because the air a person is breathing while wearing a mask tends to rise and comes down elsewhere in the room so you're more exposed to the average background than you are to a person at a distance,\" he explained.

About 3 million Americans are getting vaccinated daily, an 11 percent decrease in the seven-day average of daily shots administered over the past week. The drop is rivaled only by a brief falloff that occurred in February, when winter storms forced the closure of vaccination sites and delayed shipments nationwide. Vaccine hesitancy, vaccinating hard-to-reach groups, and other barriers appear to be hampering efforts. Yesterday President Biden sought to remove one potential barrier, promising tax credits for employers that give their workers paid time off to receive and recover from inoculations. \"The time is now to open up a new phase of this historic vaccination effort,\" President Biden said. \"To put it simply, if you've been waiting for your turn, wait no longer.\" [Read more at the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/21/vaccinations-downturn-jj-pause-soft-demand/) In other updates: - The pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has not substantially deflated overall confidence in COVID-19 immunizations, a new poll reveals. In fact, 76 percent of 1,000 registered voters surveyed nationwide said the pause didn't decrease the likelihood that they would get vaccinated. In addition, among those already vaccinated, 87 percent said they would \"definitely\" get vaccinated again if they had to do it all over. However, 32 percent indicated they would never get a Johnson & Johnson vaccine specifically. \"These results do not surprise me,\" said Dr. James McDeavitt, senior vice president and dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine. \"There appears to be a relatively small portion of the population that is hard-core opposed to vaccines and are unlikely to change their minds.\" Pollsters also inquired about how people perceived the decision to pause the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Fifty-three percent believed it was a good example of the rigorous safety monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccines in place to protect Americans. Another 29 percent felt this was a good example of why the COVID-19 vaccines are possibly unsafe, untested, and should not be taken unless you absolutely have to.

To make this conclusion, KFF used the results of a March poll that found that 61 percent of U.S. adults either received one vaccine dose or want to get vaccinated as soon as they can has continually increased. It identifies this number as representing a current \"outer edge\" of vaccine enthusiasm, translating to about 157 million adults. Using the latest data from the CDC indicating that almost 131 million adults (or 50.7 percent of all adults), had received at least one vaccine dose as of April 19, that leaves an additional 27 million adults to go before we hit up against the \"enthusiasm limit.\" At the current rate of first doses administered per day, the U.S. will reach the tipping point in about 15 days.

The U.S. continues to make progress in its nationwide vaccination campaign, with daily vaccinations reaching about 3 million on average and 50 percent of American adults (over 130 million) having received at least one dose of a vaccine so far. The challenge ahead is vaccinating the remaining 50 percent of the population, and addressing the hesitancy and other factors that might undermine efforts. As part of addressing hesitancy, the White House conducted a targeted media blitz yesterday, which involved announcements and social media engagements by the President himself as well as top officials. Another factor that is getting increasing attention is the difficulty of vaccinating older Americans. As it stands, older adults are the most vaccinated age group in the country. Yet about a fifth of those 65 and older have not received even one shot. There are many reasons that eligible people may not be vaccinated, limited access to vaccination sites and confusing procedures for booking appointments.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss recommendations for the J&J vaccine. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration recommended pausing the use of the J&J Covid-19 vaccine last week over six reported blood clot cases.

One cardiologist was confused in the early days of the pandemic. Why the sudden drop in heart attack patients at the clinic? And why did some who did come arrive hours after first feeling chest pains? Two patients, both of whom suffered greater heart damage by delaying care, provided what came to be typical answers. One said he was afraid of contracting COVID-19 by going to the hospital. The other patient went to the emergency room in the morning, left after finding it too crowded, then returned that night when he thought there would be fewer patients - and a lower risk of catching COVID-19. Along with exacerbating existing health problems, the pandemic has caused a host of new medical concerns in patients. The American population will be coming out of the pandemic with teeth worn down from grinding, back problems from slouching at makeshift homework stations and mental health problems from a combination of isolation and being too close to family.

When most Americans went to bed Monday evening, the news about vaccinations in the was overwhelming positive: the average number of shots administered per day was well over three million, leading to predictions that pandemic restrictions could ease in the coming months and some semblance of normalcy could return. But the story began to shift the following day when a vast online network that feeds vaccine skepticism with bad information and conspiracy theories went into action. Millions of Americans were already skeptical of the vaccines before the Johnson & Johnson news, a challenge the federal government, state and local governments, private sector organizations, and others have been trying to address with their own messaging campaigns. \"As it plays out, this is the sort of thing that increases the possibility of vaccine hesitancy across the board,\" said Dr. Steve Schrantz, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, who specializes in infectious diseases. \"It's a very hard thing to message, and it can put further doubt in people's minds.\" Read more at [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/15/987182241/the-most-popular-j-j-vaccine-story-on-facebook-a-conspiracy-theorist-posted-it) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/johnson-johnson-vaccine-pause-bad-news-crucial-time-bidens-recovery-ef-rcna668). In other updates: - During an emergency meeting yesterday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent a committee within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that provides advice and guidance on vaccines, called for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to stay \"on pause\" as the group gathers more data on the potential link between the vaccine and blood clots. Members said they needed to reconvene as quickly as possible after some risk-benefit and risk refinement has been completed. They said they will announced within 2 days when they plan to next meet, but it will likely be in the next 7 to 10 days.

In an accompanying announcement, he explained the Johnson & Johnson vaccine makes up less than 5 percent of the recorded shots in the U.S. to date. He added the U.S. secured enough Pfizer and Moderna doses for 300 million Americans and that there is more than enough supply to continue the current pace of vaccinations of 3 million shots per day, and meet the President's goal of 200 million shots by his 100th day in office, in late April.

If variants begin to evade detection, that could be consequential not only for individual patients, who may not receive the treatment they need, but also for the broader population. If a test misses someone who is infected by a variant, then that person may not realize they need to isolate and could unknowingly spread that variant to others, said Gary Schoolnik, a physician and infectious disease expert at Stanford University. \"And that's how a diagnostic test, if it's missing variants, can actually promote the spread of that variant,\" he explained.

Dr. Walensky also noted the important role vaccines play in reducing COVID-19 cases and other activity, but she added that it takes time for vaccinations to have an effect on transmission levels, 2 to 6 weeks or more. \"If we tried to vaccinate our way out of what is happening...we would be disappointed that it took so long for the vaccine to work to actually have the impact.\" In the past week new daily COVID-19 cases across the U.S. rose by 6.7 percent, and hospitalizations rose by 3.8 percent. Deaths, however, fell by 6 percent.

In other updates: - Today the CDC and the FDA called for an immediate pause in use of Johnson & Johnson's single-dose coronavirus vaccine after six recipients in the U.S. developed a rare disorder involving blood clots within about two weeks of vaccination. While the move was framed as a recommendation to health practitioners in the states, the federal government is expected to pause administration of the vaccine at all federally run vaccination sites. Federal officials expect that state health officials will take that as a strong signal to do the same. CDC and FDA scientists will jointly examine possible links between the vaccine and the disorder and determine whether to continue to authorize use of the vaccine for all adults or limit the authorization. The move could substantially complicate the nation's vaccination efforts at a time when many states are confronting a surge in new cases and seeking to address vaccine hesitancy. Nearly seven million people in the U.S. have received Johnson & Johnson shots so far, and roughly nine million more doses have been shipped out to the states.

Colleges have long required vaccinations for infectious diseases, backed up by laws and even some judicial cases. In a survey of about 100 four-year institutions representing all 50 states and Washington, D.C., nearly all required at least one vaccine for enrollment. But current COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized by the FDA under an emergency use authorization, or EUA, which introduces a \"new situation.\" \"We've never had the vaccine for the entire population authorized under EUA before,\" explained Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. So legal arguments have a little asterisk, she says, until vaccines are officially approved by the FDA, which could come as early as this summer.

According to the data, nearly 500 people in the U.S. have been infected with the variant, which has devastated Brazil, with the largest number of cases found in Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida. Previous reporting indicated this variant demonstrated the ability to infect some people who had immunity from previous bouts of COVID-19.

She said the variant was behind the recent spike in cases, which has the U.S. seeing an average of 63,000 new cases each day. Young adults, kids in youth sports, and people associated with daycare centers are among the new cases, Walensky added. These populations are not likely to have been vaccinated yet. The CDC has also noted B.1.1.7 is most prevalent in California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Minnesota. As WaterISAC noted in its Tuesday Security & Resilience Update, one of these states - Michigan - has recently emerged as one of the U.S.'s COVID-19 hotspots. But analysis of recent COVID-19 data has revealed other hotspot states, including New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Researchers have found these four states and Michigan account for 44 percent of the nation's new COVID-19 infections in the latest available 7-day period.

In other updates: - The CDC is recommending Americans not travel to Canada at this time, noting that even fully vaccinated travelers are at risk of getting and spreading the virus variants. The U.S.-Canada border remains closed to non-essential travel. Essential travel includes commercial travel and work-related commuting. The CDC recommends that for those who must travel to Canada should be fully vaccinated, wear masks and stay socially distant. The CDC also recommends getting tested 3-5 days after traveling to Canada. The current restrictions are in place through April 21, although that deadline is expected to be extended.

The Ontario premier, Doug Ford, pleaded with residents to remain at home. \"The risks are greater and the stakes are higher,\" he Ford. Thanks in part to the B.1.1.7 variant, new cases in Ontario have tripled throughout March. The surge has overwhelmed the province's intensive care units, breaking records previously set during the previous second wave of the virus. Other Canadian provinces are grappling with their own outbreaks that are hitting a younger demographic. British Columbia, the country's westernmost province, is currently battling an outbreak of the P1 variant, first documented in Brazil. Neighboring Alberta announced new restrictions earlier this week, cancelling in-person dining and limiting retail as the P1 variant threatened to overwhelm the province's healthcare system.

On average, about three million shots are being given per day. These vaccination numbers have inspired some optimism, but the situation is being overshadowed by increasing new case counts and the spread of variants. The new weekly average is 64,000 cases per day, up seven percent from the prior seven-day period. And the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant, which was first identified in the U.K., has now been reported in every state in the U.S. Public health officials and experts are attributing many of the new cases to younger groups of Americans who have not yet been vaccinated and to the more transmissible variants. \"Cases are increasing in younger adults, we know this is due to more highly transmissible variants,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. Until more of the population is vaccinated and COVID-19 activity subsides more, many officials and experts are asking the public to hold onto precautions for just a little while longer.

In other updates: - Today President Biden plans to announce that he is speeding up the deadline for states to make all adults eligible for a coronavirus vaccine - to April 19. The President's newest target comes almost a month after he set an original deadline of May 1 for every state. A White House official said last week that Mr. Biden revised the timeline because states, encouraged by increases in shipments, were ramping up their vaccination programs more rapidly than expected. Many governors already moved up eligibility timelines on their own weeks ahead of Mr. Biden's original May 1 marker.

More than 6,700 new cases are being diagnosed in Michigan every day, levels nearing what it saw during last year's holiday season. The situation in Michigan is further demonstrating how the newest cases are disproportionately impacting younger adults who have yet to be vaccinated. Moreover, many of them are showing up in emergency departments, a perhaps unsurprising development given that the spreading variants are believed to cause more severe cases and be more deadly.

The campaign, with ads in English and Spanish, will air throughout April on network TV and cable channels nationwide, as well as online. Two hundred and seventy-five organizations will participate in the administration's new public awareness push, with participating organizations including health professionals, scientists, community organizations, faith leaders, businesses, rural stakeholders, civil rights organizations, sports leagues, and athletes. It comes as the administration and the states are rapidly expanding access to vaccines but with some communities continuing to express skepticism about safety and the need to get the shots. Government officials expect to soon face the possibility of supply exceeding demand if many Americans remain reluctant to be vaccinated. With cases rising in some parts of the country again and variants spreading, the challenge is getting as many people as possible vaccinated to contain the pandemic and facilitate a return to a more normal way of life.

For the first time, the majority of new hospitalizations have been younger adults, with cases among people ages 50-65 increasing more than those older than 65, who are more likely to have been vaccinated. And in some states, like Michigan and Massachusetts, the number of cases among older children, teenagers and young adults have also increased.

The FBI advises that individuals are selling fake COVID-19 vaccination record cards and encouraging others to print fake cards at home. Because of this phenomenon, it strongly encourages businesses and government agencies to follow CDC guidance and continue to maintain social distancing and use personal protective equipment.

She explained that after weeks of going down or remaining stable, COVID-19 cases across the country have jumped again, as has happened at least twice in the past year before the nation experienced a major surge in virus activity. Walensky explained that these jumps were likely fueled by states relaxing restrictions and abandoning mask mandates too soon, and by the heightened transmissibility of variants - including B117, the variant first identified in the U.K. - which now account for 26 percent of all COVID-19 cases sequenced in the U.S. According to the Washington Post, in the past week new daily reported COVID-19 cases rose 12.3 percent, deaths rose 1.1 percent, and hospitalizations rose 2.5 percent.

In other updates, which are described in further detail on WaterISAC's COVID-19 general webpage: - The World Health Organization is expected to officially release a report today that says the COVID-19 virus was likely transmitted to humans from animals, such as bats, with a lab leak unlikely. The report was completed by a 10-person mission that arrived in China in January and conducted a nearly four-week probe. The mission issued an initial assessment in early February as it completed its visit. Following that assessment, some groups questioned China's transparency and whether it shared full data with the WHO. Also, the source of the virus has become embroiled in political tensions between some western nations and China, with some suggesting that outbreak source involved a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to a review of a leaked copy of the report, it lays out the different theories on how the virus may have spread to humans and provides rationales behind the group's conclusions for each possibility.

He emphasized he was expressing his personal opinion, not as a public official. Noting his virologist background, Dr. Redfield explained he came to the belief because of the speed at which the virus spread. He also contended that after being manipulated in a research laboratory it could have been accidently released by a worker in September or October 2019, a few months before coming to public attention.

March 18, 2021 The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has just released the \"Insights\" document [COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy within the Critical Infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/insights). This document provides an overview of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy (defined by the World Health Organization as a \"delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services\") and steps that critical infrastructure owners and operators can take to reduce the risk and encourage vaccine acceptance across their workforce. CISA emphasizes that COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy within the critical infrastructure workforce represents a risk to National Critical Functions and critical infrastructure companies and operations. According to CISA, recent reports show a high percentage of critical infrastructure workforces are hesitant or outright refuse to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, CISA recognizes that critical infrastructure workforce can serve as a key stakeholder in encouraging the rest of the population to get vaccinated and help the return to everyday life. Building and sustaining public trust and confidence in immunization systems is essential and the critical infrastructure workforce can play a leading role.

The CDC said the variants may be 20 percent more transmissible. In comparison, the variant B117, first identified in the U.K., is considered 50 percent more transmissible than the original COVID-19 virus. Neither of the new variants of concern are thought to escape the effectiveness of currently approved vaccines, but therapeutics, including monoclonal antibody treatments, may be slightly less effective.

Michigan has seen a rise in hospitalizations and positive test results. Minnesota's numbers are creeping up, as are Maryland's and New Jersey's. Many places, including New York City and surrounding counties, are no longer seeing steady declines in cases, despite intensive vaccination efforts. Variants, especially B117, may be behind the emergence of these hot spots.

The pandemic's diverging paths on the two continents can be linked in part to the much more successful vaccine rollout in the U.S. and the spread of more contagious variants in Europe. But while the U.S.'s vaccination campaign continues to expand, so too does the prevalence of variants. \"Each of these countries has had nadirs like we are having now, and each took an upward trend after they disregarded known mitigation strategies,\" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. \"They simply took their eye off the ball.\" According to Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington, the lesson for the U.S. is to keep vaccinating those at risk as fast as possible, keep an eye on variants, and \"keep slow and steady with the easing of social distancing requirements.\" [Read more at the Associated Press.](https://apnews.com/article/europe-coronavirus-surge-cautionary-tale-for-us-051e996d5b7e31711bb741e2f9ba724f) March 16, 2021 Yesterday U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the highly contagious B.1.1.7 COVID-19 variant, which was first identified in the UK, is projected to become the dominant variant in the U.S. by the end of this month or early April. Cases of the B.1.1.7 have so far been found in 48 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC, according to CDC data. Meanwhile, another study supports suggests the variant brings a higher risk of death. The study published yesterday in Nature says the variant may pose a 61 percent higher risk of 28-day mortality. The finding is in line with a study published last week (WaterISAC reported on this study in its Thursday Security & Resilience Update) that noted B.1.1.7 had a 64 percent higher 28-day risk of death among people older than 30. The projected increased prevalence of B.1.1.7 and other COVID-19 variants have led many officials and public health experts, including Dr. Walensky, to warn Americans about letting down their guard too early, potentially because of dropping case counts and increasing vaccinations. Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (which WaterISAC often looks to for information), said the country is in a \"whole new ballgame\" in terms of dealing with the virus, given the new variants of COVID-19 that have cropped up in recent months. \"We are, I think for the moment, in the eye of a hurricane with regard to the good news, the vaccine's coming, but the big challenge [is] with this new variant that has arrived here from Europe.\" Read more at [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/16/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html), [the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/b117-deadlier-other-covid-19-strains-more-data-affirm), and [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-variants-warning/).

As large percentages of patients with confirmed infections can shed their virus in their feces, wastewater testing systems have been used to track and even forecast COVID-19 spread in communities during the pandemic. A recent wastewater testing update indicated \"concerning\" increases of virus detection.

Anyone age 16 and older who lives or works in Alaska became eligible on Tuesday after the state became the first in the country to allow the maximum possible number of residents access to a vaccine. Next week, Texans age 50 and older will be eligible, the state's health department announced yesterday, the same day Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said that people in that state over 55 would be able to get a shot next week. New Yorkers age 60 and older became eligible on Wednesday, with Governor Andrew Cuomo citing increased supply from the federal government. The governors of Minnesota and Ohio also said this week that they would open eligibility to larger groups of residents. And at least 37 states, as well as Washington, D.C., are now allowing some residents with certain health problems to receive vaccines. The pace of vaccinations has picked up to the point where the daily average of individual shots has reached about 2.17 million a day. Should the pace hold or even increase, the adult American population of about 260 million could be fully vaccinated within months by any of the currently approved vaccines. About 62.5 million Americans have received at least one dose and about 32.9 million of that number have been fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Those diagnosed as having B117 infections had higher viral loads at diagnosis than those infected with other variants, which the authors said could be attributed to a variant trait or to the tendency of these participants to seek care when they were most contagious. The researchers cautioned that their results may not apply to other settings and age-groups, because their study included only about 8 percent of COVID-19 deaths in England over the study period.

Public health specialists lay part of the blame on the rapid spread of the P.1 strain, which studies have shown to be more contagious and better able to reinfect people than previous versions of the disease. Researchers have also said Brazil is now home to hundreds of new Covid-19 variants, warning that other more dangerous versions could emerge the longer the disease is left to fester and mutate, threatening to undermine the progress of other countries against the pandemic.

March 9, 2021 Yesterday the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0308-vaccinated-guidelines.html) for persons who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, representing a first step in providing guidance about safely returning to everyday activities in communities. The CDC said people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 - meaning it has been 14 days since receiving the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or 14 days since receiving the Johnson & Johnson injection - can now freely socialize with small groups of fully vaccinated people indoors. The CDC says they should continue to take COVID-19 precautions when in public, such as wearing a well-fitted mask. It emphasized that the vast majority of people still need to be fully vaccinated and that, until then, it is important everyone continues to adhere to public health mitigation measures to protect the large number of people who remain unvaccinated. According to the new guidelines, fully vaccinated people may also visit with unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without wearing masks or staying 6 feet apart if everyone in the other household is at low risk for severe disease, which CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky described as younger than age 65 with no underlying health conditions. Additionally, fully vaccinated people can refrain from quarantine and testing following a known exposure to COVID-19, if they remain asymptomatic. The CDC also announced that it will update its recommendations as more people are vaccinated, rates of COVID-19 in the community change, and additional scientific evidence becomes available.

March 2, 2021 President Joe Biden is expected to announce today that Merck will help manufacture Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, a move intended to substantially increase the supply of the newly approved vaccine as concerning new variants of the virus have been found in the U.S. The unusual deal between the competing pharmaceutical companies was brokered by the White House, which had been scouring the manufacturing landscape for weeks ever since it became evident that Johnson & Johnson's was running behind on its mass production. Merck's own attempt at making a COVID-19 vaccine was unsuccessful, but it is an experienced vaccine manufacturer. Under the agreement, Merck will dedicate two of its facilities to production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which unlike the other two approved vaccines requires only one shot. How quickly Merck will be able to ramp up is unclear. It will take time, possibly as long as two months or more, for the company to be able to convert its facilities to manufacture and package a vaccine that it did not invent.

These variants are a very real threat to our people and our progress. \" She also said if states lift mitigation mandates, like mask-wearing, too quickly, the nation could see a fourth wave of virus activity before enough Americans are vaccinated.

The researchers' studies have yet to be published in scientific journals. Their authors caution that findings on cells in laboratories do not always translate to the real world and that they've only begun to understand P.1's behavior. But even with the mysteries that remain around P.1, experts say that it is a variant to take seriously. \"It's right to be worried about P.1, and this data gives us the reason why,\" said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H.

The FDA does not need to follow the report's recommendations in formally issuing an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Johnson & Johnson candidate, but it often does, and it did when Pfizer and Moderna submitted their vaccines for EUAs in December. FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet Friday to review the EUA request. Also yesterday, leaders of the White House COVID-19 response team said they are ready to distribute Johnson & Johnson's vaccine when and if the FDA issues an EUA. Johnson & Johnson has a deal with the federal government to supply 100 million doses of its vaccine by the end of June. A key difference between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the two that have already been granted EUAs is that it requires only one dose. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine has also been rated at less effective overall, at 66 percent. But infectious disease experts pointed out that Johnson & Johnson's numbers can't be used as a direct comparison to the other two vaccines because of the single dose and the company's trial was conducted when there were more infections as well as new, more contagious variants.

The website is run by Boston Children's Hospital, with the help of several other collaborators. It grew out of the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009 and has been used for years to coordinate the distribution of flu and childhood vaccines. It expanded on yesterday to include the availability of coronavirus vaccines at more than 20,000 locations, concentrated in several states. If the program goes well, the website's developers plan to expand it nationwide in coming weeks to include nearly all vaccine providers that agree to be featured. That would make the website far more comprehensive than anything that exists now.

Flu death data for the whole U.S. population is hard to compile quickly, but CDC officials keep a running count of deaths of children. One pediatric flu death has been reported so far this season, compared with 92 reported at the same point in last year's flu season. Experts say that measures put in place to fend off the coronavirus - mask wearing, social distancing and virtual schooling - were a big factor in preventing a \"twindemic\" of flu and COVID-19. A push to get more people vaccinated against flu probably helped, too, as did fewer people traveling, they say.

In Maine, for example, the state moved water and wastewater workers from a \"1B\" priority for vaccines to \"1C\" to first accommodate residents who are age 70 and older. \"The water districts and sewer districts are the first line of defense for health,\" said Scott Abbattoni, a water director in Maine who is advocating for his fellow employees to be put on a higher vaccine priority list. The situation is similar in Iowa, where state sector associations have advocated that officials include sector water and wastewater workers in a higher priority grouping. \"We have limited resources, we have limited staff and so, should we have a large number of our staff become affected with COVID and have to be off for a while, we would really need to start calling in employees from other utilities who could be struggling with the same things we are dealing with,\" explained William O'Brien, Dubuque's Water and Resource Recovery Center manager.

February 16, 2021 While much attention has been focused in recent weeks on COVID-19 variants that emerged in foreign countries, especially the U.K., South Africa, and Brazil, scientists are finding a number of new variants that seem to have originated in the U.S. And they have expressed concern that many of these variants may pose the same kind of extra-contagious threat as their overseas counterparts. In [a study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251658v1) posted over the weekend, a team of researchers reported seven growing lineages of the coronavirus, spotted in states across the country. All have gained a mutation at the exact same spot in their genes. It's not clear yet whether this shared mutation makes the variants more contagious, but because it appears in a gene that influences how the virus enters human cells, the scientists are highly suspicious. It's difficult to answer even basic questions about how prevalent the new variants are in the U.S. The researchers found examples scattered across much of the country. It's also hard to say whether the variants are spreading now because they are more contagious, or for some other reason, like holiday travel.

The decreases have been treated as a welcome sign that post-holiday surges are on the decline. The nation's public health officials continue to encourage vigilance in adhering to mitigation strategies, including face mask wearing and social distancing, emphasizing their importance as variants become more prevalent.

On average, 1.7 million Americans are getting vaccinated each day, and the federal government is sending 11 million doses to the states each week.

Adding a cloth mask over a surgical mask on a rubbery dummy head more than doubled particle blocking when the dummy simulated coughing. Specifically, a surgical mask or a cloth mask alone blocked about 42 to 44 percent of particles, respectively, coming out of the coughing dummy. The combo of a cloth mask over a surgical mask blocked 92.5 percent of the risky particles. The CDC researchers also tested out tucking and knotting a surgical mask on either the receiver or the source head. The tuck-and-knot reduces side gaps that let unfiltered-breath escape. This alone reduced the receiver's exposure by 64.5 percent and 63 percent when it was used by the receiver or the source, respectively. When both heads had tucked-and-knotted masks, exposure dropped again by 96 percent.

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted that cases have continued to decline over the last four weeks, with an average of 119,900 new cases being reported between January 31 and February 6. This represents a drop of nearly 20 percent from the prior week. However, she also observed that case numbers are still dramatically higher than last summer's peak and encouraged the nation to continue to keep up its guard to combat the pandemic, implementing measures like wearing masks, avoiding travel, crowds, and poorly ventilated spaces, and getting vaccinated when it's made available.

On February 26, an FDA advisory committee will hold a public meeting to make a recommendation about whether or not the vaccine should be approved. Johnson & Johnson previously announced its vaccine is 85 percent effective at preventing severe cases of Covid-19, and 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate cases of the disease. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has a few key differences from the other vaccines approved for use in the U.S., those from Moderna and Pfizer. For one thing, Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines each require two shots, given three or four weeks apart, but Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is just one shot. While the other vaccines need to be stored at super-cold temperatures, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine just needs a standard refrigerator for storage up to three months.

South Africa recently received 1 million doses of the vaccine and was poised to start vaccinating healthcare workers, but the country decided to halt administering the vaccine while further investigations are underway. The chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial said the findings confirms that the virus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected, but promising results from other vaccine trials in South Africa using a similar virus vector suggest vaccines will still help ease the burden on health systems by preventing severe disease.

Otherwise the spread of the UK variant could trigger major COVID-19 surges like those seen in other countries. The scientists' finding is based off a study led by the Scripps Research Institute. Study coauthor Mark Zeller, PhD, of Scripps Research Institute, told CIDRAP News that US vaccination efforts will have very limited effectiveness in slowing the spread of B117 in the coming weeks. \"It will still take many months before enough people are vaccinated to slow down transmission significantly,\" he said. In the meantime, he described the best strategy as one that involves physical distancing and wearing face coverings, as well as increased testing and vaccination to lower the variant's spread to buy some time for before it becomes dominant.

President Biden directed OSHA to release this guidance, which is intended to help workplaces identify risks of being exposed to and/or contracting COVID-19 and determine appropriate control measures to implement. The guidance recommends several essential elements in a prevention program, including conducting a hazard assessment, adopting policies for employee absences that don't punish workers as a way to encourage potentially infected workers to remain home, and ensuring policies and procedures are communicated to both English and non-English speaking workers, among others. OSHA emphasizes the guidance is not a standard or regulation, and it creates no new legal obligations. It does contain descriptions of existing mandatory safety and health standards.

The order, which took effect late Monday night, requires face masks be worn by all travelers on airplanes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis, and ride-shares and at transportation hubs like airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations, and seaports. President Biden had previously ordered government agencies to \"immediately take action\" to require masks in all public transportation modes and hubs. The order says passengers must wear a mask in transit except for brief periods, such as to eat, drink or take medication. The CDC said people violating the order could potentially face criminal penalties but suggested civil penalties would be more likely if needed. The order will be enforced by the Transportation Security Administration and federal, state, and local agencies.

Pekoske's order also cites President Biden's Executive Order on Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel, the same one cited by the CDC in issuing its public transportation mask mandate. - Although there have been reports of people testing positive for COVID-19 even though they already received a vaccine, experts say cases like these are not surprising and do not indicate that there was something wrong with the vaccines or how they were administered. Some of the reasons for how these infections can still happen include that vaccines don't work instantly (it takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after receiving a dose), nor do they work retroactively (a person may have already been infected); the vaccines prevent illness, but maybe not infection (vaccines are authorized based on how well they keep people from getting sick); and even the best vaccines aren't perfect (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine efficacy rates are high, but not 100 percent). [Read more at the New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/31/world/covid-19-coronavirus#covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-positive) January 28, 2021 Today South Carolina health officials announced they had diagnosed two cases associated with the COVID-19 variant that originated in South Africa, marking the first time this variant has been detected in the U.S. The two cases don't appear to be connected, nor do the people have a history of recent travel. \"That's frightening,\" because it means there could be more undetected cases within the state, said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. \"It's probably more widespread,\" she observed. Like the other two notable variants, those originating in the U.K. and Brazil, this variant is believed to be significantly more transmissible than the original strain. As WaterISAC reported on in the Tuesday Security and Resilience Update, the other variants have already been detected in the U.S., with the U.K. variant having been first observed in a case in Colorado in late December and the first U.S. case of the Brazil variant having been identified on Monday in Minnesota. In addition to concerns about the effectiveness of existing vaccines against these and potential future variants, health officials also worry that mutations of the virus mean people might get COVID-19 a second time. South African studies have documented dozens of instances of people who contracted earlier strains of the coronavirus being infected with the new variant, suggesting that those who had contracted mild cases or otherwise had low antibody counts might be prone to reinfection.

In other COVID-19 update: - Pfizer has issued [a statement](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/vitro-studies-demonstrate-pfizer-and-biontech-covid-19)showing its vaccine was slightly less effective against the variant from South Africa, based on a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study. The statement emphasized that the small differences in viral neutralization are unlikely to lead to a significant reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine. It also added that Pfizer will continue to monitor emerging COVID-19 strains and conduct studies on the vaccine's real-world effectiveness. Additionally, Pfizer believes the flexibility of the mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to develop new vaccine variants if required. - President Biden announced the U.S. is ramping up deliveries to hard-pressed states over the next three weeks and expects to provide enough doses to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer or early fall. Biden called the push a \"wartime effort\" and said his administration was working to buy an additional 100 million doses of each of the two approved vaccines. Governors and top health officials have been increasingly raising the alarm about inadequate supplies and the need for earlier and more reliable estimates of how much vaccine is on the way so that they can plan.

This measure is intended to prevent or limit the spread of the variants in the U.S., given that they are all believed to be more transmissible and have been associated with outbreaks in their countries of origin, as well as in other countries. Two out of the three variants, those from the U.K. and from Brazil, have already been detected in the U.S. The U.K. variant was first detected in the U.S. in late December, [in a case in Colorado](https://apnews.com/article/public-health-united-kingdom-jared-polis-coronavirus-pandemic-denver-755cd6f5e9189b1890f34f625d6a37f8).

The South Africa variant has not yet been detected in the U.S., although it has been documented in Canada. In addition to their transmissibility, there are also concerns about these variants' lethality and susceptibility to existing vaccines. Late last week, [British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-variant-covid-mortality/2021/01/22/86023180-5cd6-11eb-a849-6f9423a75ffd_story.html) the U.K. variant \"may be associated with a higher degree of mortality,\" referring to preliminary data from new studies. Johnson and U.K. Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance repeated assertions that existing vaccines remain effective against the variant. Pfizer and Moderna have said their vaccines appear to work against this variant. For the other variants, those originating in Brazil and South Africa, there is no evidence that they are more lethal, but there are greater concerns about vaccine effectiveness. For the Brazil variant, there's no strong evidence that suggests that vaccines won't work. However, scientists have raised the possibility that this variant can evade antibodies, which would impact vaccines effectiveness. And for the South Africa variant, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the vaccines may have a diminished impact, but they probably will still be effective. Yesterday [Moderna announced](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against) its vaccine protects against the South Africa variant (as well as the U.K. variant), with the caveat that vaccine-elicited antibodies were also less effective at neutralizing this mutation in a laboratory dish.

Some of these goals involve bolstering production of vaccines and medical supplies, implementing measures to help prevent and mitigate the disease's spread, addressing disparities across demographic groups, and preparing the nation for future threats, among other types of measures. As expected, and as reported on in the Tuesday Security and Resilience Update, the Biden administration aims to expedite the COVID-19 vaccination campaign through a variety of steps, including by leveraging the Defense Production Act to ensure the availability of glass vials, syringes, and other supplies needed to administer vaccines. The strategy includes encouragement for all Americans to wear face masks, a measure also addressed in [an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce-and-requiring-mask-wearing/) released yesterday (and that requires face masks be worn in all federal buildings, among other stipulations). President Biden has also said he will issue a separate order to federal agencies to require masks on airplanes, trains, and other public transportation. The strategy specifies establishing an equity task force to address disparities in rates of infection, illness and death across lines of race, ethnicity and geography. And as part of preparing for future threats, the U.S. will rejoin the World Health Organization.

January 19, 2021 On Friday, President-elect Joe Biden presented a five-point plan aimed at expediting the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The five points include: - Working with states to clearly identify priority groups for the vaccine, the first of which will be adults 65 and older and \"frontline\" essential workers (those who regularly interact with and are exposed to the public as part of their duties, such as first responders and grocery store clerks). - FEMA establishing 100 federally supported vaccination centers across the country by the end of February. Biden also said he would oversee the creation of thousands of community immunization sites, such as school gyms and community centers, as well as mobile vaccination units that would travel to hard-to-reach communities to deliver the vaccines. - \"Fully activating\" pharmacies to act as vaccination sites, building on the Trump administration's reliance on commercial pharmacies to distribute the vaccine. - Using the full force of the Defense Production Act to make the supplies needed to administer vaccines, including syringes and personal protective equipment. - Committing to transparency and introducing a massive public information campaign to combat disinformation.

The money to pay for some of the points would come from a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan Biden announced the day before, on Thursday. The plan includes a request for $160 billion in funding for a national vaccination program, expanded testing, and other steps. The plan also entails billions in grants and loan programs for small businesses, and $350 billion in emergency funding for state, local, and territorial governments.

All three variants seem to be becoming more common. And all three are potentially more transmissible. What's been observed with the recent variants demonstrates coronavirus is in a constant arms race against our immune system and should serve as a reminder that it will keep evolving. Although vaccines are believed to still be effective against the current variants, eventually they may need to evolve with new mutations.

State officials disclosed the rise of the variant Sunday night after genetic monitoring linked it to a fast-growing share of new cases. Experts stress that they need to look more closely at the circumstances of the outbreaks, as well as at the latest variant before declaring it more contagious or more dangerous than the virus already broadly circulating. [Read more at the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/18/california-coronavirus-variant/) January 14, 2021 Yesterday [the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a new order](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html) requiring all air travelers arriving in the U.S. to have tested negative for COVID-19 within three days of their departure. Documentation of the negative test result, or proof of having recovered from COVID-19, is required before passengers are allowed to board the aircraft. This order goes into effect on January 26. The announcement comes as the U.S. continues to experience a critical level of COVID-19 activity, with more than 200,000 new cases reported on Tuesday alone, and given concerns of new variants of the virus, including those that show evidence of being more transmissible, emerging in countries around the world. Much attention has been paid to the variant that originated in the UK and that is known to be circulating in the U.S., but there are now also reports of two more variants of concern linked to Brazil, both which have a mutation or mutations that may affect transmissibility and host immunity. And yesterday researchers based in Ohio said they have spotted a new variant, native to the state, and likely behind rapid spread of the virus in Columbus. Like the strain that originated in the UK, the variant seems to spread more easily than the original virus, but vaccines should still be able to offer protection.

January 12, 2021 Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced new guidelines that recommend COVID-19 vaccines be given to everyone over 65 in the country. The move is intended to expand eligibility for the vaccine and accelerate a nationwide effort that has fallen short of its initial targets. Decisions for vaccine allocations are ultimately left to state and local governments, but the federal government has been issuing recommendations for priority groups that have been adopted to varying degrees. Currently, the vaccines are largely being distributed to people in the highest-risk categories, including frontline health care workers and older people in nursing homes. HHS will also no longer hold back vaccine doses to ensure that those who receive a first dose will have a second dose in reserve. Instead, all existing doses will be sent to states to provide initial inoculations. Second doses are to be provided by new waves of manufacturing. Both vaccines authorized in the U.S. so far require two doses: 21 days apart for the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, and 28 days apart for the one from Moderna.

[Access the podcast at the New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-variant-vaccine-pandemic.html) - The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Physical Security Measures infographic, which highlights resources within the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to enhance relevant stakeholder knowledge of physical security. This infographic is intended to assist facility owners, operators, and vaccine recipients to increase their understanding of potential physical threats and relevant mitigation measures. While there are elements of cyber vulnerabilities across the distribution process as well, this product focuses on physical protective measures to safely administer the vaccine. These resources and others are intended to help reduce the chance of a successful attack occurring and the impact should one occur. [Access the infographic at CISA.](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-physical-security-measures) January 7, 2021 In a news conference yesterday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar encouraged states to focus on administering COVID-19 vaccines to as many people as possible as quickly as possible, and not let \"perfection be the enemy of the good\" as far as adhering to the federal government's vaccine priority guidelines. \"We need to not be overly prescriptive,\" Azar explained, adding that if people in top priority groups had been offered the vaccine and doses were left over, states should quickly start offering the vaccine to other groups. As of Wednesday, only 28 percent of vaccine doses distributed to hospitals and 13 percent of those allocated to nursing homes have been delivered into arms, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Azar also announced that a \"federally arranged pharmacy partnership\" will launch soon. He said it will involve more than 40,000 pharmacy locations across the country, to which states can allocate vaccines for administration, including to those \"over a certain age or in certain occupations\" and eventually to the general public.

As WaterISAC reported on in its [December 22 Security & Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-assume-compromise-if-lacking-visibility-solarwinds-activity-covid), a CDC advisory committee recommended that water and wastewater sector workers be included in phase 1c for COVID-19 vaccine allocations as part of the \"other essential workers\" group. Phase 1c also includes people aged 65 to 74 and 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions. Phase 1a consists of healthcare personnel and long-term care facility comprise phase 1a, and phase 1b is for individuals 75 and older and \"frontline\" essential workers (those who regularly interact with and are exposed to the public, which include police and firefighters, public transit workers, and grocery store workers, among others). Although the federal government is issuing recommendations for vaccine allocations, ultimately these decisions are left to state and local governments. January 5, 2021 Public health officials are warning of the likelihood of a post-holiday spike in COVID-19 cases and other activity in the days and weeks ahead. \"It's terrible, it's unfortunate, but it was predictable,\" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci on Sunday. Although air travel is down markedly from years past, American airports had their busiest day of the pandemic on Saturday, with nearly 1.2 million passengers passing through security checkpoints, according to the Transportation Security Administration. And tens of millions more people were expected to travel by car. Further complicating the situation, the new, more transmissible variant of the virus, first found in the UK, is now known to be circulating in the U.S. The variant was first detected in Colorado last week, and since then there have also been cases associated with the strain in California, Florida, and New York. Additionally, the nationwide vaccination effort has not rolled out as quickly as anticipated. Operation Warp Speed had said it would inoculate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020, but so far about 4.5 million people have received the first of two injections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams explained the vaccine rollout has gone slower than anticipated because healthcare facilities are still dealing with an onslaught of new cases and increased demand for testing. \"I want everyone to know that over the next week or two is when we should be paying attention closely and making sure we continue to see this ramp up,\" he said.

In other COVID-19 updates: - The FBI has issued a press release warning of emerging fraud schemes related to COVID-19 vaccines. In one scheme, the perpetrators offer early access to a vaccine upon payment of a fee. The press release describes other variations of this activity and offers tips to avoid vaccine-related fraud. [Read the press release at the FBI.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/federal-agencies-warn-of-emerging-fraud-schemes-related-to-covid-19-vaccines) - The peer-reviewed data on both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are in, which note that they demonstrate 94 to 95 percent protection from the disease. When compared with placebos, Moderna's vaccine showed 94.1 percent efficacy and Pfizer's had 95.0 percent efficacy. Both rates are for patients who received the two intended doses. Adverse events were uncommon in both studies.

Data from Moderna's clinical trials demonstrated that people between the ages of 18 and 55 who received two 50-microgram doses showed an \"identical immune response\" to the standard of two 100-microgram doses said Dr. Moncef Slaoui, an official with the federal government's Operation Warp Speed.

Given this development and possible concerns of its implications for their utilities and communities, WaterISAC is sharing with members recently published or updated resources from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include [\"New COVID-19 Variants,\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html) [\"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants,\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html) and [\"Implications of the Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variant VOC 202012/01.\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-emerging-variant.html) Some of the most significant observations from these resources include: - Transmissibility: The variant seems to spread more easily and quickly than others. - Severity of illness and lethality: There is no evidence the variant causes more severe illness or increased risk of death. - Vaccine efficacy: There is no evidence to suggest the variant has any impact on vaccine efficacy. December 29, 2020 Canada and Australia are now among a growing list of countries to have confirmed their first cases of COVID-19 due to the variant recently observed in the United Kingdom, which is now the dominant strain there. Although the U.S. has yet to confirm any cases due to this variant, many government officials and health experts have indicated it is likely already in the country. Yesterday, Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Brett Giroir said, \"We don't have proof that it's here, but we do suspect that it is likely here, given the global interconnectedness.\" Researchers are rushing to understand more about how the UK variant behaves, but preliminary information has suggested its transmissibility may be as high as 70 percent greater than that of other strains. These developments have led to many countries to implement or increase their travel restrictions in an effort to slow the spread. In the U.S., travelers arriving from the U.K. are now required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test under new rules issued by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even without the presence of the new variant, officials and experts are already expecting more spikes in cases due to increased travel and family gatherings during the holidays. \"As we get into the next few weeks, it might actually get worse,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci. Nearly 1.3 million people traveled through U.S. airports Sunday, setting a pandemic travel record - despite warnings from the CDC to stay at home to quell coronavirus cases.

In other COVID-19 updates: - Experts are optimistic that the COVID-19 vaccines will still be effective against the variant observed in the UK, as well as other strains. And even if the virus were to mutate further, the vaccines could be rapidly reprogrammed to remain effective against new variants. While a tweaking of vaccines could be done quickly, actually rolling out a recalibrated vaccine would take some time, perhaps a couple of months, due to manufacturing and regulatory requirements.

If testing goes well and the vaccine is eventually approved, it would be added to the U.S.'s vaccination campaign, adding to an effort that is need of more supplies. \"If you want to have enough vaccine to vaccinate all the people in the U.S. who you'd like to vaccinate \u2014 up to 85 percent or more of the population \u2014 you're going to need more than two companies,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci.

And Dr. Mark Ryan, the head of the WHO emergencies program, warned that the next pandemic may be worse. \"This pandemic has been very severe ... it has affected every corner of this planet. But this is not necessarily the big one,\" he said. \"This is a wake-up call. We are learning, now, how to do things better: science, logistics, training and governance, how to communicate better.

Back in January and February, surface contamination was thought to be a problem, with early studies suggesting the virus could live on surfaces for days. Since then scientists have found that even in hospital settings, no infectious virus could be identified on surfaces near COVID-19 patients. What's found is viral RNA, which is like the \"corpse of the virus\" and is not infectious. In retrospect, extensive actions to disinfect surfaces seem like overkill. Today, the evidence points toward breathing in the virus from the air as being the most important route of transmission, and the one deserving of the most attention for reducing cases.

Essential workers are included in phase 1b, but only those considered to be \"frontline,\" meaning those who regularly interact with and are exposed to the public as part of their duties. Examples of frontline essential workers include police and firefighters, public transit workers, and grocery store workers. Phase 1c includes \"other essential workers,\" which in addition to those in the water and wastewater sector also captures workers in the IT and communications, energy, and finance sectors, among others. Both phases also include seniors, with individuals 75 and older in phase 1b and individuals 65 to 74 in phase 1c. Phase 1c also includes people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions. As WaterISAC has previously noted, although the federal government is issuing recommendations for vaccine allocations, ultimately these decisions are left to state and local governments. WaterISAC reiterates its recommendation (including that from [the December 10 Security & Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-waterisac-reiterates-recommendation-discuss-vaccine-priority)), as well as that of the Water Sector Coordinating Council (whose letter on the matter has been posted below as resource #43), that water and wastewater utilities discuss the vaccine prioritization status of their workers with their respective state and local health departments. In other COVID-19 updates: - The CDC advisory committee decided to recommend specific groups for vaccine allocation, to include creating a distinction between \"frontline\" and \"other\" essential workers, because of the limited supply of vaccines. Given the limitations, \"difficult choices have to be made,\" said Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a committee member. \"Front-line workers in particular are unable to work from home and have a high level of interaction with the public or others in the workplace,\" she added.

The authorization of a second vaccine should vastly expand the reach of COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, the Moderna vaccine should be available in more locations than the previously-authorized Pfizer vaccine because it doesn't require super-cold freezer storage.

The officials say models suggest the variant may be up to 70 percent more transmissible and may be responsible for a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in parts of the country in recent weeks. There is no strong evidence that the variant causes more severe cases, at least not yet. And experts have said the current COVID-19 vaccines should be effective against the variant. Still, the situation in the UK raised alarm around the world, with many nations barring or imposing restrictions on travelers from the country. Speaking about the development, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the new variant is likely in the U.S. \"We have to make that assumption [that it has arrived in the U.S.]\" said Fauci. \"When you see something that is pretty prevalent in a place like the U.K...I would not be surprised if it's already here. When we start to look for it we're gonna find it,\" he explained.

Among those who are hesitant to get a COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons are worries about possible side effects (59 percent cite this as a major reason), lack of trust in the government to ensure the vaccines' safety and effectiveness (55 percent), concerns that the vaccine is too new (53 percent), and concerns over the role of politics in the development process (51 percent). Still, the share of the public willing to get vaccinated has increased, with about 71 percent now saying they would definitely or probably get the vaccine, an improvement from September when that number stood at 63 percent. - State leaders quoted in [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/getting-covid-vaccines-to-people-will-cost-states-billions-they-dont-have-11607855400)said they are billions short in funding needed to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine to Americans who want to be immunized by June. They said additional funding is needed to hire medical workers, do community outreach, set up vaccination clinics, and ensure proper storage for the vaccines. - Have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and/or getting vaccinated?

The full statement from the WSCC has been posted below as resource #43 (scroll to the list of documents near the bottom of this page). The WSCC's statement echoes WaterISAC's previous guidance to its members, with an initial recommendation in the [September 17 Security & Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-strategy-hurricane-and-wildfire) and the latest in the [December 10 Security & Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-waterisac-reiterates-recommendation-discuss-vaccine-priority). In its messaging, WaterISAC has pointed to federal government planning and guidance documents that support the prioritization of the water and wastewater sector for vaccine allocation, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [COVID-19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/downloads/COVID-19-Vaccination-Program-Interim_Playbook.pdf) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's [Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce). However, final distribution strategies are left to state and local governments, and WaterISAC once again encourages its members to contact their health departments to ensure the water and wastewater sector is included in their plans. The documents referenced above and other materials posted to this webpage can assist utilities in preparing for these conversations. December 10, 2020 [A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel is expected to vote](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/covid-19-hospitalizations-hit-record-high-us-braces-new-surge) today on whether Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate should be approved. If it votes in favor of approval, it will likely lead the FDA to authorize the vaccine within days and the first doses to be administered in the U.S. next week. Health care personnel and long-term care facility residents are likely to get these first doses, as was recommended by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel last week. Although the panel has yet to vote on the vaccine prioritizations for other groups, it is likely that it will recommend essential workers (including those at \"utilities\") for phase two. While the federal government can make recommendations about vaccine prioritization, these decisions are ultimately up to the states. And when it comes to workers and who among them are \"essential\" and should be prioritized for vaccines, there are some differences in interpretation among the states, [as some companies and industry groups are reported to have found](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-patchwork/as-u-s-companies-push-to-get-workers-vaccinated-states-disagree-on-whos-essential-idUSKBN28I2OD). The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which worked with partner groups across all critical infrastructure sectors to create the [Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce) (now in version four), has indicated it is working with states to help inform their vaccine prioritization decisions. To further inform these decisions and help ensure water and wastewater workers are given the appropriate status, WaterISAC encourages it members to contact their state and local health departments on this issue. WaterISAC initially recommended this in its [September 17 Security & Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-strategy-hurricane-and-wildfire), when it pointed to CISA's guidance as a reference for helping to inform these discussions. - The National Governors Association (NGA) has published [a report](https://www.nga.org/center/publications/supporting-equitable-distribution-covid-19-vaccines/)to help support an equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, presenting key themes, strategies, and challenges across state and territorial plans. As part of preparing this report, the NGA worked with the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and the COVID Collaborative to conduct a qualitative analysis of all publicly available state and territorial COVID-19 vaccination plans. The analysis aims to support identification of key issues and promote sharing of promising practices across the country. - USA Today published [an article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/08/operation-warp-speed-covid-19-vaccine-distribution/3850884001/)discussing the federal government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution process, based on a discussion with the lead of supply, production, and distribution for Operation Warp Speed. Among other details, the vaccine will be shipped to all 50 states and outlying U.S. territories within 24 hours following the FDA's authorization. Additionally, the federal government plans to only ship half of all vaccine available each week. The other half will be held in storage and be released just before the second dose is due for those vaccinated the first time. - President Trump signed [an Executive Order (EO)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-ensuring-access-united-states-government-covid-19-vaccines/)on Tuesday stating that Americans should have priority access to vaccines developed in the U.S. or procured by the U.S. government. The EO goes on to say that once the country's vaccination needs have been met, the U.S. will facilitate international access to its vaccines. Nations Security Advisor Robert O'Brien issued [a statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-national-security-advisor-robert-c-obrien-120820/)following the EO providing further explanation and background. [A new surge of COVID-19 activity related to Thanksgiving gatherings](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/covid-19-hospitalizations-hit-record-high-us-braces-new-surge)may be starting to show, with a record 104,600 people in the hospital for COVID-19 infections reported earlier this week. Additionally, [more than 200,000 Americans are now testing positive for COVID-19 each day](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/us-total-tops-15-million-covid-19-surge-expands), on average. December 8, 2020 CDC Recommends Indoor Mask-Wearing When Not at Home, and Other COVID-19 Updates The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending \"universal use of face masks,\" which for the first time includes in all indoors settings, with the exception of when people are in their homes (excepting when a member of the household is infected or had a recent potential COVID-19 exposure). The CDC had already recommended mask-wearing in outdoors settings and public spaces. The CDC explained it issued the updated guidance given that the U.S. has entered a high-level transmission phase, with the onset of colder weather, more time spent indoors, and the ongoing holiday season. In the same updated guidance, the CDC addressed other measures for reducing COVID-19 transmission, which include postponing travel plans. Despite the recommendation, experts are anticipating a holiday travel rush. The Sunday after Thanksgiving was the busiest day of air travel in 2020, with more than 1.1 million Americans flying.

In other COVID-19 updates: - What are employers entitled to know about their employees' holiday travel plans, and what measures can they legally take to protect the safety of the workplace? According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, employers generally have wide latitude during a pandemic in what they can ask and do, although the situation varies by state. Permissible actions can include asking workers to take a pledge to refrain from any risky behavior - as some companies did right before Thanksgiving - and cautioning employees against any conduct that would violate federal or local health guidelines. Employers can also discipline workers for what they do during off hours. That could include if workers don't disclose potential exposure to the virus and return to the workplace without quarantining after personal travel or after attending large celebrations. [Read more at the Wall Street Journal.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-boss-can-restrict-your-holiday-plans-in-the-pandemic-11607301504) - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has released a tool designed to help businesses and other organizations plan COVID-19 testing. The COVID-19 Testing Impact Calculator is free, available online, and can be used within organizations to model the costs and benefits of COVID-19 testing strategies. The tool also shows how other CDC-recommended countermeasures, such as masks, contact tracing, and social distancing, can work in concert with testing to keep people safe. Users enter which of these measures are in place in their organization and the tool integrates this information to produce testing recommendations. NIH developed the tool with other organizations, including a team at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [Read more and access the tool at NIH.](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-funded-tool-helps-organizations-plan-covid-19-testing) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released a Preservation Planning Toolkit, which is intended for any PPE-using organization to plan and implement preservation strategies. With the tool, users enter data on their current or prospective PPE use practices. The tool then assists users with understanding types of preservation strategies and provides estimates of positive impacts of those measures in increasing the duration of PPE supplies. [Access the toolkit at HHS.](https://files.asprtracie.hhs.gov/documents/ppepp-toolkit-fact-sheet-hrwg.pdf) - The United Kingdom (U.K.) began delivering the first does of COVID-19 vaccine to its citizens today, using the Pfizer vaccine that was approved for use in the country last week. The U.K. is the first Western country to start a mass vaccination program, with other nations expected to approve vaccines in coming days or weeks, part of a global immunization effort. In the U.S., The Food and Drug Administration will consider Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate on Thursday and Moderna's vaccine candidate on December 17. HHS Secretary Alex Azar expressed optimism Sunday that the vaccine could be authorized \"within days.\" Read the articles at [the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/public-health-england-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-london-719288c35d8ef8815b56b1c9c5fff24c)and [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/fda-to-have-emergency-use-authorization-hearings-for-pfizer-moderna-vaccines). - Pfizer has told the U.S. government it cannot provide substantial additional doses of its COVID-19 vaccine until late June or July because other countries have rushed to buy up most of its supply, according to media reporting. That means the U.S. government may not be able to ramp up as rapidly as it had expected from the 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine that it purchased earlier this year, raising questions about whether it can keep to its aggressive schedule to vaccinate most Americans by late spring or early summer. Government officials denied there would be availability issues in the second quarter, citing other vaccines in the pipeline, such as Moderna's, also expected to be approved in coming weeks. Both vaccines are two-dose regimens, so the 100 million doses purchased of each would cover 50 million people each.

As expected, the group voted that when a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by ACIP, healthcare workers and people in long-term care facilities should be the first to receive vaccinations, as part of phase \"1a\". Before the vote, members also discussed those considered in phases \"1b\" (\"essential workers,\" which includes those at \"Utilities\") and \"1c\" (adults with high-risk medical conditions and who are 65 and older) but decided to take no action until after an upcoming FDA meeting. During that meeting, scheduled for December 10, the FDA will discuss the emergency use authorization request for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate. For this past Tuesday's meeting, ACIP also discussed gating criteria for moving to the next phase.

Additionally, vaccination clinics will report to their state immunization registries what vaccine was given, so that, for example, an entity could run a query if it didn't know where a patient got a first dose. The card will be provided in a vaccine kit that also includes a needle and syringe, alcohol wipes, and a mask.

The CDC begins by emphasizing \"travel can increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19,\" adding \"postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\" If people decide to travel, the CDC recommends they get tested 1 to 3 days before travel, with testing repeated 3 to 5 days after travel. For returning travelers, the CDC recommends they avoid nonessential activities for 7 days after travel for people who were tested, extending the period to 10 days for those who weren't tested. - The World Health Organization has released [a new resource](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/12/staying-safe-and-healthy-this-winter)with tips for staying safe during the winter holidays. The resource consists of a calendar with tips for each day this month, such as a recommendation to stay home if you're feeling unwell and on ways to celebrate without gathering with family and friends. - With predictions of tough months ahead and public health officials encouraging the public to maintain its vigilance, now's a good time to review COVID-19 symptoms. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the highest-frequency symptoms of COVID-19. But other symptoms can include fatigue or muscle aches, headaches, loss or distorted sense of smell or taste, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, and stomach issues.

December 1, 2020 CDC Advisory Committee Holds Meeting on Priority Vaccine Allocation Today, States Continue Efforts to Prepare for Distribution, and Other COVID-19 Updates Today at 2 pm ET, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet to vote on which among a series of priority groups should be the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. During [a meeting last week](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf), ACIP members indicated that healthcare workers and people in long-term care facilities (phase 1a) should be the first to be vaccinated, followed by essential workers (phase 1b, which includes those at \"utilities\") and adults with high-risk medical conditions and those over 65 (phase 1c). But the committee did not vote on those recommendations. The ACIP expected to recommend that those in phase 1a be first in line, and then to make recommendations at later meetings for priority groups in the next phases. Recommendations from the advisory group are sent to CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who also informs Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. If the recommendations are approved, they will become official CDC recommendations on immunization in the U.S. The ACIP typically votes on who should get a vaccine after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved it. The advisory group is meeting today because states want priority group guidance before Friday, when they must submit final details to the federal government on where they want vaccine to be delivered once one is authorized. Ultimately state officials will decide how the doses are distributed, but many have said they plan to follow the federal recommendations.

In other COVID-19 updates: - The initial doses of vaccine will only be enough to cover a fraction of the entire phase 1 population. There are an estimated 21 million healthcare workers, 3 million people in nursing homes, 87 million essential workers, 53 million adults over age 65, and more than 100 million people with high-risk conditions. U.S. officials anticipate that by the end of this year they'll have 40 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which have both submitted for emergency use authorizations (EUAs) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their two-dose vaccine candidates, enough to immunize 20 million people.

Dr. Deborah Birx, who coordinates the White House's COVID-19 task force, said over the weekend that the post-Thanksgiving spike could be worse than what the nation experienced after Memorial Day. She added that people who gathered for Thanksgiving should assume they've been infected and get tested in the next 5 to 10 days. She also urged those who attended gatherings to limit their social contacts, especially with older family members.

The daily travel numbers are among the highest recorded at U.S. airports since the pandemic began in March. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director [Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed concern](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/millions-travel-thanksgiving-cdc-warning/story?id=74364149) that a surge of Thanksgiving travelers could translate to a surge in cases. \"The travel, the congregate setting, not wearing masks, the chances are that you will see a surge superimposed upon a surge. What we're doing now is going to be reflected two, three weeks from now,\" he stated.

The drug maker and the University of Oxford, with whom the company partnered developed the vaccine, said they would submit their data to regulators in Britain, Europe, and Brazil and seek emergency authorization. - People are most likely to pass on COVID-19 within the first five days of having symptoms, [a British study suggests](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55006313). The research indicates patients had the highest levels of virus early on in their illness and \"live\" virus, capable of replicating, was found up to nine days after symptoms began. \"People really need to be supported to make sure they isolate as soon as they get symptoms, however mild. By the time some people get the results of swabs, they may be past their most infectious phase,\" said Dr Muge Cevik, who was involved in the study. November 19, 2020 Vaccine Announcements Continue to Inspire Optimism, but Distribution Questions Remain Yesterday, [Pfizer announced](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine) that its COVID-19 vaccine has 95 percent efficacy, better than the 90 percent noted in its initial announcement last week, and that it will apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming days. It also reported the vaccine demonstrated high efficacy in older adults and helps protect against severe cases, data that had been eagerly awaited by the scientific and public health communities. [Commenting on this development, Michael Osterholm](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/11/pfizer-biontech-note-95-covid-vaccine-efficacy-will-apply-eua), director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (which WaterISAC often looks to for information and analysis of COVID-19 and other public health issues), said he believes Pfizer is likely to receive the EUA. He added that he has complete confidence in the FDA's review and the input of its science advisors and looks forward to guidance on where and how to use the vaccine to come from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's, following recommendations it received from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Osterholm observed that the next task will be to actually deliver the vaccine to the public. \"The number one challenge is no longer research and development; it's how to convert a vaccine into a vaccination.\" In other COVID-19 updates, which are described in further detail on WaterISAC's COVID-19 general webpage: - The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report (posted below as resource #41) saying supply chain issues could interfere with a smooth rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine. The report details the challenges of scaling up mass production of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, including needing to add new manufacturing capacity\u2014or shift capacity from other products\u2014because most was already in use before the pandemic. Even when large quantities of vaccines and drugs are manufactured, they must be sealed in sterile containers in finish-fill facilities, the current scarcity of which could lead to production backlogs. Supplies of products needed for this process, including glass vials and syringes, are also limited. The report cautions that manufacturing supply chains may struggle to keep up with demand because of coronavirus-related disruptions such as changes in worker availability, fluctuating demands for certain products, and some countries' export restrictions.

Yes, according to the legal experts interviewed for one article. Whether they should is a different matter, given that federal protections could allow for some exceptions and the possibility of workers' compensation claims and public relations problems. Some of the other suggested approaches include allowing workers to get the vaccine on company time, having senior leadership promote that they got the vaccine, and engaging the union (if applicable) to promote the shot.

As the report describes, before the pandemic remote work was reserved for just seven percent of the workforce. In a matter of weeks, COVID-19 forced virtually every industry, employer, and worker to transform their approach to work. This report seeks to outline the positive and negative trade-offs of remote work for employers and employees. It also intends to improve the collective understanding of the existing research on remote work and some of the immediate impacts of COVID-19. - COVID-19 has led to a movement among architects and building standards professionals over how to promote healthy conditions indoors, where viruses could thrive and threaten occupants. Months into the pandemic, designers are tracking changes in how people interact with buildings and trying to see how they can help make the indoors healthier. Design tweaks could start with a user's entry into a building, through vestibules and queuing areas to facilitate temperature checks or social distancing. Architects are also incorporating one-way doors and hallways, spreading workstations farther apart, deploying touchless technologies, and upgrading air-filtration systems.

The CDC added that these cases could include when cessation of operation of a facility may cause serious harm or danger to public health or safety. This guidance as posted to CDC's updated \"COVID-19 Critical Infrastructure Sector Response Planning\" webpage, which also notes that all workers should wear a mask in accordance with guidance from CDC, OSHA, and state and local authorities. In other COVID-19 updates: - With significant increases in COVID-19 cases across the nation, many states and cities are reimposing or instituting new measures to slow the spread of the disease. Some states are halting phased reopening plans or imposing new coronavirus-related restrictions. Several are putting limits on social gatherings, adding states to travel quarantine lists, mandating face masks and encouraging residents to stay home, as many did in the spring. Others are restricting business hours of operation and limiting restaurant capacity. Thirty-five states - plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico - now require people to wear face coverings in public statewide.

The news comes a week after Pfizer announced its vaccine demonstrated 90 percent efficacy in a phase 3 trial involving more than 44,000 volunteers. Like the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine will also require cold storage, which experts have noted could pose problems for distribution. But while the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at -94\u00b0F, the Moderna vaccine needs to be stored at -4\u00b0F and is stable for 30 days at refrigerator temperatures (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Even with the positive news about both vaccine candidates, it's likely to be several months before large segments of the population can get vaccinated.

In previous guidance, the CDC noted the main benefit of mask wearing was to help prevent infected people from spreading the virus to others. \"You protect others, their mask protects you, and your mask also protects you,\" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaking about the new guidance. The CDC cites a number of studies that support the updated guidance and discusses the efficacy of different materials for cloth face masks. It emphasizes that those composed of multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts demonstrated superior performance. In other COVID-19 updates: - State governments' COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans show many are not ready to deliver the shots when they're available, according to a review by ProPublica. As reported on in the Tuesday Security and Resilience Update, Pfizer revealed that its vaccine may be 90 percent effective, making it a leading candidate. However, the Pfizer vaccine is unusually difficult to ship and store. It is administered in two doses given 28 days apart, has to be stored at temperatures of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and will be delivered in dry ice-packed boxes holding 1,000 to 5,000 doses. ProPublica found health officials haven't figured out how to get the ultracold doses to critical populations living far from cities. And needing to use 1,000 doses within a few days may be fine for large hospital systems or mass vaccination centers. But it could rule out sending the vaccine to providers who don't treat that many people, even doctors' offices in cities.

Sixty-seven of 128 participants (52.3 percent) reported fatigue, a common symptom of acute COVID-19 infection, a median of 10 weeks after recovery, while 54 (42.2 percent) said they had recovered their full health. Additionally, nearly a third of the participants hadn't returned to work. Before their illness, 105 participants (82 percent) had worked outside the home, but 33 (31 percent) of them still had not returned to employment by the time of study participation. \"This is of particular concern, given that it is recommended that post-viral infection return to work should take place after four weeks to prevent deconditioning,\" the researchers wrote.

As described on the main \"Wastewater Surveillance\" webpage, the CDC has initiated the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies throughout the federal government. The CDC adds that it is currently developing a portal for state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to submit wastewater testing data into a national database for use in summarizing and interpreting data for public health action. The webpage also includes a \"How do I become engaged in NWSS?\" section. [Access the webpage at the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/wastewater-surveillance.html) The main webpage also linkes to the following CDC webpages on this topic: [Sampling Strategy: Where, How, and What to Sample](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/wastewater-surveillance/developing-a-wastewater-surveillance-sampling-strategy.html) [Public Health Interpretation and Use](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/wastewater-surveillance/public-health-interpretation.html) [Targated Wastewater Surveillance at Facilities, Institutions, and Workplaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/wastewater-surveillance/wastewater-workplaces.html) WaterISAC has reported on the use of wastewater to measure the spread of COVID-19 in communities. As discussed in the [June 23 Security and Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-cyber-threat-briefing-tomorrow-blueleaks-and-australian-copy-paste), [the Water Research Foundation (WRF) published a report](https://wrf.informz.net/WRF/data/images/COVID%20Summit%20Docs/COVID-19_SummitHandout-v3b.pdf) on recommendations of global experts on this topic. In the [June 9 Security and Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-covid-19-updates-lookback-groups-targeting-utilities-more), it described how [some wastewater utilities in the U.S. have been participating in the early stages of efforts](https://www.theverge.com/21283825/sewer-systems-coronavirus-seawge-data-warning-signs-cities) to track the levels of coronavirus in their areas. And in the [April 16 Security and Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-covid-19s-financial-impact-sector-cisa-alerts-north-korea-and), it discussed [Australia's use of this technology](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-australia-sewage/australia-to-detect-coronavirus-spread-by-testing-raw-sewage-idUSKCN21Y0RI). October 22, 2020 Earlier this week, the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, published an article on the role of water infrastructure in the response and recovery to the ongoing COVD-19 pandemic, noting its \"importance to health, hygiene, and safety has never been more obvious.\" However, it also describes some of the challenges facing water infrastructure and the communities it serves, and how these have been highlighted because of the pandemic. While emphasizing that state and local leaders mostly understand these challenges, it calls on more action to be taken at the federal level, with water being elevated to core issue as part of driving a lasting recovery. Some of the solutions proposed in the article include increased technical and financial support for customer assistance programs and embracing the digital transition of water systems, such as with advanced metering infrastructure. [Read the article at the Brookings Institution.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/10/20/the-hidden-role-of-water-infrastructure-in-driving-a-covid-19-recovery/) Yesterday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance that expands the pool of people considered at risk of contracting the COVID-19 by changing the definition of who is a \"close contact\" of an infected individual. The CDC previously defined a close contact as someone who spent at least 15 consecutive minutes within six feet of a confirmed coronavirus case. It now defines [a close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) as someone who was within six feet of an infected individual for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. The change is likely to have its biggest impact in schools, workplaces and other group settings where people are in contact with others for long periods of time. [Read an article about the change at the Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/21/coronavirus-close-contact-cdc/) October 6, 2020 On Friday, the National Academies released the final Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine, presenting its criteria for what it believes should be used to set priorities for equitable distribution among groups of potential vaccine recipients. The Framework identifies a four-phased approach to vaccine allocation, with high-risk health workers, first responders, and individuals who are at heightened risk for COVID-19 in the first phase. Water and wastewater utilities fall in the second phase, which includes \"critical workers in high-risk settings - workers who are in industries essential to the functioning of society and at substantially higher risk of exposure.\" See the top of page 3-30, which identifies \"workers in the utilities sector\" and specifically lists the water sector as an example. The intent with the final Framework is that it be provided to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to assist with the creation and implementation of national and/or local guidelines for COVID-19 vaccine allocation. [Access the report at The National Academies.](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/a-framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-vaccine-for-the-novel-coronavirus?utm_source=NASEM+News+and+Publications&utm_campaign=23c0d36757-Vaccine_Allocation_Webinar_2020_09_30&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_96101de015-23c0d36757-102879829&goal=0_96101de015-23c0d36757-102879829&mc_cid=23c0d36757&mc_eid=0c0457ad9a#sectionProjectScope) This is the second in a set of strategies requested or authored by the federal government regarding allocation of a COVID-19 vaccine. As WaterISAC reported on in its [September 17 Security and Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-strategy-hurricane-and-wildfire), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released two documents outlining [the federal government's strategy for distributing a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/09/16/trump-administration-releases-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-strategy.html). The documents include [an interim playbook](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/downloads/COVID-19-Vaccination-Program-Interim_Playbook.pdf) that indicates critical infrastructure workers should be considered by jurisdictions when making decisions about vaccination priority. September 17, 2020 Yesterday the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released two documents outlining [the federal government's strategy for distributing a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/09/16/trump-administration-releases-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-strategy.html). The documents, developed in coordination with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provide a strategic distribution overview along with [an interim playbook](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/downloads/COVID-19-Vaccination-Program-Interim_Playbook.pdf) for state, tribal, territorial, and local public health programs and their partners on how to plan and operationalize a vaccination response to COVID-19 within their respective jurisdictions. In \"Section 4: Critical Populations,\" specifically on page 14, the playbook indicates that critical infrastructure workers should be considered by jurisdictions when making decisions about vaccination priority. It refers to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA's) [Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce), which includes workers in the water and wastewater sector. The playbook also references CDC's [Roadmap to Implementing Pandemic Influenza Vaccination of Critical Workforce](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/roadmap_panflu.pdf), which provides additional information and tools for state and local planners on how to operationalize and implement specific plans for targeting critical workforce groups. Although this information is specific to an influenza pandemic, the playbook indicates that it may help to inform the COVID-19 vaccination planning for critical workforces. Given the release of the strategy, WaterISAC recommends its members contact their appropriate health departments to discuss their COVID-19 vaccine priority status. Both CDC's Roadmap and CISA's Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce (also available here) may help to inform these discussions and ensure water and wastewater workers are given the appropriate status. September 10, 2020 HHS Issues Guidance on COVID-19 Vaccine Access while CDC Announces End of Enhanced Screenings for International Travelers; Studies on COVID-19-related Impacts to Mental and Financial Health HHS Guidance Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) [issued guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/09/09/trump-administration-takes-action-to-expand-access-to-covid-19-vaccines.html) under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) to expand access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines when they are made available. This guidance authorizes state-licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 vaccinations to persons ages three or older, subject to certain requirements. \"Allowing pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 vaccines will greatly expand convenient access for the American people,\" said Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett P. Giroir. Vaccine Update: There are numerous candidate COVID-19 vaccines being developed in the U.S. and around the world. Both the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) and [STAT](https://www.statnews.com/feature/coronavirus/drugs-vaccines-tracker/), an online health and medicine journal, are tracking the progress of these candidates. Yesterday STAT published [an exclusive report](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/) on a recent decision by AstraZeneca to pause the phase three trials of its vaccine following the unexplained illness in a participant. The participant received the vaccine rather than the placebo, and AstraZeneca said the pause and investigation are standard whenever there is an unexplained illness, which can happen by chance in large clinical trials. CDC Announcement Also yesterday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [announced](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s-0909-covid-19-entry-strategy-air-passengers.html) that beginning on September 14, the U.S. government will remove requirements for directing all flights carrying airline passengers arriving from, or recently had a presence in, certain countries to land at one of 15 designated airports and halt enhanced entry health screening for these passengers. Currently, enhanced entry health screening is conducted for those arriving from, or with recent presence in, China, Iran, the Schengen region of Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Brazil. The CDC explained symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms. It added that resources will instead be dedicated to more effective mitigation efforts that focus on the individual passenger, including, pre-departure, in-flight, and post-arrival health education, among other measures. COVID-19's Impacts on Mental and Financial Health While much of the attention has been on COVID-19's costs on human life, in terms of cases and deaths, two recently published reports reflect on the disease's other impacts. [A study recently published in the medical journal JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770146) indicates that more than a quarter of American adults are experiencing COVID-19-related symptoms of depression. Financial pressures as a result of the pandemic are thought to be the main factor for the rise. And according to the results of [a poll conducted by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/09/909669760/npr-poll-financial-pain-from-coronavirus-pandemic-much-much-worse-than-expected?utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=33004), at least half of households in four major U.S. cities reported serious financial problems triggered by the pandemic, and more than half report serious problems caring for their children. The results also showed these effects are falling heaviest on households with annual incomes below $100,000 and in Black and Latino families. September 3, 2020 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent planning documents to public health agencies around the country last week discussing preparations for two COVID-19 vaccines. Although the CDC referred only to a \"Vaccine A\" and \"Vaccine B,\" the technical details it provided, including the time between doses and storage temperatures, match well with the two vaccines furthest along in U.S. clinical tests, made by Moderna and Pfizer. Both companies are currently testing their candidates in Phase 3 trials. Normally, vaccine makers would wait for clinical trials to yield definitive results before moving forward with manufacturing. This time, many manufacturers have begun preparing in advance for production, and the CDC told public health agencies last week that limited doses may be available beginning in late October or November. The CDC's planning documents indicate the extraordinary complexity of distributing vaccines to hundreds of millions of people. In its documents, the CDC said certain groups would have priority, beginning with health care workers, essential workers, \"national security populations,\" and employees and residents of long-term care facilities.

The framework was commissioned by the National Institutes of Health and the CDC. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent panel of the CDC, will take the recommendations developed through the framework into account as it formulate its own recommendations for the CDC.

September 1, 2020 Two scientific studies published late last week provide further evidence for the airborne spread of COVID-19 and the importance of effective ventilation systems. One study found that patients can exhale millions of viral RNA particles per hour in the early stages of disease, and the second tied an outbreak affecting 81 percent of residents and 50 percent of healthcare workers at a Dutch nursing home to inadequate ventilation. For the second, a letter accompanying the research was written in support of a study published on July 6 warning of the hazards of airborne COVID-19 transmission in poorly ventilated environments.

August 20, 2020 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) has released version 4.0 of its Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce. For this version, there are no changes to the \"Water and Wastewater\" section, which identifies the types of workers needed to operate and maintain the sector's infrastructure. Central to the value of the guidance in the early months of the pandemic was the discrete problem it was intended to support solutions for - enabling essential workers to work during COVID-19-related community restrictions. CISA's assessment is that, for the most part, essential workers are able to work, and it that what is now most important is that essential workers are able to work in a safe environment. To support this, it offers a series of worker risk mitigation strategies for consideration. These include creating a risk categorization methodology for worker safety and determining the allocation of scarce resources for workers, such as PPE, other protection, access to medical evaluation, testing, and vaccines, among other strategies. This section of the document also includes links to other resources that provide additional guidance on health, workplace, and worker safety issues related to the pandemic. [Read the guidance at CISA.](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce) In addition to the hyperlink embedded above, the latest version of the guidance has been posted to this webpage as resource #38. August 18, 2020 Researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) say they've found the symptoms of COVID-19 tend to appear in a specific order: fever, cough and muscle pain, then nausea and/or vomiting, then diarrhea. Knowing the order of COVID-19's symptoms may help patients seek care promptly or decide promptly to self-isolate, they researchers say. It also could help doctors rule out other illnesses or plan how to treat patients. The researchers' findings may prove useful for the upcoming flu season, helping medical professionals differentiate between cases of that illness and COVID-19. \"This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,\" said USC Professor Peter Kuhn. \"Doctors can determine what steps to take to care for the patient, and they may prevent the patient's condition from worsening.\" To discover the sequence, the USC researchers examined data from more than 55,000 confirmed cases in China, collected from February 16 to 24. And to compare the order of COVID-19 symptoms to flu, the researchers examined data from 2,470 cases in North America, Europe, and the Southern Hemisphere that were reported to health authorities from 1994 to 1998. Their findings were recently published in the journal [Frontiers in Public Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00473/full). [Read the press release at USC.](https://news.usc.edu/174346/covid-19-symptoms-usc-research-fever-cough/) August 13, 2020 There were 1,470 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. yesterday, the highest single-day total yet in August. With the exception of three days this summer, Wednesday's death total was the country's highest since late May. The figure was higher on each of those three days because of single states reporting large numbers of backlogged deaths from unspecified days. For the past two weeks, the U.S. has averaged more than 1,000 deaths per day, more than twice as many as in early July.

[The first report is from the Johns Hopkins University](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200729-resetting-our-response.pdf)(also posted below as resource #35), which offers policy actions at the federal, state, and local levels to gain control of the pandemic. The recommended actions in the report pertain to non-pharmaceutical interventions, PPE supply chains, and testing and contact tracing, among other topics. The report's authors emphasize that leaders and stakeholders at all levels will need to contribute their commitment, technical expertise, insights, and funding to make these proposed actions possible. [The Association of American Medical Colleges published the next report](https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2020-07/aamc-covid-19-way-forward-road-map.pdf)(also posted below as resource #36), presents a roadmap for containing the coronavirus and ending the pandemic with measures that include addressing critical shortages, reopening schools safely, and prioritizing the distribution of a vaccine. It also identifies longer-term actions to protect and strengthen public health, reduce health disparities, and improve the overall health of the nation. [The third and final report was published by the National Governors' Association](https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/State-Guide-for-Preparing-the-Future-Workforce_2020.pdf)(also posted below as resource #37). It doesn't offer recommendations for how to end the pandemic, but it does provide insights and considerations for policy makers as they seek to make workforces resilient to the disruptions. The report was actually written before the pandemic began, but the authors observe the new context reinforces their findings and underscores the urgency of the transformations that should be implemented as part of a systemwide, resilient education and workforce development agenda. In other COVID-19 news, the has updated its [guidance on face masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html), warning that those with valves or vents do not prevent the wearer from spreading the disease to others. August 11, 2020 On Thursday, the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rescinded their global advisories recommending U.S. citizens avoid all international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the decision removed blanket recommendations to avoid all international travel, the Department of State and CDC still encourage citizens not engage in non-essential travel to much of the world through their respective systems that list threats and recommendations by country. For the U.S. Department of State, it advises all U.S. citizens to read the country-specific [Travel Advisories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/) and [U.S. Embassy COVID pages](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html) for updates on the impact of COVID-19 worldwide. For the CDC, it has published a \" [COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination\" webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html), which depicts COVID-19 risk levels in each country. The webpage complements the CDC's [Travel Health Notices webpage](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices), established to inform travelers about current health issues that impact travelers' health, like disease outbreaks in specific international destinations. The CDC has also recently updated its [\"Travel during the COVID-19 Pandemic\" webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), which provides numerous recommendations and considerations when traveling. Here the CDC reminds the public that travel increases chances of getting and spreading COVID-19 and that staying home is the best way to protect oneself and others from COVID-19. It also recommends people avoid travel if they're sick or if they've been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days. WaterISAC has become aware of the following COVID-19 resources that may be useful to members as they respond to the pandemic: - The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published a [\"Science & Tech Spotlight\" on contact tracing apps](https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708405.pdf), which may be helpful to members conducting or participating in contact tracing. - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its COVID-19 dashboard with the following new or revised toolkits: July 28, 2020 CDC Revises Guidance on Isolation Period for Most COVID-19 Cases The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently issued revised guidance based on its assessment that most people with COVID-19 are no longer infectious 10 days after they begin having symptoms. As a result, the CDC discourages people from getting tested a second time after they recover. \"For most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms,\" the CDC says. For people who have tested positive but don't have symptoms, \"isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\" There are exceptions for the 10-day guidance, including people with compromised immune systems who may be infectious for a longer period of time. Additionally, the recommendation of 10 days is specifically for those who test positive for the coronavirus and have been asked to self-isolate. It doesn't apply to people who need to quarantine to keep from possibly spreading the virus. The incubation period for the virus is 14 days, health experts say, so anyone who has been exposed to the virus would need to quarantine to see if they become sick. Read [the guidance at the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html) and [an article about the guidance at NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-changes-covid-19-guidance-how-long-patients-need-be-n1234883). Final Stage Testing of First U.S. Vaccine Candidate Begins Yesterday, final-stage testing of a COVID-19 vaccine began. Also referred to as the phase 3 trial, this stage involves 30,000 volunteers at 89 sites across the country receiving shots of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine candidate (half of the volunteers will receive a placebo). After volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is rapidly spreading. The answer probably won't come until November or December, cautioned the National Institute of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci. Don't expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97 percent of measles infections, Dr. Fauci said, who added he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that's 60 percent effective. If Moderna's candidate is successful, it will mark the fastest vaccine development timeline in history. Modern's vaccine is the first U.S. vaccine to enter phase 3 trials, but at least three more are soon to follow. All are part of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed, which has set the goal of producing, manufacturing, and distributing an effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus by 2021.

For more on this topic, the New York Times is maintaining a [Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html). July 23, 2020 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently posted a webpage discussing COVID-19 in rural communities, which could be a useful resource for water and wastewater utilities in these areas. The webpage includes a section discussing why rural communities may be at higher risk for COVID-19, influenced by factors like the health of populations, the healthcare infrastructure, and the presence of agricultural and food processing industries in such places. On the webpage the CDC also describes the approaches that can be taken by businesses and workplaces and residents, among other groupings, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Among its recommendations the CDC encourages the use of face coverings, as well as other COVID-19 prevention behaviors, to limit exposure to the virus. [Access the webpage at the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations/rural-communities.html#why-higher-risk) Given the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the country, there have been increasing calls for face coverings to be worn in public places. Some state and local government leaders have issued face covering mandates. And on Tuesday, [President Trump encouraged Americans to wear face coverings](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-coronavirus-face-mask-get-worse/), saying that \"they have an impact,\" adding that the COVID-19 situation \"will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better.\" On the topic of face coverings, WaterISAC has found two recent resources that may be helpful to members: - Dr. Michael Osterholm, the Director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (a site regularly referenced by WaterISAC), published [a commentary](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/07/commentary-my-views-cloth-face-coverings-public-preventing-covid-19)on face masks yesterday. He emphasized his support for wearing face masks while also advocating for other protective steps, like physical distancing. - Additionally, [an article](https://www.securityinformed.com/insights/enforcing-face-masks-confrontation-bias-co-14733-ga.1595409926.html?utm_source=SSc%20International%20Edition&utm_medium=Redirect&utm_campaign=International%20Redirect%20Popup)from Security Informed addresses how organizations can enforce face covering requirements, such as by their employees and customers, without confrontation or bias. As noted in the article, there have been violent confrontations between individuals charged with enforcing these requirements and others. WaterISAC has also posted numerous resources regarding face coverings and other protective measures to its COVID-19 general webpage. These include a link to CDC resources and information, including its [main face covering webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). July 21, 2020 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has just released the COVID-19 Recovery CISA Tabletop Exercise Package (CTEP), a compilation of instructions and templates to help organizations conduct their own exercise regarding COVID-19 recovery. The CTEP materials include an exercise planner handbook, an exercise brief slide deck, and an after-action report/improvement plan, among others. The intent of the CTEP is to assist critical infrastructure owners and operators in assessing their recovery and business continuity plans and addressing key questions. The CTEP also provides organizations the opportunity to discuss how ongoing recovery efforts are impacted by a potential \"second wave\" of COVID-19 infections. [Access the CTEP at CISA.](https://www.cisa.gov/covid-19-recovery-ctep) CISA has also advised its partners of another resource that may be helpful in their COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, the Communications Sector Coordinating Council's [Return to Normal: Guidance and Resources for Communications Providers](https://www.ustelecom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CSCC-Return-to-Normal-Guidance-and-Resources.pdf) (also posted below as resource #34). Although specifically tailored to the communications sector, the information and advice provided in this resource can be useful to other critical infrastructure, including water and wastewater utilities. It contains sections on key planning questions and considerations, employee testing protocols, workplace social distancing, use of PPE, and distancing and cleaning in common eating and break areas, among others. This resource is similar to another COVID-19 resource WaterISAC has promoted in its Security and Resilience Updates and on its COVID-19 general webpage, the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council's Assessing and Mitigating the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (posted below as resource #10). CISA/FEMA Broad Stakeholder Call Information The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are continuing to convene Broad Stakeholder Calls, which are open to critical infrastructure operators and other stakeholders. They are being held every Tuesday 3:00 to 4:15 pm ET until futher notice. Beginning in July, the calls will only be held every-other Tuesdays - the next call is on August 4.

The malicious website infects visitors with the AZORult Trojan, an information stealing program that can exfiltrate sensitive data. - As individuals and organizations try to get a sense of the degree of COVID-19 spread in the communities, [a series of new, online tools](https://globalepidemics.org/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression/)built by researchers and public health experts, including from the Harvard Global Health Institute, may be of assistance. The tools include a risk-assessment map that allows people to check the state or the county where they live and see a COVID-19 risk rating of green, yellow, orange or red. The risk levels are based upon the number of new daily cases per 100,000 people. There are other important metrics when it comes to tracking the spread and severity of COVID-19. But the group settled on tying the alert level to numbers of new cases per 100,000, noting it's a good indicator to show the current picture of outbreaks and compare them in a consistent way. \"It allows you to compare a rural area in upstate New York compared to New York City and have an apples-to-apples comparison for relative impact and relative caseload,\" says Ellie Graeden of Talus Analytics and the Center for Global Health, Science and Security at Georgetown University, which is part of the group.

[Exercise Starter Kit](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/188077)(FEMA) - This resource is intended for organizations to convene their own workshops on reconstitution, or the process of returning to full operations, during COVID-19. The kit includes a sample facilitator guide and conduct slides that present suggested discussion questions focused on four themes: people, facilities, messaging and communications, and resources and logistics. The suggested questions build upon the White House's guidance for employers in the [Guidelines for Opening Up America Again](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/)and FEMA's [Planning Considerations for Organizations in Reconstituting Operations during the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/30/planning-considerations-organizations-reconstituting-operations-during-covid)(in addition to the links included for each document, they are also posted below as resources #21 and 27). All of the kit's materials, including the questions, are designed and intended to be adapted and customized to an organization's own needs. The intended outcome from the workshop is a roadmap for a reconstitution plan tailored to an organization. - FEMA has also launched a series of [four new COVID-19 training videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL9Peb5GtV2Dg6IVhGzxZOKsErarpasdd)through its Center for Domestic Preparedness. While the content in most of these is tailored to healthcare professionals, some of it can be useful for a general audience and could be used by an organization providing employees with a baseline of information about COVID-19. The first video, for example, offers an overview of the virus and discusses symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. - FEMA has also launched a series of [All-Hazards Preparedness Exercise Starter Kit](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/188454)(FEMA) - The intent of this tool, as well as with the Exercise Starter Kit discussed above, is to facilitate discussions, validate planning, and identify and address gaps. With the release of this tool, FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor encouraged his audience to review their plans, to include for emergency operations, continuity, resource management, mutual aid, logistics, public information, and recovery against the ongoing COVID-19 response. - CDC Activities and Initiatives Supporting the COVID-19 Response and the President's Plan for Opening American Up Again (CDC) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a document containing information intended to be helpful for businesses as they consider and make reopening decisions and actions. The document contains an \"Interim Guidance for Employers with Workers at High Risk\" section that encourages businesses to keep in mind as they gradually scale up their operations that some workers are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. The CDC lays out a series of three steps that are intended to inform decisions and actions as organizations scale up their operations. It also identifies the actions it recommends organizations take as part of these steps, such as intensifying cleaning, disinfection, and ventilation; having a plan for when employees become sick; and being prepared to scale down operations based on state and local health department notices or if there are COVID-19 cases in the workplace. This resource is available at the CDC [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/index.html). It has also been posted below as resource #31.

[Errands and Going Out](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/going-out.html)(CDC) - While utilities can do much to reduce the spread of COVID-19 at the workplace to promote safety and business continuity, there is also the risk that employees will contract the disease elsewhere in their communities. This is an increasingly important consideration given that reopening is underway across the U.S. and public life in many places is returning to a semblance of normalcy. Information and guidance provided via the CDC's could be provided to employees to assist them in making risk-informed decisions. This resource links to other webpages that discuss topics like: [Deciding to Go Out](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/activities.html), which includes a series of questions individuals can ask themselves to help determine their risk, a list of frequently asked questions, and special considerations for certain settings (such as banks, restaurants, and gatherings); [Using Transportation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/using-transportation.html), which discusses general principles to adhere to for all modes, but also for specific settings (including public transportation); and [Running Errands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html), which provides tips for safely engaging in activities like grocery shopping and getting gas. - The resource also links to webpages for [Doctor Visits and Getting Medicines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/doctor-visits-medicine.html), [Visiting Parks [Wearing CDC webpage, [Considerations of Events and Gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html), offers considerations for enhancing protection at venues to prevent the spread of COVID-19. - [Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Use](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/information-maintaining-or-restoring-water-quality-buildings-low-or-no-use)(EPA) - EPA has posted two documents regarding recommended actions to be taken by building owners and managers to address building water quality prior to reopening. The first document contains lists of actions for building owners and managers to take; it also includes steps for public water systems. The second document complements the first by providing a simple checklist of actions. [Guidance for Building Water Systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/building-water-system.html)(CDC) - The CDC published this guidance to help minimize the risk of Legionnaire's disease and other diseases associated with water given that water has likely become stagnant in many buildings, such as those that have been vacated by businesses while social distancing measures are in place. The guidance recommends an eight step process before reopening a building, which includes flushing the water system and maintaining the water system (this step asks readers to consider contacting their local water utility to learn about any recent disruptions in the water supply). [Safely Re-Opening Buildings: General Guidance for Water Utilities](https://cwwa.ca/covid-19-and-the-re-opening-of-buildings/)(Canadian Water and Wastewater Association) - Developed to be used by water and wastewater utilities, this resource is intended to provide advice on steps to take to prepare for increased flushing, recommendations for distributing information to building owners, and guidance on communicating with the public and media. [Safely Reopening Buildings: A Fact Sheet for Building Owners/Operators](https://cwwa.ca/covid-19-and-the-re-opening-of-buildings/)(Canadian Water and Wastewater Association) - Developed to be used by building owners and operators, this resource provides general instruction for flushing and cleaning water systems and links to more detailed resources and guidance. CWWA notes the fact sheet can go out as is, but it encourages utilities to customize it before sending to building owners and operators, adding such details as utility name and logo, chlorine residual levels, and local contacts, among others. - Coronavirus Building Flushing Guidance (The Environmental Science Policy & Research Institute [ESPRI]) - This guidance helps address the issue of building water quality degradation. As noted in the document, when buildings are shut down or used less frequently, as is happening during the current COVID-19 situation, water quality in the buildings can become a serious issue. In addition to discussing how water quality degrades in buildings in these circumstances, the guidance provides a general roadmap for how to flush contaminants from buildings and get plumbing system water quality back to pre-stagnation conditions. This document is posted below as resource #17. - Assessing and Mitigating the Novel Coronavirus (ESCC) - The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council's (ESCC's) guide includes a \"Responsible Re-entry and Return to the Workplace\" section. In this section, the ESCC highlights four strategic priorities for returning to the workplace. Given similarities to the electricity sector, these priorities may also be relevant for water and wastewater utilities. This document is posted below as resource #10. [Distribution of Infrared Thermometers](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/05/26/distribution-infrared-thermometers)(FEMA) - In late May, FEMA announced the federal government is distributing non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to support the reopening of the nation's workplaces. The NCITs are being provided to these governments for further distribution to local authorities and businesses based on current conditions and their individual reopening plans and priorities. Although FEMA notes that these governments will be responsible for distributing NCITs and will have significant flexibility in making their decisions, it has identified considerations for establishing priority. These considerations include workplaces with essential critical workers (based on the DHS CISA's [Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce)), that are currently operating, and that support the reopening of other businesses. FEMA also emphasizes the thermometers should be used in accordance with [CDC guidance for businesses and employers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html)and [OSHA guidance for preparing workplaces](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf)for identifying potentially ill individuals including employees, customers, vendors or other visitors. As FEMA reminds its partners, temperature checks are one important part of an assessment symptom screening process that includes checking for fever. Fever is one of many [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)to reduce social exposure to individuals who may be exhibiting elevated temperature. [Reopening Business Digital Resources Center](https://www.uschamber.com/reopening-business)(U.S. Chamber of Commerce) - The U.S. Chamber has made available an online portal that presents the latest state guidelines, guidance and advice for businesses, and other tools and resources to help employers and employees return to work safely and successfully. It offers a standardized employee screening questionnaire and a customizable workplace flyer for communicating to employees and customers the steps an organization is taking to keep them safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The CO2 used by water utilities is often produced as a byproduct of the ethanol manufacturing process, and with the demand for ethanol having decreased (largely due to the decrease in vehicle driving) some manufacturers have suspended or reduced their operations. At this time, it seems that the water utilities that learned of potential disruptions to their CO2 shipments from their primary vendors were able to switch to alternate companies.

This document is posted below as resource #24. - The Financial Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Drinking Water Utilities (Raftelis for AMWA and AWWA) - The financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis on U.S. water utilities is estimated to exceed $15 billion, according to a new report prepared by Raftelis for the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) ( [read the press release at AMWA](https://www.amwa.net/article/reduction-us-water-utility-revenue-may-result-327-billion-economic-hit)) and the American Water Works Association (AWWA). It estimates drinking water utilities in the U.S. will see revenues from customer payments drop by nearly $14 billion. The impacts result from the elimination of water shutoffs for non-payment, increased late payments due to high unemployment, reductions in non-residential water demands, and fewer new customers. These utilities may also experience additional future revenue losses estimated at approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate as a result of deferrals of planned water rate increases. The drop in revenue will require utilities to scale back projects by as much as $5 billion (annualized) to help manage cash flows due to the crisis. These reductions will have a cascade effect on communities, reducing economic activity by an estimated $32.7 billion and costing 75,000 to 90,000 private sector jobs. The financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis on drinking water and wastewater utilities combined is estimated to exceed $27 billion (the report has also been posted below as resource #20). [Water Utility COVID-19 Financial Impact Tool](https://www.epa.gov/waterfinancecenter/water-utility-covid-19-financial-impact-tool)(EPA) - This tool is intended to help drinking water and wastewater utilities assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their financial health. The tool, an Excel spreadsheet that can be downloaded from EPA's website, walks utilities through a series of questions in the categories of revenues, expenses, and cashflow. The spreadsheet automatically calculates the changes for a utility's revenues and expenses by looking at current 2020 monthly financials versus the average monthly financials of the utility's 2019 audited financial statement. Utilities can use the tool each month to keep a running total of their cashflow. EPA emphasizes that use of the tool is voluntary and results are provided for utilities' information only. Additionally, EPA is not collecting the data entered by utilities or the results. - As noted in a news release announcing the tool, many utilities expect to experience revenue losses due to reduced commercial consumption, households that are unable to pay their bills, and deferred or cancelled rate increases.

As the article highlights, the virus spreads mainly through close-up, person-to-person interactions for extended periods of time. In these settings the virus doesn't simply rely on being spread through sneezing and coughing. It can be transmitted through seemingly benign activities like speaking and breathing that produce respiratory bits of varying sizes that can disperse along air currents and potentially infect people nearby. Additionally, some researchers say the coronavirus can also be transmitted through aerosols, or minuscule droplets that float in the air longer than large droplets. Given what is known about how coronavirus spreads, crowded events, poorly ventilated areas, and places where people are talking loudly increase the risk of infections. The article also notes what the CDC recently acknowledged, that it's not common to contract COVID-19 from a contaminated surface.

The guide is posted below as resource #9. - Assessing and Mitigating the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resource Guide, version 10 - The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC), a liaison body between the federal government and the electric power industry), has published a document that addresses steps to take at different stages of COVID-19 mitigation and response and offers lists of business continuity planning considerations. This guide has evolved significantly from its first version, which WaterISAC reported on in the [March 19 Security and Resilience Update](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/security-resilience-update-member-crowdsourcing-inputs-and-other-covid-19-resources-covid-19). Although this guide is specifically intended for electric utilities, many of the steps and considerations it discusses can be applied by water and wastewater utilities. For example, the \"Sequestration Guidelines and Considerations\" section is relevant to any utility implementing or considering a shelter-in-place programs. Some of the other areas of potential relevance and interest include the example Q&A sections (such as \"Example Q&A for Using a Respirator for COVID-19 Mitigation\" on page 13), \"Scenario Development,\" and \"Social Distancing for Control Center Personnel,\" to name just a few. The guide is posted below as resource #10. [Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19 Response](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce)(DHS CISA) - This memorandum is intended to promote a widespread understanding among state and local officials of the critical role workers in these industries play in sustaining and protecting their communities, including during emergencies. Water and wastewater utilities are specifically identified as one of the critical infrastructure sectors, and the memorandum goes on to identify types of workers for the sector (e.g., operational staff at community water systems and wastewater treatment facilities, workers repairing water and wastewater conveyances and performing required sampling or monitoring, staff and technical support for SCADA and digital systems, and chemical disinfectant suppliers for wastewater and personnel protection). As state and local communities consider COVID-19-related restrictions, this memorandum may assist in critical infrastructure workers being granted appropriate status to go about their duties, such as reporting for work or transiting between work locations. The memorandum is meant only as guidance, not as a federal directive, and it acknowledges that ultimately state and local officials are in charge of implementing and executing response activities in their jurisdictions. Additionally, the memorandum puts responsibility on critical infrastructure partners to use their judgement when balancing safety and the continued delivery of their services. In addition to the accessing the memorandum through the link provided above, it's also posted below as resource #14. - On May 19, DHS released version 3.1 of the guidance (posted below as resource #11). There are two significant changes for the \"Water and Wastewater\" section, which identifies the types of workers needed to operate and maintain the sector's infrastructure. - One, \"Laboratory staff performing water sampling and analysis\" has been added. - And two, the bullet that previously read \"Chemical equipment and personal protection suppliers to water and wastewater system\" has been modified. It now states: \"Suppliers and manufacturers of chemicals, equipment, personal protection equipment, and goods and services for water and wastewater systems.\" - On April 17, DHS released version 3.0 of the guidance (posted below as resource #12). This iteration includes language focused on sustained access and freedom of movement; a reference to the CDC guidance on safety for critical infrastructure workers; and a statement saying sick employees should avoid the workplace and the workforce. In worker categories, all references to \"employees\" or \"contractors\" have been changed to \"workers.\" For the Water and Wastewater section, one small change has been made: \"Chemical and equipment suppliers to water and wastewater systems and personnel protection\" has been changed to \"Chemical equipment and personal protection suppliers to water and wastewater system.\" - On March 28, DHS released version 2.0 of the guidance (posted below as resource #13). This iteration maintains many of the same descriptions of water and wastewater employees and support personnel as the first version, with some modificiations. Specifically: - \"Workers repairing water and wastewater conveyances and performing required sampling and monitoring\" now adds \"including field staff.\" - \"Chemical disinfectant suppliers for wastewater and personnel protection\" has been revised to also include equipment suppliers, as well as suppliers for water systems. It now reads: \"Chemical and equipment suppliers to water and wastewater systems and personnel protection.\" - On May 19, DHS released version 3.1 of the guidance (posted below as resource #11). There are two significant changes for the \"Water and Wastewater\" section, which identifies the types of workers needed to operate and maintain the sector's infrastructure. - The EPA published a template for water utilities to use to provide documentation to state and local authorities that their workers that are considered essential (posted below as resource #16 and also available at EPA [here](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-drinking-water-and-wastewater)). This template complements [the letter](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/wheeler_gov_covid-19_ow_3-27.pdf)that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent to governors on March 27 requesting that water and wastewater workers, as well as the manufacturers and suppliers who provide vital services and materials to the water sector, are considered essential workers and businesses by state authorities when enacting restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19. [Guidance on Essential Services and Functions in Canada during the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/crtcl-nfrstrctr/esf-sfe-en.aspx)(Public Safety Canada) - Public Safety Canada has published its own guidance on critical infrastructure services and functions that are deemed essential to ensure the health, safety, and economic well-being of the population. The water sector is specifically identified in this document, as are types of workers in the sector (e.g., employees and others needed to operate and maintain drinking water and wastewater/drainage infrastructure). This guidance is very similar to the Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers during COVID-19 Response recently published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. [Interim guidance for COVID-19 safety practices for critical infrastructure workers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html)(CDC) - To ensure continuity of operations of essential functions, CDC advises that critical infrastructure workers may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community. According to the CDC, in cases where workers have had an exposure but remain asymptomatic, they and their employers should engage in pre-screening, regular monitoring, wearing a face mask, social distancing, and workplace disinfecting and cleaning. As noted in its discussion of face masks, the CDC says employers can approve employees' supplied face coverings in the event of shortages (its [\"Cloth Face Covers\" webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html)provides recommendations on how to make your own). The CDC states that an employee who becomes sick during their work shift should be sent home immediately and that the surfaces in their workplaces be cleaned and disinfected and a list of persons who had contact with the ill employee compiled. The CDC advises that this guidance should be implemented in conjunction with its previously published [Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html). - Commercial Routing Assistance (CRA) tool (DHS CISA) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Idaho National Laboratory provided this tool, which may be useful to utilities whose employees include truckers or commercial drivers. It is intended to help these workers to understand the restrictions they might encounter as they travel across the country. Commercial Routing Assistance (CRA) tool merges coordinated and vetted data streams, plots multiple automated or custom routing options, and visualizes the wide variety of state regulations and actions that a driver would encounter along a route. With this free tool, commercial operators can plan vehicle movements across multiple states quickly, particularly during emergencies (a fact sheet is posted below as resource #29). Government Declarations - On April 16, the White House released its Opening Up American Again Guidelines (posted below as resource #21). The new guidelines are aimed at clearing the way for an easing of restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while keeping them in place in harder-hit places. The ultimate decisions will remain with governors. - On April 28, the White House released the Blueprint for Testing Plans and Rapid Response Programs (posted below as resource #26), which includes recommendations for states to further develop and implement their testing plans. Also referred to as \"The Blueprint,\" its recommendations are intended to support state development and implementation of testing plans and rapid response plans that were called for in the Opening Up America Again Guidelines. As described on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [\"Testing for COVID-19\" webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html), there are two kinds of tests available for COVID-19: diagnostic tests and antibody blood tests. Diagnostic tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibody blood tests check your blood for antibodies that would show if you have had a previous infection. - On April 28, the White House released the Blueprint for Testing Plans and Rapid Response Programs (posted below as resource #26), which includes recommendations for states to further develop and implement their testing plans. Also referred to as \"The Blueprint,\" its recommendations are intended to support state development and implementation of testing plans and rapid response plans that were called for in the Opening Up America Again Guidelines. As described on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's - On March 26, EPA [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-enforcement-discretion-policy-covid-19-pandemic)a new policy to help address uncertainties regarding EPA enforcement amid the ongoing COVID-19 public health crisis. Public water systems are specifically singled out as \"hav[ing] a heightened responsibility to protect public health because unsafe drinking water can lead to serious illnesses and access to clean water for drinking and handwashing is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Some water and wastewater associations believe that the current policy and how it relates to public water systems is unclear and have reached out to EPA's Office of Water to request further guidance and additional clarification. WaterISAC will keep its members updated as it learns more. - On March 16, President Trump released [COVID-19 guidelines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/coronavirus-guidelines-america/), which emphasized the need for the public to listen to and follow the directions of state and local authorities in his administration released and highlighted best practices for reducing the spread of infections. The guidelines call for people to avoid gathering in groups of more than ten people and to work from home whenever possible. However, the guidelines notes that for those who work in critical infrastructure industry, which although not specifically stated in the document does include the water and wastewater sector, \"you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule.\" - On March 26, EPA announced a new policy to help address uncertainties regarding EPA enforcement amid the ongoing COVID-19 public health crisis. Public water systems are specifically singled out as \"hav[ing] a heightened responsibility to protect public health because unsafe drinking water can lead to serious illnesses and access to clean water for drinking and handwashing is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Some water and wastewater associations believe that the current policy and how it relates to public water systems is unclear and have reached out to EPA's Office of Water to request further guidance and additional clarification. WaterISAC will keep its members updated as it learns more. - On March 13, President Trump [declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/message-congress-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/)the situation with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be a national emergency. This declaration relies on the National Emergency Act \u2014 the same law that former president Barack Obama used to bolster his administration's response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. The law grants the president and executive branch sweeping powers to act quickly and decisively to respond to an emergency. Trump said his declaration would free $50 billion in federal resources to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes. The declaration also instructs state governments to set up emergency operations centers, directs hospitals nationwide to activate emergency preparedness contingency plans, and allows Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to waive regulations that could hinder health professionals' response capabilities. - Also on March 13, Trump also [issued](https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/03/13/president-donald-j-trump-directs-fema-support-under-emergency-declaration)an emergency declaration using the Stafford Act, which allows for the mobilization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist with the response. As a result of the declaration, FEMA is directed to assist state, local, tribal, territorial governments and other eligible entities with the health and safety actions they take on behalf of the American public. - For more about the declarations, read [this article](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/13/national-emergency-coronavirus/)at Stat. - - On March 11, President Donald Trump, in a televised address to the nation, [announced](http://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814597993/trump-set-to-deliver-address-as-coronavirus-deemed-a-pandemic)a 30-day ban on travel from European countries to the U.S., beginning on March 13 at midnight, in a bid \"to keep new cases\" of COVID-19 \"from entering our shores.\" Trump also announced economic measures that he said would help the country overcome \"temporary economic disruptions\" caused by the disease. One of the measures includes financial relief to people who need to stay home because they are sick, quarantined, or caring for others. - On January 31, President Donald Trump announced via [a Presidential proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/)the suspension of entry into the country of foreign nationals who had visited China in the past 14 days. Measures to detect this virus among those who are allowed entry into the U.S. (U.S. citizens, residents, and family) who have been in China within 14 days also are being implemented. - On January 31, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar [declared a public health emergency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/01/31/secretary-azar-declares-public-health-emergency-us-2019-novel-coronavirus.html)for the ongoing situation with the COVID-19.
