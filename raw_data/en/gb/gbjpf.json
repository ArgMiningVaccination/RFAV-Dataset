Many sites provide valuable information, while others may have information that is unreliable or misleading.\"1 Furthermore, because of the rapid increase in Internet-based information, many hours can be wasted searching, selecting, and printing. Since only the smallest fraction of information dealing with aromatherapy is indexed in search engines, such as www.google.com or others, a non-systematic approach to Internet research can be not only time consuming, but also incomplete. This book was created for medical professionals, students, and members of the general public who want to know as much as possible about aromatherapy, using the most advanced research tools available and spending the least amount of time doing so. In addition to offering a structured and comprehensive bibliography, the pages that follow will tell you where and how to find reliable information covering virtually all topics related to aromatherapy, from the essentials to the most advanced areas of research. Public, academic, government, and peer-reviewed research studies are emphasized. Various abstracts are reproduced to give you some of the latest official information available to date on aromatherapy. Abundant guidance is given on how to obtain free-of-charge primary research results via the Internet. While this book focuses on the field of medicine, when some sources provide access to non-medical information relating to aromatherapy, these are noted in the text. E-book and electronic versions of this book are fully interactive with each of the Internet sites mentioned (clicking on a hyperlink automatically opens your browser to the site indicated). If you are using the hard copy version of this book, you can access a cited Web site by typing the provided Web address directly into your Internet browser. You may find it useful to refer to synonyms or related terms when accessing these Internet databases. NOTE: At the time of publication, the Web addresses were functional. However, some links may fail due to URL address changes, which is a common occurrence on the Internet. For readers unfamiliar with the Internet, detailed instructions are offered on how to access electronic resources. For readers unfamiliar with medical terminology, a comprehensive glossary is provided. For readers without access to Internet resources, a directory of medical libraries, that have or can locate references cited here, is given. We hope these resources will prove useful to the widest possible audience seeking information on aromatherapy. The Editors 1 From the NIH, National Cancer Institute (NCI): http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/ten-things-to-know. 3 CHAPTER 1. STUDIES ON AROMATHERAPY Overview In this chapter, we will show you how to locate peer-reviewed references and studies on aromatherapy. The Combined Health Information Database The Combined Health Information Database summarizes studies across numerous federal agencies. To limit your investigation to research studies and aromatherapy, you will need to use the advanced search options. First, go to http://chid.nih.gov/index.html. From there, select the \"Detailed Search\" option (or go directly to that page with the following hyperlink: http://chid.nih.gov/detail/detail.html). The trick in extracting studies is found in the drop boxes at the bottom of the search page where \"You may refine your search by.\" Select the dates and language you prefer, and the format option \"Journal Article.\" At the top of the search form, select the number of records you would like to see (we recommend 100) and check the box to display \"whole records.\" We recommend that you type \"aromatherapy\" (or synonyms) into the \"For these words:\" box. Consider using the option \"anywhere in record\" to make your search as broad as possible. If you want to limit the search to only a particular field, such as the title of the journal, then select this option in the \"Search in these fields\" drop box. The following is what you can expect from this type of search: Use of Aromatherapy as a Complementary Treatment for Chronic Pain Source: Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. 5(5): 42-51. September 1999. Summary: This article discusses the use of aromatherapy as a complementary treatment for chronic pain. First, it defines aromatherapy, reviews the effects of aroma on the body, and describes methods of using aromatherapy with and without touch. Then, it summarizes human studies on the use of aromatherapy in the treatment of pain, including aromatherapy for children, lavender for pain and coping, chamomile for pain in cancer, marigold for pain in hyperkeratotic plantar lesions, peppermint for headache and arthritic pain, and rose for pain in cancer with bone metastases. Finally, it reviews animal studies, and discusses the potential for untoward effects. It includes a list of essential oils with analgesic properties that are safe to use. The article has 4 tables and 96 references. 4 Aromatherapy Single Case Evaluation of the Effects of Aromatherapy and Massage on Disturbed Behaviour in Severe Dementia Source: British Journal of Clinical Psychology. 36: 287-296. 1997. Summary: This journal article describes a study of the effects of aromatherapy and massage on disturbed behavior in patients with severe dementia. The participants were four patients on a continuing care ward for people with advanced dementia. Two patients had Alzheimer's disease (AD), one had AD and Parkinson's disease, and one had a frontal lobe disorder. Each participant received 8 to 12 treatment sessions of aromatherapy alone, massage alone, and aromatherapy and massage combined over a 3 month period. Using a single case design with each patient serving as his own control, the effects of each treatment on the patient's behavior was assessed against a notreatment control condition. The results were mixed. In two patients, all of the treatment conditions decreased disturbed behavior compared with the control condition; however, the effect was significant for only one of these patients. In the other two patients, all or some of the treatment conditions led to an increase in disturbed behavior. The authors discuss possible explanations for the different effects. 4 figures, 1 table, 9 references. Federally Funded Research on Aromatherapy The U.S. Government supports a variety of research studies relating to aromatherapy. These studies are tracked by the Office of Extramural Research at the National Institutes of Health.2 CRISP (Computerized Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects) is a searchable database of federally funded biomedical research projects conducted at universities, hospitals, and other institutions. Search the CRISP Web site at http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/crisp_query.generate_screen. You will have the option to perform targeted searches by various criteria, including geography, date, and topics related to aromatherapy. For most of the studies, the agencies reporting into CRISP provide summaries or abstracts. As opposed to clinical trial research using patients, many federally funded studies use animals or simulated models to explore aromatherapy. The following is typical of the type of information found when searching the CRISP database for aromatherapy: Project Title: AROMATHERAPY & PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY Principal Investigator & Institution: Sloan, Richard; Columbia University Health Sciences New York, NY 10032 Timing: Fiscal Year 2001 Summary: This abstract is not available. Website: http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/Crisp_Query.Generate_Screen 2 Healthcare projects are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and Office of Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH). Studies 5 The National Library of Medicine: PubMed One of the quickest and most comprehensive ways to find academic studies in both English and other languages is to use PubMed, maintained by the National Library of Medicine.3 The advantage of PubMed over previously mentioned sources is that it covers a greater number of domestic and foreign references. It is also free to use. If the publisher has a Web site that offers full text of its journals, PubMed will provide links to that site, as well as to sites offering other related data. User registration, a subscription fee, or some other type of fee may be required to access the full text of articles in some journals. To generate your own bibliography of studies dealing with aromatherapy, simply go to the PubMed Web site at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed. Type \"aromatherapy\" (or synonyms) into the search box, and click \"Go.\" The following is the type of output you can expect from PubMed for \"aromatherapy\" (hyperlinks lead to article summaries): A clinical trial of the effect of aromatherapy on motivational behaviour in a dementia care setting using a single subject design.

The PubMed database was developed in conjunction with publishers of biomedical literature as a search tool for accessing literature citations and linking to full-text journal articles at Web sites of participating publishers. Publishers that participate in PubMed supply NLM with their citations electronically prior to or at the time of publication. 6 Aromatherapy Accidental bullous phototoxic reactions to bergamot aromatherapy oil.

NUTRITION AND AROMATHERAPY Overview In this chapter, we will show you how to find studies dedicated specifically to nutrition and aromatherapy. Finding Nutrition Studies on Aromatherapy The National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) offers a searchable bibliographic database called the IBIDS (International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements; National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 1B29, 31 Center Drive, 460,000 scientific citations and summaries about dietary supplements and nutrition as well as references to published international, scientific literature on dietary supplements such as vitamins, minerals, and botanicals.4 The IBIDS includes references and citations to both human and animal research studies. As a service of the ODS, access to the IBIDS database is available free of charge at the following Web address: http://ods.od.nih.gov/databases/ibids.html. After entering the search area, you have three choices: (1) IBIDS Consumer Database, (2) Full IBIDS Database, or (3) Peer Reviewed Citations Only. Now that you have selected a database, click on the \"Advanced\" tab. An advanced search allows you to retrieve up to 100 fully explained references in a comprehensive format. Type \"aromatherapy\" (or synonyms) into the search box, and click \"Go.\" To narrow the search, you can also select the \"Title\" field. 4 Adapted from http://ods.od.nih.gov. IBIDS is produced by the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at the National Institutes of Health to assist the public, healthcare providers, educators, and researchers in locating credible, scientific information on dietary supplements. IBIDS was developed and will be maintained through an interagency partnership with the Food and Nutrition Information Center of the National Agricultural Library, U.S. Department of Agriculture. 22 Aromatherapy The following information is typical of that found when using the \"Full IBIDS Database\" to search for \"aromatherapy\" (or a synonym): A randomized trial of aromatherapy to reduce anxiety before abortion.

AROMATHERAPY ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AND Overview In this chapter, we will begin by introducing you to official information sources on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) relating to aromatherapy. At the conclusion of this chapter, we will provide additional sources. The Combined Health Information Database The Combined Health Information Database (CHID) is a bibliographic database produced by health-related agencies of the U.S. federal government (mostly from the National Institutes of Health) that can offer concise information for a targeted search. The CHID database is updated four times a year at the end of January, April, July, and October. Check the titles, summaries, and availability of CAM-related information by using the \"Simple Search\" option at the following Web site: http://chid.nih.gov/simple/simple.html. In the drop box at the top, select \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\" Then type \"aromatherapy\" (or synonyms) in the second search box. We recommend that you select 100 \"documents per page\" and to check the \"whole records\" options. The following was extracted using this technique: Complementary Therapies in Palliative Cancer Care Source: Cancer. 91(11): 2181-2185. June 1, 2001. Summary: This journal article provides an overview of complementary therapies for palliative cancer care. First, it discusses the difference between alternative cancer 'cures' and complementary cancer care, including the potential dangers of alternative treatments and the goals of complementary medicine in palliative care. Then, it reviews evidence from exemplary studies and (where available) systematic reviews of selected complementary therapies used for palliative cancer care, including acupuncture, aromatherapy, enzyme therapy, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, massage, reflexology, relaxation, and spiritual healing.

PATENTS ON AROMATHERAPY Overview Patents can be physical innovations (e.g. chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment) or processes (e.g. treatments or diagnostic procedures). The United States Patent and Trademark Office defines a patent as a grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the Patent and Trademark Office.5 Patents, therefore, are intellectual property. For the United States, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date when the patent application was filed. If the inventor wishes to receive economic benefits, it is likely that the invention will become commercially available within 20 years of the initial filing. It is important to understand, therefore, that an inventor's patent does not indicate that a product or service is or will be commercially available. The patent implies only that the inventor has \"the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling\" the invention in the United States. While this relates to U.S. patents, similar rules govern foreign patents. In this chapter, we show you how to locate information on patents and their inventors. If you find a patent that is particularly interesting to you, contact the inventor or the assignee for further information. IMPORTANT NOTE: When following the search strategy described below, you may discover non-medical patents that use the generic term \"aromatherapy\" (or a synonym) in their titles. To accurately reflect the results that you might find while conducting research on aromatherapy, we have not necessarily excluded non-medical patents in this bibliography. Patents on Aromatherapy By performing a patent search focusing on aromatherapy, you can obtain information such as the title of the invention, the names of the inventor(s), the assignee(s) or the company that owns or controls the patent, a short abstract that summarizes the patent, and a few excerpts from the description of the patent. The abstract of a patent tends to be more technical in nature, while the description is often written for the public. Full patent descriptions contain much more information than is presented here (e.g. claims, references, figures, diagrams, etc.). We will tell you how to obtain this information later in the chapter. The following is an 5Adapted from the United States Patent and Trademark Office: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/whatis.htm. 50 Aromatherapy example of the type of information that you can expect to obtain from a patent search on aromatherapy: Aromatherapy mats for pets Inventor(s): Licciardo; Rochine 6,173,675 Date filed: November 12, 1998 Abstract: The invention is a mattress, mat or bed for animals comprising a soft and comfortable mat which-contains aromatherapy herbs having volatile components which aid and enhance certain behaviors in cats and dogs when laid upon. The mat is constructed with layers of soft fiber filling material and herbs are arranged between the layers and an outer cover of the mat. Preferably the filling material are of such a nature as to aid in the confinement and control of the herb material, while allowing for the full effect of the mixture of the herbs to be obtained. The scent and volatile effects of the herbs are able to emerge through the layers of the filling material and be inhaled by the pet to render the desired behavior. Excerpt(s): The invention is related to aromatherapy for animals and more particularly to pet mats filled with aromatic herbs. In the pet accessory industry several types of pet beds are available. Most commonly pet beds are designed simply for the comfort of a cat or a dog, although other beds or mats have deodorizing effects or insect repelling effects. These beds are stuffed with a variety of materials such as wood shavings, powdered insecticides, or other materials suitable to achieve the effects of deodorizing the pet bed or repelling fleas or ticks therefrom. Unknown to pet beds are those which provide the benefits of aromatherapy which humans have come to enjoy and to use therapeutically. Catnip toys have been used to provide a cat with a naturally scented toy which has a appealing odor to a cat and promotes feline activity with the toy. However, until now, there has not been known any toy or pet bed which will calm a cat or a dog or alter specific behavior patterns.

Box 297, Clinton, AR V. AR F. (P.O. none reported Patent Number: 6,102,300 Date filed: May 3, 1999 Abstract: A pocket size aromatherapy scent dispenser includes a flat casing defining a narrow cavity, a lid formed by an upper portion of the casing and a living hinge extending across the casing below the upper portion and pivotally connecting the lid to a remainder portion of the casing such that the lid can pivot about the living hinge between opened and closed positions relative to the remainder portion of the casing. The lid in the opened position is pivoted away from the remainder portion of the casing and opens an upper portion of the narrow cavity above the living hinge to an external environment. The lid in the closed position is disposed adjacent to the remainder Patents 51 portion of the casing and closes the upper portion of the cavity to the external environment. A piece of absorbent material carrying an aroma-producing substance is contained within the narrow cavity and has an upper portion partially exposed to the external environment when the lid is in the opened position such that a scent is produced that escapes to the external environment. A flat insert plate is disposed within narrow the cavity of the casing and contacts the upper portion of the piece of material. The insert plate partially exposes the upper portion of the piece of material to the external environment when the lid is in the opened position. Excerpt(s): The present invention generally relates to devices carrying odoriferous material for dispensing scents and, more particularly, is concerned with a pocket size aromatherapy scent dispenser having a casing with an upper portion forming a living hinge attached snap fit lid. Aromatherapy is a natural, drug-free treatment for the human body which has been found to be significantly effective in relieving the discomforts of many health-related complaints. Aromatherapy is derived from an ancient practice of using natural plant essences to treat illness and enhance health. This ancient practice uses pure essential oils extracted from a wide assortment of natural botanicals. It is believed that these oils found in plants, flowers, fruit, bark and roots provide scents that can restore a healthy balance of the body, mind and spirit. When aromatic molecules are inhaled, they are believed to make contact with nerve-receptacle bundles found at the top of the nasal cavity. When the aromatic essence contacts these nerves, they send signals that result in brain activity. These responses have been observed through brain scans and other diagnostic technologies. Aromatherapy applies to the delicate blending of these oils to treat specific symptoms. Each individual essence has distinct therapeutic qualities.

(663 Main St., Hunter, NY 12442) Assignee(s): none reported Patent Number: 6,258,748 Date filed: October 27, 1999 Abstract: To preserve flowers and provide aromatherapy, low temperature paraffin is heated to a liquid state of approximately 130 degrees Fahrenheit. A floral nutrient and preservative such as sugar is then added to the low temperature paraffin. Optionally, scents and/or color dyes are also added. The heads of flowers to be preserved are then dipped in this paraffin mixture for one to three seconds and thereafter allowed to dry. The flower can then be used immediately, or optionally hung upside down for one to three weeks prior to use to further improve shelf life. Excerpt(s): This invention relates to the field of floral preservatives, and specifically, to a device and method used to preserve cut flowers well beyond their ordinary shelf life. Flowers have long been a special gift for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and many other special occasions. However, the gift of flowers only lasts for a short time. Within a few short days or weeks, cut flowers wilt and die unless they have been properly preserved. Over time, various approaches to preserving flowers have been developed. These include freeze drying, hang drying, use of silica gels and sand mixtures, and spraying with the various compounds such as polyurethane, hairspray, and shellac. However, none of these approaches is fully satisfactory in terms of the shelf life 52 Aromatherapy achieved, the ability to achieve a lasting, pleasant aroma, and/or providing suitable coloration. Web site: http://www.delphion.com/details?pn=US06258748__ Method and appratus for aromatherapy 6,581,220 Date filed: April 30, 2001 Abstract: A method for aromatherapy including recirculating shower water on a body of a bather, the shower water including at least one aromatherapy substance. Excerpt(s): The present invention relates generally to aromatherapy and particularly to shower apparatus and methods for aromatherapy. Aromatherapy encompasses a variety of methods for delivering therapeutic benefits of essential oils or base oils of aromatic botanical extracts to the body. One type of aromatherapy involves mixing the aromatic extracts with water for bathing. Bathing with aromatic extracts is well known to provide many types of medicinal benefits. For example, therapeutic bath salts are well known for the relaxation of muscles, elimination or reduction of muscle spasms, and for the overall enhancement of a person's skin and mood. Examples of aromatic botanical extracts used in aromatherapy include, but are not limited to, jojoba oil (a base oil that has a chemical makeup very similar to the naturally occurring sebum in skin), rosewood oil, ylang-ylang oil, lavender oil, patchouli oil and grape seed extract. A bather generally mixes the aromatic extracts with water in a bathtub, and soaks in the tub for a period of time. By resting in the tub, the user accrues the combined benefits of external therapy and internal therapy, such as soothing or relaxing the body, or conditioning or otherwise improving the health of skin, to name a few. Aromatherapy showers are also known. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,915,622 to Foote and 5,957,379 to McMorrow, et al. both describe shower apparatus for delivering aromatic extracts in a water stream to a person taking a shower. These patents deal with the problem of mixing aromatic botanical extracts with mineral salts in a water stream. The problem is that if botanical extracts are exposed to mineral salts for a prolonged period of time, the mineral salts may cause oxidation of the extracts. This oxidation of the extracts eliminates a majority of the value and benefit of the aromatic character of the extracts. Web site: http://www.delphion.com/details?pn=US06581220__ PMS defense: an aromatherapy compound for the relief of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome Inventor(s): Mannella; Lenore C. (177 Riverside Ave., STE F, Newport Beach, CA 92663) Assignee(s): none reported Patent Number: 6,322,823 Date filed: May 27, 1999 Abstract: This invention is directed to an Aromatherapy compound to combat symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome. It uniquely comprises an externally applied Patents 53 compound consisting of \"essential oils\" (highly concentrated oils extracted from plant cells for use in natural, therapeutic applications) that aid in the relief or reduction of symptoms of PMS. The compound preferably comprises equal proportions of essential oil of geranium, essential oil of clary sage, and essential oil of orange. The compound can be used \"neat\" (directly on the skin), however, the preferred embodiment is to add the compound to a \"carrier\" (a base for diluting the Aromatherapy compound) such as lotion or vegetable oil. The preferred formula is approximately 3 milliliters essential oil (1milliliter of geranium, 1 milliliter of clary sage, and 1 milliliter of orange) blended in 120 milliliters of carrier. Excerpt(s): This invention is directed to an Aromatherapy compound using a unique combination of natural oils extracted from plant cells to combat symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome. Natural health care companies supply female consumers with a variety of products that purportedly reduce symptoms of PMS. These products may be in the form of vitamin supplementation or herbal compounds, as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,630 to Morrow (1998), and more broadly cite relief of \". PMS through menopausal symptoms.\". U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,199 to Page & Rector-Page (1996), provides a method of synthesizing natural substitutes for progesterone and estrogen from herbaceous plants, and is taken in capsule form or applied topically. This product targets hormonal replacement associated with menopausal symptoms. Web site: http://www.delphion.com/details?pn=US06322823__ Patent Applications on Aromatherapy As of December 2000, U.S. patent applications are open to public viewing.6 Applications are patent requests which have yet to be granted. (The process to achieve a patent can take several years.) The following patent applications have been filed since December 2000 relating to aromatherapy: Aromatherapy footwear Inventor(s): Freeman, Cindy N. (Calabasas, CA), Nunes, Catherine L. (Los Altos, CA) Correspondence: Mandel & 710; 55 Number: 20030009138 Date filed: June 4, 2002 Abstract: The present invention is footwear and footwear components including insole pads, inserts and liners containing plant-derived essential oils and/or dried plant products applied to or constructed within the footwear and footwear components to deliver the comfort, disinfectant and/or therapeutic benefits of aromatherapy through direct contact with the wearer's feet with the volatile components of the plant derived oils and/or plant products. Excerpt(s): This application claims priority to provisional application, U.S. Serial No. 60/295,730, filed Jun. 4, 2001, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety into this application. This invention relates to aromatherapy, and in particular to the application of essential oils or volatile plant material to human feet through footwear and/or footwear components, to increase comfort and provide 6 This has been a common practice outside the United States prior to December 2000. 54 Aromatherapy therapeutic benefits. In the footwear business, the focus has been on improving comfort and performance by changing the shape, fabric and design, including varying the materials and technology that provide padding and cushioning of the feet of the wearer. Most inventions have heretofore concerned developing processes of molding and contouring the innersoles and arch position of the footwear, evolving padding elements (such as air or gel), or increasing the air circulation within the shoe or footpad. Web site: http://appft1.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html Cleansing compositions with milk protein and aromatherapy Inventor(s): Piterski, Catherine A. (River Vale, NJ), March 13, 2002 Abstract: A mild foaming cleanser composition is provided. The cleanser composition has a surfactant system, a moisturizer system, an aromatherapy system and a solvent system. The moisturizer system further includes a milk protein. In addition, the cleanser composition may also include an emulsifier, preservative, pH adjusting agent, thickening agent, emollient, opacifying agent, fragrance, or any combinations thereof. Excerpt(s): This application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/067,187, filed on Feb. 2, 2002, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/266,828, filed on Feb. 6, 2001. The present invention relates to cleansing compositions. More particularly, the present invention relates to cleansing compositions for infant and toddler use that have a moisturizer system containing a milk protein for nourishing the skin and an aromatherapy system for promoting calming effect to the user. Typically, baby cleansers have a fairly high level of one or more mild cleansing agents. However, many cleansers clean skin and hair at the expense of drying out or stripping moisture from the skin and/or hair. A conditioner may be included in the cleanser composition for conditioning the skin and/or hair. Most conditioning agents are substantive. Substantive agents adhere to the skin to provide a conditioning effect, thereby causing irritation to sensitive membranes, such as those found in the eye. Thus, substantive compositions are not desirable for use in compositions used for bathing infants or toddlers. Web site: http://appft1.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html Combined aromatherapy air diffuser with lonizer DOTAN; 45 Application Number: 20010032000 Date filed: December 5, 2000 Abstract: A device, combining the prominent Aromatherapy treatment, together with ionizing.The system creates combined molecules of etheric oil and O.sub.3, loaded with Patents 55 static electrical charge.The procedure is done by airflow, carrying molecules of various kinds of etheric oils.The loaded airflow, with etheric oil molecules, passes by a metal grid, which creates O.sub.3 molecules at its edges. The O.sub.3 molecules are gravitated to the etheric oil molecules that flow nearby, and creating a new molecule. These new molecules are loaded with a static electrical charge, being formed from the connection with the O.sub.3 molecule.LED system, having the homogenous wavelength, is installed in the front side of the device, having a focus at 50-mm. approx. in order to heat up the treated area, and by this to allow a better penetration of the etheric oil. Excerpt(s): This invention relates to a device that actually operates in three different modes, usually done by a separate device for each mode of action. Said proposed device not only that it does these three separate modes of action, but also, due to the fact that it does the air diffusing prior to the ionization, it causes the air stream that contains inside it the free etheric oil molecules, to gather with the free O.sub.3 molecules that are created throughout the way, by the ionization system. Transferring the static charge to the etheric oil molecules intensifies their chemical reaction, while being in contact with any living tissue whatsoever. The device additional uniqueness is that later on, once it is in contact with the living tissue, this tissue has already been pre-heated by the focused lamps system, which is located in the front side of the device. This system stimulates the blood circulation in the tissue, so by the time the loaded air stream arrives; its absorption in the tissue is much more effectively. LED light system, having a coherent wavelength, such as LED 1, is pointed towards a focusing point located in the front side of said device, around 50 mm. at point 9. Each lamp has an optic lens, lens 16, for concentrating the light beam. Web site: http://appft1.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html Disposable personal aromatherapy mask kit Inventor(s): Dyer, Sally E. (Hilton Head Island, SC) Correspondence: ROGER RATHBUN; 13 MARGARITA Date filed: August 8, 2002 Abstract: An aromatherapy inhalation kit providing portable, disposable and immediate therapy. The kit comprises a vial having a capacity of about 2 ml. pre-filled with one application of pre-blended, predetermined quantity and diluted essential oil, a conetype mask of paper fiber to which the oil blend is applied; and a heavy weight paper folder to hold the mask and vial in the protective folder. At use, the contents of the vial are dispersed onto the outside surface of the mask. The mask is then worn over the user's nose and mouth and the user inhales the vapors for twenty to thirty minutes to enhance the user's mood and/or condition. The kit is small enough to carry in an automobile glove compartment, a backpack, a purse or a pocket. Since its administration does not rely upon electrical power, it is convenient to use at any time or in any location. Excerpt(s): The present patent application is based upon Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/318,587, filed Sep. 8, 2001 and entitled \"Disposable Personal Aromatherapy Mask Kit\". The present invention relates to aromatherapy, and, more particularly, to an improved method of the administration of diluted essential oils to a person through the process of inhalation, and to a kit that can be used to carry out the administration of aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is therapy using essential oils in a 56 Aromatherapy variety of ways and for a number of purposes. Essential oils are the volatile, organic constituents of fragrant plant matter, and they contribute to both flavor and fragrance. When distilled for plants, the essential oils become concentrated 100 fold or more, so certain properties become very pronounced in the oils.

This chapter also discusses the grief and loss associated with adoption and the special grief of single bereaved mothers. Chapter 2 examines the nature of grieving, which usually begins with shock and emotional numbness. In situations in which a miscarriage has occurred and curettage is to be performed to remove the dead embryo or fetus, or if the mother is to undergo vaginal birth, with contractions, of a fully developed baby, she is encouraged to find out what her options are and to make as many decisions as she can on her own. If she is not getting the support and answers she needs from the hospital staff, she should seek out her own support. This chapter also discusses the process of letting go of the fetus or baby; taking one's time to make that decision; ways to facilitate the grief process; and the various scenarios that can occur (e.g., miscarriage in the first 3 months, induced birth of a developed baby who has died, death during or shortly after cesarean birth, and the birth of a seriously ill infant); bonding with the baby; family-centered stillbirth; naming and baptizing the baby; collecting mementos; autopsy and burial decisions; and the need for rituals. Chapter 3 describes the second phase of grief, searching and yearning, which is full of powerful emotions like pain, anger, guilt, fear, despair, and jealousy. This phase usually lasts 4 to 6 months. In this chapter, the author encourages bereaved mothers to acknowledge and express their feelings and provides specific actions and exercises to help them find comfort and relief. This chapter also discusses taking a break from grief, finding consolation, attending a support group, a father's grief, grief and the marital relationship, siblings' grief, and a grandparent's grief. In chapter 4, the author gives bereaved parents suggestions for coping with grief 6 months after the death and beyond. This is when parents have grasped the reality of the death and are slowly adapting to life without their baby. The length of this phase differs from individual to individual. This chapter contains suggestions for nurturing the physical self with proper nutrition, exercise, sleep, and holistic treatments. The author Books 61 describes the power of visualization, creativity, spirituality, aromatherapy, and flower essences in healing from grief; what to do when the grief process stagnates; and when professional help is needed. Chapter 5 looks at the period following the anniversary of the death, a period of closure and new beginnings, including the possibility of having another child. The remaining chapters are intended for those who care for the bereaved. Chapter 6 reviews what the bereaved need and don't need from others during mourning. Chapter 7 is a primer on what health care professionals can do to support and comfort the parents who have miscarried or whose infant has died in the hospital setting. The author describes specific things caretakers can do (i.e., take a photo) and how they can set up a perinatal bereavement team. The chapter also contains 12 pages of guidelines for parents' care after stillbirth, miscarriage, and newborn death. The guidelines address what to do when the mother is admitted to the hospital, during labor and delivery, during postpartum care, and upon discharge. Chapter 8 focuses on what the hospital staff and others can do for the bereaved parents after they leave the hospital. Ideally, followup care should be given by all of the following: the mother's gynecologist or family physician; a visiting nurse, midwife, or doula; a pastor, priest, or rabbi; and a counselor or therapist. This chapter discusses how caregivers can support parents through the four phases of grief and the five tasks of mourners; monitor the health of the bereaved; recognize signs of complicated mourning; and provide care during subsequent pregnancies. Chapter 9 discusses the spiritual care of the bereaved, including the parents' right to have their child baptized, the power of rituals in healing grief, and how clergy can help bereaved parents. Chapter 10 discusses the value of support groups for bereaved parents, how parents can form their own group, the SHARE support group model, and topics for group meetings. Chapter 11 examines dealing with death in childbirth education classes, including how childbirth educators can bring up the topic, how to handle couples who have had a previous loss, what to do when a couple in the class suffers a loss, and how the group and educator can be supportive if that happens. Chapter 12 looks at what funeral directors can do to facilitate the grief process. Appendix 1 presents the rights of parents when a baby dies. Appendix 2 provides questionnaires for assessing the grief of parents and for assessing caregivers' personal experiences with and attitudes toward death and dying. Appendix 3 presents suggestions for meditation; memorial rituals; and readings, prayers, and songs. Appendix 4 is a directory of support organizations, bereavement web sites, publishers of bereavement materials, audiovisual materials, sources of information on therapy, and sources of natural remedies. An extensive bibliography and a list of journals and newsletters complete the book.

The books may be accessed in two ways: (1) by searching directly using any search term or phrase (in the same way as the bibliographic database PubMed), or (2) by following the links to PubMed abstracts. Each PubMed abstract has a \"Books\" button that displays a facsimile of the abstract in which some phrases are hypertext links. These phrases are also found in the books available at NCBI. Click on hyperlinked results in the list of books in which the phrase is found. Currently, the majority of the links are between the books and PubMed.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Guide for Patients and Their Families. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott-Raven Publishers. 1999. p. 175193. Contact: Available from Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. 386 Park Avenue South, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10016-8804. (800) handling. ISBN: 0397517718. Summary: While there is continued progress in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), more people are turning to alternative modalities to try to relieve their symptoms. This chapter on alternative medicine in IBD is from a text written specifically for people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is the collective term for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine (the colon), that is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of its inner lining. By contrast, Crohn's disease can affect any area of the gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine. The author stresses that the biggest single problem with alternative medicine is the lack of responsible, scientifically based information on the safety, potential effects, and long term effects of alternative modalities. The author uses the term integrative medicine to refer to the integration of allopathic medicine and alternative therapies. The author stresses the benefits of allopathic medicine and cautions against using any physician or practitioner who suggests that Western medical care not be used or who will not work with or coordinate activities with a primary care physician or gastroenterologist. Topics covered include insurance coverage for alternative medicine for IBD, medical training, herbal remedies, manipulation therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, music and music beds, homeopathy, aromatherapy, psychoneuroimmunology, and prayer. The author concludes by reiterating the importance of combining traditional and alternative approaches to the treatment of IBD.

The format of these resources varies. Searchable databases, bibliographic citations, full-text articles (when available), archival collections, and images are all available. The following are referenced by the National Library of Medicine:11 Bioethics: Access to published literature on the ethical, legal, and public policy issues surrounding healthcare and biomedical research.

Physician Resources 101 Coffee Break: Tutorials for Biologists17 Coffee Break is a general healthcare site that takes a scientific view of the news and covers recent breakthroughs in biology that may one day assist physicians in developing treatments. Here you will find a collection of short reports on recent biological discoveries. Each report incorporates interactive tutorials that demonstrate how bioinformatics tools are used as a part of the research process. Currently, all Coffee Breaks are written by NCBI staff.18 Each report is about 400 words and is usually based on a discovery reported in one or more articles from recently published, peer-reviewed literature.19 This site has new articles every few weeks, so it can be considered an online magazine of sorts. It is intended for general background information. You can access the Coffee Break Web site at the following hyperlink: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Coffeebreak/. Other Commercial Databases In addition to resources maintained by official agencies, other databases exist that are commercial ventures addressing medical professionals. Here are some examples that may interest you: CliniWeb International: Index and table of contents to selected clinical information on the Internet; see http://www.ohsu.edu/cliniweb/. Medical World Search: Searches full text from thousands of selected medical sites on the Internet; see http://www.mwsearch.com/. 17 Adapted 18 from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Coffeebreak/Archive/FAQ.html. The figure that accompanies each article is frequently supplied by an expert external to NCBI, in which case the source of the figure is cited. The result is an interactive tutorial that tells a biological story. 19 After a brief introduction that sets the work described into a broader context, the report focuses on how a molecular understanding can provide explanations of observed biology and lead to therapies for diseases. Each vignette is accompanied by a figure and hypertext links that lead to a series of pages that interactively show how NCBI tools and resources are used in the research process. 103 APPENDIX B. PATIENT RESOURCES Overview Official agencies, as well as federally funded institutions supported by national grants, frequently publish a variety of guidelines written with the patient in mind. These are typically called \"Fact Sheets\" or \"Guidelines.\" They can take the form of a brochure, information kit, pamphlet, or flyer. Often they are only a few pages in length. Since new guidelines on aromatherapy can appear at any moment and be published by a number of sources, the best approach to finding guidelines is to systematically scan the Internet-based services that post them. Patient Guideline Sources The remainder of this chapter directs you to sources which either publish or can help you find additional guidelines on topics related to aromatherapy. Due to space limitations, these sources are listed in a concise manner. Do not hesitate to consult the following sources by either using the Internet hyperlink provided, or, in cases where the contact information is provided, contacting the publisher or author directly. The National Institutes of Health The NIH gateway to patients is located at http://health.nih.gov/. From this site, you can search across various sources and institutes, a number of which are summarized below. Topic Pages: MEDLINEplus The National Library of Medicine has created a vast and patient-oriented healthcare information portal called MEDLINEplus. Within this Internet-based system are \"health topic pages\" which list links to available materials relevant to aromatherapy. To access this system, log on to http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthtopics.html. From there you can either search using the alphabetical index or browse by broad topic areas. Recently, MEDLINEplus listed the following when searched for \"aromatherapy\": 104 Aromatherapy Other guides About Your Medicines http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/aboutyourmedicines.html Arthritis http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/arthritis.html Cancer Alternative Therapy http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/canceralternativetherapy.html Environmental Health http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/environmentalhealth.html Hepatitis C http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hepatitisc.html Herbal Medicine http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/herbalmedicine.html Household Poisons http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/householdpoisons.html You may also choose to use the search utility provided by MEDLINEplus at the following Web address: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/. Simply type a keyword into the search box and click \"Search.\" This utility is similar to the NIH search utility, with the exception that it only includes materials that are linked within the MEDLINEplus system (mostly patient-oriented information). It also has the disadvantage of generating unstructured results. We recommend, therefore, that you use this method only if you have a very targeted search. The Combined Health Information Database (CHID) CHID Online is a reference tool that maintains a database directory of thousands of journal articles and patient education guidelines on aromatherapy. CHID offers summaries that describe the guidelines available, including contact information and pricing. CHID's general Web site is http://chid.nih.gov/. To search this database, go to http://chid.nih.gov/detail/detail.html. In particular, you can use the advanced search options to look up pamphlets, reports, brochures, and information kits. The following was recently posted in this archive: A Practical Guide to Complementary Therapies for People Living With HIV Contact: Community AIDS Treatment Information Exchange, PO Box 1104, Toronto, (416) 203-7122, http://www.catie.ca. Summary: This brochure discusses the use of complementary therapies for persons with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It discusses research and complementary therapies; the regulation of practitioners; several therapeutic systems including Ayurvedic medicine, homeopathy, North American Aboriginal healing traditions, naturopathy, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); several wellness systems including aromatherapy, color therapy, and juicing; unconventional therapies using melatonin and oxygen; and how to find a practicioner and avoid health fraud. Patient Resources 105 [Introduction to Complementary Therapies] Contact: Canadian Public Health Association, Canadian HIV/AIDS Clearinghouse, 4001565 Carling Ave Ste 400, Ottawa, (613) 725-3434, http://www.cpha.ca. Summary: This pamphlet discusses complementary therapies that may help the patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS). The pamphlet compares western medicine and complementary therapies and describes the following therapies: ayurveda, acupuncture and acupressure, aromatherapy, chiropractic therapy, massage, meditation, naturopathy, reflexology, reiki, shiatsu massage, sidha medicine, tai chi, and yoga. The pamphlet advises the patient to consult the physician about therapies he/she plans to take and to inform the complementary therapist about prescribed drugs being taken. Coping with Hepatitis C: Alternative or Complementary Approaches Source: San Francisco, CA: National Hepatitis C Program, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 2002. 3 p. Contact: Available from National Hepatitis C Program. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, CA 94121. (415) 750-2105. PRICE: Free. Summary: This patient education brochure from the Centers of Excellence in Hepatitis C Research and Education at the Veterans Administration provides information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches for people who have hepatitis C. It lists three guidelines to follow if alternative treatments will be used, and gives important warnings about herbal remedies, supplements, vitamins, and other natural treatments. It also discusses several types of CAM treatments for hepatitis C, including aromatherapy, massage therapy, meditation and visualization, and yoga. Healthfinder Healthfinder is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and offers links to hundreds of other sites that contain healthcare information. This Web site is located at http://www.healthfinder.gov. Again, keyword searches can be used to find guidelines. The following was recently found in this database: Aromatherapy - Frequently Asked Questions Summary: Provides answers to questions about aromatherapy. Source: NOAH: New York Online Access to Health http://www.healthfinder.gov/scripts/recordpass.asp?RecordType=0&RecordID=7355 The NIH Search Utility The NIH search utility allows you to search for documents on over 100 selected Web sites that comprise the NIH-WEB-SPACE. Each of these servers is \"crawled\" and indexed on an ongoing basis. Your search will produce a list of various documents, all of which will relate in some way to aromatherapy. The drawbacks of this approach are that the information is not organized by theme and that the references are often a mix of information for professionals and patients. Nevertheless, a large number of the listed Web sites provide useful background information. We can only recommend this route, therefore, for relatively 106 Aromatherapy rare or specific disorders, or when using highly targeted searches. To use the NIH search utility, visit the following Web page: http://search.nih.gov/index.html. Additional Web Sources A number of Web sites are available to the public that often link to government sites. These can also point you in the direction of essential information. The following is a representative sample: AOL: WebMD\u00aeHealth: http://my.webmd.com/health_topics Finding Associations There are several Internet directories that provide lists of medical associations with information on or resources relating to aromatherapy. By consulting all of associations listed in this chapter, you will have nearly exhausted all sources for patient associations concerned with aromatherapy. The National Health Information Center (NHIC) The National Health Information Center (NHIC) offers a free referral service to help people find organizations that provide information about aromatherapy. For more information, see the NHIC's Web site at http://www.health.gov/NHIC/ or contact an information specialist by calling 1-800-336-4797. Directory of Health Organizations The Directory of Health Organizations, provided by the National Library of Medicine Specialized Information Services, is a comprehensive source of information on associations. The Directory of Health Organizations database can be accessed via the Internet at http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/Dir/DirMain.html. It is composed of two parts: DIRLINE and Health Hotlines. The DIRLINE database comprises some 10,000 records of organizations, research centers, and government institutes and associations that primarily focus on health and biomedicine. To access DIRLINE directly, go to the following Web site: http://dirline.nlm.nih.gov/. Simply type in \"aromatherapy\" (or a synonym), and you will receive information on all relevant organizations listed in the database. Patient Resources 107 Health Hotlines directs you to toll-free numbers to over 300 organizations. You can access this database directly at http://www.sis.nlm.nih.gov/hotlines/. On this page, you are given the option to search by keyword or by browsing the subject list. When you have received your search results, click on the name of the organization for its description and contact information. The Combined Health Information Database Another comprehensive source of information on healthcare associations is the Combined Health Information Database. Using the \"Detailed Search\" option, you will need to limit your search to \"Organizations\" and \"aromatherapy\". Type the following hyperlink into your Web browser: http://chid.nih.gov/detail/detail.html. To find associations, use the drop boxes at the bottom of the search page where \"You may refine your search by.\" For publication date, select \"All Years.\" Then, select your preferred language and the format option \"Organization Resource Sheet.\" Type \"aromatherapy\" (or synonyms) into the \"For these words:\" box. You should check back periodically with this database since it is updated every three months. The National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc. The National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc. has prepared a Web site that provides, at no charge, lists of associations organized by health topic. You can access this database at the following Web site: http://www.rarediseases.org/search/orgsearch.html. Type \"aromatherapy\" (or a synonym) into the search box, and click \"Submit Query.\" 109 APPENDIX C. FINDING MEDICAL LIBRARIES Overview In this Appendix, we show you how to quickly find a medical library in your area. Preparation Your local public library and medical libraries have interlibrary loan programs with the National Library of Medicine (NLM), one of the largest medical collections in the world. According to the NLM, most of the literature in the general and historical collections of the National Library of Medicine is available on interlibrary loan to any library. If you would like to access NLM medical literature, then visit a library in your area that can request the publications for you.20 Finding a Local Medical Library The quickest method to locate medical libraries is to use the Internet-based directory published by the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM). This network includes 4626 members and affiliates that provide many services to librarians, health professionals, and the public. To find a library in your area, simply visit http://nnlm.gov/members/adv.html or call 1-800-338-7657. Medical Libraries in the U.S. and Canada In addition to the NN/LM, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) lists a number of libraries with reference facilities that are open to the public. The following is the NLM's list and includes hyperlinks to each library's Web site. These Web pages can provide information on hours of operation and other restrictions. The list below is a small sample of 20 Adapted from the NLM: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/psd/cas/interlibrary.html. 110 Aromatherapy libraries recommended by the National Library of Medicine (sorted alphabetically by name of the U.S. state or Canadian province where the library is located)21: Alabama: Health InfoNet of Jefferson County (Jefferson County Library Cooperative, Lister Hill Library of the Health Sciences), http://www.uab.edu/infonet/ Alabama: Richard M.
