Individual abstracts can be located readily by means of the page numbers given at each entry, e.g., p 0403 A82-45179. To assist the user in binding Supplements SP-7011(229) through SP-7011(240), a title page is included in the back of this Cumulative Index.NASA SP-7011(241) A CUMULATIVE INDEX TO A CONTINUING BIBLIOGRAPHY ON AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY This Cumulative index supersedes the indexes contained in supplements [SP-7011(229) through SP-7011 (240)] published by NASA during 1982. f\\I/\\Ci!/\\ Scientific and Technical Information Branch 1983 I \\|/ i^)f \\ National Aeronautics and Space Administration Washington, DCThis index is available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia 22161 at the price code of $12.00 domestic;'$24.00 foreign.INTRODUCTION WHAT THIS CUMULATIVE INDEX IS This publication is a cumulative index to the abstracts contained in NASA SP-7011 (229) through NASA SP- 7011 (240) of Aerospace Medicine and Biology: A Continuing Bibliography, NASA SP-7011, and by means of supplements, serves as a current abstracting and announcement journal for references on bioscience and biotechnology. It has been compiled through the cooperative efforts of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Entries prepared by the two contributing organizations are identified as follows: 1. NASA entries by their STAR accession numbers (N82-10000 series). 2. AIAA entries by their IAA accession numbers (A82-10000 series). HOW THIS CUMULATIVE INDEX IS ORGANIZED This Cumulative Index includes a subject, personal author, and corporate source index. HOW TO USE THE SUBJECT INDEX Two types of cross-references appear in the subject index: 1. Use (U) references indicate that the subject term is not \"postable,\" i.e., not a valid term, and that the following term or terms are used instead. For example: DOSE U DOSAGE AIRLINERS U COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ~U\u2014PASSENGER AIRCRAFT 2. Narrower Term (NT) references refer the user to more specific headings in the same subject area, under which additional material on the subject may be found. For example: FATIGUE (BIOLOGY) NT AUDITORY FATIGUE NT FLIGHT FATIGUE NT MUSCULAR FATIGUE In addition, a searcher may use the title or title and title extension in the index to narrow further his quest for particular items, this is because subject terms can readily include more than one class of document. For example: BIOLOGICAL EFFECT Vibratory force effect upon biological systems, particularly human organism. Biological effect of cosmic and solar radiations on human body at high altitudes, illustrates a case where two references on different topics are listed under the same subject term. HOW TO USE THE PERSONAL AUTHOR INDEX All personal authors used in the abstract-section citations in the individual Supplements appear in the index. Differences in translation schemes may require multiple searching of the index for variants of an author's name. For example: EMELIANOV, M. D. and YEMELYANOV, M. D. HiHOW TO USE THE CORPORATE SOURCE INDEX The corporate source index entries are abridged versions of the corporate sources used in the abstract- section citations in the individual Supplements. The corporate source supplementary (organizational component) does not appear in the index. For example: NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV., LAS CRUCES. DEPT. OF BIOLOGY. (Source citation entry) NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV., LAS CRUCES. (Source index entry) IDENTIFICATION OF DESIRED SUPPLEMENT The abstract and descriptive cataloging for any accession number selected from the indexes may be found in the appropriate Supplement. The page-number range of each Supplement appears on the inside front cover of this index. Once the range of page numbers containing the selected accession number is located in the second column, the desired Supplement number will be found in the first column. For example: Page 403 will be found in Supplement 240. AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS Information concerning the availability of documents announced in Aerospace Medicine and Biology supplements is found in the Introduction to the most currently issued supplement. ivTABLE OF CONTENTS Page Subject Index A-1 Personal Author Index B-1 Corporate Source Index C-1SUBJECT INDEXAEROSPACE MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY la continuing bibliography 1982 Cumulative IndexJANUARY 1983 Typical Subject Index Listing _L| SUBJECT HEADING!
