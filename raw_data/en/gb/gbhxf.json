Wilson1,3,4 The epidemiology of infectious causes of meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa is not well understood, and a common cause of meningitis in this region, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), is notoriously hard to diagnose. Here we show that integrating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) with a host gene expression-basedmachine (MLC) enhances diagnostic accuracy for TB meningitis (TBM) its 368 HIV-infected Ugandan adults with subacute meningitis were prospectivelyenrolled. Total RNA and DNA CSF mNGS libraries were sequenced to identify meningitispathogens. In parallel, a CSF host transcriptomic MLC to distinguish between TBM and otherinfections was trained and then evaluated in a blinded fashion on an independent dataset.mNGS identi es an array of infectious TBM mimics (and co-infections), including emerging, the speci city of mNGS and the sensitivity of an MLC created from CSF host transcriptomes, the combined assay has high sensitivity (88.9%) and speci city (86.7%) for the detection of TBM and its many mimics. Furthermore, we achieve comparable combinedassay performance at sequencing depths more amenable to performing diagnostic mNGS inlow resource settings.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29353-x OPEN 1Weill Institute for Neurosciences, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.2University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.3UCSF Center for Tuberculosis, San Francisco, CA, USA.4UCSF Center for Encephalitis and Meningitis, San Francisco, CA, USA. 5Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.6Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.7Medical Research Council \u2014Uganda Virus Research Institute \u2014LSHTM Uganda Research Unit, Entebbe, Uganda.8University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA.9University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.10Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.11Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS, USA. 12Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA, USA.13Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.14These authors contributed equally: P.

Ramesh.email: 11234567890():,;Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) affects million (8.9-11 million) people worldwide and carries devas- tating consequences, including ~1.2 million deaths in 2019 alone. With signi cant public health resources required for the COVID-19 pandemic, the global TB burden will likely only increase in the coming years1,2. Meningitis is the most severe complication of TB, carrying a 50 -60% mortality rate in persons living with HIV3. The diagnosis of TB meningitis (TBM) is notoriously dif cult yet essential, as early and appropriate treat- ment is critical to prevent signi cant morbidity and mortality4. Due to the paucibacillary nature of TB infection in the central nervous system (CNS), culture and nucleic acid detection (e.g., TB PCR) are insensitive diagnostic tools4-7compared to the TBM Uniform Case De nition (UCD), which was created to standar- dize research studies8. However, the clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria that comprise the UCD lack speci city9. Thus, there is a double-edged problem of patients with delayed or missed diagnoses of TBM due to the inadequate sensitivity of available diagnostic tests as well as patients inappropriately diagnosed and empirically treated for TBM based on nonspeci c clinical, laboratory, and radiologic criteria who have other infectious (and non-infectious) causes of meningitis10-12. Metagenomic next-generation dated diagnostic assay for neuroinfectious diseases that can test for a wide variety of infections by amplifying all the genetic material (host and pathogen) from a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample13. We and others have published case reports and case series demonstrating that CSF mNGS can diagnose TBM (and other infections that can clinically mimic TBM). These studies suggest that mNGS is speci c but only moderately sensitive for detecting the small amounts of TB nucleic acid in the CSF of patients with TBM10,11,14-16. Here, we investigated the clinical utility of CSF mNGS in a large population of prospectively enrolled Ugandan adults living with HIV and suspected TBM. We sought to enhance test performance by leveraging the human gene expression component of the CSF mNGS data to develop a complementary machine learning classi er (MLC) that cate- gorizes patients as having TBM or not. While host-based MLCs derived from blood and respiratory fluids are increasingly avail- able to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious diseases (including TB)17-21, the picogram quantities of RNA in a typical CSF sample have thus far stymied the development of analogous host-based classi ers for patients with neuroin flammatory disease. Results Cohort demographics . From 2018 -2019, 368 patients consented for the study. The median age was 35 years [IQR 29 -41 years] with 42.7% female. Among the patients for whom the CD4 cell count was measured ( n=95), the median was 41 cells/mm3[IQR 13-80 cells/mm3]. At the time of admission, 181 patients (49.1%) were documented as being on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 41/181 (22.6%) of these patients known to have commenced ART in the prior month. Median duration of headache prior to admission was 14 days [IQR 7 -21 days]. Median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at presentation was 14 [IQR 14 -15], 185/362 (51.1% of those with known GCS) had GCS < 15. Mortality at discharge or last contact was 25.9% (94/362) (Table 1). CSF was collected for mNGS from 368 patients. Of note, a second CSF sample was available for 14 patients, and results are represented as pathogens detected per patient, not per sample. Basic CSF studies (i.e., cell counts, chemistry) are listed in Table 1. One hundred eighty (48.9%) were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) based on: a positive serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) as well as a positive CSF CrAg and/or positive fungalculture (Not-TBM group). 2.9% (11/368) of diagnosed with bacterial meningitis (Not-TBM group). 10/366 (2.7%) were diagnosed group). Sixty-three (17.1%) were classi or denite TBM, of 61.9% had de nite 38% (24/63) were classi ed as probable TBM. De nite was diagnosed by Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in 97.4% (38/39) of cases. 66.6% (12/18) of cases were TB culture positive (11/18 cases were positive for TB by both Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and culture). 16.3% (60/368) cases were classi ed as possible TBM. 11.9% (44/368) were categorized as indeterminate. Nine cases had missing data for their TBM UCD score, 6 of these cases had cryptococcal antigenemia, and 3 cases had a nal hospital diagnosis listed as unknown. These patients were classi ed as indeterminate. Training and test cohorts . Two hundred forty patients were included in the training cohort, ~2/3 of the cohort. Within this cohort, 70 samples had either de nite TBM or some other neu- rological disease (OND) (see Methods) and were used for the training of the MLC. The learning curves generated show that further addition of samples would have diminishing improve- ments to performance of the classi er (Supplementary Fig. 1). One hundred thirty patients were included in the test cohort. Apart from two cases, cases were exclusive to either the training or test cohorts. In one case, the CSF was used in both the training and test cohorts, and in the other case, CSF collections from2 separate days from a single case were split between the training and test cohorts. In the training cohort, the percentage of cases with de nite TBM was 12.6% ( n=30) whereas in the test cohort, it was 6.3% ( n=8) (Supplementary Table 1). Training cohort mNGS results . Median sequencing depth for the RNA-Seq libraries after remov al of External RNA Control Con- sortium (ERCC) sequences (both through bioinformatic ltering and 5,668,087 paired-end reads -13,858,372). median RNA input mass was 4.37 pg (0.8 -1326.4 pg). The median sequencing depth DNA-S eq libraries was 27,341,015 (IQR -32,158,040). Transcripts an average of 3212 protein-coding genes (113 -5335) were detected. We did not observe a strong correlation between the total number of protein-coding genes for which transcripts were detected in each sample and RNA mass, cell count, and library preparation method (i.e., with or without ERCC DASH) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). TBM detection by mNGS . We evaluated all de nite TBM cases that were mNGS positive for TB. The median number of sequences aligning to the TB genome was 24 in the DNA-seq libraries (2 -552 sequences) (median 1.4 reads per million reads (rpM) sequenced, 0.1 -25.2 rPM), and 3683 in the RNA-seq libraries (1 -116,083 sequences) (median 155.7 rPM, 0.1 -9050 rpM). No TB reads were detected in the 8 \"no template \"water controls. Given the very low abundance of TB reads in de nite TBM CSF and the lack of any TB sequences detected in the \"no template \"water controls, detection of TB by mNGS was de ned as 1 or more sequences, with the entire sequence aligning (with no alignment to any other mycobacterial species) to the TB genome with 98% nucleotide sequence identity. Training cohort machine classi er. micro- biologically proven samples (TBM: n=32 and OND: n=38) infections, identi ed in the training cohort, were used for the training of the MLC. Samples were sequenced across two batches (TBM: batch 1 ( 1 ( COMMUNICATIONS NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2022) 13:1675 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29353-x | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsTable 1 Baseline demographics by nal diagnosis.

Sixteen thousand six hundred seventeen different iterations of the classi er were run to determine the optimal parameters: all combinations of ve ML methods (with parameters) with/without feature selection, addi-tion of the co-variate matrix variables before/after feature selec- tion, class weights (TBM, OND) and prior count for logCPM. We wanted to identify a small set of features to distinguish the TBM versus OND, and hence chose L1 regularization. The rst round of iterations ( n=16,050) of the classi er was bootstrapped 100 times. A second round of iterations ( n=567) to ne tune the classi er was run 1000 times. A cutoff of 50% was used for the diagnosis of TBM. Two support vector machine (SVM) classi ers, with L1 regularization (regularization parameter C =0.1), independent of the co-variate highest sensitivities were chosen: MLC1 and MLC2. MLC1 had a prior count =75, and top 50 features, and MLC2 had a prior count =75, top 40 features and class weight for TBM =2. This class weight of 2 further increased the sensitivity of TBM detection in our training cohort. MLC1 had an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) =0.94, sensitivity =0.84 and speci city=0.95 on the training the resequenced samples, MLC1 classi ed 4/5 TBM and 5/5 OND correctly. A total of 15 genes were used to classify TBM and 111 genes to classify OND (bootstrap =1000) (Supplementary Data 1). For the TBM group, four genes were used For the OND group, three genes were used classi cation: EEF1A1 (532/1000), ers (SVM, C =0.1, prior count =75) based on these top genes to manuscript we only discuss results from MLC1. Perfor- mance of the MLC2, four-gene and seven-gene classi ers are described in the Supplementary Information (SupplementaryNote 1). Test cohort mNGS and MLC detection of TBM . Median sequencing depth RNA-seq after removal of ltering was (IQR 9,842,494 -29,087,373) The median RNA mass was 7.03 pg (2.7 -4750 pg). There were nine cases of de nite TBM and 13 probable TBM cases in the test cohort. mNGS detected TB in six of the de nite TBM cases, for a sensitivity of 6/9 (66.6%). In the probable TBM group, mNGS detected one case of TB, one case of Toxoplasma gondii , one case of C. neoformans , T. gondii and varicella zoster virus (VZV) co-infection, and one case of T. gondii and C. co-infection. The case with T. gondii andC. neoformans co-infection was a repeat CSF sample present in the training cohort which the authors were blinded to. The MLC correctly called seven out of nine cases of de nite TBM as TBM for a sensitivity of 77.7%. The MLC called three cases as TBM in the probable TBM group. One of these cases had TB detected by mNGS (Fig. 1), and the other two cases had no pathogen identi ed. We compared the MLC failures and successes and saw no statistically signi cant differences regarding their RNA mass, CSF cell counts or the number of protein-coding genes with non-zero counts (Supplementary Fig. 2B). mNGS results for entire cohort . Sequences aligning to M. tuberculosis were detected by RNA-seq, DNA-seq or both in 37cases throughout the cohort (Supplementary Table 2). TB was detected by mNGS in 74.4% (29/39) of de nite TBM cases. TB detected by mNGS in 12.5% (3/24) of cases classi ed as probable (i.e., negative CSF TB PCR and TB culture). Thus,overall sensitivity for detecting TB by mNGS in cases de ned as de nite or probable TBM was 50.8% (32/63). Sensitivity increased to 54.2% (32/59) when excluding cases from the probable TBM group in which mNGS detected alternate infections. TB was detected in 3.8% (4/104) of cases classi ed as possible TBM or indeterminate. TB was identi ed as a co-infection in one patient with CM (Not-TBM group) for whom TB culture and Xpert Ultra had not been performed. Regarding alternate infections, one denite TBM case had a T. gondii co-infection detected by mNGS. As stated, mNGS detected four cases with non-TB infections in the probable TBM group, including three cases previously mentioned in the test cohort results section ( C. neo- formans in one case, T. gondii in one case and a T. gondii and VZV co-infection in another), and one case of a T. gondii andC. neoformans co-infection in the training cohort. Viral infections . Nineteen neuroinvasive viruses (other than HIV-1) were detected by mNGS across the entire cohort (Table 2). As described above, VZV was detected as a co-infection with T. gondii in a case classi ed as probable TBM. Ten viruses were detected in the possible TBM and indeterminate groups (herpes sub-Saharan Africa24,25, was identi ed along with TB (see Supplementary Information for clinical history). mNGS yielded 5739.5 rPM with 96.1% coverage across the Wesselsbron virus genome (Fig. 2D and Supplementary methods for phylogenetic tree). Nine additional viruses were detected and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) n=2 were detected as co- infections in patients with CM (Fig. 2C). In addition, viral reads to likely nonpathogenic viruses were detected (Supplementary Data 2). Bacterial infections . We identi ed nine cases of bacterial meningitis, including four cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Fig. 2C). All four of the cases were categorized as acute bacterial meningitis by hospital discharge diagnosis (Not-TBM group) (Table 2). One case of Nocardia brasiliensis was detected by CSF mNGS in a patient classi ed as possible TBM. Four cases of Neisseria meningitidis were detected. Two of these cases had a clinical diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (Not-TBM group). One case was in the possible / indeterminate group, and the other case was a co-infection in a patient with CM (Not-TBM group). mNGS also detected C. neoformans in this case (9.21 rPM). Parasitic infections . Fifteen cases of T. gondii were identi ed. One case was identi ed as a co-infection in a patient with de nite TBM, three cases were identi ed in patients classi ed as probable TBM, one case which also had C. neoformans identi ed on mNGS (CSF CrAg negative), and another with a co-infection with VZV (as described above). Six cases of T. gondii were identi ed in patients classi ed as possible TBM, and four were identi ed as co- infections in patients with CM (Table 2).

The combined assay detected three cases of TB in the probable TBM group and eight additional TBM cases initially classi ed as possible TBM. Improvement in speci city of the combined assay from the standalone host MLC classi er was due to eight cases that wereclassi ed as TBM by the MLC but were found to have other pathogens detected on mNGS, which overruled the MLC classi- cation. These were three cases of N. meningitidis , three cases of C. neoformans , one case of VZV, and one case of EBV. One case of denite TBM had lumbar punctures (LPs) performed on days 1 and 3 post-initiation of TBM treatment. Day 1 CSF was used as part of the MLC training cohort, and TB was detected by mNGS. Day 3 CSF was used in the test cohort to which the authors were blinded. mNGS failed to detect TB in the day 3 CSF; however, the MLC still classi ed this sample as TBM. We considered this a failure of TB detection by mNGS when analyzing the test cohort data. Fig. 1 Development of a host-based machine learning classi er from cerebrospinal fluid RNA-seq data.

Shallow depth sequencing of the test set had no impact on MLCsensitivity or speci city: MLC1 sequencing MLC results) as TBM, and 59/75 OND cases as OND at all subsampled depths down to 100,000 reads. The nal AUC, sensitivity, and specicity for the MLC1 were calculated once the optimal threshold determined for the mNGS assay. mNGS subsampling . mNGS results from the original samples were used as a baseline for comparison at various subsampling depths. DNA-seq libraries in which TB was detected for the entire cohort at the original sequencing depth ( n=25) had 500,000 reads (8/25). RNA-seq libraries in which TB was detected for the entire cohort at the original sequencing depth(n=9) had TB detected with 100% sensitivity (9/9) at a sub- sampling depth of 2,000,000 reads and 88.9% sensitivity (8/9) at 100,000 reads (Supplementary Table 3). For non-TB pathogens, 15 DNA and 6 RNA samples consisting of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections were analyzed, including one sample with a co-infection. For DNA-seq, at a subsample depth of 500,000 reads, mNGS detected 100% of the pathogens that were detected at the original sequencing depth. At the lowest subsample depth of 100,000 reads, 13/15 (86.67%) of pathogens were detected. When subsampling RNA-seq libraries at a depth of 2,000,000 or 100,000 reads, 6/6 (100%) of pathogens detected at the original sequencing depths were detected (Supplementary Table 3).Table 2 All non-TBM pathogens detected in entire cohort.

While TB detection by mNGS at shallow sequencing depths was insensitive, the MLC classi er still maintained similar sensitivity to classify TBM at 100,000 paired-end reads. We therefore reran all microbiologically proven samples from the nal test cohort (n=84) at 100,000 reads for RNA-seq and 500,000 reads for DNA-seq for through the MLC and the open source, cloud-based metagenomics pipeline (Chan Zuckerberg ID or CZID)26pipeline to assess AUC, sensitivity and speci city of our in silico low depthsequencing model. The MLC had an AUC (Fig. 1C). Cost analysis . At a depth of 100,000 reads for the RNA library and 500,000 reads for the DNA library, one sample would require 600,000 total paired-end reads. An Illumina iSeq generates 8,000,000 paired-end reads per flow cell. Thus, at 600,000 reads Fig. 2 Pathogen detection by mNGS. A Detection of TB for entire cohort.

Discussion Characterizing the epidemiology of infectious and non-infectious etiologies of meningitis and encephalitis is inherently challenging and only compounded by the limited diagnostic capacity in sub- Saharan Africa 27-29. Because of the high prevalence of advanced HIV-1 and TB infections in Uganda , C. neoformans and TB are the most commonly diagnosed causes of meningitis. Yet, the etiology of many other cases of meningitis and/or encephalitis is never known30. Here, we utilized unbiased CSF mNGS to obtain a more comprehensive pro le of neurologic infections (and co- infections) in Ugandan adults with subacute meningitis living with HIV. We identi ed many treatable and vaccine-preventable infections. In addition, we describe the rst use of human tran- scriptomic data generated by a CSF mNGS assay to combine direct detection of pathogens with a host-based MLC that iden- ties patients with or without TBM. The diagnosis of TBM remains dif cult due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease. While mNGS can detect TB in CSF, mNGS still has limited sensitivity, akin to TB PCR14-16.H e r e ,m N G S demonstrated 74.4% concordance against microbiologically con- rmed cases of TBM nite TBM) and 54.2% concordance against the UCD of de nite and probable TBM after removing probable TBM cases in whom mNGS identi ed an alternate infection. We detected an additional ve cases of TBM missed by conventional testing in the possible TBM and indeterminate groups and a sixth case in a patient diagnosed with CM (Not-TBM group), who did not undergo conventional testing for TBM. mNGS identi ed 43 additional neurological infections that were either sole or co-infections, including neuroinvasive viruses like Wesselsbron virus, a flavivirus endemic to the region that mainly infects livestock24but with several reports of human infections, including neuroinvasive disease25,31. This virus was present in a patient co-infected with TB (Supplementary Infor- mation). We also and rubella virus). Measles can present with varying CNS manifestations, including measles inclusion body encephalitis occurring in HIV-infected patients32. Two cases of human parvovirus were detected. Neurological manifesta- tions of human parvovirus B19 have been previously described in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients33.I n addition to viral infections, we found 15 cases of CNS tox- oplasmosis and 1 case of CNS morbid but treatable conditions if diagnosed early34,35. Despite the relatively pauci-cellular content of many CSF samples in this cohort of immunocompromi sed patients, we recovered a rich human gene expression dataset, detecting transcripts to an average of more than 3000 genes/sample. Leveraging these data, we built a sensitive MLC to distinguish TBM from ONDs that can mimic TBM. Five of six de nite TBM cases in the test cohort were classi ed correctly, improving upon the dir ect detection of TB in 3/6 cases by mNGS. Our MLC primarily uses four genes to classify TBM: GBP5 ,SOD2 ,NFKBIA ,a in flam- masome responses to pathogenic bacteria36,37,a n di sp a r to fa3 gene signature ( GBP5 ,DUSP3 ,a n d KLF2 ) that distinguishes active pulmonary TB from other infections38,39. Additional studies using GBP5 have also distinguished TB from non-TB pneumonia with >90% sensitivity and speci city40,41. The three other primary genes (SOD2 ,NFKBIA ,a n d FTL)u s e di no u rM L Ch a v en o tb e e n described in other TB host gene expres sion signatures. Interestingly, SOD2-mediated acidi cation of phagosomes has been shown to promote survival of TB in their host and serves as a marker for oxidative stress42-44. Ferritin has been recognized as an important factor in host immunity against TB, and ferritin heavy chain in particular has been shown to protect against TB in murine studies45. NFKBIA is a member of the NF-kappa-B (NF- B) inhibitor family. NF-B signaling dynamics, triggered via tumor necrosis factor- binding to receptors on macrophages, has been shown to play a key role for survival of TB46.P a r t i c u l a r l y ,B a ie ta l . ,r e p o r t e dt h a tN F - B inhibition, decreased survival of TB in macrophages47. Overall, the MLC was optimized for high sensitivity, but there was a trade-off with speci city. The MLC performed poorly classifying OND cases that had infections which were not present in the training cohort. For instance, three of four cases of N. meningitidis were classi ed as TBM. Fortunately, coupling case classi cation by the host MLC with direct detection of pathogens by mNGS enhanced the overall speci city of the assay. In other words, direct detection of a pathogen by mNGS overruled the MLC if a pathogen other than TB was detected. Training the MLC on a larger cohort of patients with a wider range of ONDs will further improve accuracy. Implementing these technologies in low resource settings is critical to improve prospective diagnoses and the institution of appropriate therapies. The utility of our diagnostic tool is not only its ability to detect TB, but also co-infections and infectious TB mimics with enhanced sensitivity for TB enabled by the host MLC analysis whose data are generated as part of the mNGS assay. Our in silico analyses suggest that only an average of 600,000 paired-end reads are required to achieve results thatwe and others have traditionally achieved with millions or tens of millions of reads/sample 10,14,48. In addition to an estimated per sample cost of $75, the cost-effectiveness of this assay will likely be enhanced in low resource settings lacking numerous pathogen- specic PCR assays and other diagnostic modalities commonly at the disposal of clinicians in high resource settings. Thus, mNGS, may serve as a \"leapfrog \"technology in this context. This study has several additional limitations. It remains to be determined how well the genes that comprise the MLC translate to immunocompetent individuals though we are heartened that the key genes in our classi er have signi cant overlap with host transcriptomic studies in pulmonary TB, including non-HIV- positive patient populations39. In addition, host responses may vary between patients with different genetic backgrounds and based on the virulence of the infecting TB strain. Although almost all LPs were performed prior to initiation of therapy, we did not have data about prehospital antibiotic treatment, which may have impacted CSF pathogen load and host gene expression pro les. As illustrated in the case vignettes (Supplementary Information), we made every attempt to clinically correlate candidate pathogens detected by mNGS (in addition to con rmatory laboratory test- ing). However, the lack of widely available advanced neuroima- ging and other testing modalities limited clinical adjudication to some degree. This is re flected in the fact that we detected high levels of HIV in the CSF of many patients, some of whom likely had HIV-associated dementia. However, we were not able to condently classify them as such. Additionally, while we had a large cohort of patients, the number of cases of de nite TBM in the training and test cohorts was small which limited theARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29353-x 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2022) 13:1675 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29353-x | www.nature.com/naturecommunicationsprecision of the point estimates for the sensitivity, speci city, and AUC of the combined assay. Currently mNGS is an expensive technology; however, research is underway to make this tool more accessible, especially for lowresource settings where the burden of infectious diseases is high and the availability of many pathogen-speci c assays is low 48-50. Here, we demonstrated that mNGS identi ed many previously undiagnosed but treatable neurologic infections, even in patients already diagnosed with one cause of infectious meningitis. In addition, we developed a rst-of-its-kind combined diagnostic assay utilizing mNGS and analysis of the CSF host transcriptome to diagnose TBM vs other non-TB meningitis etiologies. The accuracy of this method will only increase with the incorporation of larger patient numbers and holds the promise of more sensi- tively and rapidly detecting TBM along with TBM co-infections and TBM mimics, many of which are treatable or vaccine- preventable illnesses. Lastly, the ability to generate useful host transcriptomic data from pauci-cellular CSF augurs well for developing future MLCs that distinguish between other clinically overlapping neuroin flammatory syndromes like viral and auto- immune encephalitis. Methods Study cohort . All research was conducted complies with all ethical regulations. Patients were prospectively recruited as part of the \"Improving Diagnostics and Neurocognitive Outcomes in HIV/AIDS-related Meningitis \"study (NCT01802385), a prospective cohort study underway in Uganda. Although some patients studied here later enrolled into other unrelated clinical trials, the analyses in this study of baseline CSF specimens are not related to the outcomes of anytherapeutic intervention. Research was approved by University of Minnesota (IRB Study ID STUDY00006856), Infectious Diseases Institute at Makerere University and the Mulago Hospital Research and Ethics Committee (IRB Study IDMHREC1246), and University of California San Francisco (IRB 13 -12236). All HIV-positive patients presenting with signs and symptoms concerning for meningitis (presentation with some combination of headache, fever, nuchal rigidity, neurologic de cit, or altered mental status) to Kiruddu Regional Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda from March 2018 to March 2020 were screened forstudy inclusion. LP was performed during days 1 -3 of admission utilizing a standardized diagnostic algorithm. All patients had extensive demographic, clinical, biochemical, and microbial data collected. However, CD4 +T cell counts and HIV viral loads were not available for the majority of patients. Clinical data included presenting signs and symptoms, prior TB history and prophylaxis, response to antimicrobial and adjunctive treatments, and hospital discharge status. BaselineCSF cell count, protein, glucose, microscopy, gram stain, bacterial cultures, CrAg, and fungal culture were obtained for all participants. If the CrAg was positive, the patient was treated for CM, and no further microbiological diagnostic testing was performed. If the CSF CrAg was negative, CSF Gene Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and TB culture were performed to evaluate for TBM 8. If TB was detected by either of these tests, the patient was considered to have de nite TBM. The BioFire\u00aeFilmArray\u00ae Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel was performed on a subset ( n=52) of CSF samples, regardless of presumed diagnosis based on the clinician 's discretion. For all enrollees, ~1 mL of CSF was collected in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield collection tubes (Zymo Research; Irving, CA) and subsequently frozen at 70 \u00b0C within 8 h of collection and shipped in batches to the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) for mNGS on dry ice (Fig. 3). Final clinical diagnoses and case classi cations were adjudicated based on investigations performed in Uganda and per the consensus TBM UCD8 (Supplementary Table 4), respectively. Cases were categorized into de nite TBM (microbiologically proven), probable TBM (score > 10 points), possible TBM (score6-9 points), indeterminate (score < 6 points and without a microbiologically conrmed alternate infection), and Not-TBM (microbiologically con rmed alternate infection). Alternate diseases in the Not-TBM category included CM, bacterial meningitis, and viral meningitis (Table 1). Cerebrospinal fluid mNGS . Total nucleic acid was extracted from 90 uL of CSF using the Zymo Quick -DNA/RNA MagBead (Zymo Cat. No. R2130) via the Agilent Bravo or the Integra Via flo 96, in batches of 40 -96 samples and eluted into 50 uL of sterile water. The nucleic acid was then divided with half undergoing DNAse treatment to isolate RNA and the remainder being used for DNA sequencing (DNA-Seq). Total nucleic acid was also extracted from no-template water controls. ERCC RNAs were spiked into the RNA fractions at 25 pg to later back-calculate RNA mass and use as positive internal controls 23. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries were prepared using the New England Biolabs 'NEBNext Ultra II RNA library preparation kit (NEB Cat No. E7770) as per the protocol. Library preparation was performed in bulk using the Echo Labcyte525 and Agilent Bravo or Integra Via flo 96 liquid handling robots51. DNA libraries were prepared using the New England Biolabs 'NEBNext \u00aeUltra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit (E7805L) as per the protocol using the Echo Labcyte 525 and Agilent Bravo liquid handling robots. Host ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using the Qiagen QIAseq FastSelect RNA removal kit (Qiagen Cat No.333180) at 1:100 dilution. The RNA-Seq libraries for 205 samples from both training and test cohorts underwent ERCC depletion using DASH. DASH is a CRISPR-Cas9 technology the removes abundant sequences from mNGS libraries.CRISPR-Cas-9 guide RNAs (gRNAs) were created to target ERCC sequences. DASH treatment is performed after ligation of adapters barcoding of the RNA-seq library. gRNAs targe ERCC sequences. These regions in the library are cleaved, leaving only the fragments with intact adapters on both ends to be further ampli ed and sequenced 22. Shallow sequencing was performed on an Illumina iSeq to calculate pooling volumes. Then pooled libraries were size selected using Ampure beads and sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq base pair sequencing. . A open used are uploaded to CZID (czi- d.org), which performs several processing steps prior to analysis of non-host data.Therst step in the pipeline is an alignment to the human genome to remove host sequences. Remaining sequences after this initial human alignment step were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SequenceRead Archive (SRA) with the primary accession codes PRJNA773920 ( https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA773920 ). As a result, these data les contain non-host sequences not only from pathogens but also from environmental contaminants from skin and the laboratory, including bacteria, fungi, non- pathogenic viruses, and even vertebrates. Subsequent steps in the CZID pipeline(i.e., removal of low-quality reads, duplicate reads. low complexity reads, and additional human sequence ltering) further reduce contaminating and unin- formative sequences from the nonhuman dataset. The remaining sequencesundergo an assembly-based alignment using an indexed version of the NCBI 's GenBank database to identify the source of nonhuman sequences in the datasets. Additional computational steps detailed below that are speci c to different types of pathogens were used to discriminate between likely environmental contaminants and candidate pathogens. Given its paucibacillary nature, the abundance of TB DNA in CSF, as measured by rpM, can fall below the reporting thresholds in clinical mNGS assays 14.W e therefore identi ed the optimal reporting threshold for TB using the training cohort and used this threshold on the test cohort. Regarding common causes of bacterial meningitis, sequences in low abundance in CSF mNGS datasets secondary to environmental, specimen handling, and/or water contamination. Reads aligning to these pathogens were normalized using compression ratios obtained from the CZID pipeline. The relative abundance for these organisms was calculated in log10(rpM) by RNA-Seq ( x-axis) versus DNA- Seq ( y-axis) (Fig. 2C). When these bacteria were detected with both RNA and DNA abundance greater than 1 log relative to the mean abundance of the entire cohort, they were considered likely pathogens rather than environmental contaminants. A positive detection of a fungus or parasite required an rpM ratio of 10, where the rpM ratio =rpM CSF sample/rpM no-template control (NTC), or rpM ratio=rpM CSF sample if rpM NTC =052. Candidate viral pathogens had to have known neuroinvasive potential and at least one sequence and its mate pair both aligning speci cally to the virus 'genome. Given that EBV and CMV can be incidentally detected by pathogen-speci c PCR and/or CSF mNGS without clear disease association, only clear outlier cases de ned as log10 (rPM) two-fold greater than the mean abundance of the entire cohort were presumed pathogenic within the context of patients with advanced HIV infection. Neuroinvasive viruses,bacteria, fungi, and parasites identi ed by mNGS were orthogonally validated with pathogen-speci c PCR, clinical microbiological tests performed in Uganda (e.g., CrAg and fungal culture) or repeat mNGS on an independent CSF aliquot. Development of a host gene expression MLC to discriminate between TBM (without co-infection) and non-TB etiologies . We created a training cohort to identify the optimal reporting threshold for TB and to build the MLC classi er. The cohort included patients with de nite TBM and other neurological diseases (ONDs). Patients from the OND group were selected from the probable TBM, possible TBM / indeterminate and Not-TBM groups, including cases with viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens, along with cases with only low abundance HIV,EBV, and/or CMV. This was done to prevent biasing the training set to a particular OND and to provide a more accurate representation of the overall patient population. The work flow for the training of the MLC is presented in Fig. 3A. Human gene counts were generated with Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) ( v2.5.3a) from the CZID analysis pipeline26using human genome assembly build 38 v23. Transcript counts for human protein-coding genes ( n=19,590) from the samples comprising the training set were used as an input for building the MLC.Samples were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values using calcNormFactors andlogCPM functions from the edgeR R package that were adapted in python v3.6.21 53. Additionally, age, sex, GCS, and CSF white cell countsNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29353-x ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2022) 13:1675 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29353-x | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 9were included as a priori suspected co-variates. As the number of genes used as input (19,590) was larger than the number of samples used to train the classi er, we used feature selection (Univariate Feature Selection, scikit-learn v.0.21.3) to reduce the dimensionality of the input vector and identify the smallest set of genes most predictive of TBM and OND. Finally, ve different ML methods (logistic regression, random forest, SVM, elastic net, and XGBoost) were evaluated to determine the best performing classi er. We chose to evaluate these MLC methods because they are \"interpretable \". In other words, the genes used for classi cation are known so it is possible to extract decision rules. Final parameters for the MLC were chosen using cross-validation (80/20 split) to avoid over tting. The classi er with the highest sensitivity (followed by AUC, and speci city) was chosen as the nal classi er. Testing of a combined mNGS and host gene expression MLC . A test cohort of patients with TBM and ONDs was created to assess the sensitivity and speci city of the host gene expression MLC alone and the combined mNGS and host-based gene expression MLC assay for diagnosing patients with or without TBM. UCSFinvestigators were blinded to any sample or case details. The nal combined assay used both the mNGS (both DNA-seq and RNA-seq) and host MLC resulting in a single test for the detection of TBM versus OND. If the MLC classi ed a casedifferently than the pathogens detected by mNGS assay (meeting preset mNGS thresholds), then the mNGS results would overrule the MLC due to the pre- sumption that direct detection of a pathogen was more speci c than categorization of disease based on a host response signature. Patients with TBM for whom there was evidence of a CNS co-infection found on mNGS (other than HIV) were notused in the nal test set. The reference standard was a microbiological composite of conventional CSF testing (e.g., CSF CrAg, fungal culture, Gram stain, bacterial culture, Gene Xpert MTB/RIF TB culture) and orthogonally (other than TB). In silico evaluation of mNGS and a host gene expression MLC with shallow depth sequencing for low resource settings . To assess whether similar results were achievable at shallow depth sequencing to better enable mNGS diagnostics in lower resource settings, we subsampled our test dataset at various sequencing depths (i.e., 100,000 to 2 million reads) and analyzed the impact on the sensitivity and speci city of the assay for pathogen identi cation and the accuracy of the host gene expression MLC. First, all samples were aligned to the ERCC transcripts usingSTAR (v2.5.3a) to lter out any remaining ERCC sequences that were not removed through DASH. Next, les were each subsampled in triplicate using seqtk (v1.2- r94) at the following sequencing depths: 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 500,000, Fig. 3 Study work flow.Four major components of the study: recruitment, library preparation, analysis, and creation of the combined assay.

Subsampled les were then aligned to the human genome using STAR to obtain transcript counts, which were then run through MLC1 classi er. Subsampled les were also uploaded to the CZID pipeline for mNGS analysis. Statistics . Final diagnostic accuracy of the combined assay (AUC, sensitivity, and specicity) was based on comparing the results against a composite of clinical diagnostic testing results and orthogonally con rmed mNGS-identi ed pathogens. The p-value for the was calculated in GraphPad Prism, u sing a two-tailed test for hypotheses and assuming that the null hypothesis value for the AUC was 0.5. Baseline clinical char- acteristics and demographic data were compared between cohorts via Mann-Whitney U for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Reporting summary .
