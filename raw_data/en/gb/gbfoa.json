Influenza vaccines are the most effective and cost-effective means to control influenza. Current influenza vaccines mainly induce neutralizing antibodies against highly variable globular head of hemagglutinin and lack cross-protection. Vaccine adjuvants have been approved to enhance seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly and spare influenza vaccine doses. Clinical studies found that MF59 and AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines could induce cross-protective immunity against non-vaccine viral strains. In addition to MF59 and AS03 adjuvants, experimental adjuvants, such as Toll-like receptor agonists, saponin-based adjuvants, cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin-based mucosal adjuvants, and physical adjuvants, are also able to broaden influenza vaccine-induced immune responses against non-vaccine strains. This review focuses on introducing the various types of adjuvants capable of assisting current influenza vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity in preclinical and clinical studies. Mechanisms of licensed MF59 and AS03 adjuvants to induce cross-protective immunity are also introduced. Vaccine adjuvants hold a great promise to adjuvant influenza vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-01-21", "cleaned_text": "on the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza causes 3-5 million severe illnesses and 290,000-650,000 deaths each year worldwide. Influenza viruses are negative-sensed, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00075), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075)]. Influenza viruses belong to the virus family Orthomyxoviridae [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00075), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075)]. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00075)]. Human influenza is often caused by type A and B viruses [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075)]. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are highly abundant viral surface proteins with important roles in viral infection and release [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075)]. There are a total of 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes, giving rise to 198 possible influenza A subtypes [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075)]. Not all influenza A subtypes have been found in nature [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00075)]. The natural hosts of influenza A viruses are wild aquatic birds, although influenza A viruses have also adapted to a variety of avian and mammalian species [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00075)]. H1N1 and H3N2 are two major influenza A subtypes that cause annual influenza epidemics in humans [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00075)]. Different from influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses have only two lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) and only infect humans and seals [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00075)]. Influenza viruses have a high mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00075)]. Based on reports, the annual mutation rates for the non-structural genes of influenza A and B viruses are about 2.0 \u00d7 103 and 0.6 \u00d7 103 nucleotide substitutions/site, respectively [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00075)]. The high mutation rates of influenza A viruses cause frequent sequence changes of HA, leading to antigenic drift [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00075), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00075)]. Antigenic drift enables influenza viruses to evade host immune surveillance and cause epidemics [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00075), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00075)]. The co-infection of different influenza A subtypes can also cause reassortment, a process by which influenza viruses exchange gene segments and generate new viruses [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00075)]. Due to the lack of preexisting immunity, the reassortant viruses have a high risk to cause influenza pandemics if sufficient human-to-human transmission can be established [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00075), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00075), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00075)]. Four major influenza pandemics have occurred in human history: the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, the 1957 H2N2 pandemic, the 1968 H3N2 pandemic, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00075), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00075)]. The 1918 influenza pandemic infected about one-third of the global population and claimed 50 million lives [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00075)]. The 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 influenza pandemics each claimed about one million lives [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00075), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00075)]. The most recent 2009 influenza pandemic claimed an estimated 151,700575,400 lives [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00075), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00075)]. The 1957 H2N2 influenza contains three genes from an avian influenza A virus, and the 1968 H3N2 influenza contains two genes from an avian influenza A virus [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00075)], while the 2009 H1N1 influenza contains a unique combination of genes from avian, human, and swine influenza A viruses [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00075)]. [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00075), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00075)]. Yet, current influenza vaccines mainly induce strain-specific protection with little or no protection against drifted or shifted viruses. Universal influenza vaccines are under active development to induce broad cross-protective immunity [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00075), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00075), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00075)]. In addition to a universal influenza vaccine approach, the incorporation of vaccine adjuvants has been found to broaden influenza vaccine-induced immune responses. This review focuses on introducing vaccine adjuvants that are capable of assisting current influenza vaccines to induce broad cross-protective immunity. 2. Current Influenza Vaccines and Limitations [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00075), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00075)]. Different types of influenza vaccines are available in the global market ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00075-t001)). Based on the number of vaccine viral strains, influenza vaccines can be divided into trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines with the former containing two type A (H1N1, H3N2) and one type B (Victoria or Yamagata) strains and the latter containing two type A (H1N1, H3N2) and two type B (Victoria and Yamagata) strains [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00075), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00075)]. Influenza vaccines can also be classified into inactivated or attenuated vaccines [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. Inactivated vaccines can be further divided into subunit, split-virion, and virosome vaccines [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines undergo limited proliferation in respiratory epithelial cells following intranasal (IN) delivery [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. Inactivated subunit vaccines are prepared by the disruption of viruses by detergents followed by purification of HA and NA as the major vaccine antigens [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. Inactivated split-virion vaccines are prepared by the disruption of viruses by detergents without further purification [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. As a result, split-virion vaccines contain additional viral components as compared to subunit vaccines [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. Virosome vaccines are prepared by the detergent solubilization of viral membrane followed by nucleocapsid removal and then detergent removal to allow the viral membrane to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00075)]. Influenza virosome vaccines simulate native viruses in cell binding and membrane fusion [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00075)]. Influenza virosome vaccine (Inflexal V) is the only influenza vaccine that has been approved for all age groups [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00075)]. Based on the production methods, influenza vaccines can be classified into egg, cell, or recombinant protein-based [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00075)]. Embryonic eggs have a long history of being used to expand influenza viruses to produce influenza vaccines [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00075)]. Yet, embryonic egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing is a lengthy process and also depends on egg supply [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00075)]. To overcome these limitations, cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing has been developed, in which influenza viruses are propagated in mammalian cells, such as Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00075)]. Cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing is not limited by egg supply and less likely to introduce viral mutations [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. Recombinant influenza vaccines have been developed based on recombinant DNA technologies [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00075)]. One such vaccine (Flublok) is produced in insect cells using Baculovirus Expression Systems [ [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00075)]. As compared to egg and cell-based vaccines, recombinant influenza vaccines can be more quickly produced without the use of live viruses [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00075)]. Based on the delivery routes, influenza vaccines can be classified into intramuscular (IM), intradermal (ID), and IN vaccines [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00075), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00075)]. Most of the inactivated influenza vaccines are delivered into the muscular tissue by hypodermic needles, while live-attenuated vaccines are delivered by Intranasal Sprayer to the upper respiratory tract [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00075)]. IN influenza vaccination provides an important alternative to needle-based IM vaccination for those who have needle phobia [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00075)]. Needle-free Jet Injectors, such as PharmaJet and Bioject ZetaJet, have been also developed for the IM delivery of inactivated influenza vaccines [ [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00075), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00075), [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00075)]. Due to the richness of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00075), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00075)], inactivated influenza vaccines are also approved for ID delivery by Intradermal Microinjection Systems and MicronJet600 to save vaccine dose and cost [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00075), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00075)]. Based on the usage, influenza vaccines can be divided into seasonal, pre-pandemic, and pandemic vaccines [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00075)]. Seasonal influenza vaccines are made based on viral strains predicted to circulate in the next flu season [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00075), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00075)]. Pre-pandemic influenza vaccines are prepared based on viral strains with a high risk to cause influenza pandemics, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H7N9 viruses [ [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00075), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00075)]. Pre-pandemic influenza vaccines are stockpiled to facilitate a quick response in case of real pandemics [ [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00075)]. Pandemic influenza vaccines are made based on pandemic viral stains to control the spread of pandemic influenza [ [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00075)]. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00075), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00075)]. HA is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and forms trimeric spikes on the influenza viral surface [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00075), [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00075), [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00075)]. To form functional HA, HA precursor HA0 needs to be cleaved by cellular protease to form HA1 and HA2 linked by disulfide bonds [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00075)]. Functional HA is composed of a globular head and a stem domain [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00075)]. The globular head is comprised of part of HA1, and the stem domain is comprised of the remaining HA1 and part of HA2 [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00075)]. The remaining HA2 is composed of a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic tail [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00075)]. HA plays crucial roles in viral infection. HA binds to sialic acids on the host cell surface and mediates the fusion of viral envelop with the late endosomal membrane of host cells2. Based on the sequence and antigenic relatedness of HA, influenza A viruses can be divided into group 1 which requires influenza vaccines to be manufactured each year. Considering that influenza viruses to circulate in the next flu season are predicted based on surveillance [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00075), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00075)], the selected vaccine viral strains may not exactly match circulating viral strains. Vaccine mismatch often leads to low vaccine effectiveness and surging influenza cases [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00075), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00075)]. In the 2014-2015 flu season, influenza A H3N2 viruses drifted significantly after the selection of vaccine viral strains [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00075)]. Consequently, influenza vaccine effectiveness against the drifted H3N2 strain was only 6%, and the overall vaccine effectiveness was only 19% [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00075)]. There were also significant vaccine mismatches in the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 flu seasons, which resulted in low vaccine effectiveness in the two flu seasons (10 and 21%, respectively) [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00075)]. In contrast, vaccine effectiveness is usually between 40 and 60% with a good vaccine match [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00075)]. Egg-based vaccine manufacturing sometimes introduces mutations in immunodominant regions of HA, leading to reduced vaccine effectiveness [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00075)]. [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00075), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00075)]. HPAI H5N1 viruses mainly infect birds and are highly contagious among them [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00075)]. The first human infection of H5N1 was identified in 1997 amid a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong, China [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00075)]. H5N1 viruses have infected about 700 people in primarily 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Near East with 60% lethality rate [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00075)]. The first human infection of H7N9 occurred in China in 2013 [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00075)]. Ever since, H7N9 has caused almost annual epidemics in humans [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00075)]. The largest epidemic caused about 766 human infections in 2016-2017 [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00075)]. Overall, H7N9 caused more than 1500 human infections with a lethality rate of 39% [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00075)]. Although most H5N1 and H7N9 infections in humans were due to the close contact with poultry, human-to-human transmission may occur as a result of viral gene reassortment [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00075)]. Different types of H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines have been developed and evaluated in clinical studies that include subunit, split-virion, and whole-inactivated vaccines [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00075), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00075)]. H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines often require two immunizations and high antigen amounts (45 or 90 \u00b5g) to induce protective immune responses due to their low immunogenicity [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00075), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00075), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00075), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00075)]. Molecular epidemiology studies found that H5N1 viruses had evolved into different clades and subclades, and H7N9 viruses had evolved into distinct lineages [ [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00075), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00075)]. Similar to the seasonal influenza vaccine, H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines alone lack the ability to induce cross-clade or cross-lineage immunity [ [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00075), [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00075)]. 3. Vaccine Adjuvants [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00075), [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00075)]. Considering vaccines are mainly given to healthy populations, adjuvants need to have a high level of safety to be approved for human use [ [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00075), [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00075), [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00075)]. Experimental adjuvants, such as complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvants, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and a variety of cytokines, possess potent vaccine adjuvant effects and yet are less likely to be approved for human use due to their high risk to induce significant local or systemic adverse reactions [ [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00075), [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00075), [69](#B69-vaccines-09-00075)]. [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00075), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00075), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00075)]. Alum adjuvant was discovered in 1920s by Raman and Glenny based on the observation that the precipitation of vaccines on insoluble aluminum salts could enhance vaccine-induced immune responses [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00075), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00075), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00075)]. Then, Alum adjuvant was incorporated into tetanus and diphtheria vaccines and broadly used in humans [ [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00075), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00075), [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00075)]. Interestingly, Alum adjuvant was ineffective to enhance seasonal, pre-pandemic, or pandemic influenza vaccine efficacy [ [73](#B73-vaccines-09-00075), [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00075), [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00075), [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00075)]. Alum adjuvant mainly induces type 2 T helper (Th2)-biased immune responses and was originally thought to act through an \"antigen depot\". In 2012, Hutchison et al. found that the removal of Alum depot as early as 2 h after administration had no significant impact on antigen-specific T and B cell responses [ [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00075)]. Instead, Kool et al. found that Alum adjuvant could induce uric acid release and activate inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) to mediate its adjuvant effects [ [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00075)]. Several studies also found that Alum adjuvant could activate the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NALP3) inflammasome, leading to Caspase-1 activation and interleukin 1 (IL-1) release [ [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00075), [80](#B80-vaccines-09-00075), [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00075)]. Yet, the depletion of NALP3 only affected antigen-specific IgE but not IgG1 or IgG2 antibody production [ [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00075), [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00075), [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00075)]. More work is needed to elucidate how Th2-biased immune responses are induced by Alum-adjuvanted vaccines [ [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00075), [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00075)]. Alum adjuvant remained the only adjuvant for more than half a century until squalene emulsion-based MF59 adjuvant was approved by European Authorities in 1997 to enhance seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly [ [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00075), [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00075), [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00075)]. MF59 was approved in 2015 to enhance seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly in the United States [ [88](#B88-vaccines-09-00075), [89](#B89-vaccines-09-00075)]. MF59 has been also licensed to boost seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy in children aged 6 months to 2 years old in Canada since 2015 [ [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00075)]. In addition to seasonal influenza vaccines, MF59 has been also incorporated into pre-pandemic H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines to spare vaccine doses [ [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00075), [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00075)]. Overall, millions of MF59-containing influenza vaccine doses have been administered in humans with a good safety profile [ [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00075), [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00075), [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00075)]. After MF59, several as AS01, AS03, and AS04, were approved for human use [ [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00075), [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00075)]. AS04 is prepared by the adsorption of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) onto Alum adjuvant and was approved to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine efficacy in 2009 [ [95](#B95-vaccines-09-00075), [96](#B96-vaccines-09-00075)]. MPL is a non-toxic derivative of LPS and a potent Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist [ [98](#B98-vaccines-09-00075), AS03 was incorporated into the influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine in Europe [ [100](#B100-vaccines-09-00075), [101](#B101-vaccines-09-00075)]. AS03 was also incorporated into the pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine stockpiled in the United States [ [102](#B102-vaccines-09-00075)]. AS02 are was approved to boost pre-erythrocytic RTS, S malaria vaccine efficacy in 2015 [ [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00075), [105](#B105-vaccines-09-00075), [106](#B106-vaccines-09-00075)]. Recently, CpG 1018 was approved to boost hepatitis B VLP vaccine efficacy [ [107](#B107-vaccines-09-00075), [108](#B108-vaccines-09-00075)]. CpG [107](#B107-vaccines-09-00075), [109](#B109-vaccines-09-00075)]. An overview adjuvants is summarized in [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00075-t002). [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00075), [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00075)]. Different types of adjuvants have been explored to increase seasonal, pre-pandemic, and pandemic influenza vaccine efficacy, spare vaccine doses, and broaden vaccine-induced immune responses. This review focuses on introducing vaccine adjuvants capable of assisting current influenza vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity. 4. Vaccine Adjuvants Assist Influenza Vaccines to Induce Cross-Protective Immunity [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00075-t003)). In addition to licensed adjuvants, various types of experimental adjuvants were found to also assist influenza vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity, such as TLR agonists Vaccine [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00075)]. MF59-adjuvanted vaccine induced higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) geometric mean titer (GMT) and higher seroconversion rates than the non-adjuvanted vaccine in each flu season [ [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00075)]. Interestingly, the MF59-adjuvanted but not the non-adjuvanted vaccine in the 1992-1993 flu season induced significant HI GMT against heterologous viruses used to produce seasonal influenza vaccines for the 1993-1994 flu season [ [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00075)]. This study hinted that MF59 might broaden influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses against non-vaccine viral strains. This hypothesis was confirmed in a later study, in which Ansaldi et al. compared HI GMT and seroconversion rates of MF59-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines in the 2004-2005 flu season against heterologous H3N2 viruses circulated in four prior and two subsequent flu seasons in the elderly [ [111](#B111-vaccines-09-00075)]. The MF59-adjuvanted vaccine induced significantly higher HI GMT against heterologous H3N2 strains circulated in subsequent flu seasons and significantly higher seroconversion rates against heterologous H3N2 strains circulated in prior and subsequent flu seasons as compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine [ [111](#B111-vaccines-09-00075)]. In addition to the elderly, MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine also induced heterologous immunity in young children. Nolan et al. found that the MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine induced significantly higher HI GMT and seroconversion rates against heterologous type A and B viruses in infants and young children than the non-adjuvanted vaccine [ [112](#B112-vaccines-09-00075)]. 4.1.2. Induction of Cross-Clade Immunity against Moreover, two priming doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine also induced significant neutralizing antibody titer against clade 2 strain (A/Turkey/Turkey/1/05) [ [113](#B113-vaccines-09-00075)]. The cross-clade antibody responses significantly dropped 6 months later and yet could be boosted to above the protective levels by a single dose of the same vaccine [ [113](#B113-vaccines-09-00075)]. In addition to adults, the MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine could also induce cross-clade antibody responses in pediatrics. Vesikari et al. found that two priming doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) could induce significant microneutralization (MN) antibody titer against clade 2 strains (A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/Anhui/1/2005) in pediatrics [ [114](#B114-vaccines-09-00075)]. Despite significantly reduced antibody levels one year later, MN antibody titer against clade 2 strains could be boosted to more than 40 in most of the pediatrics by a single dose of the same vaccine [ [114](#B114-vaccines-09-00075)]. These studies found that MF59 adjuvant was crucial to induce cross-clade antibody responses in homologous prime/boost immunizations. MF59 was also in heterologous prime/boost 1 H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) vaccine boost 6 years later could induce more rapid, higher, and longer duration of cross-reactive antibody responses against clade 0, 1, and 2 strains as compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine prime and MF59-adjuvanted clade 1 H5N1 vaccine boost [ [115](#B115-vaccines-09-00075)]. This study indicated crucial roles of MF59 adjuvant in the H5N1 vaccine prime to induce cross-clade antibody responses after boost with heterologous H5N1 vaccine years later. The above studies support the incorporation of MF59 adjuvant in stockpiled H5N1 vaccines to facilitate the induction of cross-clade antibody responses following homologous and heterologous prime/boost [116](#B116-vaccines-09-00075)]. Hatta et al. found that the MF59-like AddaVax adjuvant could significantly increase H7N9 vaccine efficacy and induce cross-protection against an antigenically distinct and highly pathogenic H7N9 severe vaccination [ [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00075), [112](#B112-vaccines-09-00075), [113](#B113-vaccines-09-00075), [114](#B114-vaccines-09-00075), [115](#B115-vaccines-09-00075)]. Yet, MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines were observed to induce more frequent local and systemic adverse reactions than non-adjuvanted vaccines [ [110](#B110-vaccines-09-00075), [112](#B112-vaccines-09-00075), [113](#B113-vaccines-09-00075), [114](#B114-vaccines-09-00075), [115](#B115-vaccines-09-00075)]. The most common local adverse reaction was injection-site pain, and the most common systemic adverse reactions were myalgia and headache [ [112](#B112-vaccines-09-00075), [113](#B113-vaccines-09-00075), [115](#B115-vaccines-09-00075)]. Most of the local and systemic adverse reactions were mild to moderate without the need for medical treatments. 4.1.4. Mechanistic Insights [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. Whole-genome-fragment phage display libraries were used to map HA and NP epitopes capable of binding polyclonal antibodies of immune sera [ [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. It was found that MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine induced a high frequency (60%) of anti-HA1 antibodies and broad anti-NA antibodies [ [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. In contrast, non-adjuvanted and Alum-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines induced a low frequency of anti-HA1 antibodies (23% and 32%, respectively) and rare anti-NA antibodies [ [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. Moreover, MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine induced antibodies capable of binding long HA1 epitopes encompassing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is similar to those bound by broadly neutralizing antibodies [ [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. In contrast, non-adjuvanted and Alum-adjuvanted vaccines mainly induced antibodies capable of binding short HA1 epitopes [ [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. This study indicated that MF59 adjuvant could expand antibody repertoires to target protective HA sites and increase antibody avidities to properly folded HA1 [ [118](#B118-vaccines-09-00075)]. In a different study [ [119](#B119-vaccines-09-00075)], Khurana et al. found that MF59 adjuvant similarly enhanced influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine-induced antibody diversity and affinity, more significantly expanded anti-HA1 than anti-HA2 antibodies, and induced antibodies capable of binding properly folded HA1 globular head. These studies provide important insights on how MF59 adjuvant broadens influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses against non-vaccine 4.2.1. Cross-Clade Protection against Pre-Pandemic H5N1 Vaccine [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00075)]. Chu et al. found that two doses of AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) induced a 91.4% seroconversion rate against clade 2 strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005), while the non-adjuvanted vaccine only induced a 5.6% seroconversion rate against the same clade 2 strain [ [120](#B120-vaccines-09-00075)]. Langley et al. found that two doses of AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on clade 2 strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005) induced significant neutralizing antibody titer against clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) [ [121](#B121-vaccines-09-00075)]. These studies support the incorporation of AS03 adjuvant in H5N1 vaccines to induce cross-clade antibody responses following a two-dose regimen. [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00075)]. This study also found that heterologous prime/boost immunization was superior to homologous prime/boost immunization to induce cross-clade immunity [ [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00075)]. In support, homologous prime/boost immunization of the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on the clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) induced an 83.3% seroprotection rate against the clade 2 strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005) if the vaccines were given 6 months apart and a 41.5-54.5% seroprotection rate against the same clade 2 strain if the vaccines were given 21 days apart [ [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00075)]. In another study, Leroux-Roels et al. found that two-dose priming of the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on the clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) and a single dose boost of AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on the clade 2 strain (A/Indonesia/5/2005) could induce rapid immune responses against the clade 2 vaccine strain [ [123](#B123-vaccines-09-00075)]. In contrast, non-adjuvanted vaccine priming seemed to inhibit the induction of cross-clade immune responses [ [123](#B123-vaccines-09-00075)]. Sun et al. found that homologous or heterologous prime/boost immunization of AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on the clade 1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or clade 2 strain (A/Anhui/1/2005) could induce significant heterologous protection against antigenically distinct and highly pathogenic H5N2 vaccines also induced more frequent local and systemic adverse reactions than non-adjuvanted vaccines [ [120](#B120-vaccines-09-00075), [121](#B121-vaccines-09-00075), [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00075), [123](#B123-vaccines-09-00075)]. The most common local reaction was injection-site pain, and the most common systemic adverse reactions were myalgia and fatigue [ [120](#B120-vaccines-09-00075), [121](#B121-vaccines-09-00075), [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00075), [123](#B123-vaccines-09-00075)]. Most of the local and systemic adverse reactions were mild to moderate and self-resolved in days without the need for medical treatments [ [120](#B120-vaccines-09-00075), [121](#B121-vaccines-09-00075), [122](#B122-vaccines-09-00075), [123](#B123-vaccines-09-00075)]. It is also worth mentioning that the AS03-adjuvanted influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine (Pandemrix) caused increased cases of narcolepsy in adolescents in Sweden and Finland 3-6 months after vaccination [ [127](#B127-vaccines-09-00075), [128](#B128-vaccines-09-00075)], while the non-adjuvanted vaccine failed to increase narcolepsy cases in the United States [ [129](#B129-vaccines-09-00075)]. One study found that the HA peptide (275-287) of the pandemic virus could stimulate proliferation of hypocretin-responsive CD4+ T cells in narcolepsy patients [ [130](#B130-vaccines-09-00075)]. Since the pathologic hallmark of narcolepsy is the loss of hypocretin neurons [ [130](#B130-vaccines-09-00075)], immune responses against hypocretin might be responsible to the increased cases of narcolepsy following Pandemrix vaccination. Although MF59 and AS03 are emulsion-based adjuvants, the MF59-adjuvanted influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine failed to increase narcolepsy cases [ [131](#B131-vaccines-09-00075), [132](#B132-vaccines-09-00075)]. Therefore, the unique combination of AS03 adjuvant and the pandemic influenza vaccine likely caused the increased cases of narcolepsy following Pandemrix vaccination. 4.2.3. Mechanistic Insights [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00075)]. The AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine induced 10-fold higher anti-HA2 antibodies targeting the conserved H1/H5 region and also expanded antibody repertoires against the HA1 domain, especially against the long HA1 epitopes encompassing RBD [ [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00075)]. The HA1 to HA2 ratio of bound clones was increased by 7-fold with the use of AS03 adjuvant, hinting the induction of anti-HA1 dominant antibody responses [ [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00075)]. The AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine also induced anti-NA antibodies targeting the C-terminal region of NA, which is close to the sialic acid binding enzymatic site [ [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00075)]. The AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine also increased antibody affinity against properly folded HA1 but not HA2 domains [ [125](#B125-vaccines-09-00075)]. Moris et al. found that the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine based on the clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) could induce higher levels of long-lived memory B cells and cross-reactive and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells than the non-adjuvanted vaccine in young adults (18-60 years old) [ [124](#B124-vaccines-09-00075)]. Due to the crucial roles of helper CD4+ T cells in stimulating antigen-specific B cell responses [ [133](#B133-vaccines-09-00075)], cross-reactive and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells might contribute to the expanded antibody repertoires and the production of broadly cross-protective antibodies following the TLR4 agonist, and two major formulations of GLA have been explored as vaccine adjuvants: GLA-SE assist influenza vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity. Pillet et al. found that GLA-SE could boost the plant-derived H5-VLP vaccine to induce protective HI titer in healthy adults [ [134](#B134-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, the GLA-SE-adjuvanted H5-VLP vaccine induced significant polyfunctional and sustained heterologous CD4+ T cell responses against the influenza H2 protein [ [134](#B134-vaccines-09-00075)]. Clegg et al. found that GLA-AF could boost the recombinant H5N1 hemagglutinin protein (rH5) based on the clade 1 strain to induce significant HI titer against heterologous clade 1 and clade 2 viruses and confer significant protection against clade 2 viral challenges in murine models [ [136](#B136-vaccines-09-00075)]. GLA-AF also boosted rH5 based on the clade 2 strain to induce significant HI titer and protection against clade 1 strain in ferrets [ [136](#B136-vaccines-09-00075)]. Although the majority of adjuvants have been licensed to boost IM vaccination, GLA-AF was explored to boost ID H5N1 vaccination. Carter et al. found that GLA-AF could assist the plant-produced H5-VLP vaccine to induce -higher HI titer against heterologous H5N1 viruses in murine models [ [135](#B135-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, a single dose of the ID H5-VLP vaccine based on the clade 2 strain in the presence of GLA-AF conferred complete protection against lethal challenges of clade 1 strain in ferrets [ [135](#B135-vaccines-09-00075)]. In human studies, the ID H5-VLP vaccine in the presence of GLA-AF induced more potent HI titer against heterologous clade 2 strain or clade 1 strain as compared to the IM H5-VLP vaccine in the presence of the same adjuvant or ID H5-VLP vaccine alone [ [135](#B135-vaccines-09-00075)]. This study indicated that properly stimulated dermal APCs had a better ability than IM APCs to induce cross-protective immune responses [ [135](#B135-vaccines-09-00075)]. Ko et al. found that a combination of MPL and CpG adjuvants could assist the influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine to induce cross-protective immune responses against heterosubtypic H5N1 viruses in murine models [ [136](#B136-vaccines-09-00075)]. Goff et al. found that a combination of synthetic TLR4 and TLR7 agonists could assist rHA or cross-protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses in murine models [ [138](#B138-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, the heterosubtypic protection was mainly due to the broadly cross-protective antibodies against HA stalks [ [138](#B138-vaccines-09-00075)]. 4.4. TLR7 Agonists [158](#B158-vaccines-09-00075)]. Topical imiquimod treatment (Aldara) followed by ID TIV was found to induce much higher seroconversion rates against all vaccine strains than ID TIV alone in young healthy adults [ [139](#B139-vaccines-09-00075)]. Topical imiquimod followed by ID TIV also induced significant seroconversion against non-vaccine viral strains such as the antigenically drifted H3N2 strain [ [139](#B139-vaccines-09-00075)]. 3M-052 was a synthesized TLR7 agonist containing an 18-carbon chain to limit its systemic distribution and induce more prominent local adjuvant effects [ [140](#B140-vaccines-09-00075)]. Hoeven et al. found that one dose of rHA (H5N1, A/Vietnam/1203/04) in the presence of 3M-052 in stable emulsions induced 100% protection against homologous viral challenges in murine and ferret models, while rHA alone only induced partial protection [ [140](#B140-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, rHA in the presence of 3M-052 in stable emulsions or liposomes induced significant neutralizing antibodies clade 2 strains [ [140](#B140-vaccines-09-00075)]. 4.5. Flagellin [159](#B159-vaccines-09-00075)]. D0/D1 domains are comprised of N- and C-termini of flagellin [ [159](#B159-vaccines-09-00075)]. D2/D3 domains are composed of highly variable internal region of flagellin [ [159](#B159-vaccines-09-00075)]. Extracellular flagellin can be recognized by TLR5, intracellular can be recognized by the cytosolic family domain [160](#B160-vaccines-09-00075), [ [163](#B163-vaccines-09-00075)], while the D0 to NLRC4 inflammasome activation [ [164](#B164-vaccines-09-00075)]. Foreign antigens can replace the highly variable D3 domain of flagellin or insert to its N or C-terminus without affecting its TLR5 activation ability [ [161](#B161-vaccines-09-00075)]. Flagellin has been broadly explored as a highly immunogenic carrier for vaccine development against bacterial, viral, parasitic diseases, and cancer [ [161](#B161-vaccines-09-00075)]. Wang et al. produced the IM immunization of flagellin/HA/M1 VLPs could induce significant protection against heterosubtypic H3N2 viruses in murine models [ [141](#B141-vaccines-09-00075)]. Due to the strong induction of respiratory epithelial cells with TLR5 expression to release cytokines and chemokines [ [161](#B161-vaccines-09-00075)], flagellin has been also explored as a mucosal adjuvant [ [160](#B160-vaccines-09-00075)]. Wang et al. found that IN immunization of flagellin/HA/M1 VLPs induced complete protection against heterosubtypic H3N2 viral challenges in murine models, while HA/M1 VLPs alone or in the presence of soluble flagellin showed little or no protection [ [142](#B142-vaccines-09-00075)]. The above two studies indicated the importance of co-delivery of flagellin and HA/M1 VLPs [165](#B165-vaccines-09-00075), [166](#B166-vaccines-09-00075)]. QS-21 has potent vaccine adjuvant effects if used alone at high doses [ [165](#B165-vaccines-09-00075)]. Yet, a high-dose of QS-21 has the risk of inducing hemolysis in humans [ [165](#B165-vaccines-09-00075)]. To improve its safety, QS-21 has been formulated with MPL in several adjuvant systems [ [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00075), [167](#B167-vaccines-09-00075)]. Other saponin-containing adjuvants have been also developed. Immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs) are particulate antigen delivery systems comprised of vaccine antigens, phospholipids, cholesterol, and saponin [ [168](#B168-vaccines-09-00075), [169](#B169-vaccines-09-00075)]. ISCOMs are able to augment immune responses [ [168](#B168-vaccines-09-00075), [170](#B170-vaccines-09-00075), [171](#B171-vaccines-09-00075)]. ISCOMs were explored to boost influenza vaccination and induce cross-protective immunity. Sambhara et al. found that ISCOMs could significantly increase H1N1 vaccine-induced HI titer and fully protect mice from heterosubtypic H2N2 viral challenges [ [143](#B143-vaccines-09-00075)]. Further studies found that ISCOMs-induced heterosubtypic protection was correlated with CTL responses against a shared major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I epitope within HA of influenza H1 and H2 viruses [ [143](#B143-vaccines-09-00075)]. ISCOM technology-based Matrix-M adjuvant found to significantly virosomal vaccine-induced HI titer and protection against heterologous influenza type B but not type A viruses [ [144](#B144-vaccines-09-00075)]. Matrix-M adjuvant also significantly increased HA nanoparticle-induced HI titer and protection against drifted H3N2 viruses in ferrets [ [145](#B145-vaccines-09-00075)]. In another study, Cox et al. found that the Matrix-M-adjuvanted trivalent virosomal vaccine induced cross-protective immunity against highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N7 viruses in mice and ferrets [ [146](#B146-vaccines-09-00075)]. In addition to the seasonal influenza vaccine, the Matrix-M-adjuvanted virosomal H5N1 vaccine induced significant MN antibody titer against human subjects [ [147](#B147-vaccines-09-00075)]. 4.7. Adjuvants [172](#B172-vaccines-09-00075)]. CT and LT belong to AB5 toxins composed of one A and five B subunits [ [172](#B172-vaccines-09-00075), [173](#B173-vaccines-09-00075)]. The A subunit catalyzes specific targets and is responsible for cell toxicity [ [172](#B172-vaccines-09-00075), [173](#B173-vaccines-09-00075)]. The B subunit forms a five-membered ring structure capable of binding to GM1-ganglioside receptors on target cells [ [172](#B172-vaccines-09-00075), [173](#B173-vaccines-09-00075)]. Quan et al. found that CT could significantly IN whole-inactivated PR8 (PR8i) models [ [148](#B148-vaccines-09-00075)]. The CT-adjuvanted PR8i vaccine was found to confer complete protection against heterosubtypic H3N2 viruses, while the PR8i vaccine alone induced partial protection [ [148](#B148-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, the heterosubtypic protection was mainly due to cross-reactive antibodies but not CD4+ or CD8+ T cells [ [148](#B148-vaccines-09-00075)]. In an earlier study, Tamura et al. found that the CT B subunit (CTB) could significantly increase IN TIV-induced cross-protection against a drifted virus in murine models, while subcutaneous delivery of the same vaccine failed to induce similar levels of cross-protection [ [149](#B149-vaccines-09-00075)]. An LT-adjuvanted influenza vaccine was approved for IN delivery in Switzerland (Nasalflu, Berna Biotech) during the 2000-2001 flu season [ [174](#B174-vaccines-09-00075)]. However, it was pulled off the market due to the 19-fold increased risks of Bell's palsy or facial paralysis in vaccine recipients [ [174](#B174-vaccines-09-00075)]. Therefore, different LT mutants were developed to reduce the enterotoxicity of LT-based adjuvants, such as [ [175](#B175-vaccines-09-00075), [176](#B176-vaccines-09-00075)]. Tumpey et al. found that the IN H3N2 vaccine in the presence of LT (R192G) adjuvant conferred complete protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in murine models, while the IN vaccine alone induced partial protection [ [150](#B150-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, a subcutaneous vaccine in the presence of LT (R192G) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant failed to confer protection against lethal H5N1 viral challenges [ [150](#B150-vaccines-09-00075)]. B cells rather than CD8+ T cells were vital for the heterosubtypic protection [ [150](#B150-vaccines-09-00075)]. 4.8. CAF01 [177](#B177-vaccines-09-00075)]. DDA is a quaternary ammonium compound comprised of one positively charged hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic 18-carbon tails and can self-assemble into liposome structures [ [178](#B178-vaccines-09-00075)]. TDB is a glycolipid that is used to increase the stability and adjuvant effects of DDA liposomes [ [178](#B178-vaccines-09-00075)]. Rosenkrands et al. found that the CAF01 adjuvant could significantly enhance TIV-induced humoral and cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice [ [151](#B151-vaccines-09-00075)]. Furthermore, CAF01-adjuvanted TIV induced complete protection against heterologous H1N1 viral challenges, while TIV alone induced partial protection [ [151](#B151-vaccines-09-00075)]. Christensen et al. found that CAF01 adjuvant significantly enhanced TIV-induced HI titer against homologous but not heterologous H1N1 viruses in ferrets [ [152](#B152-vaccines-09-00075)]. Yet, CAF01-adjuvanted TIV more significantly reduced viral load and fever after heterologous H1N1 viral challenges as compared to TIV alone [ [152](#B152-vaccines-09-00075)]. This study indicated that CAF01-adjuvanted TIV induced HI-independent near-infrared laser adjuvant was recently advanced to the clinical test and was found to stimulate significant cutaneous immune cell trafficking with good safety and tolerability in humans [ [185](#B185-vaccines-09-00075)]. The intentional induction of microscopic photothermal damage by non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) was found to safely boost ID influenza vaccination in murine models [ [186](#B186-vaccines-09-00075)]. Interestingly, the NAFL significantly increased dissolving microneedle-based PR8i vaccine-induced responses and against heterologous and H3N2 viruses in murine models [ [153](#B153-vaccines-09-00075)]. We recently explored the use of radiofrequency energy to boost ID influenza vaccination and found that the radiofrequency adjuvant (RFA) could simultaneously augment influenza vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses in murine models [ [187](#B187-vaccines-09-00075)]. The RFA effects were comparable to MF59-like AddaVax adjuvant at 0.3 \u00b5g vaccine dose and superior to AddaVax adjuvant at 0.06 \u00b5g vaccine dose [ [187](#B187-vaccines-09-00075)]. We recently found that the RFA-adjuvanted influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine could induce heterologous protection against PR8 viruses, while the vaccine alone failed to induce heterologous protection in murine models (Li et al., manuscript in preparation). 5.
