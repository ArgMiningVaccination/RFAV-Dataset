ACSM provides recommendations and guidelines for physical activity and exercise based on the latest science and insights from health professionals. ACSM is known throughout the industry as the \"gold standard\" when it comes to exercise recommendations. Thanks in large part to the publication of [ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription](/education-resources/books/guidelines-exercise-testing-prescription) , now in its 11th edition. GETP has been a staple resource for professionals since 1975. The [Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition](https://health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/current-guidelines) , published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, gives the most current physical activity recommendations for all age groups and special populations. ACSM and CDC recommendations state that: - All healthy adults aged 18-65 years should participate in moderate intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 30 minutes on five days per week, or vigorous intensity aerobic activity for a minimum of 20 minutes on three days per week. - Every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance for a minimum of two days per week.
