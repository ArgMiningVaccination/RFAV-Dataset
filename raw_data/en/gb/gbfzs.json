The treatment decreased patients' postoperative narcotic consumption and additional pain-relieving need after arthroscopic shoulder surgery and had no serious side effects.Arthroscopic shoulder procedures are common in current orthopedic practices. Although arthroscopic shoulder surgery is less invasive and painful than open shoulder surgery, it can still cause postoperative pain. Efficient pain relief is needed for patients' well-being, early rehabilitation, and faster recovery.Based on this and other research, the physicians at Oregon Shoulder Institute now recommend the use of magnesium supplements for certain patients before and after surgery.What is Magnesium?Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in your body. It is an essential mineral and electrolyte that must be obtained from diet or through supplements. It has over 300 functions in the body and plays a crucial role in hormonal balance. For example, magnesium affects thyroid function, estrogen detoxification, blood sugar, muscle contraction and more. Magnesium is also important for adequate absorption of vitamin D and calcium.It is occasionally marketed as a calming agent to help relieve symptoms associated with depression and anxiety, but more research is needed on these uses. Additionally, not everyone should take magnesium, particularly those with kidney disease.Guidelines for Magnesium IntakeA standard multivitamin provides only about 50-100mg of magnesium a day. If one is taking Magnesium separately a reasonable dosage is 500 mg twice daily for two weeks following surgery. However, one of our recommendations is to take 800 IU Vitamin D daily a month prior to surgery and for 3 months after surgery. One option is to therefore take a supplement that is complex of Vitamin D, Calcium, and Magnesium.One such supplement is available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Country-Life-Target-Mins-Vegetarian/dp/B00117ZTNY).This complex provides 400 IU of Vitamin D, 1000 mg of Calcium, and 500 mg of Magnesium per dose. Therefore, one could take this supplement twice a day to satisfy the recommended amount of Vitamin D and also get Magnesium.Worried about supplement safety?Before taking a supplement, always talk to your doctor to make sure that it's safe for any medical conditions you may have and that it won't interact with any medications you are taking.Although supplement makers must follow FDA rules for good manufacturing practices, the agency does not require testing the estimated 9,000 products on the market to make sure they do contain the ingredients they claim, and don't contain contaminants, such as dangerous bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, or lead. This means there is no guarantee that any particular product is effective or safe. To add a degree of protection, look for products that have voluntarily gone through quality testing, which is certified by a seal on the packaging. Some good ones to look for are those from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab.com, and NSF International.If you are having shoulder pain, and it persists over a long period of time, schedule a consultation with Dr. Denard or Phillips at (541) 608-2595.Both Drs. Denard and Phillips have advanced shoulder training and perform most shoulder procedures in a minimally invasive fashion, including all types of rotator cuff repairs and in-stability repair. These techniques allow them to repair tears that some consider \"irreparable.\" Providing every patient with advanced medicine and compassionate care every time.In 2021, The National Library of Medicine's Expertscape ranked Patrick Denard, MD, number two for rotator cuff repair and number seventeen in shoulder replacements worldwide. He has also been voted one of the top 20 shoulder surgeons in North Americaand is the most widely published shoulder specialist in Oregon.Sources: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325888/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325888/)And Harvard Health "}
