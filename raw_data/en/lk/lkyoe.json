Welcome to NoPo Kids Dentistry Functional and Holistic Kids Dentist in North Portland Mission StatementOur mission at NoPo Kids Dentistry is to create a super fun, positive, and happy dental experience all while providing a whole-body and holistic approach to your child's dental needs. We believe diet is the key to overall health and focus on providing only the most natural and up-to-date treatment options for your child. We dream of a world without cavities and will work to encourage your child to \"eat a rainbow\" for optimal health! First Visit to NoPo Kids Dentistry, Ideally by Age ONE!At NoPo Kids Dentistry, Doctor Staci, as well as the The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Dental Association (ADA), and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), recommend to establish a \"Dental Home\" for your child by around one year of age. Children who have a dental home at younger ages are more likely to receive appropriate preventive and routine oral health care, as well they are more likely to avoid future dental issues and disease. They also learn early to love the dentist and are less apt to have fear and phobias with coming to see us.

We thoroughly examine and discuss how one part of the human body can affect another part and talk a lot about how we are an interconnected system...not just a bunch of separate body parts.

Patient Testimonials Excellent staff and service. Both our boys were super nervous about getting their teeth cleaned. The folks here did everything they could to make our boys' experiences fun and as worry-free as possible. All of the chairs have a fun pillow pet stuffed animal and also a TV on the ceiling with kids movies on it. - Red D. We had our first appointment this morning with Dr. Staci for our 2-year old. We were so impressed with this office! They were welcoming and had great toys to play with while we waited (which wasn't long). The dentist and assistant were great at helping our little guy feel comfortable and gave us great tips for healthy teeth! We'll definitely be telling our friends with little ones about this office. - Abby O. Everyone was so kind, efficient, and amazing! I was definitely nervous for my son and that was wiped away the second we walked in the door. Great experience. He can't wait to go back "}
