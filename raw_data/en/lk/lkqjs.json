There is no scientific evidence that Gerson therapy is an effective treatment for cancer, and evidence shows that coffee enemas can be dangerous if used excessively.| |high doses of vitamins||Some people believe that taking high doses of certain vitamins strengthens the body's immune system during cancer treatment. There is little evidence to support this claim. In fact, many vitamins and minerals can be toxic at high levels (for example vitamin E in high doses may increase the risk of bleeding). They may also affect how radiation therapy, chemotherapy and other drugs work.| |alkaline diet||This diet claims eating high alkaline foods such as green vegetables, fruits, oily fish and nuts lowers the acidity levels in the body. A low acid level is said to stop cancer growth, but there's no evidence to support this claim.| |macrobiotic diet||Generally, this diet consists of wholegrains, fruits and vegetables, and soups made with legumes and fermented soy (miso). This diet may cause you to lose weight. There is no evidence this diet cures cancer.| |paleo diet||This diet consists of fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, meats and eggs, but excludes grains and dairy products. Eating grains is essential for a healthy digestive system. This diet is not recommended during cancer treatment.| Keep your complementary therapists and other health professionals informed about any special diets you try before, during or after cancer treatment. This will help them give you the best possible care.
