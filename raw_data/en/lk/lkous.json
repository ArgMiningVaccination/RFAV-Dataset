Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus. Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalitiesin infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre 'syndrome in infected adults. Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efcacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV. Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery. Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-speci c cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity. In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)- / (designated IFNAR /) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue. In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR/mice against subsequent viral challenge. This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests thatadditional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans. Npj Vaccines (2016) 1,16021; doi:10.1038/npjvaccines.2016.21; published online 10 November 2016 INTRODUCTION Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA flavivirus, 1 spread primarily through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos.2-4 However, during the recent outbreak in South and Central America, novel mechanisms of ZIKV transmission have been described including sexual and transplacental transmission.5-7The virus is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia and has spread unabatedthrough South America, Mexico and the Caribbean over the last 2years. 8,9Factors including increased global travel and an expansion of the range of Aedes mosquitos owing to climate change portend further spread of this virus, expanding its range in the southern United States over the next few years.5,9 ZIKV infection presents with a prodrome of myalgias, arthral- gias, malaise and low-grade fever with a rash appearing approximately 7 days post infection that may occur withconjunctivitis and retro-orbital pain. The clinical presentation issimilar to, albeit less severe than, chikungunya and dengue viralinfections, which are also transmitted through the same mosquito vectors. During the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013, an increased risk of Guillain Barre 'syndrome was identi ed in infected individuals. 4,6,10Alarmingly, during the recent outbreak in South and Central America, microcephaly and other congenitalabnormalities in infants have been observed in mothers who were infected by ZIKV during pregnancy. 11-13In April 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Preventionconrmed the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly establishing ZIKV as a teratogen. There are currently no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. Therefore, thedevelopment and evaluation of potential vaccines to controland halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent is of high priority. 14Here we describe the development and evaluation of a synthetic ZIKV prME DNA vaccine delivered by electroporationfor its immunogenicity and its impact on ZIKV infection in apathogenic animal challenge model. 1The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, USA;2Special Pathogens Program, National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2;3Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 0J9;4Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA;5Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA;6Department of Molecular Medicine, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, FL, USA and7GeneOne Life Science Teheran-Ro, Gangnam-Gu, Seoul, Korea.

The ZIKV- prME consensus sequence was cloned into the pVax1 vector after additional modi cations and optimisations were made to improve itsin vivo expression including the addition of a highly ef cient immunoglobulin E (IgE) leader peptide sequence (Figure alignment of ZIKV-Env sequences was performed using homology models and visualisation on Discovery Studio 4.5. Reference models included PDB 5JHM and PDB 5IZ7. Aligned residues corresponding to speci c regions on the prME antigen were labelled in the models for visualisation purposes (Figure 1b). The optimised consensus vaccine selections are, in general, conservative or semi-conservative relative to multiple ZIKV strains analysed in this study. Structural studies of EDE-speci c neutralising antibodies have revealed that these recognition determinants can be found at a serotype-invariant site at theEnv-dimer interface, which includes the exposed main chain of the fusion loop and two conserved glycan chains (N67- and N153- linked glycans).15These two glycosylation are not highly conserved in other flaviviruses. Moreover, ZIKV does not possess the N67-linked glycosylation site, and the N154-linked glycosyla- tion site (equivalent to the N153-linked glycosylation site in dengue) is absent in some of the isolated ZIKV strains. As part of the consensus design, we therefore designed the construct leaving out this glycosylation site. Lack of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) to ZIKV-Env protein.15 Subsequent to construction, expression of the ZIKV-prME protein from the plasmid was con rmed by western blot analysis and an indirect immuno fluorescence assay (IFA). The protein extracts prepared from the cells transiently transfected with ZIKV- prME were analysed for expression by western blot using a panflavivirus antibody (Figure 1c) and sera collected from ZIKV- prME immunised mice (Figure 1d). ZIKV-prME expression was further detected by IFA by the staining of 293T cells transfected Figure 1. Construction of the ZIKV-prME consensus DNA vaccine. ( a) Diagrammatic representation of the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine indicating the cloning of prME into the pVax1 mammalian expression vector. A consensus design strategy was adopted for the ZIKV-prME consensus sequence. Codon-optimised synthetic genes of the prME construct included a synthetic IgE leader sequence. The optimised gene construct was inserted into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of a modi ed pVax1 vector under the control of the CMV promoter. ( b) Model building of the ZIKV-E proteins demonstrates overlap of the vaccine target with potentially relevant epitope regions. Several changes made for vaccine design purpose are located in domains II and III (located within dashed lines of inset, middle left). Vaccine-speci c residue changes in these regions are shown in violet CPK format on a ribbon backbone representation of an E Env protein dimer (each chain in light and dark green, respectively). Regions corresponding to the de ned EDE are indicated in cyan, and the fusion loop is indicated in blue.

ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine induces antigen-speci c T cells in C57BL/6 mice The ability of the ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine to induce cellular immune responses was evaluated. Groups of four female C57BL/6 mice were immunised with either the control plasmid backbone (pVax1) or the ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine three times at 2 week intervals through intramuscular (i.m.) injection followed by electroporation at the site of delivery (Figure 2a). One week after the third injection bulk splenocytes harvested from each animal and evaluated in ELISpot assays for their ability to secrete interferon- (IFN-) after ex vivo exposure to peptide pools encompassing The assay results show that splenocytes from ZIKV-prME immunised mice produced a cellular immune response after stimulation with multiple ZIKV-E peptide pools (Figure 2b). The region(s) of ZIKV-Env, which elicited the strongest cellular response(s) were evaluated by ELISpot assay in a matrix format using 22 peptide pools consisting of 15-mers (overlapping by 9 amino acids) spanning the entire ZIKV-prME protein. Several pools demonstrated elevated T cell responses, with peptide pool 15 exhibiting the highest number of spot-forming units (SFU)(Figure 2c). This matrix mapping analysis a prME epitope, 'IRCIGVSNR DFVEGM '(aa167-181). restricted epitope through analysis utilising the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource tool (http://tools.iedb.org), which supports that in this haplotype the antigen is effectively processed. Further evaluation of the cellular immunogenicity of the ZIKV-prME vaccine entailed the determination of the polyfunc- tional properties of CD8+T cells collected 1 week after the nal immunisation. The results show that the ZIKV-prME vaccination increased the proportion of bifunctional vaccine-speci c T vaccination exhibited a strong ability to expand T cell functionality (Figure 2d). In addition, comparative immune studies were performed with optimised plasmids encoding the prME sequence of either a recently identi ed Brazilian ZIKV strain or of the original MR766 ZIKV strain. Induction of cellular immune responses in mice immunised with either plasmid was measured 1 week after the third vaccination through IFN- ELISpot analysis after stimulating splenocytes with the ZIKV-prME peptide pools. The results illustrate that the T-cell responses induced by the consensus ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine construct were consistently higher than those generated by either of these two non-consensus Figure 2.

IFN- generation, as an indication of induction of cellular immune responses, was measured by an IFN- ELISpot assay. The splenocytes harvested 1 week after the third immunisation were incubated in the presence of one of the six peptide pools spanning the entire prM and Env proteins. Results are shown in stacked bar graphs. The data represent the average numbers of SFU (spot- forming units) per million splenocytes with values representing the mean responses in each \u00b1s.e.m.

( d) Flow cytometric analysis of T-cell responses. Immunisation induces higher number of IFN- and TNF- secreting cells when stimulated by ZIKV peptides. One week after the last immunisation with the ZIKV-prME vaccine, splenocytes were cultured in the presence of pooled ZIKV peptides (5 M) or R10 only. Frequencies of ZIKV peptide-speci c IFN- and TNF- secreting cells were measured by flow cytometry. Single function gates were set based on negative control (unstimulated) samples and were placed consistently across samples. The percentage of the total CD8+T-cell responses are shown. These data are representative of two independent immunisation experiments. IFN, interferon; TNF, virus.ZIKA virus prM envelope -based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al 3 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development Npj Vaccines (2016) 16021plasmid vaccines (Supplementary Figure S1A,B). Detailed mapping analysis of the cellular responses induced by either the Brazilian or MR766 prME vaccines revealed that both vaccines induced a signi cant cellular response against the dominant Env-speci c CTL epitope as identi ed in Figure 2b and c for the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid (data not shown). The consensus immunogen consistently induced more robust responses in these T-cell assays at the same dose and was evaluated further in additional assays. Generation of a ZIKV recombinant envelope protein At the onset of these studies, there were no available commercial reagents to evaluate speci c anti-ZIKV immune responses. There- fore, by necessity, recombinant ZIKV-Env protein (rZIKV-E) was generated to support the assays performed in this study. To generate this reagent, a consensus ZIKV-Env sequence based on the ZIKV-prME vaccine consensus antigen was cloned into a pET30a Escherichia coli expression vector (Supplementary Figure S2A). The rZIKV-E antigen was produced in E. coli cultures, puried using nickel column chromatography and analysed using SDS-PAGE, which showed overexpressed proteins of the predicted size in lysate from rZIKV-E transfected bacteria that could be detected by western analysis using an anti-His tag antibody (Supplementary Figure S2B). The sera from mice immunised withthe ZIKV-prME vaccine bound to rZIKV-Env that was used as a capture antigen in an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Supplementary Figure S2C). A commercial antibody (designated panflavivirus) that reacts to the Env protein of multiple flaviviruses, also bound to rZIKV-E. Western analysis demonstrated that from speci cally recognised rZIKV-E indicate the generated rZIKV-E reacted speci cally with immune sera from ZIKV-prME vaccinated mice, thus this recombinant protein was used for further immunogenicity studies. Induction of functional humoral responses in C57BL/6 mice by the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine The ability of the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine to induce humoral immune responses in mice was evaluated. Groups of four C57BL/6 mice were immunised intramuscularly (i.m.) through electroporation-mediated delivery three times at 2-week intervals with 25 g of either the empty control pVax1 or the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine plasmids. Sera was obtained from each immunized mouse and tested by ELISA for ZIKV-speci c IgG responses using immobilised rZIKV-E as the capture antigen. A signi cant increase in anti-ZIKV-speci c IgG was observed on day 21 with a further boost in the sera IgG levels noted on day 35 (Figure 3a). Day 60 sera from vaccinated animals show that Figure 3. Anti-ZIKV antibody responses are induced by ZIKV-prME vaccination. ( a) ELISA analysis measuring binding antibody production (measured by OD450 values) in immunised mice. The C57BL/6 mice ( n=4) were immunised i.m. times g of ZIKV-prME plasmid or pVax1 at 2-week intervals. Binding to rZIKV-E was analysed with sera from animals at different time points (days 21, 35 and 60) post immunisation at various dilutions. The data shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. ( b) Endpoint binding titre analysis. Differences in the anti-ZIKV endpoint titres produced in response to the ZIKV-prME immunogen were analysed in sera from immunised animals after each boost. ( c) Western blot analysis of rZIKV-E speci c antibodies induced by ZIKV-prME immunisation. The rZIKV-E protein was electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel and analysed by western blot analysis with pooled sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice (day 35). Binding to rZIKV-E is indicated by the arrowhead. ( d) Immuno fluorescence of induced by ZIKV-prME immunisation. The Vero cells infected with either ZIKV-MR766 or mock infected were stained with pooled sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice (day 35) followed by an anti-mouse-AF488 secondary antibody for detection. ( e) Plaque-reduction neutralisation The serum samples from the ZIKV-prME immunised mice were tested for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro. PRNT 50was de ned as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50% of the input virus. The values in parentheses indicate the PRNT 50. Control ZIKV-Cap (DNA vaccine expressing the ZIKV capsid protein) and pVax1 sera were used as negative controls. ZIKV-prME, precursor membrane and Env of Zika virus.ZIKA virus prM envelope -based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al 4 Npj Vaccines (2016) 16021 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentelevated ZIKV-speci c antibody responses were maintained long term following the nal boost. Most importantly, sera from vaccinated mice contained very high levels of rZIKV-E-speci c antibodies as indicated by the endpoint titres (Figure 3b). Additional assessment of the speci city of the vaccine-induced antibodies was performed by screening pooled sera from ZIKV-prME plasmid inoculated mice for its ability to detect rZIKV-E by western analysis (Figure 3c) and to stain ZIKV (MR766 strain)- infected cells in an immuno fluorescence assay (Figure 3d). The results from both these analyses con rmed speci city of the vaccine-induced humoral responses. Furthermore, ZIKV-speci c binding antibody responses were also assessed in mice immunised with plasmids encodingthe prME sequences from a Brazilian strain and the MR766 strain described above. Day 35 (1 week after third immunisation) sera from pVax1- and both non-consensus vaccine-immunised for binding to rZIKV-E. This analysisindicates that both MR766 and Brazil vaccine plasmids induced signi cant antibody binding, and that immunisation with the consensus ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine generates an effective humoralresponse against rZIKV-E (Supplementary Figure S1C, D). A plaque reduction neutraliszation test (PRNT) assay was performed on pooled day 35 sera from mice immunised witheither the control pVax1 plasmid, ZIKV-prMEplasmid consensus ZIKV-C (capsid) plasmid vaccine. The PRNT assay used was a method adapted from a previously described technique for analysing dengue virus, West Nile virusand other flaviviruses. 16As Figure 3e, ZIKV-prME response 50dilution titres (inverse of the serum dilution at which 50% of the control ZIKV infection was inhibited) of 456 \u00b1 5, whereas the PRNT50 of sera from ZIKV-Cap mice was higherthan that of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated animals (titre = 15 \u00b1 2). Immune responses and protection against ZIKV in mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR /) following immunisation with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine Mechanisms of ZIKV-induced disease and immunity are poorly dened, and the protective versus the hypothetical pathogenic nature of the immune response to ZIKV infection is as yet unclear.17Most strains of mice are resistant to ZIKV infection, however, mice lacking IFN- /receptor (IFNAR/) were found to be susceptible to infection and disease with most succumbingwithin 6 -7 days post challenge.18The ability of the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine to induce cellular and humoral immune responses in this mouse strain was investigated. Five tosix week old female IFNAR/mice ( n= 4) were immunised i.m., with electroporation-mediated delivery, times at 2-weekintervals with either the control pVax1 plasmid or ZIKV-prME vaccine plasmid vaccine. The serum was collected from immu- nised mice at days 0, 14, 21, and 35, and splenocytes wereharvested from mice 1 week following the nal immunisation (day 35). The splenocytes from vaccine-immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response as indicated by levels of SFU per 10 6cells in an ELISpot assay (Supplementary Figure S3A). The results from ELISA analysis, using rZIKV-E as a capture antigen,show detectable anti-ZIKV serum IgG by day 14 (titres of ~ 1:1,000)and these levels were boosted with subsequent vaccinations with binding antibody titres reaching at least 1:100,000 (Supplementary Figure S3B,C). By comparison, the PRNT 50titre for the day 35 postimmunisation samples was 1:60 (data not shown). The resultsindicate that IFNAR/mice immunised with the consensus ZIKV- prME vaccine are capable of generating anti-ZIKV cellular and humoral immune responses supporting further study in thismodel of putative vaccine effects in a pathogenic challenge.ZIKV-speci c functional cellular and humoral responses elicited by the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine in non-human NHPs were immunised by intradermal immunisation using intradermal electroporation, based on recent studies showing responses in a intradermal format.19,20Rhesus macaques (RM; n= 5/group) vaccine plasmid intradermally with electroporation, with each animal vaccinated twice 4 weeks apart. The sera and peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at day 0 (pre- immunisation) and week 6 (2 weeks post second immunisation). ELISpot analysis of pre-immunisation and week 6 PBMCs ex vivo stimulated with the ZIKV-prME peptide pools showed that ZIKV- prME immunisation induced robust anti-ZIKV T cell responses in RM (Figure 4a). Speci c anti-ZIKV antibody responses in sera from vaccinated RM were assessed by ELISA. At week 6, rZIKV-E-speci c binding antibodies were detectable in animals vaccinated with ZIKV-prME(Figure 4b). Endpoint titres were determined for each animal at week 2 (after 1 immunisation) and week 6 (after 2 immunisations; Figure 4c). The ELISA results were con rmed by western blot analysis using RM sera from the individual vaccinated animals (Figure 4d). The neutralisation activity of the antibodies generated in RM at week 6 was evaluated by a PRNT 50assay. All the vaccinated monkeys had signi cant neutralisation activity with anti-ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50dilution titres ranging from 161 to 1380 (average 501 \u00b1 224 standard error of the mean; Figure 4e). PRNT titres did not directly correlate with ELISA titre (data not shown). The ability of the immune sera from vaccinated RM to block ZIKV infection of Vero cells, neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) or neural progenitor (U-87MG) cells in was by IFA. ZIKV strains (MR766 or PR209) were pre-incubated in sera or diluted RM-immune sera and added to monolayers of each cell type. Four days post infection, ZIKV-positive cells were identi ed by IFA using pan flavivirus antibody (Supplementary Figure S4A -C) and ZIKV- positive cells were quanti ed (Supplementary Figure S4B -D). The sera from ZIKA-prME vaccinated RM inhibited the ZIKV infection ineach cell type tested. Protection against ZIKV infection and disease in IFNAR/mice following ZIKV-prME immunisation In exploratory studies, 5 -6-week-old IFNAR(/)mice n= 10) were challenged with 1 \u00d7106plaque-forming units (PFU) of the ZIKV- PR209 (i.c); or intravenous (i.v.) routes. After the challenge, all the animals were monitored for clinical signs ofinfection, which included routine measurement of body weight as well as inspection for other signs of a moribund condition such as hind limb weakness and paralysis. No change in the generalappearance of the mice was observed during the rst 4 days after inoculation. However, after the fourth day, the mice in each of the groups demonstrated reduced overall activity, decreased mobilityand a hunched posture often accompanied by hind-limb weakness, decreased water intake and obvious weight loss. The animals succumbed to the infection between day 6 and day 8regardless of the route of viral challenge (Supplementary Figure S5A-E). On the basis of these data, the subsequent studies to evaluate ZIKV-prME-mediated protection in this model used thes.c. route for challenge. The protective ef cacy of the ZIKV-prME vaccine was next evaluated in this IFNAR /mouse model. Two groups of mice (n= 10) were immunised (25 g of vaccine) by the i.m. route, through electroporation-mediated delivery with the ZIKV-prME vaccine. Also, two groups of 10 mice were immunised by the i.m.route through electroporation-mediated delivery with the control pVax1 vector. The immunisations were performed two times, two weeks apart, and all the animals were challenged on day 21ZIKA virus prM envelope -based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al 5 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development Npj Vaccines (2016) 16021(1 week post second immunisation). One set of control and vaccinated mice received 1 \u00d7 106PFU of ZIKV-PR209 by the s.c. route and the other set of each group were challenged with a total of 2 \u00d7 106PFU ZIKV-PR209 by the s.c. route. At 3 weeks postchallenge, 100% of all ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals survived, whereas only 30% of the single- or 10% of double-dose challenged controls survived (Figures 5a,b). In all the challenges, the vaccinated animals were without signs of disease including no Figure 5. Survival data for immunised mice lacking the type I interferon ,receptor following ZIKV infection.

The infection of control mice with ZIKV-PR209 virus produced a marked decrease in body weight along with decreased mobility, hunched posture, hind- limb knuckle walking and/or paralysis of one or both hind limbs (Figures 5e,f). The potential ability of a single immunisation with the ZIKV- prME DNA vaccine to protect IFNAR/mice from ZIKV challenge was evaluated. Groups of 10 mice were immunised i.m. with electroporation once with either control plasmid or ZIKV-prME vaccine and challenged 2 weeks later with a total dose of 2\u00d71 06PFU ZIKV-PR209. Three weeks post challenge, 100% of the ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals survived, whereas only 10% of the control animals survived (Figure 6a). To determine gross histopathological changes, brain tissue was sectioned into 5 m- thick sagittal sections, stained for nuclear structures and counter- stained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin (Figure 6b). The mice were killed at day 7 or 8 post challenge for the analysis of histology and viral load. The ZIKV infection caused severe brain pathology in the mice. The unvaccinated control (pVax1) mice brain sections showed nuclear fragments within neutrophils (Figures 6b -i); perivascular and degenerating cells of the cerebral cortex (Figure 6b-ii and iii) and degenerating neurons within the hippocampus (Figure 6b-iv). In contrast, the ZIKV-prME vaccinatedanimals presented with normal histopathology in brain tissues (Figures 6b-v and vi) supporting that protective responses induced by immunisation with the synthetic ZIKA-prME vaccine could limit viral-induced disease in the brain. This observation demonstrates the potential for vaccination to protect the brain in this model. Consistent with the amelioration of body weight loss and mobility impairment in vaccinated mice following ZIKV challenge, a signi cantly lower viral load was noted in the blood (Figure 6c) and brain (Figure 6d) of the ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals compared with viral challenged pVax1 vaccinated animals in the high (2 \u00d7 106PFU) dose challenge groups. Taken together, these data illustrate that ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine-mediated immune responses can protect mice against ZIKV challenge. Passive transfer of anti-ZIKV immune sera protects mice against ZIKV infection Next, we tested whether transfer of immune sera from ZIKV- prME vaccinated RM could prevent ZIKV-mediated patho- genesis in IFNAR/mice. To this end, 150 g equivalent IgG (PRNT 501/160) from week 6 RM were adoptively transferred into IFNAR/mice 1 day after the ZIKV viral challenge. Two groups of control mice were included, one group receiving pre-immune sera from RM and the other group receiving phosphate-buffered saline Figure 6. Single immunisation with the ZIKV-prME vaccine provides protection against ZIKV challenge in mice lacking the type I interferon , receptor. Mice were immunised once and challenged with 2 \u00d7 106plaque-forming units of ZIKV-PR209, two weeks post immunisation. The survival curves depict 10 mice per group per experiment ( a). The ZIKV-prME vaccine prevented ZIKV-induced neurological abnormalities in the mouse brain ( b). Brain sections from pVax1 and ZIKV-prME vaccinated groups were collected 7 -8 days after challenge and stained with H&E (haematoxylin and eosin) for histology. The sections taken from representative, unprotected pVax1 control animals shows pathology.

The mice that received PBS or control sera lost 15 to 25% of their original body weight during the course of infection, and all died 6 -8 days post infection. When vaccine immune sera from RMs were transferred to infection-susceptible mice, the animals lost weight on day 3 and 4, but subsequently regained it beginning on day 5 and 80% ultimately survived infectious challenge (Figure 7a) demonstrating the ability of the NHP sera transfer to confer protection against clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection following viral challenge (Figure 7b). In repeated experiments performed to evaluate the ef cacy of immune serum transfer in protection against challenge with ZIKV, the survival among ZIKV-prME immune sera recipients ranged from 80 to 100%. These studies show that anti-ZIKV vaccine immune sera had the ability to confer signi cant protection against ZIKV infection in the absence of an acquired adaptive anti-ZIKV immune response. DISCUSSION Serious concerns have been raised by the recent spread of ZIKV and its associated pathogenesis in humans. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for this emerging infectious agent. Very recently, a collection of experimental ZIKV vaccines have been shown to lower viral load post challenge in non- pathogenic animal infection models.21,22These data are encoura- ging. In this regard, it is important to examine additional novel vaccine approaches targeting ZIKA in additional models that similar to susceptible humans, might show disease. Here we evaluated a synthetic DNA vaccine, designed to express a novel consensus ZIKV-prM and E antigen, for immunogenicity following electroporation-enhanced immunisation in mice and non-human primates. We observed that ZIKV-prME DNA vaccination was immunogenic and generated antigen-speci c T cells and binding and neutralising antibodies in both mice and NHPs. Uniquely, the NHPs were immunised with ZIKV-prME through electroporation by the intradermal route, which uses lower voltage and a smaller transfection area than i.m. electroporation, as we have recently described.23Further study of such approaches may provide advantages in clinical settings. The ZIKV-prME consensus construct includes a designed change of the potential NXS/T motif, which removes a putative glycosyla- tion site. Deletion of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type bnAbs (broadly neutralising antibodies) against ZIKV-E protein.24The antibody responses induced by the consensus ZIKV-prME appear as robust or in some cases superior in magnitude to those elicited by similarlydeveloped MR766 ZIKV-prME and Brazil ZIKV-prME vaccines. These constructs were sequence matched with the original ZIKV- MR766 isolate or a recently circulating ZIKV strain from Brazil, respectively. While supportive, further study will provide more insight into the effects of such incorporated designed changes on induced immune responses. As there are few pathogenic challenge models for ZIKV, we compared the putative protective nature of the immune responses of the ZIKV-prME vaccine in C57BL/6 and IFNAR/ mice. Both strains of mice responded with a robust humoral immune response when immunised with ZIKV-prME. T-cell responses were also induced, but appear to be more robust in wild-type C57BL/6 compared with those induced in the IFNAR/ animals, supporting a partial defect in innate to adaptive immunity transition as expected owing to the knock-out phenotype in the mouse. However, based on the induction of antigen speci c immunity, the model was useful for evaluation of the impact of the vaccine on both infection and pathogenesis. A single vaccination with ZIKV-prME in IFNAR/mice was protective against disease and death in this model, including protection of neuro-pathogenesis. Flavivirus-neutralising antibodies directed against the Env antigen are thought to have a key role in protection against disease, an idea supported directly by passive antibody transfer experiments in animal models and indirectly by epidemiological data from prospective studies in geographical areas that are prone to mosquito-borne viral infections.3,7,8 Although immunisation of IFNAR/mice with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine as well as serum transfer from immunised NHPs were protective in this murine model, the IFNAR/vaccinated as opposed to serum-transferred mice exhibited greater control of weight loss as an indication of control of pathogenesis. Although additional studies are needed, this result potentially suggests a role for the T-cell response in this aspect of protection in this model. In addition, we observed that control IFNAR/mice who recovered from challenge remain viral positive by PCR for at least several weeks, suggesting an additional bene t of vaccination in limiting potential sexual or vector borne transmission. Our study extends prior ndings and supports the potential of vaccination and, in this case this synthetic DNA vaccination, to impact prevention of disease in a susceptible host.

Both ZIKV virus strains MR766 (a kind gift from Dr Susan Weiss) and PR209(Bioqual, MD) were ampli ed in Vero cells and stocks were titred by standard plaque assay on Vero cells. Five- to six-week-old female C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and IFNAR /(MMRRC repository-The Jackson Laboratory) mice were housed and treated/vaccinated in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility in accordancewith the National Institutes of Health, Wistar and the Public Health Agencyof Canada IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee)guidelines. The RMs were housed and treated/vaccinated at Bioqual, MD, USA. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendationsdescribed in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of theNIH, the Of ce of Animal Welfare, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All animal immunisation work was approved by the Bioqual Animal Careand Use Committee (IACUC). Bioqual is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All the procedures were carried out under ketamine anaesthesia by trained personnel underthe supervision of veterinary staff, and all the efforts were made to protectthe welfare of the animals and to minimise animal suffering in accordancewith the 'Weatherall report for the use of non-human primates ' recommendations. The animals were housed in adjoining individualprimate cages allowing social interactions, under controlled conditions ofhumidity, temperature and light (12 h light/12 h dark cycles). Food andwater were available ad libitum . The animals were monitored twice daily and fed commercial monkey chow, treats and fruits twice daily by trainedpersonnel. Construction of ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine The ZIKV-prME encodes full-length precursor ofmembrane (prM) plus Env (E) and a construct encoding a consensusCapsid proteins were synthesised. A consensus strategy was used and theconsensus sequences were determined by the alignment of current ZIKVprME protein sequences. The vaccine insert was genetically optimised (i.e.,codon and RNA optimisation) for enhanced expression in humans and anIgE leader sequence was added to facilitate expression. The construct wassynthesised commercially (Genscript, NJ, USA), and then subcloned into amodi ed pVax1 expression vector under the control of the cytomegalo- virus immediate-early promoter as described before. 25Thenal construct is named ZIKV-prME vaccine and the control plasmid backbone is pVax1. Inaddition, a number of other matched DNA constructs encoding the prMand E genes from MR766 (DQ859059.1) and a 2016 Brazilian (AMA12084.1)outbreak strain were also designed, for further evaluation. Large-scaleampli cations of DNA constructs were carried out by Inovio Pharmaceu- ticals Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) and puri ed plasmid DNA was formulated in water for immunisations. The size of the DNA inserts wasconrmed via agarose gel electrophoresis. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by multiple alignment with ClustalW using MEGA version 5software. 25 DNA immunisations and electroporation-mediated delivery enhancement Female C57BL/6 mice (6 -8 weeks old) and IFNAR/mice (5 -6 weeks old) were immunised with 25 g of DNA in a total volume of 20 or 30 lo f water delivered into the tibialis anterior muscle with in vivo electroporation delivery. In vivo electroporation was delivered with the CELLECTRA adaptive constant current electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals)at the same site immediately following DNA injection. A three-prongedCELLECTRA minimally invasive device was inserted ~ 2 mm into themuscle. Square-wave pulses were delivered through a triangular three-electrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stainless steel electrodes andtwo constant current pulses of 0.1 Amps were delivered for 52 msec/pulseseparated by a 1 s delay. Further protocols for the use of electroporationhave been previously described in detail. 26The mice were immunised three times at 2-week intervals and killed 1 week after the nal immunisation. Blood and splenocytes were collected after each immunisa-tion for the analysis of cellular and humoral two sites two times at 4-week intervals with 2 mg ZIKV-prME vaccine. Electroporation was delivered at 0.2 Amps immediatelyusing the same device described for mouse immunisations.Western blot analysis For in vitro expression studies, transfections were performed using the GeneJammer reagent, following the manufacturer 's protocols (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Brie fly, the cells were grown to 50% con fluence in a 35 mm dish and transfected with 1 g of ZIKV-prME vaccine. The cells were collected 2 days after transfection, washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Western Blot was used to verify the expression of the ZIKV-prME protein from the harvested cell lysate and the immune speci city of the mouse and RM serum through the use of either pan- flavivirus antibody or immune sera from the ZIKV-prME vaccinated mice, as described previously.25In brief, 3 - 12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were loaded with 5 go r1 g of ZIKV Env recombinant protein (rZIKV-E); transfected cell lysates or supernatant and the Odyssey protein Molecular Weight Marker (Product # 928-40000). The gels were run at 200 V for 50 min in MOPS buffer. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device (Life Technologies). The membranes were blocked in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. To detect vaccine expression, the anti-Flavivirus group antigen (MAB10216-Clone D1- 4G2-4-15) antibody was diluted 1:500 and the immune serum from mice and RM was diluted 1:50 in Odyssey blocking buffer with 0.2% Tween 20 (Bio- Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and incubated with the membranes overnight at4 \u00b0C. The membranes were washed with PBST and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IRDye680CW; LI-COR Biosciences) for at 1:15,000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were imaged on the Odyssey infrared For cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 5 g of ZIKV-prME vaccine. Two days after transfection, the cells were xed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Nonspeci c binding was then blocked with normal goat serum diluted in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The slides were then washed in PBS for 5 min and subsequently incubated with sera from immunised mice or RM at a 1:100 dilutions overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The slides were washed as described above andincubated with appropriate secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG- AF488; for mouse serum and goat anti-human IgG-AF488 for RM serum; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 1:200 dilutions at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, Flouroshield mounting media with DAPI (Abcam, Cam- bridge, MA, USA) was added to stain the nuclei of all cells. After which, coverslips were mounted and the slides were observed under a microscope (EVOS Cell Imaging Systems; Life Technologies).25. In addition, Vero, SK-N-SH or U87-MB cells were grown on four-chamber tissue culture treated glass slides and infected at MOI of 0.01 with ZIKV-MR766 or PR209 that were preincubated with/without RM immune sera (1:200), and stained at 4 days post ZIKV infection using pan- flavivirus antibody paraf n-embedded brain tissue was sectioned into 5 m thick sagittal sections, placed on Superfrost microscope slides (Fisher Scienti c, Hampton, NH, USA) and backed at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The sections were deparaf nised using two changes of xylene and rehydrated by immersing in 100%, 90% and then 70% ethanol. The sections were stained for nuclear structures using Harris haematoxylin (Surgipath, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for 2 min followed by differentiation in 1% acid alcohol (Surgipath) and treatment with Scott 's tap water for 2 min. Subsequently, the sections were counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin (Surgipath) for 2 min. The slides were dehydrated with 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol, cleared in xylene and mounted Permount (Fisher Scienti c). Splenocyte and PBMC isolation Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from all the mice. Briefly, the spleens from mice were collected individually in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS Stomacher80 paddle blender (A.J. Seward and Co. Ltd.) for 30 s on high speed. The processed spleen samples were ltered through 45 mm nylon lters and then centrifuged at 1,500 gfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ACK (ammonium -chloride -potassium) lysis bufferZIKA virus prM envelope -based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al 9 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development Npj Vaccines (2016) 16021(Life Technologies) for 5 min at room temperature, and PBS was then added to stop the reaction. The samples were again centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The cell pellets were resuspended in R10 and then passed through a 45 mm nylon lter before use in ELISpot assay and flow cytometric analysis.25For RM, blood (20 ml at each time point) was collected in EDTA tubes and the PBMCs were isolated using a standard Ficoll-hypaque procedure with Accuspin tubes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Five millilitres of blood was also collected into sera tubes at each time point for sera isolation. Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining assay a plate (2 \u00d7 106/well) and were stimulated with ZIKV-prME pooled peptides for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO 2in the presence of Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (brefeldin A and monensin; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). The cell stimulation cocktail protein transport inhibitors; used as a positive control and R10 media as the negative control. All the cells were then stained for surface and intracellular proteins as described by the manufacturer 's instructions (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Brie fly, the cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% FBS) before surface staining with flourochrome-conjugated antibodies. The cells were washed with FACS buffer, xed and permeabilised using the BD Cytox/Ctyoperm TM (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer 's protocol followed by intracellular staining. The following antibodies were used for surface staining: LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo software Star, USA). ELISpot assay Briefly, 96-well ELISpot plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were coated with anti-mouse IFN- capture Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, the plates were washed with PBS and blocked for 2 h with PBST+1% BSA. Two hundred thousand splenocytes from immunised mice were added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2in the presence of media alone (negative control), media with PMA/ionomycin (positive control) or media with peptide pools (1 g/ml) consisting of 15-mers overlapping by nine amino acids and spanning the length of the ZIKV prME protein (Genscript,Piscataway, NJ, USA). After 24 h, the cells were washed and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with biotinylated anti-mouse Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Streptavidin -alkaline phosphatase (R&D Systems) was added to each well after washing and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was washed, and then 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 - indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride colour reagent; R&D Systems) was added. Last, the plateswere rinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature and SFU were quanti ed by an automated ELISpot reader (CTL Limited, Shaker Heights, OH, USA), and the raw values were normalised to SFU per million splenocytes. For RM samples, the ELISPOT PROfor monkey IFN- kit (MABTECH, Cincinnati, OH, USA) was used as described by the manufacturer; two hundred thousand PBMCs were stimulated with peptide pools; and the plates were washed and spots were developedand counted as described before.25 Humoral immune response: antibody-binding ELISA An ELISA was used to determine the titres of mouse and RM sera aspreviously described.25Briefly, 1g of ed coat 96-well microtiter plates (Nalgene Nunc International, Naperville, IL, USA) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After blocking with 10% FBS in PBS for at least an hour, the plates were washed four times with 0.05% PBST (Tween20 in PBS). Serum samples from immunised mice and RMs were serially diluted in 1% FBS, added to the plates, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were again washed four times in 0.05% PBST,then incubated with HRP-conjugated dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature. For RM sera, anti-monkey IgG HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) was used at a 1:5,000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. The wasdetected by adding SIGMAFAST OPD ( o-phenylenediamine dihydrochlor- ide) substrate solution according to the manufacturer 's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The reaction was stopped after15 min with the addition of 1 N H 2SO4. The optical density at 450 nm was read on a Synergy plate reader. All the mouse and RM serum samples wereassayed in duplicate. Endpoint titres were determined using the methoddescribed by Frey et al. 27 Neutralisation (PRNT 50) assay The PRNT involving MR766 and Vero was described previously.28 Briefly, heat-inactivated mouse or RM sera were serially diluted serum- free DMEM (1:10 to 1: 1280) and incubated with an equal volume of ZIKVMR766 (100 PFU) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. The mixtures were added to theconfluent layers of Vero cells and left at 37 \u00b0C for adsorption for 2 h. A 2 \u00d7 DMEM media:soft-agar (1:1) overlay was added over cells and the plate wasincubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C. The agar overlay was removed and the cellswere xed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS, stained with crystal violet solution, washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS and the plates were left to dry.The plaques in assays done in 24-well plates were scanned with anautomated Immunospot reader (CTL Limited), and the plaques in samplewells and in negative control (DMEM only) and positive control (100 PFU MR766 ZIKV virus only) wells were counted using the automated software provided with the ELISpot reader. The percentage plaque reduction wascalculated as follows: % reduction = 100 \u00d7 {1 (average number of plaques for each dilution/average number of plaques in positive control wells)}.GraphPad Prism software was used to perform nonlinear regressionanalysis of % plaque reduction versus a log transformation of eachindividual serum dilution to facilitate linear interpolation of actual 50%PRNT titres at peak post vaccination response. The medians andinterquartile ranges at 50% neutralisation were calculated for eachneutralisation target overall and by vaccine treatment group; thegeometric mean titres were also calculated. The titres representthe reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in a 50% reduction in thenumber of plaques. ZIKV challenge studies in IFNAR/mice For challenge studies, IFNAR/mice ( n= 10/group) were immunised once twice with the ZIKA-prME vaccine or pVax1. The micewere challenge with either 1 \u00d7 106PFU or 2 \u00d7 106PFU ZIKV-PR209 virus on day 15 (single immunisation group) or day 21 one week after the secondimmunisation (two immunisation groups). Post challenge, the animalswere weighed and body temperature was measured daily by asubcutaneously located temperature chip. In addition, they were observedfor clinical signs of disease twice daily (decreased mobility; hunchedposture; hind-limb knuckle walking (partial paralysis), paralysis of one hindlimb or both hind limbs) and blood was drawn for viral load determination.The criteria for killing on welfare grounds consisted of 20% weight loss orparalysis in one or both hind limbs. Real-time RT-PCR assay for measurement of ZIKV load The brains from treated mice were immersed in RNAlater (Ambion,Waltham, MA, USA) 4 \u00b0C for 1 week, then stored at 80 \u00b0C. The brain tissue was then weighed and homogenised in 600 l RLT buffer in a 2 ml cryovial using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) with a stainless steel beadfor 6 min at 30 cycles/s. Viral RNA was also isolated from blood with theRNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). A ZIKV speci c real-time RT-PCR assay was utilised for the detection of viral RNA from subject animals. RNA wasreverse transcribed and ampli ed using the primers ZIKV 835 ZIKV 911c TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A standard curve wasgenerated in parallel for each plate and used for the quanti cation of viral genome copy numbers. The StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (LifeTechnologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) software version 2.3 wasused to calculate the cycle threshold (Ct) values, and a Ct value 38 for at least one of the replicates was considered positive, as previouslydescribed. 29Pre-bleeds were negative in this assay. Statistical analysis Differences in fold increases in antibody titres were compared using Mann - Whitney analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad, Prism 4ZIKA virus prM envelope -based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al 10 Npj Vaccines (2016) 16021 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development(Graphpad software, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). For all the analyses, Po0.05 was considered to be signi cant. Log 10transformations were applied to end point binding ELISA titres and whole-virus PRNT 50titres.
