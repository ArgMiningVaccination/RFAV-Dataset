I was excited to try Nude By Nature's natural-setting-spray as I've not tried it before. Although I have used numerous brands of setting sprays, and like using them. I really like the packaging of this product, nice, clean and simple with the eye catching rose gold accents. I applied this onto my skin after completing my day's makeup. I was instantly calmed by the lovely, fresh scent that came from this spray. I'm super happy that this is a natural product, it contains Australian Kakadu Plum, a wonderful ingredient that contains lots of Vitamin C, which is great for protection against Australia's harsh sun rays and also aids the skin in collagen production....the ultimate multi-tasking product. Really more of a skincare than cosmetic product. After using this a few times for makeup setting, I have come to the conclusion that this spray doesn't set my makeup at all. But, all is not lost. I actually really like this as a facial spritz and will be using on a daily basis to add extra benefits to my skincare routine. "}
