No stickers or tags required. Works anytime, anywhere. [VIDEO] Vision AI Authentication Authenticate your products with the highest level of accuracy, whether on a unit or batch level. Fully secured and 100% immutable, eliminating the need for expensive experts, lab tests, or middlemen. Just a smartphone. [VIDEO] Vision AI Inspection Ensure the integrity of your products throughout the supply chain by detecting changes on a microstructure level. Highly cost-effective, easily scalable, and require no special hardware. Just vision AI models. [VIDEO] Vision AI Tokenization Create an immutable link between the physical product and the blockchain record, such as the source code or NFT. This will secure ownership and ensure authenticity with a smartphone. The service is Web3 ready. Types of PHYSICAL CODE Types of Physical code Individual Physical Code Protect and trace each item individually using its own unique microstructure. Batch Physical Code Protect and trace an entire SKU of items by learning the characteristics of a small sample set. The secret sauce Our Physical Code cannot be changed, manipulated, or tampered with because it is based on an item's unique material structure \u2014 unlike tags, chips, or invisible markers. Competitive Advantages Competitive advantage State-of-the-Art CV/ML Algorithms Contains 30+ CV/ML methods never described in any article. 5Y+ competitive advantage.
