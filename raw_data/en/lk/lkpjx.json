Lahlou's sagais quite memorable, detailing the case of a body ravaged by cancer andsubmitted to medical treatment. Ultimately, however, it is religion thatwill bring the cure. The intersection of this afflicted body with religionand the divine will be explored in chapter 5. The nexus of the femalebody and medicine is equally crucial, as the corporal intertwines in fas-cinating ways with the medical and the geographical. Various geogra-phies manifest themselves as the mutating cancerous body traverses theglobe. Like her sisters in the Islamic revival movement who undergo dra- matic spiritual experiences, Le\u00efla Lahlou relates her journey in the rstperson. 1Do Not Forget God (Fal\u00e2 Tansa All\u00e2h) is the title of her book.2 More correctly, the title should be translated as So Do Not Forget God, but it will be rendered here as Do Not Forget God. Originally written in Arabic, the work has appeared in multiple editions and was translatedinto French as N'oublie pas Dieu. 3This French translation is unfortu- nately littered with errors (mistranslations, omissions of important ma-terials like the religious intertext, etc.). Nevertheless, it will be used be-low at a specic stage in the analysis. The injunction not to forget the Deity is in the masculine singular. True, strictly speaking, grammatically the use of the male gender could 69include the female. But why stretch the linguistic limits when one is speaking, of all things, about breast cancer, an essentially female afflic-tion? 4The signicance of this grammatical choice will become evident as the analytical journey continues. This title also stands out not so much because of what it includes (i.e., the male gender) as because of what it excludes. In the context of otherworks written by women and emanating from the Islamic revival move-ment, Do Not Forget God also singles itself out because of its absence of the personal. There is no reference here to \"my journey,\" as in thework of Kar\u00eem\u00e2n Hamza or work briefly discussed, Rihlat\u00ee min al-Zalam\u00e2t il\u00e2 al-N\u00fbr (My Journey from Darkness to Light) by Shams al-B\u00e2r\u00fbd\u00ee. 5Do Not Forget God is also far from femme, et l'int\u00e9grisme: Journal d'une jeune femme europ\u00e9enne (Islam, Woman, and Integrism: Journal of a Young European Woman), the spiritual sagaof Sultana Kouhmane, the Moroccan-Belgian Islamic activist who willgure prominently below. 6It is precisely its nature as an injunction that permits Lahlou's title to transcend the personal and address itself to boththe male and female genders. But the story Le\u00efla tells about her breast cancer is quite gender spe- cic. 7Le\u00efla's narrative eschews absolute chronology: the sequence of events is there but not their dates. Le\u00efla discovers her breast cancer herself as she is taking a bath. A visit to her Moroccan physician is followed by more medical tests in Belgium:she is diagnosed with cancer. The chemotherapy treatment is adminis-tered in Morocco, but due to illness Le\u00efla is obliged to return to Belgiumfor more medical attention. Belgium is then followed by a diagnostic tripto France. All the physical examinations conrm the identical result: aserious cancer which has already metastasized. In Paris, before under-taking further treatment, Le\u00efla and her husband decide to perform the cumra, the little pilgrimage to Mecca. On the cumra, Le\u00efla maintains an ascetic regimen consisting of an egg, bread, and water from the sacred well of Zamzam, a regimen thatleads to the disappearance of the lumps in her body. 8Medical tests in France after the cumra conrm this nding. Nevertheless, the French physician recommends treatment to eliminate any vestige of the cancerin her lungs. Le\u00efla returns home, where she becomes ill. Then follows aseries of treatments in both Europe and Morocco. Her return to Mo-rocco only means time spent between the hospital and her home. Themonth of Ramad\u00e2n nds her in a worsened state in which she is losingconsciousness, and the physician decides to send her home to her fam-70 Chapter 4ily. Her family members are worried that Le\u00efla's end is near and have very little hope of her coming out of her coma. She, however, felt thatshe was not in a coma, but rather in an extended sleep. It is during thisstate that the Prophet Muhammad appears to Le\u00efla in a dream and wipeshis hand on her head, effecting a cure. Le\u00efla awakens, walks energeti-cally, and recounts the incident to her family, whose members are verypleased. She spends much of the night in prayer, and this happy eventsignals at once the end of Le\u00efla's rst-person narrative as well as her cure\"from this dangerous illness.\" 9 In her introduction, Le\u00efla Lahlou alerts her reader to the fact that hers is a factual story. But this is not only a true story\u2014it is a highly dra-matic one as well. It is not just the corporal cure from a dreaded breastcancer that the reader witnesses. Throughout the drama, the femalebody plays a most important role. This should not perhaps come as asurprise, since, after all, breast cancer is rst and foremost a conditionof the female body. This cancerous female body which is Le\u00efla's plays, however, on more than just the narrative stage that is the spiritual journey detailed in Do Not Forget God. What can be called breast-cancer narratives\u2014that is, texts recounting a woman's experience with breast cancer\u2014 are pro-liferating, much as the illness seems to be. Be it in English or other western languages, women rush to narrate their experience with the disease. The task here is not bibliographical. As Barbara Seaman puts it:\"Breast-cancer books written by patients are not entirely new.\" 10Sim- ply, by calling attention to the generic types of works that discuss breastcancer, it becomes easier to see the contribution of the Moroccan Le\u00eflaLahlou. Discussions by women of breast cancer can be on the level of cultural discourse analysis or on the level of personal testimony. Susan Sontag'sgroundbreaking work, Illness as Metaphor, is one of the best-known studies of the cultural languages of cancer. Emanating from a personalexperience (the author was diagnosed with breast cancer), Sontag'swork goes beyond the personal to comment on societal attitudes to dis-ease. 11The personal narratives of women suffering from this killer con- dition abound, and they can range from autobiography, such as JoyceWadler's My Breast, to play, such as Elisabeth Gille's Le crabe sur la ban- quette arri\u00e8re. 12These examples, which can be multiplied, demonstrate clearly that a woman's detailing her experience with breast cancer is nota peculiar phenomenon. On this world literary stage, Le\u00efla Lahlou be-comes one of many female players.Breast Cancer and Medicine 71If one moves, however, from the world stage to the Islamic stage, be it in North Africa or the Middle East, then the story is different, Le\u00efla'srole becomes more unusual. Other women have written of cancer. cAbla al-Ruwayn\u00ee's eloquent work on her late husband, the poet Amal Dun-qul, who was afflicted with this disease, would be one such example. 13 Then there is a short story by the Egyptian feminist physician-writer,Nawal El Saadawi, in which the central character is diagnosed withbreast cancer. 14Other narrative differences aside, this ctional creation, by its nature as a short story, cannot be seen in the same way as Lahlou'sextended narrative. One Arab woman has written of her breast-cancer experience: Eve- lyne Accad. A Lebanese-American, Accad was diagnosed with breastcancer in 1994. She published excerpts from her cancer diary in Al- Raida, the Lebanese journal of the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World. Professor Accad's cancer entries, detailing as they do herdiagnosis and her treatment, are quite revealing. Following a surgicalprocedure, she writes: \"From now on, I belonged to all my sisters whohave been mutilated, subjected to a mastectomy, hysterectomy, clitori-dectomy, i.e., all the ectomies.\" 15Despite the explicit link clitoridec- tomy, Accad writes from an extra-Middle Eastern locus: her diagnosisis in the West, as is her treatment. This western perspective means that Lahlou's text is still part of a mi- nority opinion. Something else sets Le\u00efla Lahlou apart in the MiddleEastern and North African context, however: her frank discussions ofthe female body. To bare this body before the reader is, to say the least,striking. 16The female body is an obsession in certain contemporary re- vivalist discourses, but it is the female body as an object that must be oc-culted rather than the female body as an object to be examined and an-alyzed, as it is in Lahlou's autobiographical narrative. 17When one adds to this the fact that Islam is part and parcel of Le\u00efla's text, the fact thatshe exposes her female body when this body should literally be coveredis signicant. Even more extraordinary is the trajectory that this body takes on its journey from a medical diagnosis of breast cancer to a spiritual \"cure\"from this dreaded disease. The female body crosses geographical bor-ders as it crosses medical frontiers, becoming along the way a partici-pant in a transnational discourse of the female body. From Casablancato Brussels, from Paris to Mecca, the reader follows the female hero onher various trajectories.72 Chapter 4The centrality of the geographical component appears in the opening sentences of this spiritual journey. The rst words Le\u00efla utters as a nar-rator are: \"From the plane . . .\" She is on the plane, returning from herjourney to Mecca. 18This beginning underlines the signicance of geog- raphy and displacement. In addition, this is an event that takes placelater than its actual narrative location, given that the reader does not yetknow from the journey itself (though that is clear from the introduction)that the narrator: ( a) has breast cancer; ( b) will pursue medical treat- ment; and ( c) will have a corporal intervention in Mecca. To use G\u00e9rard Genette's terminology, this constitutes a prolepsis, a chronological in-trusion in the narrative in which an event occurs chronologically afterits actual placement in the narrative. While the present task is not theexamination of these intrusions in the narrative, one needs neverthelessto keep in mind the nature of this event and its importance as a marker.It sets the entire breast-cancer journey under the sign of religion and theholy. And since the narrator makes a point of bragging about her healthon this return journey from Mecca, it means that the reader is alertedfrom the beginning of the work that the narrator will win her corporalbattle with cancer. If, however, the journey from Mecca is viewed not so much as a pro- lepsis in the cancer narrative but as the true beginning of the narrativeof spiritual salvation, then the entire following story becomes an analep-sis, an event that takes place before its actual location in the narrative.In fact, any autobiographical project constitutes an anachrony of sorts,since the events narrated have all taken place before the process of nar-ration has even occurred. In Le\u00efla's case, this process is heightened bythe opening setting of the narrative, in which the chronology of salva-tion is the opening marker. Le\u00efla's body is, hence, from the beginning, a body in movement. Per- haps one of the most important loci for an analysis of this body in move-ment is the medical environment, an environment that shifts continu-ously between two continents, Europe and Africa. It has been decadessince Michel Foucault made it clear that the clinic and medicine are theirown purveyors of discourse. 19Of course, Foucault is far from alone now. Western cultural critics have delved into the fruitful areas of medi-cine and literature and, recently, Kathryn Montgomery Hunter has elo-quently demonstrated the textual strategies inherent in medical texts,from the ctional to the case history. 20And this is not to speak of Elaine Scarry's groundbreaking work.21Breast Cancer and Medicine 73The nexus of medicine and the body, as cultural constructs, has, un- fortunately, only barely begun to attract the attention of critics in the areaof Middle Eastern studies. And this despite the fact that the physician-writer looms quite large on the literary scene. Names likes those of themale Y\u00fbsuf Idr\u00ees and the female Nawal El Saadawi should already be fa-miliar. 22Both are exceptionally conscious of the body and capitalize on their medical knowledge in much of their ction.23 Of course, ctional creations exploiting medicine and corporality are one thing, autobiographical journeys involving a diseased body, an-other. Medicine in Le\u00efla's journey is a powerful tool that vies with reli-gion in its efcacy. In her narrative, however, it is not simply medicinethat plays an important role. The appended medical documents them-selves create their own alternate narrative, providing a parallel readingof the spiritual saga. Perhaps, for a western audience, it needs to be saidthat these Moroccan physicians in Lahlou's text are working in the iden-tical western-origin scientic medical tradition as their western counter-parts. There is no discordance or break between the two groups. To start at the beginning may seem like an obvious step. In this case, however, it is more than that. Le\u00efla's initial visit to her physician inCasablanca immediately after her own discovery of the abnormality inher breast proves to be a crucial event. With one voice, the members ofLe\u00efla's family urge her to go to Dr. Yacoubi's clinic. doctor . . . women . . . Are you going to go to him?\" I did not answer . . . And it was as though the questions hadbeen posed to an individual other than me . . . I threw myself on them andhugged them warmly as though I were asking for help even from the doctor. . . Yes . 24 Le\u00efla imagines a conversation with the physician in which she be- seeches him not to inform her family of her condition and asks him ifher breasts will be cut off, \"like the breasts of so-and-so were cut off?\"She continues: \"No. By God I will not go and will never go. Leave mealone. I want to sleep.\" Despite her hesitation, Le\u00efla goes to the physi-cian. Dr. Yacoubi, the gynecologist, appears in the text as jovial andfriendly. Nevertheless, Le\u00efla is speechless once she enters his ofce andwishes that her husband would broach another topic with the medicalspecialist. This inability to speak stands in opposition to the imaginaryconversation between Le\u00efla and her physician. There, the female patient74 Chapter 4could give voice to her fear about her potential physical mutilation. Of course, this imaginary dialogue remains precisely that: imaginary, withthe voice of the physician occulted. This does not mean that Yacoubi is absent in the text. Far from it. The gynecologist is the one who examines Le\u00efla's body. He presses on herbreasts and she, sweating and quite uncomfortable, merely moves herbody in various ways to facilitate the physician's task. Hers is the dis-eased passive body, subjected to the physician's procedure and gaze. Isit a wonder that she was \"no longer anything but a doll in the hands ofthe physician\"? 25 When Le\u00efla actually speaks in the physician's ofce it is after the ex- amination. It is then to confront the medical specialist and ask about thesize of the lump and insist that the object in her breast is small. \"Thenwhat I have is not cancer,\" she ascertains. Yacoubi's response argues forlogic: after all, he cannot declare anything before verifying the diagno-sis, something that necessitates examinations. He does, however, con-rm the presence of calcication in the breast. Le\u00efla's corporal entity has begun to transform itself. Her body may be that of a doll, only insofar as it seems to have lost any will of its own;however, if a doll is understood as the representation of an idealizedbody, and more importantly of a static and unchanging body, thenLe\u00efla's corporal entity is far from that. The visit to Dr. Yacoubi and thefollowing medical examinations reveal that she is indeed afflicted with aserious condition. This new corporal reality will begin to dictate a ge-ography of its own, as the Moroccan physician explains the Europeanoptions open to Le\u00efla on her search for medical treatment. The choicesare two: Villejuif in France or Brussels. Because of her fearful negativeassociations with Villejuif and cancer, Le\u00efla chooses Brussels. It wouldbe a mistake to read in this choice a negative reaction to the name of thetown, Villejuif. Among the physicians consulted by the patient was a Dr. Isra\u00ebl, about whom Le\u00efla has only positive things to say, not to men-tion Dr. L\u00e9vy-Lebar of Casablanca. 26Not only is her text free of any sec- tarianism, but all the physicians, whether of Jewish, Christian, or Mus-lim background, are treated in totally nonreligious terms. They are purerepresentatives of science. The visit to Dr. Yacoubi's clinic in Casablanca is the focal point of Le\u00efla's pre-European medical experience in the text. But this visit that ul-timately determines the ill state of Le\u00efla's body will also signal the phys-ical migration of this body, as the female patient pursues treatment in Breast Cancer and Medicine 75Europe. Her trajectory begins in Casablanca. She is sent by her physi- cian to Brugmann Hospital in Brussels.27Unlike Yacoubi's clinic in Casablanca, this locus in Europe receives a detailed description. It was\"all roses/flowers, and water, and trees. As though with the beauty ofnature those in charge wanted to lighten the pain of the patient or makehim forget that he [masculine singular in the Arabic] was in a clinic. . . .Especially if he is told that he has a dangerous illness . . . cancer?!\" 28 Brugmann Hospital is a large hospital with signs directing individuals towhere they should go. And should someone lose the way, there arewomen who will guide him [masculine singular]: \"if you nd yourself ina wing other than the one to which you should be going, there arewomen who point out the right way to you.\" The narrator notes that theradiology specialists try as hard as possible to make the patient [malesingular] feel better and more condent so that \"those large instrumentsand frozen rooms do not frighten him.\" 29 Le\u00efla continues. \"What I also liked were the women who are en- trusted to help the female patient take off her clothes . . . and uncoverthe afflicted side of her body so that the female patient feels a bit betterabout that. . . .\" In the waiting room I found women speaking or, more correctly, telling sto- ries and debating their problems . . . and they would speak about cancer assomething normal, which surprised me. . . . Among them would be one whocomplained about a pain she had once in a while in her lower abdomen, andanother who wondered why her chest swelled . . . and I almost screamed inher face that I also complain of a swelling in my breast . . . and all wait pa-tiently to be called on. . . . And while I was in my frightening dreams awoman asked me which country I was from. . . . no doubt it is my accent thatcaught her attention, making her ask about my country. She smiled uponhearing \"Morocco\" because she had visited Marrakech and Fez and, oh, howmuch she liked them . . . and how much she wished to return to Morocco tostay a longer time there . . . and after a long and extensive discussion of myillness, she made me frightened and calm at the same time . . . and I knew thatshe had had an operation six months ago. . . . her physicians in America hadagreed to take out her breasts . . . so she left them and came to Belgium whereher family was, to perhaps nd a second solution, i.e., cobalt treatment orchemotheraphy. . . . Two nouns that will undoubtedly enter the dictionary ofmy new life. . . . then she moved to France and she did not nish her conver-sation when I was called. I rushed, following the nurse, fullling all the re-quests like a polite child undergoing a difcult examination. I took off myclothes in a cold room. . . . I stayed in this state for ve minutes and my bodywas shaking from the cold. But it was a necessary and natural matter, whichhad to be gone through before beginning the medical examinations. Duringthe entire examination time, the nurse was asking me about the weather, and76 Chapter 4my occupation, and my country. She also was impressed by my home coun- try of Morocco [literally: my Morocco] and loved it a lot . . .30 This is a highly complex incident with multiple discursive layers, in which the geographical mixes with the corporal. The female body stands at thecenter of much of the discourse, and specically the baring of this femalebody, its uncovering. Take the geographical layer rst. Geography here is, on the most ob- vious level, that of the world. But this incident makes it clear that eventhis world geography is not so simple. There are a geography of tourismand a geography of medicine. Tourism involves Morocco. In the medi-cal setting, Le\u00efla hears admiring comments from both a female patientand a nurse about \"my Morocco.\" The patient had visited Marrakechand Fez, liked them a great deal, and wished to return there to spend alonger time. As for the nurse, she also engages Le\u00efla in a conversationabout her home country. The geography of medicine is the all-encompassing geography that subsumes the geography of tourism within it. After all, it is in the med-ical establishment that Le\u00efla hears tourist praise of her country. The dis-course of the clinic is not identical in Europe and Morocco. In Europe,Le\u00efla becomes the exotic other. And this even in the medical environ-ment in which she is surrounded by women who, like herself, are af-flicted with cancer. This complicated geography of medicine involves an elaborate set of physical displacements in which the diseased female body is shuttledfrom one continent to another in search of medical treatment. The nar-rator hails from North Africa and nds herself at the time of this inci-dent in Europe. Her corporal trajectory takes place between Africa,Asia, and Europe. The difference is that the tourist geography is one gen-erated from Europe, whereas the other geographies (both medical andsacred) come from within the Moroccan cultural sphere. Le\u00efla is not, however, the only character involved in this medical ge- ography. One of the female patients in the Brussels clinic explains thatshe hails from America and has been crossing geographical borders insearch of a solution to her physical dilemma: breast cancer. She had hadan operation six months earlier and had left the physicians in Americawho wished to remove her breasts in order to come to Belgium for a sec-ond opinion. Then this patient moved to France. This breast-cancer vic-tim textually disappears as Le\u00efla is called, and the reader never discoverswhat France will hold for her. As Le\u00efla's own narrative develops acrossBreast Cancer and Medicine 77geographical and national borders, she nds herself eventually in France, much as her copatient did in this incident. This larger medical geography of countries and national borders in which the female body travels and that subsumed within it a geographyof tourism is offset in this incident by another sort of geography, that ofthe European clinic. When Brugmann Hospital makes an entrance inLe\u00efla's life, it is immediately introduced as \"a hospital which is all roses/flowers, and water, and trees.\" This is an interesting description indeed.It draws away from the institutional aspect of the building as an archi-tectural entity designed for medical purposes and turns it almost into anatural park. Notice the inclusive quality of the \"all,\" which initiallyleaves no space for other physical characteristics. The \"nature\" aspectof this is not foreign to Le\u00efla. It is she, after all, who declares that throughthis environment of \"nature,\" those in charge in the medical institutionwished to lighten the burden of pain from those afflicted with serious ill-nesses, like cancer. This idealized description of the nature-lled hospital is soon aban- doned in favor of an intricate physical geography of the hospital. Likethe female body that must be uncovered, so the reality that is the physi-cal hospital is also uncovered, one level at a time. The reader discoversthat the entity that begins as \"all roses/flowers, and water, and trees,\"Brugmann Hospital is, in fact, a large complex with elaborate signs di-recting people to where they should go. Someone lost is given guidanceby women who are there for that purpose. These women guides help individuals navigate the labyrinth of the medical institution. But the textual appearance of these female guides isnot without importance. They do more in Le\u00efla's journey than just pointout the right hospital hallways. They signal a female presence that willbe signicant for Le\u00efla as she enters the world of the European hospital.And this female presence is intimately tied to the corporal component inthe text. The women guides function as the links between geographyand corporality. In much the same way that women help lost individuals nd their way, so it is that women help other women bare their bodies and locatethe afflicted area. This baring of the female entity is not simply one in-volving the divesting of clothing. When Le\u00efla enters the world of the Eu-ropean hospital in Brussels, she becomes part of a corporal female com-munity dened by physical illness. In fact, the uncovering of the female body takes place on two levels. On the one hand, there is the verbal undressing, what one could call the78 Chapter 4telling event, and on the other hand, there is the physical undressing, what one could call the examination event. Both events, the telling andthe examination, occur in a medical setting, the clinic, and are heraldedby the women guides. The telling event is embedded in the examinationevent, in that it is while awaiting the examination that the women telltheir stories and debate their problems. What these women create in the European clinic is a female group linked by a common corporal problem. This bonding represents a homo-sociality that permits the women to discuss the body and its afflictions. 31 The clinic, a closed space in which individuals come together out of a uni-fying principle, here cancer and female maladies, is an ideal environmentfor the creation of homosociality. In this homosocial environment, the fe-male diseased body becomes an object that can be discussed and in theprocess transformed into a public entity. Another form of female ho-mosociality, one based on religion, will be signicant below. 32 The women form a community sharing their illnesses. Le\u00efla \"almost\" participates in this event of women speaking their bodies when shenearly screams out about the swelling in her chest. But she does not. Sheremains textually, for the purposes of this event, an observer and not anactive participant. She confesses that it is her accent that alerts one of thefemale patients to ask her about her country. The reader remains in thedark about what she might have said. Her precise role in any dialogueis a mystery and her actual words are hidden in the narrative. There is an inherent tension between the homosociality of this inci- dent in which the women share both their stories and their bodies andthe fact that Le\u00efla appears to stand alone. She does not relate her ownexperience to the other women and, even more important, she appearsto undress alone. And all this despite the presence of women whose aidin this area is praised. The situation in this instance is not entirely dis-similar to that in Dr. Yacoubi's clinic in Casablanca. There, Le\u00efla wasunable to utter a word. She was like a doll. The experience in the hos-pital in Brussels turns her into a \"polite child undergoing a difcult ex-amination.\" The Arabic word here refers to an educational examina-tion, not a medical one. In the company of women, though, there is progress. From a doll, Le\u00efla becomes a young child. She moves from inanimate object to hu-man being, albeit a still immature one. Is it a wonder then that shespeaks of a new life and of learning a new vocabulary, much as a childmight? In her case, however, it is the language of medical treatment:cobalt and chemotherapy, \"two nouns that will undoubtedly enter theBreast Cancer and Medicine 79dictionary of my new life.\"33This is a language taught her by other women in the homosocial environment of the diseased female body. The female homosociality inherent in this incident stands in contrast to the experience in Casablanca. There, the initial consultation with Dr. Yacoubi is followed by a visit to a laboratory. The narrator under-goes a mammography, coldly described as \"a big instrument with whichthey press on the breast from every side.\" Le\u00efla initially stands alone,without the companionship of other women suffering the same fate.This homosociality in the European hospital will become importantlater, when viewed against the female homosociality in Mecca. There,religion will bring Le\u00efla close to her Muslim sisters who are party to hercure as they examine her body for any signs of abnormalities. 34 Notwithstanding her eloquent aside about having to learn a new lan- guage, the narrator had already demonstrated to the astute reader aconceptual sophistication when discussing her physical condition. Asshe ponders, in the beginning of the journey, whether or not to tell herdaughter that she is afflicted with cancer, she notes the difculty ofexpressing the existence of this disease, which is referred to by all sortsof names except that of \"cancer, its true name.\" These linguistic sub-terfuges and euphemisms include \"a deadly illness, a dangerous epi-demic,\" and similar terms. Le\u00efla's own metaphors are imbued with thelanguage of incarceration and punishment. The elegant clinic of thephysician becomes a dark prison, and the narrator feels that her fate iscapital punishment: \"my name was registered in another world. ...t h e world of cancer is the world of the death sentence.\" 35As Le\u00efla moves geographically from North Africa, she describes this as moving \"thebattle abroad.\" 36Of course, this terminology and the concomitant im- ages would certainly not be alien to someone like Susan Sontag.37They simply conrm that the discourse of cancer has a quasi-universal sub-stratum that permits its migration and its existence in a transnationallanguage of the diseased body. As Le\u00efla moves from medical environment to medical environment, in the process crossing continents and national borders, her medicaldossier moves with her. This le makes its rst entrance in the text inLe\u00efla's initial visit to a medical setting, that of Dr. Yacoubi's clinic inCasablanca. The narrator notes that it is the custom of the Moroccangynecologist to \"ask about the state of his female patient while he readsher dossier and writes in it the date of her last visit.\" 38On his request, following her mammography, the folder is quickly returned to him onthe same day.80 Chapter 4This rst appearance of Le\u00efla's medical dossier is far from being de- void of interest. The record surfaces in the text at the same time as Le\u00efla'spredicament and will maintain its existence alongside her cancer. Thecreation of the medical record is a process in which the patient and thephysician partake. The gynecologist inquires about his patient's condi-tion as he reads and writes in the dossier. The words of the patient aretransmuted into a written record that will form part of a dossier, inti-mately linked to the medical professional who manipulates it and con-trols it. After all, the gynecologist dictates to the laboratory the speedwith which the results of the patient's examination are to be returned,and the medical laboratory complies with the physician's wishes. This medical dossier will continue to resurface and will transform it- self as the female body changes. Le\u00efla's initial visit to \"Fu\" in Belgiumwill signal the dossier once again. 39Like his Moroccan colleague, Fu also examines the female patient and reads her dossier. \"And how smalland thin it was at the beginning. . . . And he opened a new folder withmy address in my home country and my life from my earliest youth tothis very day, with all its happenings.\" 40With this ofcial birth of a new medical le in Europe, Le\u00efla's medical record takes on a life of its own.This dossier is now able to grow and get bigger. 41Not only that, but it seems to have an uncanny ability to cross national boundaries, much asits subject does. Le\u00efla returns to North Africa after her medical bout inBelgium: \"I returned anew to my energy and vitality . . . and my life be-came the life of any normal woman. . . . \"My dossier arrived at Mr. Yacoubi's it was the treatment plan! . . . And the treatment as she arrives ( wasaln\u00e2 ) in Casablanca airport with her husband, her dossier arrives ( wasala ) at Yacoubi's, one assumes from Europe as well. Perhaps the most dramatic moment for this medical record occurs af- ter the rst religious intervention in Mecca. As is to be expected, themedical record makes no appearance during Le\u00efla's journey and subse-quent visit to the holy places of Islam. The reader knows that it is inMecca that the physical symptoms of her illness disappear. She is veryanxious to visit the various medical specialists who had predicted nocure whatsoever for her. She leaves them complete freedom to repeattheir examinations anew, including a biopsy. \"They were detailed, dif-cult, long, and repeated examinations.\" The physicians are nervous.They begin to ask her, \"Are you really so and so? The daughter of so and so? The wife of so and so? Do you have two children, Nadia andKarim?\" She answers them sarcastically and without fear, \"Yes! Yes!\" 43Breast Cancer and Medicine 81The examinations were all negative, a fact that leaves the physicians confused and surprised. \"They compared the rst dossier and the lastdossier.\" 44The evaluation of the two les is much the same as the evalu- ation of the female patient's body, which is rst afflicted with the breastcancer and then seemingly not. And when Le\u00efla travels to Paris to consult with a French oncologist after the rst religious intervention in Mecca, her medical record goeswith her. This time the le is even bigger, thanks to the fact that all herexaminations have been repeated, as have the x-rays of her entire body.Professor \"I\" examines this \"strange dossier\" very carefully and pre-scribes more treatment. 45 Patient and medical dossier are leading a quasi-parallel life. This \"strange\" medical record is nothing but a kind of external manifestationof the narrator's illness and corporal reality. Much like her own physi-cal body, it moves across various sorts of boundaries, from physician tophysician. By not venturing forth to Mecca along with the narrator, themedical le remains, as it were, in the \"scientic\" realm and not in thespiritual one. After all, there was nothing to keep Le\u00efla from consultingwith physicians in Saudi Arabia, but she does not. Her consultationsthere are restricted to the domain of the religious. The medical practi-tioner, be he in the hospital or the clinic, is replaced with the religiousgure of the Imam of the mosque. 46 Just as the narrator's body undergoes a radical change in Mecca with the disappearance of the lumps, so her medical and social identity mustbe reestablished after this corporal and spiritual intervention. That is inessence why the questioning about her family identity becomes so cru-cial. Her sarcastic and proud response helps seal the social identity inthe face of the changing body. This medical folder that registers the life of the protagonist from her earliest days and exists alongside her through her medical journey isreminiscent of the Book of Judgment. In Le\u00efla's case, however, this Bookof Judgment records the medical and corporal, the religious being leftaside. The essential irony of this, of course, is that the salvation from thedreaded cancer comes through the spiritual interventions, both that inMecca and that in Morocco through the oneiric experience. 47 The parallel life of the patient, on the one hand, and the medical dossier, on the other, is conrmed in the physical entity that is the book,Do Not Forget God. In fact, the book as physical object pulls together the two narratives, of which one (that of Le\u00efla) claims to be the inter-preter between the other (that of the physicians) and the resulting book.82 Chapter 4As the reader follows the trajectory of the medical record and the dis- cussion of the various examinations to which the narrator submits, thereader may well become aware that behind this inspiring journey to a re-ligious cure from breast cancer lies a variety of medical documents. Thereader is not to be disappointed. Le\u00efla, as if she were herself conscious ofher own reader's mind, obliges. At the end of her corporal and spiritualjourney, Le\u00efla is cured by the Prophet Muhammad by means of a dream,an incident to be investigated in detail below. 48The dream and its cure signal the end of the narrative text. This is conrmed by the table of con-tents at the end of the physical entity that is the Arabic book. In the orig-inal Arabic text, the medical documents are not evident from the tableof contents, in which they are not listed. In the French text, however,their existence is signaled in a section entitled \"Documents annexes.\" Before presenting these medical documents, the narrator advises her reader that some may nd her account fanciful. The medical documentsare there to avert this possibility. She invites the doubting reader to \"ex-amine them carefully.\" She is permitting the documents \"to speak forthemselves\" so that readers can see through them the power and wisdomof God, as evidenced by part of a Qur'\u00e2nic verse, \"When He desiressomething, He says to it: 'be' and it is.\" 49 By arguing that the medical materials should \"speak for themselves,\" the rst-person female narrator is alerting the reader that another voicehas entered the work, the voice of medicine. This is a \"cancer in twovoices,\" but not like that of Sandra Butler and Barbara Rosenblum.Their two voices are a patient and her partner; 50Le\u00efla Lahlou's are a pa- tient, on the one hand, and the medical establishment, on the other. Themedical voice in Lahlou's text is not introduced, however, for its ownsake but rather as proof of the divine word. Yet, an examination of theentirety of her medical documents demonstrates that not a single one, beit from North Africa or Europe, broaches the issue of religion. So what kind of documents are these whose power goes beyond their mere medical validity to support the power of the Deity? The medicaldocuments, unlike the rst-person narration by Le\u00efla, are dated. Theyprovide a real chronological frame for the events in the work. Further,the medical documents in the Arabic original and in the French transla-tion are not identical. The French work includes more documents thanits Arabic counterpart. Nevertheless, the nature of the documentationdoes not differ substantially from one text to the other. The diagnosticreports range from laboratories in France commissioned to performblood tests to radiologists in Morocco providing the results of variousBreast Cancer and Medicine 83x-rays. The reader will also nd statements and certications from phy- sicians attesting that they have indeed been following the female patient,and providing their medical judgment of her state. Le\u00efla's invitation to her reader that he or she examine the documents carefully is a bit disingenuous. Most readers will nd themselves at a losswhen facing these scientic papers. Or, at the very least, they will be in-timidated. The average reader will be looking at a medical certicatedrafted on letterhead bearing a physician's name, the name of a labora-tory, or the name of a hospital. Some of the documents are handwritten,rendering them more difcult to decipher. The Arabophone reader, withthe Arabic text in hand, will be facing an even greater dilemma: all themedical documentation is in French. The only Arabic he or she will en-counter in that section of the work will be the names and addresses ofthe Moroccan medical practitioners. These essential facts about thepractitioners, along with their medical degrees, are displayed both inArabic and in French (one facing the other on the same letterhead). Forthe reader of the French translation, the alterity between Le\u00efla's rst-person narration and the medical testimonies will not be as radical. Nevertheless, there is an inherent discordance between the personal breast-cancer narrative as told by the female patient and that other nar-rative of her condition, the narrative of the medical establishment. Thescrutiny of one medical document will demonstrate the complexities ofthis alternate medical discourse in the work. This document is a letter addressed to Dr. Yacoubi in Casablanca from a Belgian oncologist, Dr. H. M. Tagnon. The document appears in boththe French and the Arabic editions of Lahlou's work. Dr. Tagnon typeshis missive on the letterhead of the European Organization for Researchon Treatment [sic] of Cancer in Brussels, of which he is the past president.\"Cher Confr\u00e8re,\" begins Tagnon. This letter is in the rst-person singu-lar: Tagnon has seen Madame Lahlou, whose cancer has metastasized.The metastases are \"unfortunately\" partly due to the chemotherapy andto the fact that this treatment did not include endoxan, \"following theflat refusal of the patient to take this medication, which causes hair to fallout\" ( \u00e0 la suite du refus absolu Tagnon continues by informing his Moroc- can colleague that he has convinced the patient to follow the enclosedtreatment, with which he has provided her and which includes endoxan.\"She has promised me to submit herself\" to the new plan. Tagnon thanksYacoubi and adds that this patient is extremely sensitive and needs con-84 Chapter 4siderable moral support, which the two of them should be able to pro- vide. He has promised her that he will see her as often as she would like.Noting when he would like her next visit to be, the Belgian oncologistsigns off with the usual French formalities. 51 This French missive from Tagnon to Yacoubi is telling. It is a docu- ment that indeed speaks for itself, to quote the narrator of Do Not For- get God: it is narrated in the rst person. And this rst-person male nar- rator, a medical specialist, is a favored speaker, addressing himself toanother male specialist. True, the sender is in Europe and the recipientin North Africa, but no matter. This is the privilege of the transnationalbody. It can become the subject of the identical medical discourse, be itin Morocco or in Belgium. In Tagnon's narration, the female patient surfaces only as an object of the discourse. She is now \"Madame Lahlou,\" whose concern over herphysical appearance and fear of hair loss prevented her from followingthe prescribed medical treatment, thus helping the cancer to spreadthroughout her body. This is also a fairly weak individual, in need of agreat deal of support. But the missive is reassuring on that front. Thevoice of the physician is at once superior, strong, and protective. Tagnon'senglobing nous (we) speaks to himself and his Moroccan colleague: they should be able to provide the breast-cancer victim with the moral supportshe requires. The female patient may be painted here as a weak individual in need of help. But there is an essential irony to Tagnon's words that only ap-pears when his letter to Yacoubi is placed in the context of Le\u00efla's rst-person female narrative. Tagnon had condently assured his Moroccancolleague \"Madame Lahlou\" promised him that she would \"sub-mit herself\" to the new treatment. Submission is an interesting term indeed. Tagnon's letter is dated April 4, 1979. It will be remembered that Le\u00efla's Arabic text contains nodates. Nevertheless, an archaeology of the appended medical documentsreveals that Tagnon's letter immediately precedes the visit to Paris, dur-ing which Le\u00efla consulted the French oncologist, \"I,\" who conrmed thediagnosis of his Belgian colleague. This is Dr. Isra\u00ebl of the H\u00f4pital Avi-cenne, whose handwritten testimony is included in the appendix to theArabic text, but not in that to the French text. It is after the visit to \"I\"that Le\u00efla and her husband perform the cumra to Mecca. And, of course, this pilgrimage will bring about the rst religious intervention, in whichthe physical symptoms of the cancer disappear. Islam is the triumphantBreast Cancer and Medicine 85hero here: Islam, a word that means \"submission.\" Lahlou has submit- ted herself, as Tagnon so eloquently put it. Her submission, however,was not to medicine but to religion\u2014not to the physicians but to God. Le\u00efla invites the medical records to \"speak for themselves.\" But she attempts to orient the reader's perspective with the intertextual game ofinserting a Qur'\u00e2nic verse in the course of this invitation. The astutereader who listens to these documents speak will hear a narrative, pre-dominantly male (the laboratory results are not gender coded), that re-denes and recontextualizes the rst-person narrative of the female pa-tient. The French medical documentation serves as testimony to theArabic verbal journey narrated in the rst person, in which Le\u00efla takesthe reader from the discovery of the cancer to its cure. These materialsdo not form a closure as such to the case, but they do provide the workwith a medical, scientic cover. 52 In the medical documentation, Le\u00efla is the third-person object. The story of the ravaged female body told by the rst-person narrator is trans-muted into the words of the physicians, who turn the female narrator intothe object of a medical discourse generated by scientic personnel andlaboratories, stretching from Casablanca through Bordeaux to Brussels. The transformation of the female narrator into the object of the dis- course is, in its own way, not dissimilar from the phenomenon of Kar\u00ee-m\u00e2n Hamza, whose spiritual journey was sandwiched between the in-troduction and the epilogue by men. 53In Kar\u00eem\u00e2n's universe, however, all the parties involved in the creation of the various discourses of whichKar\u00eem\u00e2n is either the subject (as narrator) or the object (as \"narratee\")belonged to the identical universe, the spiritual one. Le\u00efla's mutation isdifferent because she herself acts as the mediator between her own nar-ration and the testimony of the medical establishment, introducing thedocuments and encouraging her reader to immerse himself or herself inthem. Le\u00efla's situation of go-between means that she is endorsing herown change in status from rst-person narrator who controls the per-sonal journey to object of the medical discourse. This entire game with narration and the medical documents calls into question Le\u00efla's agency in the text. The analysis of the Belgian physi-cian's letter made it clear that he and the narrator understood the issueof submission quite differently. While he wished her to submit herself tomedicine, she instead submitted herself to religion. This personal act onthe part of the female narrator demonstrates what appears at the outsetas full control over her destiny.86 Chapter 4But the issue is much more complicated. Control over her destiny and her body is not so simple for the breast-cancer victim. There are two is-sues central to this question of control, and both relate to Le\u00efla's agencyin the text. On the one hand, there is the issue of knowledge, and on theother hand, there is the issue of the body. Of course, knowledge consti-tutes, among other things, awareness of the narrator's physical condi-tion, a condition ultimately linked to her body. For the moment, how-ever, one needs to separate the body as an abstract entity from the bodyas a corporal phenomenon undergoing transformation as the disease pro-gresses. This latter involves knowledge of what is transpiring in thatchanging body. Take the body as abstract entity rst. From the initial discovery of the abnormality in her breast until the nal cure from this dreaded cancer,Le\u00efla's body seems to be under the control of other characters in the text.This external control effectively begins early in the journey. After all, theinitial push to visit the Moroccan physician in his clinic comes fromvarious family members and not directly from the narrator herself. Andas her body travels from North Africa to Europe and Asia, that body un-dergoes various examinations and treatments partially administered byother characters in the story. Be it in Yacoubi's clinic or in the Belgianhospital, Le\u00efla's body is turned into a public object. This public aspect of her body is not alien to Le\u00efla. Perhaps the most signicant element of the body as public object is the gaze. The gaze sur-faces in the opening pages of the text. As the central character of the spir-itual journey begins her saga with the cancer, the visual componentreigns supreme. The reader watches as rst the narrator and then the var-ious members of her family gaze at her body, specically at her abnormalbreast. Verbs expressing the action of looking and observing abound, asthis activity is pursued. And, of course, there is the all-important medi-cal gaze that haunts the breast-cancer victim. The gaze even reappears inthe religious setting of the pilgrimage to Mecca. 54 Le\u00efla herself, however, is not immune to the exploitation of this all- powerful gaze. In a manner that is quite out of character in the MiddleEast and North Africa, she declares her wish to show off her body. Onher return to Casablanca after the initial operation in Belgium that lefther diseased breast intact, she triumphantly boasts: \"I arrived at theCasablanca airport. . . . and I almost opened my shirt out of joy . . . andif I had been able to, I would have said to the passers-by: I was cured . . .my cancer has left me.\" 55Breast Cancer and Medicine 87This desire to exhibit the body is, on one level, understandable, and demonstrates the excitement of the female narrator over the fact thatphysicians in Europe had not performed a mastectomy and that herbody remained whole. She had already discovered this herself, but herinclination to share this information with mere strangers by taking offher shirt in a public place like the Casablanca airport is, to say the least,unusual. In the Islamic cultural context in which Le\u00efla is operating, dis-playing the female body is taboo. 56Displaying this body naked would be an even greater cultural challenge. But beyond simply a mere allusion to a passing desire for body dis- play, this incident in the Casablanca airport signals much more for thebody. It is now that Le\u00efla feels she can speak about her breast as thoughit were like any other piece of her body, without shame. And how proud I was . . . and who is the woman who would not take pride in this? A cancer in her breast? And this diseased part was not taken out . . .was not cut . . was not disgured. . . . who is the woman whowill not look in the mirror after this illness and not have a smile mixed withtears to praise God over what the mirror reflects to her. . . . everything as Godwanted it is in its place . . . as though nothing had happened. 57 This aside on the body is embedded in Le\u00efla's narration of her arrival in Casablanca, an event to which she returns immediately after thesehappy observations. This return to the homeland, this geographical displacement from Eu- rope to North Africa, necessitates these comments on corporal stabilityand the unchanging body. Interestingly enough, all the observationsabout the body are based on external and supercial criteria dealingwith appearance. Le\u00efla's pride in her body is based on the fact that thatbody is complete and undamaged: no mutilation has taken place, no\"ectomy,\" to use Evelyne Accad's terminology. 58The narrator is not happy leaving the issue here. She feels the need to bring in the Deity, whomust be praised for the fact that the body parts are where they should be. The concern with the outward appearance of the body as a whole entity, as something that has not been mutilated, is not too dissimilarfrom \"the same as before\" phenomenon that Audre Lorde discusses. InThe Cancer Journals, Lorde speaks about the breast-cancer victim who chooses prosthesis following a mastectomy as someone who \"wishes tobe 'the same as before.'\" 59Of course, Le\u00efla's concern here is precisely because she has not lost a breast but instead can have the same body she88 Chapter 4has always had. Nevertheless, there is a nostalgia here for the body as undamaged goods. This assessment of the body as a sum of its parts that are not dis- turbed, as the gaze and its reflection in the mirror verify, leaves aside theentire question of the internal cancer plaguing the female narrator. Infact, knowledge about the inner workings of the body and not its exte-rior appearance is a question that occurs over and over again in the nar-rative and leads to the area of the agency of the narrator and controlover her body. From the rst medical encounter between Le\u00efla and a physician, which takes place in Yacoubi's clinic, Le\u00efla seems to be arguing for theintegrity of her body. It is here that she declares that the size of the lumpin her breast is proof that she does not have cancer. This negation of thecorporal reality is immediately questioned by the attending physician.Dr. Yacoubi informs her that they have found calcication. It is really at this point that medical certainty establishes that Le\u00efla's body, as a corporal entity, has begun to be transformed. And these cor-poral transformations will continue throughout the narrative as the can-cer rst metastasizes, then goes into remission, then is seemingly cured.At the same time the physical reality that is Le\u00efla's body undergoes radi-cal modications as it encounters the various medical treatments and theascetic regimen in Mecca. The body becomes an evolving, mutating unitand a complex of parts: as the cancer changes and moves, as the variousmedical treatments enter the body, so the body is altered. 60 Throughout many of these variations, Le\u00efla remains, as it were, out- side her own body, calling her own agency into question. She is certain,for example, that her husband asked the Belgian specialist \"to hide thetruth from me.\" Nor did this physician \"answer my questions.\" 61After certain treatment decisions are made, including the use of chemother-apy, Le\u00efla notes that she was not asked what she herself would prefer. 62 She does, of course, as she herself admits, overhear her husband speak-ing to the oncologist about her cancer, leaving no doubt that she wasquite aware of her own physical condition. In fact, she overhears herhusband crying out to the physician, \"No. . . . She will never die in threemonths.\" Le\u00efla moves away after she hears the physician prescribing amastectomy and chemotherapy\u2014all to the husband. 63 Le\u00efla's protestations are a clear sign that she felt no control over her own fate, no sense of agency when dealing with her malignancy. In this,she differs drastically from many western breast-cancer victims. In a Breast Cancer and Medicine 89series of commentaries from women with breast cancer, a recurring to- pos is that of \"taking control.\" Listen to Kathleen M. Hoffman, a breast-cancer patient, explaining her position on the question of control: \"Iagreed to a lumpectomy, but I refused to sign consent to 'perform what-ever procedures' the surgeon deemed necessary during the surgery. Ulti-mately it meant two surgeries, not one, but I needed to feel in control.\" 64 In Audre Lorde's journals, the decision to follow certain treatment ismade after long and due consideration of all the possible alternatives.And she, like Hoffman, had wanted \"a two-stage operation anyway, sep-arating the biopsy from the mastectomy. I wanted time to re-examinemy decision.\" 65 Part of Le\u00efla's dilemma with agency is, without doubt, cultural. It is not considered appropriate in the Middle East to inform ill patients oftheir medical plight. Instead, a consistently optimistic attitude is takenwith the patient, assuring him or her that the illness is but a passingthing, even when it is as serious a condition as a terminal cancer. Fam-ily members and friends, however, are normally advised of a patient'spredicament and counseled to keep the secret from the diseased indi-vidual. This is a situation that I myself have encountered with terminallyill friends in the Middle East, like the famous lm director Sh\u00e2d\u00ee cAbd al-Sal\u00e2m. As he suffered and screamed in agony from bone cancer, ev-eryone assured him he would be ne. Part of Le\u00efla's problems arisesfrom these cultural practices. As Le\u00efla is outside this diagnostic universe, she has recourse to an in- teresting metaphor, that of acting. After Yacoubi's announcement aboutcalcication, the narrator states that she is no longer a normal individ-ual; rather, her name has been registered in another world. She delvesinto \"the scenario\": I became the star of the most wicked and worst lm in my life. . . . True, since my childhood, I used to dream of acting. . . . I would stand in front of a mir-ror for hours and hours imitating the actress whom I admired. . . . But I didnot expect that I would undertake the most dangerous role . . . and that Iwould live the worst days. . . . Would that I had not gotten up on that stagefull of thorns. . . . Would that I had died before reading the chapters of thissad and painful show. 66 The entire idea that Le\u00efla is but an actor on a stage is, of course, related to her passivity and to her absence of agency. This is rendered all themore pathetic in that a childhood fantasy of acting as agency becomesan adult experience of acting as loss of control.90 Chapter 4The opening of the journey stands as an interesting moment in this question of agency. As the narrator is addressing the importance ofhealth (presumably on the plane from Mecca), she notes that she did notconcern herself with her health until she had almost lost it, \"and untilthe conflict began, a conflict between me and an illness that was almostdangerous and deadly were it not for the mercy of my Lord.\" 67 Beginning a journey with a conflict is far from unusual: one has but to think of the popular novel by Nawal El Saadawi, Mudhakkir\u00e2t Ta- b\u00eeba (Memoirs of a Woman Doctor), which begins with the notion of conflict between the rst-person female narrator and her femininity.68 The difference here is that in Le\u00efla's struggle, it is the Deity, through hismercy, who brings about a resolution. The religious intervention will beaddressed below. 69Here, it is the agency of the Deity that is important. Religious agency means that the narrator need not take any action vis-\u00e0-vis the dilemma between her and her own corporality. The Deity willbattle the cancer alongside the male representatives of the medical es-tablishment. And, it is no surprise that the Deity should be the winner. 70 Female patient, male physicians; a rst-person narration in Arabic in which the female patient is the subject of the narrative, controlling andmanipulating it; appended medical texts in the French language, inwhich this female patient becomes the object of the discourse\u2014an in-herent multilingual quality permeates Le\u00efla Lahlou's book, in which var-ious languages, ranging from the corporal to the geographical, sit sideby side. And this is not to speak of the Arabic and French languages that co- exist for this North African writer. Beginning with the rst pages of Do Not Forget God, there is an essential bilingualism that exists for the nar- rator and for the general medical universe that she will soon be inhabit-ing. She appears to be equally comfortable in both Arabic and French.Those initial moments of discovery of the abnormal body part also re-call to Le\u00efla's mind the French-language magazine Constellation and what she read in one of its articles about cancer in general and breastcancer in particular. 71This reference to the magazine does not end there, however. Le\u00efla notes that she kept this magazine and would come backto it from time to time \"as if I wanted to read about the new discoveriesand what medicine had accomplished in terms of great advance or faststeps in this area . . . or as though I wanted to memorize the names ofthe medicines and the medical instruments specialized in cancer.\" 72 Here the narrator is attempting, rst and foremost, to demonstrate the importance of cancer as a presence in her life. But what also comesBreast Cancer and Medicine 91through is the association of this dreaded illness with the West and with the French language, the language of Morocco's principal colonizers.Although politics and history play no overt role in this breast-cancernarrative, one cannot ignore the importance of medicine and its associ-ation as a western transplant. Once this geographical component be-comes clear, the absence of the medical le in Mecca takes on even moreimportance. Science becomes associated with the West and spiritual sal-vation with the East. This is not to imply that one should not have re-course to medicine. Far from it. 73Medical geography and spiritual ge- ography can coexist, but theirs is not a comfortable alliance.74The geography of tourism, with its constant praise of Morocco, was embed-ded within the geography of medicine. Le\u00efla's intense cancer journey appears to be quite uplifting, as it chron- icles a religious cure from a dreaded medical condition. The only discor-dant element in this story is the fate of Le\u00efla Lahlou herself. She died ofan intestinal cancer not too many years after her miraculous cure. 7592 Chapter 4 "}
