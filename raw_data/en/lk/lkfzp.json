COMIRNATY contains the active ingredient tozinameran. COMIRNATY is an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine. COMIRNATY is a vaccine given to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older. COMIRNATY works by triggering your immune system to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, to protect against COVID-19 disease. 2. What should I know before I am given COMIRNATY? Warnings COMIRNATY should not be given: - if you are allergic to tozinameran or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Check with your doctor if you have: - had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine or after being given COMIRNATY in the past. - fainted following any needle injection. - a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. - a weakened immune system, such as due to HIV infection or are on a medicine that affects your immune system. - a bleeding disorder, bruise easily or are on a blood thinning medicine. During treatment, you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under [Section 6. Are there any side effects?](#s6) Very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have been reported after vaccination with COMIRNATY. The cases have mostly occurred within two weeks following vaccination, more often after the second vaccination, and more often, but not always, in younger men. There have been cases in women. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. Sometimes the symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis may not be specific and could include tiredness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, swelling, and cough. You may develop a temporary, stress-related response associated with the process of receiving your injection. This may include dizziness, fainting, sweating, increased heart rate and/or anxiety. If you start to feel faint at any time during the process of receiving your injection, let your doctor, nurse or pharmacist know and take actions to avoid falling and injuring yourself, such as sitting or lying down. As with any vaccine, COMIRNATY may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. Pregnancy and breastfeeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. Children and adolescents COMIRNATY should not be given to children under 12 years. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have recently received any other vaccine. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking and if these affect, or are affected by, COMIRNATY. 4. How will I be given COMIRNATY? - COMIRNATY will be given as an injection into the muscle of your upper arm by a doctor, nurse or pharmacist. - For primary vaccination, you will be given two doses. One dose followed by a second dose at least 21 days later. If you miss the second dose, ask your doctor for advice. - If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Comirnaty at least 28 days after the second dose as part of the primary vaccination. - A doctor, nurse or pharmacist will observe you for at least 15 minutes after being given COMIRNATY. - A booster dose of COMIRNATY may be given at least 6 months after the primary vaccination for people 12 years of age and older. 5. What should I know while being given COMIRNATY? Things you should know - If you receive one dose of COMIRNATY, you should receive a second dose of the same vaccine at least 21 days later to complete the primary vaccination schedule. - If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Comirnaty at least 28 days after the second dose as part of the primary vaccination. - A booster dose of COMIRNATY may be given at least 6 months after the primary vaccination for people 12 years of age and older. - You may not be protected against COVID-19 disease until at least seven days after your second dose. - You may not be protected if you only receive one dose, so a second dose is important. Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how COMIRNATY affects you. Some of the side effects of COMIRNATY may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Storage of the vaccine COMIRNATY is stored at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C. It must be kept in the original package in order to protect from light. A doctor, nurse or pharmacist will prepare the injection for you before you are given it.
