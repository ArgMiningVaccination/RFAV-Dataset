The selec- tion pressures that result in viral downregulation of HLA-C in some individuals, but preserva- tion of surface HLA-C in others are not clear. To better understand viral immune evasion targeting HLA-C, we have characterized HLA-C downregulation by a range of primary HIV-1 viruses. 128 replication competent viral isolates from 19 individuals with effective anti- retroviral therapy, show that a substantial minority of individuals harbor latent reservoirvirus which strongly downregulates HLA-C. Untreated infections display no change in HLA-C downregulation during the first 6 months of infection, but variation between viral quasispecies can be detected in chronic infection. Vpu molecules cloned from plasma of 195 treatment na wve individuals in chronic infection demonstrate that downregulation of HLA-C adapts to host HLA genotype.

Studies of primary and mutant molecules identify 5 residues in the transmembrane region of Vpu, and 4 residues in the transmembrane domain of HLA-C,which determine interactions between Vpu and HLA. The observed adaptation of Vpu-medi-ated downregulation to host genotype indicates that HLA-C alleles differ in likelihood of mediating a CTL response that is subverted by viral downregulation, and that preservation of HLA-C expression is favored in the absence of these responses. Finding that latent reser-voir viruses can downregulate HLA-C could have implications for HIV-1 cure therapy approaches in some individuals. Author summary HLA-C is a member of the major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) family of molecules which are integral to many responses of innate and adaptive immunity. HIV-1 can downregulate the expression level of HLA-C on infected cells, using the viral protein Vpu, but the magnitude of HLA-C downregulation varies widely between primary HIVviruses. This provides an opportunity to identify opposing pressures on HLA-C expres- sion in infected human individuals. We find that viral downregulation of HLA-C associ- ates with both host and virus genotype, defining allelic differences in HLA-C and Vputhat will help to identify the specific immune responses which result in viral downregula- tion or preservation of HLA-C. These responses could represent candidates for immune therapy, given their demonstrated effects in vivo. We also find that HIV-1 viruses from the latent reservoir of some individuals can downregulate HLA-C, indicating that in cer- tain individuals HIV-1 cure will require the removal of virus that is able to downregulate HLA-C. The unique role of HLA-C, exerting selection pressures that result in variable modulation of its expression, may make it possible for immunotherapies to achieve enhanced efficacy if both of the opposing pressures on HLA-C expression could be estab- lished in the same individual. Introduction Human Leukocyte Antigen class-I (HLA-I) molecules present peptides from intracellular pro- teins at the cell surface. Classical HLA-I molecules are highly polymorphic and expressed fromthree loci, HLA-A,\u2014B and\u2014C, which differ in some respects. Polymorphism is most pro- nounced for HLA-B, and HLA-A/B are expressed at around 10-fold higher levels than HLA-C at the cell surface [ 1,2]. In the event of HIV-1 infection, HLA-A/B/C proteins can all present viral peptides which are recognized by CD8+ T cells, and result in the triggering of effector responses including target cell killing. Several lines of evidence provide unambiguous support for a critical role of CD8+ T cell responses in partial control of HIV-1 infection: the emergenceof cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) coincides with reduction in viral load after acute infection[3-5], HLA-I alleles associate with outcomes of HIV-1 infection or viral sequence adaptation [6-9], and CTL can eliminate infected cells in vitro [ 10]. Many pathogens evade CTLs by dis- rupting HLA expression, but this can incur recognition by innate immune cells. Natural Killer(NK) cells are regulated by inhibitory receptors for self HLA-I molecules, such as inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Cells with decreased HLA expression fail to ligate these inhibitory receptors, resulting in NK activation and cytotoxicity [ 11].

Faced with these challenges, HIV-1 demonstrates sophisticated manipulation of HLA-I molecules, in which both the locus specificity and magnitude of downregulation appears to be important. It has long been known that HLA-A/B, but not HLA-C molecules, are downregu- lated by the Nef protein of HIV-1 [ 15-17]. Downregulation of HLA-A/B is well-established to subvert CTL mediated host immunity in vitro and in vivo [ 18,19]. The clinical importance of Nef is confirmed by rare forms of HIV-1 that lack part of Nef, which do not cause AIDS when infecting humans [ 20,21]. Although downregulated by around 5-fold on infected primary cells, HLA-A/B are not removed entirely from the surface of infected cells [ 2]. This may main- tain some inhibition of NK cells, although other receptor-ligand interactions during infection can also clearly influence NK cell responses [ 22-25]. We recently found that HLA-C can be downregulated by the Vpu protein of HIV-1, and this observation has already been replicated by 3 independent groups [ 26-29]. Vpu is neces- sary and sufficient HLA-A/B. Downregu- lation of HLA-C by Vpu occurs in primary cells infected with primary HIV-1 clones. Transmitted/founder viruses, viruses from chronic infection, and representatives of all sub- types of HIV-1 are capable of downregulating HLA-C [ 26]. This supports a biologically rele- vant role for downregulation of HLA-C by HIV-1, and the finding is consistent with evidenceaccumulated over the past decade for a role of HLA-C expression level in HIV-1 disease. Early genome-wide association studies identified a strong effect of a variant marking HLA-C in the outcome of HIV-1 infection [ 8,9]. Unlike HLA-A/B for which individual alleles associate with HIV-1 viral load, associations at the HLA-C locus implicated large groups of alleles. It was found that host HLA-C alleles vary in expression level under normal conditions, and that HLA-C expression level as a continuous variable correlated inversely with HIV-1 viral load [30,31]. Higher HLA-C expression may be disadvantageous for the virus due to more potent CTL responses, as both HIV-specific CTL and viral escape mutation associate more strongly with HLA-C alleles that are expressed at higher levels [ 31,32]. A key difference between HLA-C downregulation by Vpu and the modulation of HLA-A/B by Nef, is that the former varies much more frequently between HIV-1 viruses. Indeed, down- regulation of HLA-C by HIV-1 had escaped detection for so long because the widely-studied lab-adapted strain NL4-3 does not downregulate HLA-C. In the initial report of HLA-C down- regulation by Vpu, 15 infectious molecular clones showed a continuous distribution in ability to downregulate HLA-C, in contrast to almost identical levels of HLA-A downregulation [ 26]. A comprehensive screen of 360 primary Nef variants found some variability in downregulation of HLA-A, but that the magnitude of this function was on average well-preserved [ 33]. This suggests that a similar level of HLA downregulation provides optimal evasion of HLA-A/B mediated immunity across individuals. Responses that target HLA-C differ much more between individuals in the selection pressure they exert on HLA expression level. Targeting of HLA-A/B and HLA-C by separate viral proteins, and their contrasting patterns of downregula- tion between individuals, emphasizes differences in the biological role of these HLA molecules in HIV-1 infection. The specific selection pressures which favor viral downregulation of HLA-C in some indi- viduals, but HLA-C preservation in others, are not known. In contrast to HLA-A/B, the physi- ological significance of HLA-C restricted CTL is less clear. HLA-C restricted CTL responsescan be detected, and viral escape mutations associating with HLA-C alleles are observed [ 34- 38]. However, these mutations are not necessarily deleterious for the virus, and unlike for HLA-A/B individual HLA-C alleles do not strongly associate with HIV-1 viral load [ 7,39]. HLA-C downregulation by HIV-1 adapts to host HLA genotype \u0001 \u0001Viral downregulation of HLA-C is also more likely than downregulation of HLA-A/B, to increase infected cell susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity. This is because inhibitory KIR2DL receptors which recognize self HLA-C alleles are present in all individuals, unlike KIR3DLwhich bind only a subset of HLA-A/B allotypes that are absent in many individuals [ 40]. In vitro experiments have provided evidence consistent with HLA-C downregulation inhibiting CTL but activating NK cells. which Env epitope, showed decreased inhibition of an NL4-3 virus mutated so that its Vpu was able to downregulate HLA-C [ 26]. KIR2DL2+ NK cells showed increased inhibition of the virus JR-CSF compared to its mutant lacking Vpu [ 27]. In both of these in vitro approaches, the small effect and analysis of single epitopes or effectors limits generalization to a physiologicalrole of HLA-C downregulation in or NK function. The variation in HLA-C downregula- tion between primary HIV-1 viruses provides an opportunity to identify the selection pres- sures acting on HLA-C expression in human individuals. To identify what leads to differential HLA-C downregulation by virus from different infec- tions, it is necessary to expand the number and type of primary viruses for which this pheno- type has been studied. To date 15 infectious molecular clones and viruses from sixtransmission pairs, have been measured for ability to downregulate HLA-C [ 26,27,29]. This study characterizes HLA-C downregulation by 128 viruses from the latent reservoir of 19 anti- retroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed individuals, 41 samples from 9 individuals with untreated infection, and cloned Vpu molecules from a further 195 chronically infected individuals span-ning four viral subtypes. Adaptation of HLA-C downregulation to host genotypic variants is identified, that indicates selection pressures involved in the viral manipulation of HLA-C. Results HIV-1 reservoir viruses can downregulate HLA-C In virally suppressed individuals adhering to effective ART, a reservoir of infected cells results in viral rebound if ART is discontinued [ 41]. This viral reservoir is the subject of intense inter- est as a barrier to the cure of HIV-1 [ 42]. We have characterized the ability to downregulate HLA-C for 128 inducible infectious HIV-1 isolates, from peripheral blood of 19 ART-sup- pressed individuals. Cultures were generated for quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOA), with limiting dilutions of donor CD4+ T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA, and induced viral isolates infected co-cultured Molt-4 T cells [ 43]. In these conditions viral isolates represent clonal outgrowths with negligible mutation in the two weeks of in vitro culture [ 44]. HLA-C downregulation by each viral isolate was quantified by comparing flow cytometry staining of HLA-C, between infected and uninfected Molt-4 cells within the same culture well ( Fig 1A ). Isolates varied widely in their ability to downregulate HLA-C, ranging from no effect to robust downregulation ( Fig 1B ). For viruses showing the strongest downregulation of HLA-C, this was of a magnitude comparable to that observed for the downregulation of HLA-B when pri-mary CD4+ T cells are infected with HIV-1 in vitro [ 2,45]. 19 individuals were studied and of these, the viral isolates of 15 individuals demonstrated no or low ability to downregulate HLA-C, whereas in 4 individuals we observed downregulation of ). HLA-C downregulation infection Given the variation in HLA-C downregulation between primary viruses from different indi- viduals and between multiple viral isolates from the reservoir of an individual ( Fig 1C )[26], we investigated if HLA-C downregulation changed longitudinally during early untreated infection. Using previously described paired primary infectious molecular clones from HLA-C downregulation by HIV-1 adapts to host HLA genotype PLOS https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September \u0001individuals, we compared HLA-C downregulation between a transmitted/founder virus and a representative virus from the same individual 6 months after infection [ 46,47]. Primary CD4 + T cells were infected in vitro and HLA-C downregulation determined by flow cytometry, comparing HLA-C staining on infected versus uninfected CD4 cells within the same culture well ( Fig 2A ). For 3 individuals studied, there was no difference in the HLA-C downregulation by the transmitted compared to 6 month virus. This included viruses with HLA-C downregu- lation which was weak Fig 2B ). To investigate infection, we studied cloned Vpu mole- cules generated from the plasma of 6 untreated individuals. Cloned Vpu genes were expressed by transfection in HeLa cells using a Rev-dependent vector, and HLA-C gulation by flow cytometry comparing staining of transfected versus untrans-fected cells within a well Fig 2C and 2D ). Vpu-mediated downregulation of HLA-C cells, correlates robustly with HLA-C downregulation by primary HIV-1 viruses ( S1 Fig ). For one donor sampled at 1, 4 and 10 years post-infection, the 5 most frequent Vpu sequence variants observed at each time-point were studied, andshowed variation in HLA-C downregulation between the all timepoints ( Fig 2E ). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that in this individual a single virus from one timepoint gives rise to all of the quasispecies present at the next, indicating that inthis individual persistent diversification in viral downregulation S2 Fig ) [48]. HLA-C was characterized for 3 further donors where multiple quasi- species were tested at a single timepoint ( Fig 2F-2H ), and 2 further donors where dominant Vpu species were tested from longitudinal timepoints spanning 2 and 4 years ( Fig 2I and 2J ). Together this analysis of 41 viruses from 9 individuals shows robust changes in HLA-C downregulation in longitudinal infection are not readily observed, but that variation between quasi-species is detected in some individuals which could result in adaptation of downregu- lation in chronic infection.

In all cases participants were ART na \u00efve and in the chronic stage of infection, and HLA genotypes were known for 186 of the individuals. For each individual a single Vpu sequence was cloned from plasma, expressed by transfection in Molt-4 cells, and HLA-C downregulation quantified of HLA-C transfection of Molt-4 cells, correlates robustly with HLA-C downregulation by primary HIV-1 viruses ( S1 Fig ). The observed distribution showed a natu- ral threshold at approximately 6-fold downregulation of HLA-C, where in 117 of the infectionsVpu downregulated HLA-C by <6-fold, and HLA-C >6-fold ( Fig 3A ). Subsequent categorical analyses used this threshold to classify Vpu molecules as strong, or weak downregulators of HLA-C. When individuals were stratified by common alleles of the classical HLA-I loci, the frequency of Vpu clones that downregulateHLA-C strongly varied significantly in association with host HLA-C allotype (p = 0.0009), but not with HLA-A (p = 0.05) or HLA-B (p = 0.28) ( Fig 3B ). At the extreme ends of this spectrum, only 1 out of 15 Vpu clones from individuals carrying HLA-C /C317 was capable of downregulat- ing HLA-C strongly, in contrast to 11 out of 14 Vpu clones from individuals carrying HLA-C/C314. This suggests immune responses which drive the virus to downregulate HLA-C, vary in their frequency between individuals with different HLA-C alleles. Inhibition of NK cells, mediated by KIR binding to HLA-C, may exert selection pressure on HLA-C expression. All HLA-C alleles resolve into two groups, C1 and C2, based upon a dimorphism at positions 77 and 80 which determines their binding to inhibitory two-domain KIR [ 40]. However, we found no difference in the frequency of Vpu clones that downregulated HLA-C strongly when individuals were grouped by presence of C1 versus C2 alleles ( Fig 3C ). This suggests that inhibition of NK cells may not be a significant factor in the selection pres- sures that influence Vpu-mediated downregulation of HLA. HLA-C alleles differ in their sur-face protein expression level on peripheral blood lymphocytes, enabling HLA-C expression level to be inferred for individuals on the basis of their HLA-C genotype [ 30,31]. For 186 Vpu molecules, the observed HLA-C downregulation showed a positive correlation with inferredHLA-C expression level in the host prior to infection (r = 0.27, p = 0.0005) ( Fig 3D ). This indi- cates that the higher the HLA-C expression level of an individual that is infected with HIV-1, the greater the downregulation of HLA-C demonstrated by the viral Vpu that adapts to thisindividual. To maximize statistical power our primary analyses combined individuals from the BC HOMER and UARTO cohorts. To rule out confounding by the substantial differences between these cohorts, for example in ethnicity and sex ratio, analyses were repeated stratified by cohort. Fig 3B showed the frequency of Vpu clones that downregulate HLA-C strongly, varied in association with HLA-C allotype. This association was not significant in BC HOMER and UARTO participants separately (p = 0.053 and 0.23 respectively) but plots of alleles with n /C215 in both cohorts show these do typically have similar effects. For example HLA-C /C314 has the highest frequency of Vpu clones that downregulate HLA-C strongly in both cohorts; HLA-C/C304, 06 and 08 are intermediate; and HLA-C/C303 and 07 are among the lowest in both cohorts S3A and S3B Fig ).Fig 3D showed that the magnitude of HLA-C downregulation observed for a Vpu clone, correlated with HLA-C expression level prior to infection inferred from host HLA-C genotype. This correlation was significant in both BC HOMER (p = 0.008) and UARTO participants (p = 0.002) with highly similar correlation coefficients ( S3C and S3D Fig). The total of 195 Vpu clones studied here also included viruses from the 4 major HIV-1 HLA-C downregulation by HIV-1 adapts to host HLA genotype PLOS https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 2018 7 / \u0001group M subtypes. Both viral ability to downregulate HLA-C and variation in this phenotype between primary viruses was observed within each subtype, consistent with prior study of 14 primary infectious molecular clones [ 26]. In this larger dataset we detect significant difference in the frequency of HLA-C downregulation between subtypes. Vpu clones from subtype A and Fig 3. Downregulation of HLA-C shows adaptation to host HLA genotype. (A) For 186 individuals a single Vpu clone from chronic untreated infection was measured for ability to downregulate HLA-C by transfection of Molt-4 cells. The distribution of HLA-C downregulation is shown, with a threshold of 6- fold used to define 69 strongly downregulating (black) and 117 weakly downregulating Vpu clones (grey). (B) The proportion of Vpu clones that downregulate HLA -C strongly is shown when individuals are stratified by the presence of common alleles of each of the HLA-A,\u2014B, and\u2014C loci. The number of individuals in ea ch group is shown above each plot and statistical analysis is by chi square tests. (C) HLA-C alleles can be grouped as C1 or C2 according to their differenti al binding of KIR2D receptors, and the proportion of Vpu clones that strongly downregulate HLA-C is shown for individuals when grouped by these genotypes. (D) HLA- C alleles differ in expression level and can be inferred for an individual from the HLA-C genotype. HLA-C expression level and the observed HLA-C downre gulation by Vpu are plotted for 186 individuals. (E) For the subset of individuals where viral adaptation to host HLA-C alleles could be quantified (n = 72), the c orrelation between host HLA-C allele-specific viral sequence adaptation and observed downregulation of HLA-C by Vpu was determined. For 10 HLA-C alleles this correlation is plotted against the proportion of individuals with that HLA-C allele in which Vpu downregulates HLA-C. by genotype https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September 4, 2018 \u0001 \u0001B viruses more frequently downregulated HLA-C strongly than those from subtypes C or D (S4 Fig ). Viral adaptation to HLA-C correlates with observed HLA-C downregulation Given that the proportion of Vpu clones that downregulate HLA-C differs significantly based on host HLA-C genotype ( Fig 3B ), we hypothesized that that among individuals with an HLA-C allele that strongly selects for viral downregulation of HLA-C, there would be a direct correlation between the extent of viral adaptation to that HLA-C allele, and the observed HLA-C downregulation by Vpu. In contrast, such a relationship would not be observed inindividuals carrying an HLA-C allele which does not select for viral downregulation ofHLA-C. To assess this, we used a published HLA adaptation metric to quantify the extent of HIV-1 adaptation to host HLA-C alleles [ 49]. The strength of correlation between viral adapta- tion to host HLA-C and observed downregulation ( S5 Fig ). Consistent with our hypothesis, a significant positive correlation was observed between a given Vpu's ability to downregulate HLA-C in individuals expressing HLA-C /C308 (an allele that strongly selects for viral downregulation of HLA-C), but not in indi- viduals expressing HLA-C/C307 (an allele which does not select for viral downregulation of HLA-C). Across HLA-C alleles, the strength of these correlations associates directly with the variation between HLA-C alleles in selection pressure for HLA-C downregulation, shown bythe frequency of Vpu clones that downregulate in individuals with that HLA-C allele (r = 0.68, p = 0.03) ( Fig 3E ). Thus, the variation in HLA-C downregulation observed by viruses with different degrees of adaptation to an HLA-C allele, supports the finding that Vpu-medi-ated downregulation genotype. region determines downregulation of HLA-C For a paired Vpu molecules that differentially downregulate HLA-C, sequence variants which differences have been identi- fied. For example, by Vpu from WITO but not NL4-3 is primarily explained by the sequence differences at positions 4 and 5 of Vpu [ 26]. However, these posi- tions are not sufficient to predict HLA-C downregulation in natural Vpu sequences, indicating other residues also play a role. Using the nearly 200 Vpu clones from different individuals that were characterized for ability to downregulate HLA-C, we identified Vpu sequence variantswhich account for variation in HLA-C downregulation in this population of primary viruses. Vpu is an approximately 80 amino acid protein with a large cytoplasmic region, a transmem- brane domain, and a Representative sequences primary Vpu mole- cules observed to downregulate, or not to downregulate HLA-C, are shown aligned to from NL4-3 ( 4A ). At each Vpu residue, amino acid polymorphism was tested for association with the observed downregulation of HLA-C for 191 Vpu clones. A multiple linear regression model identified 5 positions at which the residues indicated associated indepen- dently with HLA-C downregulation ( Fig 4B ). The strongest effects are presence of glutamic acid at position 5, or a glycine or threonine at position 16, which when present result in Vpu molecules which downregulate HLA-C more strongly. An alanine at position 15 associatedwith weaker downregulation of HLA-C. The frequency of different amino acids observed at each of these 5 positions is detailed in S6 Fig . These five positions remained independently sig- nificant when viral subtype is included as a covariate ( S1 Table ), and in analyses stratified by by HIV-1 adapts to host HLA genotype PLOS https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September 4, 2018 9 / \u0001 \u0001 Fig 4. Variation in the Vpu transmembrane region is responsible for the range of HLA-C downregulation exhibited by primary HIV-1 viruses. (A) Sequence of representative Vpu clones that weakly (clone 1), or strongly downregulate HLA-C (clones 2-4), are shown aligned to Vpu from NL4-3. (B) A multiple li near regression model using 191 of the primary Vpu clones identifies 5 positions of Vpu at which the residues indicated associate independently with HLA-C downregulation. (C) These positions were each confirmed to influence HLA-C downregulation using single residue mutants of Vpu. HLA-C staining is sh own for cells transfected with primary Vpu clones (red), single residue mutants (black), and untransfected cells (grey).

Each of these 5 Vpu positions was confirmed to impact HLA-C downregulation, in the direction indicated, in the context of primary Vpu sequences compared to single amino acid mutants ( Fig ). For example, a with proline at position 3 downregulated HLA-C strongly, but a mutant constructed with serine, the next most common residue at posi- tion 3, showed reduced ability to downregulate HLA-C. Although this population analysis identified 5 positions of importance, individual primary Vpu sequences carried no more than 3 of the residues detected to associate with HLA-C downregulation, in various combinations. When we generated a mutant Vpu with the variants that associate with greater HLA-C down- regulation at all 5 of the positions implicated, this molecule demonstrated negligible downre- gulation of HLA-C, suggesting that some of these residues may not be compatible with one another ( Fig 4D ). The multiple linear regression model defined in Fig 4B , when used to predict HLA-C downregulation for each Vpu clone, explains 40% of the variation in for these Vpu molecules ( Fig 4E ). A plot of the residuals between observed and predicted HLA-C downregulation confirms linear regression analysis is appropriate ( S7 Fig). When highlighted on the NMR structure of Vpu, the 5 positions implicated in HLA-C downregulation cluster in the transmembrane and N-terminal regions of the molecule ( Fig 4F)[50]. These 5 positions were also observed to vary in the longitudinal Vpu clones which showed variation in HLA-C downregulation ( S2 Fig ). Together these results suggest the trans- membrane domain of Vpu is responsible for interaction with HLA-C, and that primary virusesexploit multiple alternative sequences which are able to downregulate HLA-C. The transmembrane domain of HLA mediates interaction with Vpu Analyses of HLA chimeras also indicate the transmembrane domain of HLA-C molecules is responsible for interaction with Vpu. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged con- structs of Vpu from a primary virus, 2_87, which was previously shown to downregulateHLA-C, or from NL4-3 which does not downregulate HLA-C [ 26]. Cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged constructs of either HLA-A or HLA-C. Flag immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting with anti-Flag or anti-HA mAb, detected precipitated Vpu and associated HLA respectively. Vpu from 2_87 co-precipitated HLA-C, in contrast to lanes using Vpu from NL4-3 or the HLA-A molecule, showing an interaction between primary Vpu and HLA-C consistent with our cellular observations ( Fig 5A ). Experiments were repeated using chimeras between and HLA-C, where the primary Vpu co-precipitated specifically chimeras 2 and 3 with transmembrane domains from HLA-C, but not chimeras 1 and 4 lacking HLA-C transmembrane sequence ( Fig 5B and 5C ). This the transmembrane domain of HLA-C mediates interaction with Vpu. Alignment of HLA transmembrane domain sequences identified a 4 residue sequence, LAVL, which is conserved in HLA-C molecules which we have found downregulated by Vpu, but not in HLA-A/B which are unaffected by Vpu ( Fig 5D ) [26]. It was confirmed the primary Vpu could co-precipitate HLA chimera 5, comprised entirely of HLA-A with just these 4 transmembrane residues substituted from HLA-C, but not the reciprocal chimera 6 ( Fig 5B-5D ). Thus, studies of mutant HLA-I molecules implicate 4 residues in the transmembrane domain of HLA-C, that contribute to the interaction with Vpu.clones. (F) An NMR structure of Vpu, with N-terminal and transmembrane regions highlighted, shows the location of the 5 Vpu positions at which primary sequence variations associate with HLA-C downregulation (green). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257.g004 HLA-C genotype https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September 4, 2018 11 / 25\u0010\u0012\u0016\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001Discussion Until recently it was believed that HIV-1 Nef subverted both CTL and NK cell immunity by downregulating the dominant CTL ligands HLA-A and -B, but preserving expression of HLA-C HLA-E which serve as ligands for KIR2DL and NKG2A receptors that inhibit NK cells [ 16,18]. This understanding was modified by our finding that primary strains of HIV-1 can also downregulate HLA-C using the viral Vpu protein [ 26]. A major difference between the viral modulation of HLA-A/B compared to HLA-C, is that most HIV-1 strains downregu- late HLA-A/B relatively well whereas HLA-C downregulation varies widely. The consequencesresulting from HIV-1 downregulating HLA-C on infected cells in some individuals but not Fig 5. Transmembrane domain residues of HLA mediate the interaction with Vpu.

Variation between HIV-1 viruses provides an opportunity to identify selec- tion pressures in human individuals which may be relevant. In this study we have character- ized HLA-C downregulation for a wide range of primary viruses. We demonstrate that HIV-1viruses from the latent reservoir of certain individuals downregulate HLA-C, that different quasispecies members can vary widely in their ability to downregulate HLA-C during chronic infection, and that viral downregulation of HLA-C shows a striking adaptation to the HLA genotype of the host. In a screen of 128 replication competent viral isolates from limiting dilution outgrowth assays of 19 individuals treated with effective ART, 4 individuals harbored multiple viral iso- lates that downregulated HLA-C. These viruses are representative of the latent viral reservoir with the ability to seed new infection when ART is ceased [ 41]. Consequently, it will be neces- sary to clear reservoir viruses that are able to downregulate HLA-C to cure HIV-1 in certain individuals. This complicates some shock and kill strategies, which have proposed to use HLA-C restricted effectors as this HLA was previously thought to be preserved on infected cells [ 51,52]. It may also provide new opportunities for individualized therapy although such approaches, if ultimately developed, would be limited in scalability at least initially. Characteri- zation of the CTL responses in the 4 individuals in which HIV-1 downregulates HLA-C may identify CTL epitopes that could represent candidates for expansion and treatment as immune therapies, due to their in vivo selection pressure suggested by this study. The unique role of HLA-C, exerting selection pressures that result in variable modulation of its expression, maymake it possible for immunotherapies to achieve enhanced efficacy if both of the opposing pressures on HLA-C expression level could be established in the same individual. In vitro infections of primary CD4+ T cells with transmitted/founder viruses, and virus from the same individual after 6 months of untreated infection, showed no change in HLA-C downregulation for 3 individuals. Analyses of 35 Vpu clones from 6 untreated individuals in chronic infection detected little longitudinal change in HLA-C downregulation, but confirmed variation between viral quasi-species present at a timepoint in several individuals, which could result in adaptation to host HLA genotype. These results indicate HLA-C downregulation by HIV-1 is not frequently affected by early innate immune pressures during acute infection [53,54]. A screen of Vpu molecules from nearly 200 chronically infected ART na \u00efve individu- als, found that in approximately one third of the infections viruses downregulated HLA-C strongly. Host HLA-C genotype was the strongest corollary downregulation identi- fied. Viruses from individuals as C /C307, generally downregulated HLA-C only weakly, whereas viruses from individuals with other alleles such as C/C314 were far more likely to downregulate HLA-C strongly. This differential downregulation of HLA-C is unlikely to be attributable to viral adaptation to the susceptibility of different HLA-C alleles to downregulation by Vpu. This is because pri- mary HIV-1 viruses which downregulate HLA-C have been used to infect CD4+ cells from dif- ferent individuals in vitro, and showed downregulation which was broadly similar across HLA-C types [ 26,27]. Further, the 4 HLA transmembrane residues found to be required for interaction with Vpu are conserved in all HLA-C alleles. We therefore interpret the association between downregulation and host HLA-C genotype to represent viral adaptation to differences in immune responses which are mediated by HLA-C alleles. It is well established that downre-gulation of HLA-A/B by Nef subverts CTL responses, so it seems likely that certain CTL responses are also the selection pressure resulting in HLA-C downregulation [ 18,19]. Consistent with this idea there is both in vitro and in vivo evidence that lower HLA-C expression levels candecrease the efficacy or frequency of HLA-C restricted CTL responses [ 26,31,32]. The variation in adaptation to HLA-C alleles that we observed, suggests that HLA-C alleles differ in their like- lihood of restricting CTL responses which the virus responds to by downregulating HLA-C. HLA-C downregulation by https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September 4, 2018 13 / \u0001 \u0001It is not clear what differentiates HLA-C alleles that are more likely to select for HLA-C downregulation, although they tend to be expressed at higher levels. We observed a direct cor- relation between the level of HLA-C expression by an individual prior to infection, and thedegree of downregulation observed following chronic infection. Although certain HLA-C restricted CTL responses may be evaded by viral downregulation of HLA-C, in two thirds of infections Vpu downregulated HLA-C only weakly. Thus, there appears to be some advantage to the virus in preserving HLA-C expression in most individuals. Grouping HLA-C allelesbased on differential KIR binding did not result in differences in the frequency of Vpu mole- cules that downregulate HLA-C strongly. This might be clarified by KIR typing but suggests that inhibition of NK cells may not be a significant factor in the selection pressures that influ- ence viral downregulation of HLA-C, because the KIR bound by these groups of HLA-C alleles differ functionally, and these HLA-C allele groups do associate with other outcomes influenced by NK cells [ 40,55-57]. Other reasons why the virus might preserve HLA-C include a possible cost to replication efficiency of using Vpu to downregulate HLA-C. Vpu has multiple func- antagonizing CD4 and tetherin to promote virion release from infected cells, and these may be impaired when Vpu is used to downregulate HLA-C [ 58,59]. Interactions between different conformations of HLA-C and Env have also been reported to influence virion infectivity, and could represent another mechanism impacted by HLA-C downregula- tion [ 60]. That magnitude of downregulation is part of the viral adaptation to host HLA-C alleles, is supported by the variation observed in HLA-C downregulation by viruses with differ-ent degrees of adaptation to host HLA-C alleles. Molecular characterization using primary virus derived Vpu sequences and chimeric HLA constructs identified 5 positions in the Vpu N-terminal stalk and transmembrane domain, and4 residues in the HLA transmembrane domain, which are important in the interaction required for downregulation of HLA-C. The 5 positions of Vpu are all found on a similar face of the transmembrane/extracellular region of the molecule, consistent with residues at these sites promoting or disrupting a binding site. The 4 residues of the HLA transmembrane identi- fied to be important are not present in any common HLA-A or\u2014B alleles, but are conserved in all HLA-C alleles. HLA-E transmembrane sequence differs from all classical HLA alleles in these 4 positions, so it will be interesting to determine if Vpu from different primary viruses can variably modulate HLA-E in addition to HLA-C the possibility of predicting HLA-C downregulaton by primary virus from the Vpu sequence alone. This could identify preliminary characteristics of infections in which HIV-1 does or does not downregulate HLA-C for experi- mental validation, although additional effects of HIV-1 on HLA may occur in vivo. For exam- ple Vpu can suppress NF-kb activity to inhibit transcription from all HLA loci [ 62]. Variation between primary viruses in downregulation of HLA-C represents an opportunity to identify specific cellular immune responses that exert selection pressure on HLA expression in vivo. Comparison of cellular responses between individuals in which HIV-1 downregulates versus preserves HLA-C, has potential to identify specific CTL epitopes useful for HIV-1 therapy, and to improve understanding of the differential role of HLA-C molecules between infected individuals.

All donors pro-vided written informed consent and samples were de-identified for the present study. Detection and prediction of HLA-C expression The mouse IgG2b monoclonal antibody DT9 was used in flow cytometry analyses to detectHLA-C [ 63]. This mAb has been shown to bind all alleles of HLA-C, but no common HLA-A/ B alleles [ 30]. DT9 also recognizes HLA-E but this antigen is expressed at much lower levels than HLA-C on lymphocytes [ 2]. That the decreased DT9 binding of primary CD4+ cells upon HIV-1 infection reflects downregulation of HLA-C, has been confirmed by similar decreases in the staining of 3 different mAbs which recognize independent HLA-C epitopes but do not detect HLA-E [ 26]. Healthy individuals vary in their HLA-C expression level on PBL, and this has been shown to be a function of HLA-C genotype, with an average expression level for each allele defined ( S4 Table ). A sum of the average expression level of each HLA-C allele has previously been shown to predict HLA-C expression level for unrelated individuals of both European and African American ethnicity [ 31]. HLA-C downregulation by inducible infectious HIV-1 reservoir isolates QVOA were performed using a previously described protocol, with slight modifications [ 43]. Briefly, CD4+ T-cells from ART suppressed individuals were cultured at limiting dilutions,with 12 replicates per dilution, and stimulated with IL-2, PHA and irradiated allogeneic feeder cells from HIV-uninfected donors in the presence of Molt-4 cells [ 64]. Dilutions were chosen to minimize the probability that any given dilution will have all positive or all negative wells.After 14 days of culture, wells were screened for outgrowth of a viral isolate by ELISA for p24 (NCI Frederick). The following day, for the dilution with fewest CD4+ T cells that yielded wells with detectable virus, positive cultures were assayed by flow cytometry. After staining with mAb isotype control, detected by PE anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Aldrich), cells were blocked with murine IgG and further stained with CD3-BV421 (Sony Biotechnology) and Far Red Viability Dye (Thermofisher Scientific). Cells were then fixed and permeabilizedusing BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) followed KC57-FITC (Beckman Coulter). Staining was acquired using a SP6800 Spectral Cell Analyzer (Sony Biotechnology) and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star). Molt-4 cells lack CD3 expres-sion, which enabled discrimination from primary T cells, before the median fluorescenceintensity (MFI) of DT9 staining was compared between the (infected) and Gag- (uninfected) Molt-4 populations. HLA-C downregulation in primary cells infected with longitudinal viral clones Paired infectious molecular clones from the transmitter/founder and 6-month timepoints of the same infected individual have been previously been described [ 46,47]. Single genome amplification from plasma RNA at these timepoints was followed by phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences to identify the transmitted virus and a biologically active 6 month consensus virus. Plasmids containing these infectious molecular clones were expressed in HEK 293T (ATCC, CRL-11268), used to infect primary CD4+ cells in vitro, and analyzed for HLA-C downregulation by flow cytometry all as previously described [ 26]. Briefly, CD4+ cells were magnetically selected, stimulated with anti-CD3/28 beads and IL-2 for 3-5 days, infected with HIV-1 and cultured for a further 6 or 7 days. Cells were then incubated with mAb DT9 or HLA-C genotype PLOS https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September 4, 2018 control, followed by PE-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). antibody- binding sites were before further fluo-rescent reactive viability dye (Invitrogen).

Vpu genes cloned from primary viruses Plasma-derived Vpu clones in a Rev-dependent CRV1 based vector have previously been described for 14 longitudinally sampled, untreated, subtype B HIV-1 infections [ 48]. For 2 individuals from that study, long term non-progressors 1 and 5, multiple Vpu clones werecharacterized here for ability to downregulate HLA-C (clones 1-15 and 26-28 respectively). For C infected individuals (CH596, CH492, CH256, CH694), for which plasma sequencing has previously been described [ 53,65,66], Vpu clones were constructed in the same vector and tested for HLA-C downregulation (clones 16-19, 20-25, 29-30 and 31-35 Vpu given in S5 Table . Chronically infected ART- na\u00efve individuals have previously been described from the BC HOMER cohort with subtype B infection [ 67,68] and the UARTO cohort with infections of subtypes A, C and D [ 69]. Overall, 25% of BC HOMER cohort participants reported they were men who have sex with men, while 39% reported a history of injection drug use, and 92% of the BC HOMER participants in this present study were male. 30% of the UARTO cohort samples included in this study were male and this cohort comprises predominantly heterosexual individuals. To characterize HLA-C downregulation a single plasma-derived Vpu sequence for 195 of these individuals, was cloned into a bicistronic pSel RRE-Vpu vector that expresses Vpu and GFP [ Of these 195 clones, Vpu sequences were of subtypes A (n = 45), B (n = 75), C (n = 19) or D (n = 56). Sequences of these Vpu clones are given in S6 Table . A panel of 14 infectious molecular clones of HIV-1, including viruses of subtypes B, C and D, have previously been characterized for ability to downregulate HLA-C when infecting primary CD4+ cells in vitro [ 26]. Vpu genes from each of these viruses were also generated in the pSel RRE-Vpu expression vector. Synthetic DNA sequences containing the desired Vpu sequence (Synthetic Genomics Inc) were inserted into the plasmid digested with AscI and SacII using Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs), and chemically competent cells transformed according to manufacturer instructions. Trans- formed cells were selected on zeocin agar plates (Invivogen), single colonies grown in TB with Zeocin (Invivogen), plasmid extracted, and sequence verified using primer 5'-ACCTTGTTTA TTGCAGCTT-3' for Sanger sequencing (Integrated DNA and L-glutamine. Molt-4 in same media supplemented with 10mM HEPES. The 35 Vpu clones obtained in CRV1 based vectors, representing multiple quasi-spe- cies and longitudinal samples from 6 individuals, were assessed for ability to downregulate HLA-C in HeLa cells as previously described [ 26]. Briefly, TransIT-HeLaMONSTER (Mirus) was used to co-transfect HeLa with the CRV1 based vector containing Rev and primary Vpu genes, and with an EGFP expressing plasmid [ (Becton https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 2018 16 \u0001The 195 Vpu clones derived in pSel RRE-Vpu vectors, from chronically infected UARTO and BC HOMER cohort individuals, were assessed for ability to downregulate HLA-C in Molt-4 cells. Lipofectamine (ThermoFisher) was used according to manufacturer instructions to co-transfect ~200,000 cells with the pSel RRE-Vpu plasmid containing GFP and primary Vpu genes, and with the Rev expression plasmid pSel-Rev- \u00efGFP previously described [ 70]. After 24hrs cells were stained with DT9 and an APC-conjugated secondary as above, and staining results were acquired using a SP6800 Spectral Cell Analyzer (Sony Biotechnology). 14 Vpu genes from HIV-1 infectious molecular clones were characterized for HLA-C downregulation in both HeLa cells transfected and Molt-4 cells transfected using Lipofectamine, as described above. All cytometry analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star). Vpu transfected cells were discriminated from untransfected by GFP fluorescence, and the MFI of DT9 staining compared between these populations to calculate fold downregu- lation of HLA-C. Analysis of viral adaptation to host HLA-C genotype Extent of viral sequence adaptation to host HLA-C genotype was determined for 72 subtype B- infected individuals from the BC HOMER cohort for whom HLA-I genotypes were available,using a published adaptation metric [ 49]. Briefly, a probabilistic model is used to compare the expected HIV-1 sequence if evolving indefinitely in a host whose immune system targeted solely viral epitopes restricted by the HLA allele in question, compared to if the virus wasevolving indefinitely in the absence of immune pressure. The resulting ratio of these two sce-narios is scaled so that it ranges from 1 to +1, where the extremes denote zero and complete adaptation to the HLA allele in question, respectively. This quantification of adaptation used specifically the viral Nef sequence because of the high number of HLA-associated sequence variants contained therein, and was restricted to HIV-1 subtype B as HLA-associated polymor- phisms are extensively mapped for this subtype [ 38]. Identification of Vpu residues influencing HLA-C downregulation Of the 195 Vpu clones from individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 that were character- ized for ability to downregulate HLA-C, 4 were excluded due to substantial sequence length polymorphism. The remaining 191 Vpu sequences were aligned and at every position of Vpu,polymorphic variants were tested for association with HLA-C downregulation as a categorical variable using Fisher's exact test. Residues that differed with p <0.05 were then tested in a mul- tiple linear regression analysis, identifying 5 positions with independently significant effectson downregulation of HLA-C. These were confirmed experimentally using single amino acid mutants of primary Vpu sequences generated by incorporating synthetic DNA sequences into the pSel RRE-Vpu vector, as described above for the construction of Vpu genes from 14 infec- tious molecular clones. HLA-C downregulation by mutant and primary Vpu clones was com- pared by transfection of Molt-4 cells, also as described above. Co-precipitation of chimeric HLA molecules with Vpu A nine-amino acid HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was added to the N-terminus of HLA-A/C30201, HLA-C/C30501, or 6 chimeras of these HLA. The HA tag was added to the mature protein, by insertion just after the leader sequence, with addition of a second glycine-serine N- terminal to the tag to reproduce the cleavage site of the HLA-I molecule as previously described [ 71]. These constructs were synthesized by IDT with 5' EcoRI and kozak sequences, and 3' NotI recognition site, and inserted by Gibson Assembly into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector digested with EcoRI and NotI (all New England Biolabs). Transformed cells were selected with HLA-C downregulation by HIV-1 adapts to host HLA genotype PLOS https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007257 September 2018 and of co-precipitated -TrCP has been previously described [ 72]. This was repeated with an adapted method substituting HLA for -TrCP. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with the HA-tagged HLA plasmid and Flag-tagged Vpu. 24 hours after immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Flag mono-clonal antibody (Sigma) and protein G agarose beads, then analyzed by western blot using mouse anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies. Statistical analyses Differences in HLA-C downregulation between reservoir isolates were compared by unpaired t tests. Variation in the frequency of Vpu clones that downregulate HLA-C strongly, between individuals of different HLA genotypes, was analyzed by chi square tests. Linear regression with Spearman analysis was used to determine correlations between observed HLA-C downre- gulation and predicted HLA-C expression level for different individuals, and across HLA-Calleles in terms of the frequency of Vpu clones that downregulate HLA-C, and the strength ofcorrelation between HLA-C allele specific adaptation and HLA-C downregulation. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze Vpu positions associating with downregulation of HLA-C. Significance was based on a two-sided p value /C200.05 throughout. All analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 6 or R version 3.4.3 statistical software packages [ 73].

(C,D) HLA-C expression level for an individual inferred from HLA-C genotype, and observed HLA-C downregulation for Vpu from that individual, are plotted separately for BC HOMERand UARTO individuals. Correlations were determined Spearman analyses. (TIF) S4 Fig. HIV-1 subtypes differ in their frequency of HLA-C downregulation. Data is shown for 195 individuals from which HLA-C downregulation by a single Vpu clone from chronicuntreated measured by transfection of Molt-4 cells. HLA-C downregulation is observed more frequently for Vpu molecules from viral subtypes A and B, compared to sub- types C and D, when analyzed by Fisher's exact test.(TIF) S5 Fig. Correlations between viral sequence adaptation to host HLA-C and the observed downregulation of HLA-C by Vpu. For 72 individuals with subtype B virus the extent of HIV-1 adaptation to each HLA-C could be quantified from the proportion of Nef sequencevariants which associate with that HLA-C allele, which are observed in individual viralsequences. The strength of correlation between this viral adaptation to host HLA-C, and the observed downregulation of HLA-C by Vpu, was then determined for each HLA-C allele. (A) Representative linear regression analyses for C /C307 where in 29 individuals sequence adaptation does not correlate with downregulation, or for C/C308 where in 9 individuals sequence adapta- tion does correlate with downregulation of HLA-C by For each HLA-C allele is shown the number of individuals analyzed (n), the observed correlation between adaptation and downregulation (R), and among the individuals included in this analysis the fraction of the individuals with that allele for which Vpu demonstrated greater Vpu sequence variation observed at positions identified as important in downregu- lation of HLA-C. 191 primary Vpu clones were analyzed in Fig 4 and identified residues at Vpu positions 3, 5, 15, 16 and 24 which associated independently with HLA-C downregula-tion. For each of these positions the frequency of all residues observed in this population of 191 primary Vpu sequences is shown, for Vpu molecules found to downregulate HLA-C (black) and those that do not (grey).(TIF) Residuals plot for predicted HLA-C downregulation. InFig 4E a multiple linear regression model was used to predict downregulation of HLA-C based on Vpu sequence at 5 positions. The residuals between observed and predicted HLA-C downregulation are shownfor all 191 Vpu clones in this analysis. (TIF) S8 Fig. Sequences of HA-tagged HLA constructs.

In this study, we determined the genomic sequences of the transmitted founder (TF) viruses from acutely infected individuals enrolled between 2005 and 2011 into IAVI protocol C in Rwanda and have compared these isolates to viruses from more recent (2016-2019) acute/early infections in three at risk populations - MSM, high risk women (HRW), and discordant couples (DC). For the Protocol C samples, we utilized near full-length single genome (NFLG) amplification to generate 288 HIV-1 amplicons from 26 acutely infected seroconverters (SC), while for the 21 recent seroconverter samples (13 from HRW, two from DC, and six from MSM), we PCR amplified overlapping half-genomes. Using PacBio SMRT with the MDPseq workflow, we performed multiplex sequencing to obtain high accuracy sequences for each amplicon. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the majority of recent transmitted viruses from DC and HRW clustered within those of the earlier Protocol C cohort. However, five of six sequences from the MSM cohort branched together and were greater than 97% identical. Recombination analyses revealed a high frequency (6/26; 23%) of unique inter-subtype recombination in Protocol C with 19% AC and 4% CD recombinant viruses, which contrasted with only 6.5% of recombinants defined by sequencing of the pol gene previously. The frequency of recombinants was significantly higher (12/21; 57%) in the more recent isolates, although, the five related viruses from the MSM cohort had identical recombination break points. While major drug resistance mutations were absent from Protocol C viruses, 4/21 of recent isolates exhibited transmitted nevirapine resistance. These results demonstrate the ongoing evolution and increased prevalence of recombinant and drug resistant transmitted viruses in Rwanda and highlight the importance of defining NFLG sequences to fully understand the nature \u0010\u0014\u0011\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001Umviligihozo et al.

Keywords: HIV-1 transmission, genetic bottleneck, HIV subtype, inter-subtype recombination, antiretroviral drug resistance mutations, near full-length genome sequencing INTRODUCTION Worldwide 37 million people are living with HIV , two-thirds of these infected individuals are found in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS, 2020 ). Even though more than half are receiving ART, a significant fraction of treated patients are not virally suppressed ( Hamers et al., 2012; Hauser et al., 2019 ), and HIV prevention remains a major problem in the fight against HIV . A global effort to design and develop an effective HIV-1 vaccine has been carried out over the last 30 years, but one of its major challenges is the enormous diversity of HIV-1. This can be attributed to several factors: the high error rate of the viral reverse transcriptase, since it lacks a proof-reading function; host immune responses that constantly apply selection pressure for less susceptible virus; and the propensity for the virus to undergo recombination ( Lukashov and Goudsmit, 1998; Mansky, et al., 2018 ). A number of investigators have studied the interplay between HIV-1 and host immunity, and have shown that viral adaptation, particularly to the cellular immune response during the course of infection, can be a major contributor to viral evolution ( Moore et al., 2002; Brumme and Walker, 2009; Crawford et al., 2009; Kawashima et al., 2009; Carlson et al., 2012, 2016; Monaco et al., 2016 ). However, recombination between genetically distinct viruses has the greatest potential to generate diversity ( McCutchan et al., 1996; Butler et al., 2007; Lau and Wong, 2013; Giovanetti et al., 2020 ). HIV-1 has been classified into four phylogenetic groups M, O, N, and P based on nucleic acid sequencing of the viral genomic RNA, with group M being by far the most widespread ( Robertson et al., 2000; Desire et al., 2018 ). The latter is subdivided into nine different subtypes (A-D, F-H, J, K, and the newly identified L), with genetic variation between subtypes ranging from 20 to 35% depending on the genomic regions and the subtypes being compared ( Korber et al., 2001; Desire et al., 2018; Y amaguchi et al., 2020 ). The process of recombination between viruses belonging to different subtypes and the ongoing spread of those recombinants is the basis for the emergence of circulating recombinant forms or CRFs. To date over 102 inter-subtype CRFs have Hemelaar et al., 2020; 2021 ). Therefore, to develop a broadly effective prophylactic vaccine, there is a clear need to gain insight into the genotypic and phenotypic features of the viruses from various geographic locations against which a potential vaccine must act. Rwanda is an East-Central African country bordered by the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a highly diverse HIV-1 population ( Rodgers et al., 2017 ), Burundi, where subtype C is most prevalent ( Delatorre and Bello, 2012 ) and Uganda where subtypes A1 and D predominate, but with a high percentage of unique recombinant forms (URFs; Lee et al., 2017; Grant et al., 2020 ). Thus, defining the nature of HIV-1 diversity over time in this geographically small, land-locked country will be relevant to ongoing HIV-1 vaccine efforts. Based on a region encompassing the pol gene, an earlier subtype analysis of over 90 incident infections enrolled under IAVI Protocol C in Rwanda identified 80% as subtype A1 and only 6.5% as recombinant viruses ( Amornkul et al., 2013 ), while a second study of smaller sample size, where gag, pol, and env genes were sequenced, reported 13.5% recombinant forms in the same cohort ( Kemal et al., 2013 ). In the current study, we have amplified near full-length single genomes (NFLG) of viruses from the plasma of a total of 26 acutely HIV infected individuals from the Rwandan heterosexual acute infection cohort Protocol C and 21 recently infected individuals from high-risk cohorts. This allowed us to define the sequence of the infecting viruses and compare over two time periods (2005-2012 and 2016-2019) the frequency of inter-subtype recombination across the full genome. In addition, because these two periods define very different availability of anti-retroviral therapies, we were able to compare the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance. These data point to an increase in genetic mixing and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in Rwanda over the last 15 years and highlight the importance of NFLG sequencing for assessing diversity in viral populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics Statement Subjects in this study were enrolled in human subjects protocols approved by the Rwanda National Ethics Committee and Emory University Institutional Review Board. All study subjects have provided written informed consent. Study Subjects In this study, we have studied HIV-1 Early infection subjects from two distinct time periods during last 15 years in Kigali Rwanda. During the first period from 2005 to 2011, plasma samples were collected under IAVI Protocol C ( Price et al., 2020 ) from 26/97 (27%) seroconvertors from a heterosexual transmission cohort in Kigali. Individuals enrolled in this cohort were from HIV-1 discordant couples who underwent couples counseling and testing and who were followed, with additional counseling and testing, every 1-3 months to reduce the incidence of transmission. HIV infection was identified by p24 ELISA antigen testing or seroconversion. The 26 seroconverters were selected from the original 97 based on the availability of sample during the very early/acute period of HIV infection. During the \u0010\u0014\u0012\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001Umviligihozo et al. Inter-Subtype HIV Recombinants in Rwanda Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734929second period from 2016 to 2019, 21 individuals who were followed in government clinics every 3-6 months in virtual cohorts comprised of high-risk women, men having sex with men and discordant couples, were enrolled immediately after seroconversion. Viral RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis Viral RNA was extracted from patient's plasma using the QIAamp RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For near-full- length genome amplification, 140 l plasma were used for vRNA isolation, and then the purified vRNA was converted to full- length cDNA with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) enzyme with a reverse HIV-1 primer that designed at the end of the R region in LTR ( Yue et al., 2015 ). For 5 ' and 3 ' half genome amplifications, the amount of plasma sample was calculated according to VL and aliquoted based on 300 copies x # of reaction per each extraction, and then diluted to 140 l with PBS if less than 140 l. Near Full-Length Single HIV-1 Genome Amplification cDNA was serially diluted to yield approximately 30% PCR positive to ensure the majority of amplicons were derived from single virus RNA molecule ( Yue et al., 2015 ). A 9 kb PCR fragment extending from the 5 ' U5 to 3 ' R region of the genome was generated by using Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB; Deymier et al., 2014 ). The amplification primers are shown in Table 1 and conditions were as described previously ( Deymier et III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Master mix I (MMI) contained 25 m reverse first round primer and template vRNA (300 copies per reaction), adjusted to a total volume of 11 l per reaction with H 2O. The MMI was incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min to melt secondary structures in the RNA then temperature was decreased to 4 \u00b0C to anneal the 5 ' or 3 ' first round reverse primer ( Table 1 ) with the RNA template. Master mix II (MMII) contains 2XReaction buffer, 5 ' or 3 ' first round forward primer (25 m; Table 1 ), SuperScript III/Platinum Taq Mix in a total volume of 39 l per each reaction. The 39 l MMII was added to 11 l MMI at 4 \u00b0C, and then the entire 50 l reaction was incubated at 55 \u00b0C for 30 min in PCR cycler to synthesize cDNA. After the cDNA was synthesized, the initial PCR step was 2 min at 94 \u00b0C; followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C 15 s, 52 \u00b0C 30 s, 68\u00b0C 6 min; and an additional one step of 68 \u00b0C for 10 min for stabilization. Second round PCR was carried out by using Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB). The sequences and positions of the 5 ' half second round primers are shown in Table 1 . PCR conditions were 98 \u00b0C 30 s as the initial step, followed by 35 cycles of 98 \u00b0C 10 s, 64 \u00b0C 30 s and 72 \u00b0C 4 min; plus, an additional step of 72 \u00b0C 10 min prior to keeping the reaction at 4 \u00b0C. The sequences and positions of the 3 ' half second round forward primer and reverse primer OFM19 are shown in Table 1 . PCR conditions were 98 \u00b0C 30 s as the initial step, followed by 35 cycles at 98 \u00b0C 10 s, 58 \u00b0C 30 s for annealing and 72 \u00b0C 4 min for extension; plus, an additional step of 72 \u00b0C 10 min prior to keeping the reaction at 4 \u00b0C. The second round PCR resulted in a 4,456 bp fragment from the 5 'half, and a 4,742 bp fragment from the 3 'half. PacBio DNA Sequencing Library Preparation Four SMRTbell libraries of NFLSGA and four SMRTbell libraries of half genome amplicons were built to gain deep sequencing data. The PacBio sequencing method was described previously ( Dilernia et al., 2015 ). In brief, we combined 75 NFLSGA amplicons for each RSII library; 10 patients' half genome PCR products were collected for each RSII library. The final library DNA concentration was more than 20 ng/ l, TABLE 1 | cDNA and PCR Primers.

SMRT sequencing was performed on a PacBio RSII at the University of Delaware DNA Sequencing & Genotyping Center. Sequence Analysis Data derived from the PacBio RSII was run using the error correction algorithm MDPseq ( Dilernia et al., 2015 ). Defining transmitted founder (TF) viral sequences and phylogenetical analysis were carried out through Geneious v9.1.8 (Biomatters Ltd). Codon-align for each HIV-1 protein was performed by Gene Cutter (LANL). Subtyping and recombinant identification were carried out by Recombinant analysis program (RIP) and jpHMM at GOBICS (LANL). GenBank Submission Near full-length (NFL) sequences were submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers for the 26 Protocol C derived viruses are JX236678.1, JX236677.1, and MT942708-MT942972. Those for the 21 recent seroconverters are MZ642260-MZ642280. RESULTS Study Volunteers This project was conducted in partnership with Projet San Francisco/Centre for Family Health Research which was established in Kigali, Rwanda in 1986. Two distinct groups of HIV-1 infected volunteers were studied: Group 1 represented acutely and very-early infected individuals from 2005 to 2011 (IAVI's Protocol C cohort), while Group 2 represented infected individuals with early HIV infection from 2016 to 2019. For Group 1, HIV discordant couples enrolled in a longitudinal prospective prevention study were provided with counseling, condoms and HIV testing of the seronegative partner during the study ( Allen et al., 1992 ). Couples voluntary counseling and testing (CVCT) in high prevalence areas has been shown to reduce transmission incidence of HIV in cohabiting couples by more than two-thirds ( Wall et al., 2019 ). When infection of the seronegative partner was identified as described in methods, they were enrolled in IAVI Protocol C, an acute infection, long-term follow-up study, and samples were obtained from both partners ( Price et al., 2020 ). Originally, 94 volunteers with incident HIV infection were enrolled into Protocol C from Kigali; in the current study, we analyzed plasma viruses from the 26 seroconverters with the shortest estimated time from the date of infection (median time from EDI = 23 days) calculated as described in methods; with 16 out of 26 plasma collected less than 30 days post-EDI ( Table 2 ). For Group 2, individuals were identified in collaboration with government clinics generally within 3 months of their last seronegative visit (median time from EDI = 91 days; Table 3 ), so that we could compare the phylogenetics and subtypes of contemporaneous viruses circulating in 2016 through 2019 with those from 2005 to 2011. We analyzed plasma viruses from 21 of these newly infected individuals who included partners of HIV-1 discordant couples (2), female sex workers (FSW; 13), and young MSM (6; Table 3 ). Severity of Genetic Bottleneck During HIV Transmission in the Protocol C Heterosexual Acute Transmission Cohort In sub-Saharan Africa, heterosexual transmission remains the predominant mode of infection by HIV-1, and accounts for approximately 75% of newly infected cases worldwide ( Monaco et al., 2017 ). We performed near full-length, single genome amplification (NFLSGA ~9,000 bp) on HIV-1 from the 26 acute plasma samples using a high-fidelity nested PCR approach described previously ( Rousseau et al., Deymier et al., 2014; Yue et al., 2015; Kinloch et al., 2019 ). A total of 288 PCR amplicons from viral RNA were sequenced with an average of 11 NFLSGAs per individual using a multiplexed, highly accurate, DNA sequencing approach based on the PacBio Sequencing platform combined with the MDPseq work flow we have described previously ( Dilernia et al., 2015 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the near full-length genome sequences showed that in 20 out of 26 Rwandan seroconverters a single virus variant established infection, with sequences for each individual clustering in a very homogeneous rake ( Figure 1 ). In contrast, in six of 26 individuals, infection was initiated by more than one virus variant ( Figure 1 ); as an example, for the acutely infected individual 175,071 three clearly distinct sequence branches were observed in the phylogenetic tree and three different populations were shown by the highlighter analysis ( Figure 2 ). Inter-Subtype Recombinants Recognized by Near Full-Length Sequencing Worldwide HIV-1 Group M is the major source of the global pandemic. In this group there are 9 subtypes, over 100 CRF, and many URF ( Hemelaar et 2020; LANL, 2021 ). Globally, the proportions of recombinants has increased over time, reaching almost 23% of all infections in the period 2010 to 2015 ( Hemelaar et al., 2020 ), and URF infections occur frequently in the regions and countries where more than one subtype circulate ( Tebit and Arts, 2011 ). Based on previous subtyping of HIV-1 infection for Protocol C volunteers which employed pol gene sequences ( Fabiani et al., 1998; Amornkul et al., 2013 ), we expected that the 26 viruses would comprise approximately 21 Subtype A1 (81%); three subtype C (11%); and two Recombinant (8%, 1 A1/C and 1 C/D). In contrast, utilizing the 9 kb near full-length genome sequences and the programs RIP and jpHMM 1 to detect recombinants, we observed a 3-fold higher percentage of recombinant viruses, with six (5A1/C and 1C/D) recombinants (23%) in addition to 18 (69%), two subtype C (8%) infections ( Figures 1, 3A and Table 2 ). Each of the recombinant genomes exhibited unique recombination breakpoints (URFs), with two viruses 175,011 and 175,017 resulting from multiple crossovers between their subtype A1 and C progenitors ( Figure 3A ). A majority of the A1/C recombinants retained a portion of the Env gene and/or 1 www.hiv.lanl.gov\u0010\u0014\u0014\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001Umviligihozo et al.

Of these the five A1/C URFs and 1 C/D URF were single virus transmission cases: while one of two subtype C and five of 18 subtype A1 involved multi-variant transmission ( Figure 1 ). Near Full-Length Sequencing of Plasma Virus in Recent Seroconverters Near full-length (9 kb) single genome amplification is very inefficient, expensive and time consuming, therefore, for recent samples, we opted to utilize the more efficient population PCR amplification of 5 ' and 3 ' half-genome regions, with amplicons that overlapped by ~250 amplicons were sequenced using next-generation PacBio single molecule real time sequencing and individual reads were analyzed using the MDPseq workflow. This allowed us to determine the consensus sequence for the early virus population and breakpoints in those determined to be recombinants. A phylogenetic analysis of the 21 recent seroconversion viruses in the context of the 26 viruses from Protocol C (Red; Figure 4 ) shows that overall, the two viruses from discordant couple transmissions (Blue) and a majority of the viruses from newly infected FSWs (Magenta) clustered within the diversity of the older viral isolates. In contrast five of the six newly infecting viruses from the cohort of young MSM (Cyan) clustered together on the phylogenetic tree with the sequences exhibiting very limited diversity (median 97.5% identity). This would be consistent with a recent transmission network within a risk group that otherwise has demonstrated low sero-incidence (Karita et al., in preparation). An analysis for recombination using the RIP and jpHMM tools 2 revealed that 12 of the 21 recent seroconversions were initiated by unique A1/C and A1/C/D recombinant forms (Figure 4 , denoted by blue circles). These represent, therefore, 57% of the samples analyzed, a significantly higher frequency than we observed in the Protocol C samples (23%; p = 0.033). Even if we define the five closely related viruses from MSM 2 https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/HIVTools.html FIGURE 1 | Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences from Protocol C acute infections.

Inter-Subtype HIV Recombinants in Rwanda Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734929as a single recombinant, the frequency (47.1%) while no longer significant ( p = 0.182) remains double that of the earlier samples. Interestingly, while each of the recent recombinants exhibited unique numbers and positions of crossovers ( Figure 3B ), a region of subtype extending from just before an 18-residue amphipathic alpha-helical region located on the outer domain of gp120, known as the alpha 2 helix, to the membrane-spanning domain of gp41, was conserved throughout. A similar, albeit shorter region that terminated in the C-terminal heptad repeat of gp41, was present in four of the five unique A1/C recombinants identified in the Protocol C samples (Figure 3A ). Identification of Antiretroviral Drug Resistance Mutations Finally, in order to determine whether, in the context of increased availability of ART, transmitted drug resistance was increasing, sequences encompassing the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase were extracted from all 47 near full-length genomes and submitted to the Stanford HIVdb analysis program, and any major drug resistance mutations (DRMs) documented. None of the Protocol C viral sequences analyzed for this study encoded any major DRMs. In contrast, four of the 21 recent isolates encoded DRMs in the reverse transcriptase. MAS-21F, MAS-1F, and PSF-80M encoded the K103N mutation that confers high level resistance to the non-nucleoside inhibitors nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). NGA-77F encoded K103S, which confers high level resistance to NVP and intermediate resistance to EFV , and E138A, which confers low level resistance to etravirine and rilpivirine. DISCUSSION Here, we report on the NFLG sequences of HIV from 47 acute and early infected Rwandans. This more than quadruples the number of near full-length sequences previously reported for this East African country ( Lamers et al., 2016 ). For the IAVI Protocol C samples, we amplified more than 10 NFLG single-genome amplicons per individual, a total of 288, from acute infections that allowed us to define a TF virus sequence in a majority of cases. This was facilitated by the use of PacBio single molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing sequences ( Dilernia et al., 2015 ), We utilized the same workflow for the more efficient, overlapping half-genome population amplicons generated from recent infections. The long-read technology allowed the population PCR to be deconvoluted to yield the individual sequences of the corresponding amplicons in order to generate a consensus sequence of the infecting virus. We have previously reported, based on sequencing of the V1-V4 region of Env that in a majority of transmission events in both a Zambian discordant couple cohort and the Rwandan Protocol C cohort infection was established by a single genetic variant from the transmitting partner ( Derdeyn et al., 2004; Haaland et al., 2009 ). In general, multiple variant infections represented only 10-15% of the transmission pairs examined FIGURE 2 | Multi-variants transmission.

Inter-Subtype HIV Recombinants in Rwanda Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734929(Haaland et al., 2009 ). In the current study, we observed a somewhat higher frequency (23%) of infections initiated by more than one partner-derived virus variant, similar to that reported in a South African women cohort ( Abrahams et al., 2009 ) and a predominantly MSM cohort ( Keele et al., 2008 ). We have reported previously that evidence of genital inflammation and ulcers can lower the barrier to transmission and increase multi-variant transmission ( Haaland et al., 2009; Carlson et al., 2014 ), and a recent study in a Kenyan MSM cohort, where sexually transmitted infections were common reported 39% (15 out of 38) of the participants were infected with multiple founder viruses ( Macharia et al., 2020 ). In the heterosexual protocol C cohort studied here we observed evidence of genital inflammation or ulcers in just six individuals in the 6 months prior to HIV-1 infection and these individuals were equally distributed between the single and multiple variant infections groups ( p = 0.67; Chi-square with Y ates correction). Inter-subtype recombination represents a significant challenge to HIV-1 vaccine design since it provides the virus with a mechanism to rapidly diversify following co-infection of an individual with two different subtype viruses ( Robertson et al., 1995 ). This gives rise to unique recombinant forms that can be prevalent in regions where more than one subtype circulates. An example of this is Uganda, Rwanda's neighbor, where subtypes A and D cocirculate, and recent studies have identified a frequency of recombinants between the two subtypes as high as 49% ( Lee et al., 2017; Grant et al., 2020 ).

Inter-Subtype HIV Recombinants in Rwanda Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734929analysis of viral subtypes from 30 women in Rwanda in 2013 reported 80% subtype A1, 3% subtype C and D, and 13% AC or AD recombinant forms based on sequencing of gag, pol, and env (Kemal et al., 2013 ). Similarly, an earlier subtype analysis of 92 IAVI Protocol C incident infections in Rwanda, which was based on a region encompassing the pol gene, defined 80% as subtype A1 and only 6.5% as recombinant viruses ( Amornkul et al., 2013 ). contrast, using NFLG sequences, we identified 23% (6/26) recombinants, a much higher frequency than even the 8% (2/26) previously defined for these same individuals through pol sequencing. This highlights the importance of NFLG sequencing to fully understand the complexity of virus populations circulating in multi-subtype countries. Indeed, sequencing of 21 more recent (2016-2019) incident infection viruses from different high-risk groups suggests that recombinant viruses are increasing in frequency, since we observed that 57% of these recent infections were A1/C, or A1/C/D recombinants. With the exception of the five viruses that appeared to represent a recent viral transmission network, the recombinants in these recent infections and those in Protocol C resulted from a series of unique recombination events. In contrast, five of the six viruses from the MSM cohort were highly related and had identical recombination patterns. Of interest, one common recombination breakpoint (4912) was shared by this MSM group (represented by PSF-3M, Figure 3B ) and its nearest neighbor MAS-7F ( Figure 4 ) raising the possibility that the former evolved from the latter following further recombination events. Although, the risk groups in Protocol C and the recent infection cohorts are different, the majority of infections in the latter represented heterosexual transmission in high-risk women and discordant couple partners (15/21), where recombinant viruses remained prevalent (47%). Nevertheless, this difference in risk groups should be considered a potential weakness of the comparison. Although, a majority of the recombinant viruses from the recent seroconverters exhibited unique recombination break points, they all retained a common region of Env that was derived from a subtype A1 parent. This region extended minimally in KAG-34F from the last few residues of the third variable (V3) loop of gp120, just before the hydrophobic alpha 2 helix, to the beginning of the membrane spanning domain of gp41. We have shown previously, that, in subtype C viruses, the alpha 2 helix is under positive selection pressure and that FIGURE 4 | Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences from recent infections in the context of Protocol C acute infections.

Inter-Subtype HIV Recombinants in Rwanda Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734929variations in this region are in part linked to early neutralizing antibody escape ( Rong et al., 2007 ). The conserved region also spans the fifth conserved domain (C5) of gp120 and the ectodomain of gp41, both critical gp120 and gp41 trimer stability ( Binley et al., 2000; Julien et al., 2013 ). Thus it is possible that this region from subtype A1 provides a fitness advantage to the recombinants. We have recently reported on the presence of DRMs in the transmitted virus of newly infected partners of Rwandan couples, where the transmitting partner was on ART but carried drug resistant virus ( Woodson et al., 2018 ). It was of interest, therefore, to compare the prevalence and nature of DRMs in the Protocol C cohort, from a time when antiretroviral drugs were not widely available, to those in more recently infected individuals, when treatment with the standard first-line combination of Tenofovir (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), and EFV following diagnosis was routine. Although none of the 26 acutely infected individuals from Protocol C encoded DRMs, a previous study of 78 Rwandans from the same cohort did identify five individuals with NNRTI mutations (three with K103N, two with L100I) and one with the protease inhibitor mutation, M46L ( Price et al., 2011 ). Our finding that four of the 21 recent infection viruses encoded K103N/S, which confers resistance to NVP and EFV , indicates that this mutation is becoming more prevalent ( p = 0.035) within the population. Moreover, since all of these samples were collected prior to the initiation of ART, for the three females whose virus encoded this mutation, the resistance mutations must have been present in the virus of their male partners. Overall, we demonstrate here, through NFLG sequence analysis that recombinant viruses are more prevalent in Rwanda than previously reported, and that the frequency of both recombinants and NNRTI DRMs appear to have increased between two sampling periods. It will be critical therefore to continue to monitor the nature of circulating viruses to ensure the validity of ongoing vaccine development efforts.

Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe, with the first case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14 th, 2020. Although the global number of COVID- 19 infections has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of new infections and deaths recorded in Open Peer Review Reviewer Status Invited Reviewers 12 version 3 (revision) 10 Dec 2020 version 2 (revision) report report b Page 1 of 22Wellcome Open Research 2020, 5:163 Last updated: 10 DEC 2020\u0010\u0015\u0013\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001African countries have been relatively modest, suggesting slower transmission dynamics of the virus on the continent, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data. Notably, there is no significant increase in unexplained pneumonias or deaths on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive assessment of sub-Saharan Africa's (SSA) preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have contributed to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak so far. As a group of early career scientists and the next generation of African scientific leaders with experience of working in medical and diverse health research fields in both SSA and resource-rich countries, we present a unique perspective on the current public health interventions to fight COVID-19 in Africa. Our perspective is based on extensive review of the available scientific publications, official technical reports and announcements released by governmental and non-governmental health organizations as well as from our personal experiences as workers on the COVID-19 battlefield in SSA. We documented public health interventions implemented in seven SSA countries including Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana, the existing gaps and the important components of disease control that may strengthen SSA response to future outbreaks.

Introduction COVID-19 is caused by a novel beta-coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was rst reported in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China1. SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe2, with the rst case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14th 20203. COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of inter- national concern on January 30th 2020 and a pandemic on March 11th 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO)4,5. Just a few months into the pandemic, COVID-19 has ravaged developed countries, with signicant case fatal- ity rates in Europe and the USA6. Considering the large number of people that live in poor and crowded informal set- tings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)7,8, the mode of transmis- sion of SARS-CoV-2, the severity of the disease as well as the existing fragile health systems9-11 it was hypothesized that Africa may markedly be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic result-ing in disastrous consequences with a large number of patients overwhelming hospitals and high case fatality rates 9,12. As of June 6th COVID-19 global infections recorded in 215 countries were 6,663,034 cases and 392,802 deaths [5.9%]. The three countries with the highest burden were the USA with 1,857,872 cases [deaths 5.8%], Brazil 614,941 [5.5%] and Russia 458,689 [1.2%]. Italy and Spain were highly affected in the rst quarter of the year but have stabilised their epidemics since the beginning of May 2020 with 234,531 cases [deaths: 14.4%] and 240,978 [11.3%] respectively 6. At the same time, the African continent accounted for only 2.6% of the global infections with 177,953 cases and 4,936 deaths [2.8%] in 54 countries13. Four African countries, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco and Algeria, comprise more than 52% of reported COVID-19 cases in Africa 13 and only one of these countries is located in the SSA region. Although the global number of SARS-CoV-2 infections increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic due to ongo- ing transmission, the low number of infections and deaths recorded in SSA countries have raised suspicions on whether they represent a slow progression of the pandemic in Africa, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data. Notably, there is no signicant increase in unexplained pneumo- nias or deaths recorded on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments, although recent reports from South Africa indicate a surge in weekly deaths from natural causes that may be attributable to COVID-19 14. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive assessment of SSA's preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have contributed to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak so far. Here, we - a diverse group of early career researchers (grad- uate students and post-doctoral scientists) and the next generation of African scientic leaders with experience working in various elds of health research including medicine, immu- nology, molecular biology, microbiology, virology and pub- lic health in both SSA countries and in developed countries - conducted an assessment of African preparedness and response to the COVID-19 during the early (rst 3 months) of the pandemic on the African continent. The early career research- ers involved are fellows of the African Academy of Science's Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excel- lence (SANTHE) 15, (part of the DELTAS Africa initiative) and some were at the frontline of the battle against COVID-19 in their respective countries during the time of this assessment. As of June 6th 2020, the seven countries represented had reported the following caseloads of COVID-19: Cameroon, 7,599 cases 40 [2.5%]; 13 and South Africa, which had recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Africa with 45,973 cases [2.1% deaths]13. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded rap- idly, and the undertaken public health measures interrupted our studies, our careers and other usual activities, this pandemic has also offered a blueprint on how to deal with epidemics. This analysis presents a unique perspective on the currently developed public health interventions to ght COVID-19 on the African continent. We discuss the challenges and oppor- tunities that exist to improve African capacity to ght future epi- demics from our perspective as the next generation of scientists that will oversee these responses in the future. Our evaluation of sub-Saharan Africa preparedness and response to COVID-19 reviewed country specic preventive meas- ures and critically examined the response to the pandemic in seven African countries. We assessed the public health meas- ures and other crucial interventions that were put in place in the control of COVID-19 in Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana. We argue that these strat- egies may have helped to prevent a disastrous outcome by reducing rapid transmissions that may happen in clusters and minimizing the number of patients seeking medical assistance at the same time. We also identied and summarized in three cat- egories of biomedical, sociocultural and economic factors; the challenges encountered at different levels of the health system. We presented the gaps existing in the public health interven- tion programs that may result in delays/failure to halt the spread of the disease as well as the important components of disease control that may strengthen sub-Saharan Africa preparedness and response to future outbreaks. Amendments from Version 2 In response to the reviewer's comments, the following changes were made to this article. In the introduction and Table 2 , \"global pandemic\" was replaced with \"pandemic\".

WHO warned on February 22 nd 2020 that all member states of the African Union should develop an early strong plan of action to tackle the growing threat16. As emerging African leaders in health research and fellows of the SANTHE consortium, we convened a virtual meeting to discuss the threat that the pandemic posed to SSA and agreed that we had a responsibility to critically analyze the response of our govern-ments so far and to offer our own perspective on how this and other similar epidemics should be tackled on the continent. In the meeting, participants discussed the origin of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, infection preventive measures, diagnostic tests, clinical management of the disease and the development of vacci nes and therapeutics by critically reviewing the ava ilable scientic literature. We discussed the need for scientic and evidence-based responses that considered Africa's unique health- care, sociocultural and economic challenges. We therefore decided to review articles focusing on SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Africa and the responses that African governments were taking. Specically, we used the free search engine PubMed to identify articles that discussed the transmission dynamics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, or described the sociocultural, eco- nomic and the state of health care systems in Africa and their impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, we searched for popular media reports and performed internet searches at of-cial websites for any documents or articles highlighting interven- tions against COVID-19 implemented by African governments, local health authorities or nongovernmental health organizations. We also relied on our own personal experiences and perspec- tives. Considering that the response to the epidemic has been very variable from country to country, we agreed to focus our analysis from reports emanating from Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana, countries that were represented among us. An extensive review of the steps taken in preparedness and response to COVID-19 guided by a representative from each of the seven SSA countries was conducted and a conclusive report encompassing our perspectives was generated. Sub-Saharan Africa preparedness for COVID-19 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world's top priority was to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, to reduce disease fatalities and to limit the patient burden on health sys- tems. Despite the uncertainty and unanswered questions around the management of the newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 infec- tion, African countries joined the global effort to battle the COVID-19 pandemic as we outline in detail below. It has been reported that the experiences of SSA countries in han- dling ongoing outbreaks and managing infectious diseases such as Ebola, tuberculosis, malaria and HIV came in handy in the ght of COVID-19 17-19. Pre-existing emergency plans on public health interventions, community engagement programs and the work force composed of emergency medical experts and trained health care workers were quickly re-directed to ensure a fast response to COVID-1917-21.As early as January 2020, prior to the identication of the rst case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the African continent on February 14th 20203, African countries had already initi- ated public engagement conversations to inform the population about the new pandemic22-28. Public notices about COVID-19 were issued between January and March in the seven SSA coun- tries that we assessed29-35. In preparation for possible incom- ing cases the Ministries of Health worked with local health authorities to designate medical teams, testing laboratories and clinical facilities for isolation and care of COVID-19 patients 25,36-41. Through media communication, health authorities addressed the new threat, communicating the signs and symp- toms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its mode of transmission as well as the preventive measures and safety guidelines such as hand and respiratory hygiene and social distancing according to WHO guidelines and recommendations24,42-48. Some of the countries that were considered in this analysis such as Rwanda and Kenya quickly instituted widespread hand washing stations or used hand sanitizers in public places such as bus stations and restaurant entrances 49-51. Health communication about COVID-19 was made easier by the use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter, whereas web-based chat or a hotline number that could be contacted for information and inquiries about COVID-19 were made avail- able to the public in all the seven countries 23,28,52-57. Furthermore, in an effort guided by Africa CDC to strengthen the emergency response to COVID-19, the readiness of African countries to handle the new disease was assessed and training of health care workers and lab technologists on diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection was conducted 22. The majority of African countries lack specialized medical capacity that is critical for handling severe cases of COVID-19, such as intensive care unit (ICU) beds11,58 and mechanical ventilators59. Therefore, the main priority on the African con- tinent was to contain the infection, initiate immediate testing for suspected cases and to start medical intervention prior to development or progression to severe clinical disease. The coun- tries we assessed focused their efforts on prevention, early identication of new infections and mitigating mass spread of the virus by quickly tracing case contacts based on the avail-able information. All seven countries initiated border screening at ports of entry by March 2020 and a 14-day self-quarantine was recommended for all incoming travellers 53,60-65. Although as a result of few or unavailable laboratory technol- ogy, some SSA countries could not test for COVID-19 locally, the early established collaborative model among African countries, coordinated by the Africa CDC, increased testing capacity across the continent22,66,67 as an example early sam- ples of suspected COVID-19 cases from the Central African Republic were shipped to Rwanda for testing until the local capacity became available. Nonetheless, testing constraints still remain in most countries 68, and therefore testing priority was given to most at risk persons such as returning travellers, or the people who have been in contact with conrmed cases, iden- tied through contact tracing by health care workers.

Sub-Saharan Africa response to COVID-19 The early implementation of COVID-19 preventive meas- ures delayed the rapid spread of the virus within the African population, but these procedures could not completely halt the spread of the virus in all seven countries. Soon after each country had identied the rst case of COVID-19, new infections were reported, with the majority related to returnee travellers or contacts of index COVID-19 cases. To reduce the risk of imported cases, these countries, with the excep- tion of Zambia, swiftly closed borders, shut airports and reduced incoming travellers to essential workers and returning residents 27,62-65,69-72. In order to mitigate further spread of the disease, individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were admit- ted in designated isolation areas for care and medical assist- ance while case contact tracing was immediately initiated. Additionally, mass gatherings and non-essential travels were prohibited, government and private business staff were encour- aged to work from home and schools were closed65,71-77. With the exception of Zambia, the assessed SSA countries implemented a dusk to dawn curfew and nation-wide lockdown to enforce social distancing measures, limiting movements to essential service providers 71,78-83. These measures were mainly put in place to prevent large volumes of new infections that would result in a high demand for hospital services, potentially leading to overwhelming of the fragile medical infrastructure 84,85. Contrary to what was initially expected, the spread of SARS- CoV-2 has been relatively slower in Africa12, and COVID-19 infections have been generally mild to moderate, leading to more recoveries and lower fatality rates in the seven SSA countries86 compared to Western countries6. It should also be mentioned that this pandemic started earlier on the other con- tinents, suggesting that it may be too early for SSA to cel-ebrate its relative success as Africa may have not yet faced the highest phase of the disease. However, a comparison of the early phases of the pandemic in some African and European countries has shown a positive impact of early interventions ini- tiated by SSA countries resulting in distinct disease trajecto- ries, For example a comparison of the infection dynamics in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Spain vs South Africa and Cameroon has shown a continual exponential peak in non-African countries but slow and gradual increase in both of the SSA countries 87. Our analysis suggests that early initiation of preventive meas- ures, a faster response by timely testing of suspected cases and immediate contact tracing done by SSA countries has mitigated a faster and more extensive spread of the virus in the popula- tion. Additionally, a contemporary warm climate may have impacted the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in these countries88-90. We posit that the predominantly young demography could be a contributing factor to a mild dis- ease and low case fatality observed in Africa20,91. Furthermore, there are suggestions that cross reactive-immunity resulting from previous infections that are predominant in the region or the universal BCG vaccine policy92, widely recommended for infants vaccination in the assessed countries, may have offered some health benets such as enhanced lung cells immu-nity against infections contributing to better clinical outcome of the disease. However, these observations have not yet been con- rmed by rigorous evaluations. Altogether, the prevention pro- grams that were put in place and the early response implemented by SSA countries may have mitigated the widespread dissemi- nation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and fatality due to COVID- 19 in SSA countries 69,93. The interventions implemented in all seven SSA for prevention and control of the COVID-19 are summarized in Table 1 . Biomedical, sociocultural and economic challenges met in the course of COVID-19 pandemic The ability to coordinate a rapid response to COVID-19 by African governments, guided by health and scientic experts in the assessed countries, has shown the continent's strengths and the expertise to tackle health threats like the COVID-19. However, the main challenges in SSA countries such as poor infrastructure 94, clusters of high density populations95, highest global bur- den of infectious diseases96, and low GDP per capita97,98 have impacted the sustainability of these interventions resulting in early ease of the key measures to prevent other consequences unrelated to the pandemic. Details about the key challenges are summarized in Table 2 . The main challenges that Africa faces in the response to COVID-19 pertain to lack of local biotechnological produc- tion and limited research capacity or expertise in speciality elds, thus making African countries unable to conduct suf-cient testing and focused research studies related to disease transmissibility, vaccine or cure research relevant to the local context. Many African countries are relying on equipment and reagents imported from outside the continent. Although, most African countries already have the equipment footprint for COVID-19 tests from the key manufacturers Abbott, Cepheid and Roche, testing capacity is hindered by the ina- bility to rapidly expand the technological capacity, limited funds and more recently by the export restrictions imposed on COVID-19-related supplies 99. It is heartening to note that countries such as Senegal and South Africa have initiated programmes to locally develop reagents and PPE100-102. The shift in focus to pro- duction of COVID-19-specic items threatens the pre-existing line products needed for other infections such as HIV and TB. For example procurement of COVID-19 supplies has ham- pered the existing unstable supply chain for routine medical supplies that are essential for the management of other medi-cal conditions (e.g. antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis and hepatitis drugs, infant vaccines, anesthesia needed for surger- ies and dental treatments, test kits, laboratory reagents and consumables used for other medical/research activities). The mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to enforce- ment of social distancing measures by restrictions of mass gatherings and a national lockdown in six of the seven coun- tries that we assessed 62-65,71,72,74-77.

The fragile health systems coupled with lockdown measures have inadvertently reduced access to health care for non-emergency and other pre-existing medi- cal conditions. For example with a re-prioritisation of human resources, it is estimated that an additional 6.5 million TB cases will occur over the next ve years106. Although the impact on other diseases such as HIV and malaria has not been assessed, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic will set back some of the gains made in the countries' responses to these killer diseases. Recommended solutions to bridge the gaps for improved outbreak preparedness and response Based on our assessment of the challenges and the gaps that were found in the approach used by the seven SSA to prevent/ respond to COVID-19 outbreak, we summarized the potential solutions in Figure 1 . We classied these into three interconnected categories of biomedical, sociocultural and economic aspects that we recommended to help improve the preparedness and response to future outbreaks.In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Africa CDC has started planning for the coordination of a centralised procurement system to reach the target of 55 million tests across the continent. Tens of thousands of test kits, PPE and thermometers have already been distributed to countries through a donation from the Jack Ma Foundation99. However, sustain- ability of a strong supply chain requires African governments to mobilize resources and to avail funding for health emergency response and research development on the continent includ-ing funded education in speciality elds. This will allow the countries to generate adequate interventions and to maintain a rapid response to outbreaks without overreliance on exper- tise from non-African countries and urgent importation of sup- plies. SSA countries should leverage novel medical/research capacity upon the existing structures that were put in place over many decades of ghting other public health threats such as Ebola, HIV , TB and malaria. The establishment of a net- work of multidisciplinary health care workers competent in various tasks such as community education and testing, in a multi-disease focused approach would allow management of staff shortage rather than having to prioritize the new life-threatening disease over those that were already prevailing on the continent.

Documentation on physical capacity on the African ground is needed. Some essential documents lacked the important infor- mation such as the date signed and released. Improvement on good record keeping especially for health data of this kind is essential for future references. Our assessment was not designed to demonstrate with certi- tude that the implemented interventions were directly linked to the number of infections or COVID-19 deaths in the assessed SSA countries. Clinical and biomedical research studies may be more appropriate to conrm these observations. Fur-ther, systematic reviews of effects would be informative. Nev- ertheless, we believe that our unique perspective on the SSA countries preparedness and response to a great health threat such as the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a valuable contribution to the future interventions. Conclusion We assessed the Sub-Saharan Africa preparedness and response to COVID-19. Based on an extensive review of the available scientic publications, the government technical reports and the anno uncements released by governmental and non-gov ernmental health organizations as well as our personal experiences as workers on the COVID-19 battleeld in SSA countries. This assessment was conducted during the rst three month of the COVID-19 pandemic before the virus spread widely in SSA and our conclusions were drawn based on statistical informa- tion on the disease presented in this study. We documented the preventive measures and the response put in place to contain the SARS-CoV-2 in seven SSA countries including Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia, South Africa and Botswana. We have shown the strengths of early initiated interventions that may have contributed to modest and slower dynamics of COVID-19 in SSA countries. To prepare for the ght against the COVID-19 pandemic, the countries of the sub-Saharan Africa assessed have strengthened their medical capacities by rapidly introducing screening techniques for SARS-CoV-2 and training health care workers in the management of the new disease. Pub- lic engagement efforts and information sessions were launched. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic these countries closed their borders and airports, implemented screening for SARS- CoV-2 at port of entry, and introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for returning travellers. These SSA countries issued national guidelines on recommended safety measures, initiated immediate contact tracing, prevented mass gatherings, insti- tuted national lockdown and curfew, closed schools and urged the private sector and the government personnel to work from home. It was noted that Zambia, which did not fully imple- ment the interventions described in this study as well as other countries not included in our review that have struggled to put into action public health interventions 107,108, reported no signi- cant increases in deaths compared to countries with more robust responses reported here. There, consistent with the recent study by M. Njenga et al.109 which investigated the causes of low mor- bidity and low mortality of COVID-19 in African countries, we also suggest that other factors such as warm climate, young population, pre-existing cross reactive immunity may have considerably contributed to the evolution of the COVID-19 pan-demic in SSA countries. It should be noted that implementa- tion of the public health interventions for preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa faced many challenges. We discussed the need for scientic research and evidence-based responses that considered Africa's unique healthcare, sociocultural and economic challenges. Overall, the assessed countries lacked the local biotechnological capac- ity for the production of biomedical supplies 99, they had a lim- ited workforce with the expertise to specically address the pandemic using evidence110, there was lack of community trust103, poor infrastructure11, inability to manage remote education programs111, failure to maintain the measures implemented due to the population economic instability7,8 and insufcient funds10. Formal studies of the extent of these challenges and how to address them in the future will be required. While efforts to bridge some of the gaps have been initiated, we recom- mend that SSA countries develop continued funding streams to support these initiatives as well to increase south to south/ north- south collaborations to enhance the capacity of the exist-ing health systems. Therefore, if these problems are addressed in a timely manner, there is no doubt that in the next ve years SSA countries will have developed a reliable-strong health system to prevent the newly emerging viral infections to spread at a large scale.

Kondwani C. Jambo Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine b(LSTM), Liverpool, UK This is an open letter by Umviligihozo et al.bthat aims at documenting the public health interventions against COVID-19 implemented in seven sub-Saharan African countries. Overall, the paper is well written and covers the most pertinent issues on the topic. It highlights the diverse implementation strategies employed by the seven SSA countries but notes the relative similar low mortality experienced in SSA. b However, the article could do with a bit of balancing of viewpoints, especially discussing why despite the relatively different implementation strategies of pubic health measures bthe mortality is relatively low but similar among the SSA countries. In countries like Malawi (not discussed in the article), that have struggled to implement public health interventions, the mortality has not been very different from the other SSA countries. bCould this bobservation mean that it is not necessarily the public health interventions that have driven the low mortality in SSA but potentially other factors? The authors have speculated that other factors including population demographics, cross- reactive immunity, and climate could have contributed to the less severe outcomes, but this has been relegated to a short paragraph. In its current state, the article puts a lot of weight on public health interventions but could be strengthened with a bit more discussion on the other factors. b b Page 16 of 22Wellcome Open Research 2020, 5:163 Last updated: 10 DEC 2020\u0010\u0016\u0018\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 The article would also benefit from a discussion on whether the planned public health interventions in the different countries were successfully implemented. Experiences from other countries show that what was planned on paper is not what happened or is happening on the ground. A discussion on this within the article will aid the reader in the interpretation of the findings and recommendations. All in all, I commend the authors for a well-thought-out open letter and for their confidence as young scientists in driving opinion in Africa. Is the rationale for the Open Letter provided in sufficient detail? Yes Does the article adequately reference differing views and opinions? Partl y Are all factual statements correct, and are statements and arguments made adequately supported by citations?Ye s Is the Open Letter written in accessible language?Y es Where applicable, are recommendations and next steps explained clearly for others to follow?Ye s Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

Author Response 07 Sep 2020 Gisele Umviligihozo , Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and important suggestions for improving this article. Our responses are presented below: b We agree with the reviewer that there are aspects of the COVID-19 presentation in sub-Saharan African that remain unresolved and require additional research. However, our goal here was to review that response in selected African countries and this preliminary analysis suggests a robust and effective response, notwithstanding other factors that may have influenced transmission dynamics and mortality. b b b Page 17 of 22Wellcome Open Research 2020, 5:163 Last updated: 10 DEC 2020\u0010\u0017\u000f\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001In response to the reviewer, we have under the conclusion the following clause that highlighted the importance of other factors driving the observations on infection dynamics of the COVID-19. \"It was noted that Zambia, which did not fully implement the interventions described in this study as well as other countries not included in our review that have struggled to put into action public health interventions, 1,2 reported no significant increases in deaths compared to countries with more robust responses reported here. There, consistent with the recent study by M. Njenga et al3 which investigated the causes of low morbidity and low mortality of COVID-19 in African countries, we also suggest that other factors such as a warm climate, young population, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity may have considerably contributed to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA countries.\" b We agree with the reviewer that further studies of the efficiency of implementation of public health interventions is required. This was beyond the scope of the current work.b b The following summary discussing the challenges faced in the implementation of the interventions described was added to the text. \"It should be noted that implementation of the public health interventions for preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa faced many challenges. Overall, the assessed countries lacked the local biotechnological capacity for the production of biomedical supplies, 4 they had a limited workforce with the expertise to specifically address the pandemic using evidence,5 there was lack of community trust6, poor infrastructure7, inability to manage remote education programs,8 failure to maintain the measures implemented due to the population economic instability9,10 and insufficient funds.11 Formal studies of the extent of these challenges and how to address them in future will be required.\" b References b 1. bbbbbb Chibwana MG, Jere KC, Kamn'gona R, et al.

Charles Shey Wiysonge Cochrane South Africa, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa I read, with keen interest, the article on public health interventions to fight COVID-19 in Africa by Gisele Umviligihozo and her colleagues, all of them early career scientists, who describe themselves as the next generation of African scientific leaders. This portrays a commendable sense of duty. The article deserves indexing and I have only minor comments and suggestions for improvement. The authors write that this article is \"Based on an extensive review of the available scientific publications, the government technical reports and the announcements released by governmental and nongovernmental health organizations ...\". However, the authors do not provide a description of the search and selection of the literature used in this article. I suggest that they should provide this information in the article or as a supplementary document. The World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and not in March 2020. Please refer to reference 1 1. The authors state that \"Notably, there is no significant increase in unexplained pneumonias or deaths recorded on the continent which could possibly indicate the effectiveness of interventions introduced by several African governments\". While I generally agree with this statement, especially given the time they submitted the article, I would like to alert the authors to reports by the South African Medical Research Council of a recent upsurge in weekly deaths from natural b Page 19 of 22Wellcome Open Research 2020, 5:163 Last updated: 10 DEC 2020\u0010\u0017\u0011\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001causes in South Africa. Please refer to reference 22. In Table 2, what does the sociocultural challenge \"suspicion of harmful and unethical interventions\" mean? What are the harmful and unethical interventions and why and who offered the harmful and unethical interventions to whom? What are \"faith-related rumors\"? References 1.

Author Response 07 Sep 2020 Gisele Umviligihozo , Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and suggestions for improving this article, our responses are as follows: b b Page 20 of 22Wellcome Open Research 2020, 5:163 Last updated: 10 DEC 2020\u0010\u0017\u0012\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001To elaborate on the search criteria and to describe the research methodology used in the selection of the literature for this article, the following statement under \"Assessment and findings\" was updated to reflect these steps. b\"We therefore decided to review articles focusing on SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Africa and the responses that African governments were taking. b Specifically, we used the free search engine PubMed to identify articles that discussed the transmission dynamics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, or described the sociocultural, economic and the state of health care systems in Africa and their impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, we searched for popular media reports and performed internet searches at official websites for any documents or articles highlighting interventions against COVID-19 implemented by African governments, local health authorities or nongovernmental health organizations. b We also relied on our own personal experiences and perspectives.\" b We agree with the reviewer's comment on this bdate, abcorrection has been made to this statement which now reads \"COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30th, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).1\" We agree with the reviewer's comment on the need to draw the reader's attention to the changing dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA, to address this concern we updated the introduction to include that recent reports from South Africa indicate a surge in weekly deaths from natural causes that may be attributable to COVID-19. 2 bbWe also clarified in conclusion that \"This assessment was conducted during the first three month of the COVID-19 pandemic before the virus spread widely in SSA and our conclusions were drawn based on statistical information on the disease presented in this study\" The sociocultural challenges mentioned in Table 2 refer to the misinformation about the consequences of the safety recommendations. As an example, misinformation has led to some interventions being termed harmful or unethical among some communities. b Examples include interventions such as wearing a mask which some have suggested is detrimental to health due to carbon dioxide poisoning,3 numerous faith-related rumors, whereby some religious leaders have spread misleading information that they are able to cure COVID-194. Table 2 was updated to clarify these points. b References b 1. bbbbbb World Health Organization (WHO).
