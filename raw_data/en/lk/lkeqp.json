A separate program, the [HRSA COVID-19 Coverage Assistance Fund](/provider-relief/about/covid-19-coverage-assistance), is available to reimburse providers for COVID-19 vaccine administration to underinsured individuals whose health plan either does not include COVID-19 vaccination as a covered benefit or covers COVID-19 vaccine administration but with cost-sharing. View [Frequently Asked Questions](/provider-relief/about/covid-uninsured-claim/faq). How it works Health care providers who have conducted COVID-19 testing or provided treatment for uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 primary diagnosis on or after February 4, 2020, can request claims reimbursement through the program electronically and will be reimbursed generally at Medicare rates, subject to available funding. Providers can also request reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccine administration. Steps will involve: enrolling as a provider participant, checking patient eligibility, submitting patient information, submitting claims, and receiving payment via direct deposit. To participate, providers must attest to the following at registration: - You have checked for health care coverage eligibility and confirmed that the patient is uninsured. You have verified that the patient does not have coverage through an individual, or employer-sponsored plan, a federal healthcare program, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program at the time services were rendered, and no other payer will reimburse you for COVID-19 vaccination, testing and/or care for that patient. - You will accept defined program reimbursement as payment in full. - You agree not to balance bill the patient. - You agree to [program terms and conditions](/sites/default/files/hrsa/provider-relief/uninsured-program-terms-conditions-6-21.pdf) (PDF - 123 KB) and may be subject to post-reimbursement audit review.
