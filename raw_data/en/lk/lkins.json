Rose also practices [Hypnotherapy](https://essendonnaturalhealth.com.au/hypnotherapy/). Holistic and Crystal Healing involves a range of therapies to help cleanse and activate the mind and body to improve physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. Our Holistic Healer, [Rose Gentile](https://essendonnaturalhealth.com.au/practitioners/rose-gentile/), has particular expertise in using a wide range of different crystals to cleanse and activate the seven major and minor chakras that are responsible for maintaining our physical, spiritual and emotional wellbeing. The body, soul, mind and spirit together with the seven chakras are one whole. Rose may also use hypnotherapy, flower essences, or tarot when and where appropriate with consent from the patient. The chakras influence our body shape, hormones, thoughts, and behaviour. When imbalanced, this can result in dis-ease and sub-optimal health. The chakras are the entry gates to our aura. When one or more chakras are blocked, energy does not flow harmoniously through them. Childhood traumas, limited belief systems, physical and emotional injuries can all contribute to chakra blockages. Rose can assess an individual's chakras and then proceed to energise and balance them with crystal healing. Many clients can actually feel their chakras being activated at the time of treatment based on the feelings they feel in their physical body and mind. Balancing the chakras has many benefits such as: With permission, Rose also assesses her clients aura. This is the electromagnetic field that surrounds all living creatures- each person's body has its own unique colour and frequency. The size, clarity and colour of your aura tells Rose lots of things about your energy, general health and emotional wellbeing. For example, an orange aura it shows that you have a lot of energy, are creative, productive and have an adventurous social nature. Blue in your aura shows a person who is calm, patient, caring, and intuitive with a desire to help others. Violet in the aura tells me that this person has psychic ability, is intuitive, sensitive and idealistic. Green shows us that this person is patient, in tune with nature, loves the environment and cares for Mother Nature; they are natural healers and teachers. All the other colours in the spectrum like red, brown, yellow, white, silver, gold and all their different shades tell us a great deal about a person. When Rose sees you for the first time she will scan you and tell you what physical and or emotional issues you may have. She can often tell what medical problems you are currently experiencing - you don't have to tell her anything, only validate it if it's true when asked. She does this by intuition and by looking at your subtle energy systems. All that is required is that you remain receptive, open and honest. Clients usually report and comment on immediate beneficial changes within the first session, this is apparent by the increase in the size of their aura at the end of treatment. It may take a few visits to improve or resolve any presenting problems. If you would like to make a time to see Rose, please contact reception on [03 9337 8572](tel: 0393378572) and speak with one of our friendly reception staff.
