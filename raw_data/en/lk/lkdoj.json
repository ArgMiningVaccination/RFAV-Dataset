According to the AAMC, holistic review is a flexible, individualized way of assessing an applicant's capabilities by which balanced consideration is given to experiences, attributes, and academic metrics and when considered in combination, how the individual might contribute value as a medical student and future physician. Holistic admission process promotes broadly diverse perspectives in medical education: o Enhance the quality of education for all students . o Translate into more effective and culturally competent physicians better prepared to serve a varied patient population. o Address disparities in health care, including access to qua lity services. o Minority physicians may be more likely to practice in underserved population areas. o Medical schools educate all of their students regarding disparities in health care to focus on research agendas and policy strategies, as well as clinical pr actice. A Holistic admissions process enables medical schools to increase student diversity as a means of achieving such mission- related goals as: Excellence in education, research, and clinical care. An enriched educational environment and learning community that benefits all students . A physician workforce that is better able to meet the needs of a diverse nation within a global society .

July 1 is the deadline for completing all admissions requirements, including those on the matriculation checklist (the checklist will be available in the Applicant Portal by early May) Failure to meet the July 1 deadline may result in monetary fines, withdrawal of acceptance, or require the student to defer matriculation to the following admission year Orientation and the first day of classes is ty pically the third week of July. Attendance for all orientation activities is mandatory The Committee strongly recommends that incoming students not make plans to be out of the country during the one week leading up to beginning Orientation and Classes. S tudents planning to travel prior to pre- matriculation should complete all checklist items prior to travel. MSTP orientation begins in June each year Page | 5 REGULAR MD ADMISSION PROGRAM INFORMATION PRIMARY APPLICATION Our School uses the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) application for the admissions process. Applications must be \"verified\" by AMCAS prior to entering the Committee Review process . SECONDARY APPLICATION Secondary Applications are requested from verified AMCAS applicants who apply to our school who meet minimum requirements outlined in \"Minimum Requirements.\" Applicants selected to complete the secondary will receive an invitation and instructions via emai l. Applicants may save their work and return as necessary to edit and add information until all required fields are completed and the appl ication is submitted for review. A non -refundable $100 application fee to be paid online. This fee is waived for appli cants who have qualified for fee assistance from the AAMC Fee Assistance Program (FAP) . LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION Our school participates in the AMCAS Letters Service. AMCAS receives letters from the AMCAS Letter Writer Application, Interfolio, Mail and VirtualEvals. As a medical school participating in the AMCAS Letters Service, you are required to send ALL letters through the AMCAS Letters Service. Only letters submitted through AMCAS Letter Writer Application, Interfolio, Mail and VirtualEvals will be included in the application for review by our Admissions Committee. Once letters are processed by AMCAS, it may take a day or two for them to be uploaded into our admissions system. While letters from a Pre- Health Professional Advisory Committee (or other advisory entity) are the strongly preferred method of reporting from undergraduate school, applicants who do n ot have access to such a committee may submit a packet of letters or three individual letters of evaluation and recommendation. Applicants must choose one of the following options: Option One - Preferred Option: Committee Letter A committee letter is a letter authored by a pre- health committee or pre- health advisor and intended to represent the institution's evaluation of the applicant. A committee letter may or may not include additional letters written in support of the application. Option Two: Letter Packet Applicants from schools without a Pre- Health Professional Advisory Committee (PHPAC) may submit a packet of letters of evaluation and recommendation: A packet or set of letters assembled and distributed by your institution, often by the institutions career center. A Letter Packet may include a cover sheet from the pre- health committee or advisor. A letter packet differs from a Committee Letter in that a Letter Packet does not include an evaluative letter from your pre- health committee or advisor. Option Three: Three Individual Letters If the school does not have a Pre- Health Professional Advisory Committee (PHPAC), the applicant may submit the following three individual letters of evaluation and recommendation: At least one letter from a faculty member (preferably a science faculty member) Two letter s from other faculty or individual s who can provide in- depth evaluation and recommendation Note: Applicants should not submit more than five individual letters of recommendation. APPLI CATION SCREENING Page | 6 Applications are considered complete when all required materials are received by the Admissions Office. Completed application files are read by admissions committee members on a rolling basis. Interviews are offered based on the results of the application screening process. There are three possible actions after the Initial Application Review is completed: 1. The applicant is offered an Interview at that time. 2. The applicant's application is determined to be competitive and remains under consideration for a possible interview at a future date. Applicants placed in the status may remain here for an extended period of time. 3. The applicant is notified the application is not competitive for admission and the Committee will give no further consi deration to the applicant this application year . Typically , the last group of applicants to be invited are notified by February . INTERVIEWS Interviews allow the Committee to develop a better understanding of the applicant's interests, experiences, motivation and capacity to be a physician. Interviews also provide the opportunity to recruit desired students. Applicants offered inter views are notified by email and given instructions for scheduling the interview. Interviews are conducted on select Thursdays, from the end of August through mid- March Each applicant will have a Traditional Interview and a Multi Mini Interview. o For the traditional interview, the applicant meets individually with one Admissions Commi ttee member for a twenty -five minute interview. o The Multi Mini Interview consists of a series of 8 - 10 stations each held in a different room. Applicants will discuss or respond to a scenario that is different in each station. Interviewers, both tradit ional and multi mini interviewers are blind to the applicants GPA and MCAT score . Traditional i nterviewers do have access to the applicant's AMCAS and Secondary applications and letters, but do not have access to applicant's coursework, grades or MCAT scor es. Multi Mini interviewers do not have access to any applicant information other than name. The interview day includes presentations on curriculum, admissions, student services and diversity and inclusion. Applicants also have lunch with current student s and go on a tour of the hospital. COMMITTEE REVIEW Following the interviews, each applicants file and evaluations are holistically reviewed by three individual members of the Admissions Selection Committee in preparation for committee discussions/decis ions. The Admissions Selection Committee makes all decisions on admission to the medical school. Committee decisions are final and not subject to appeal. NOTIFICATION OF COMMITTEE DECISIONS Acceptances The Selection Committee makes admission decisions on a rolling basis until all seats are filled. The first acceptances for Regular MD admission are typically offered on or shortly after October 15. No Further Consideration Applicants are notified via em ail if they are no longer being considered for admission. Still Under Consideration Applicants who have not been notified of acceptance or denial are still under consideration for a seat in the class. Waitlist Once the interview cycle is complete, all applicants who are still under consideration for admission will be placed on the first or second tier of the waitlist. UABSOM typically notifies applicants of their waitlist placement by the end of March or early April . Feedback from the Admissions Commi ttee During the Admissions Season All inquiries from applicants seeking feedback should be referred to the Admissions Office Page | 7 Applicant thank you notes and other communications to Admissions Committee members should be directed to the Admissions Office.

This includes: Shadow physicians to learn about the Patient -Physician relationship and gain familiarity with the modern medical system in both outpatient and hospital settings. Volunteer in service organizations benefiting other people, especially those serving under -served populations. 11. Maintain high standards of moral character. EMSAP students are expected not to lie, steal, cheat, plagiarize, commit fraud or commit felonies. Violations of these standards will subject a student to dismissal from the program, and will be determined by the sole judgment of a committee consisting of the EMSAP Director, the Director of Enrollment Management and the Dean for Admissions of the SOM. 12. Demonstrate personal and emotional maturity and have life experiences consistent with that of premedical students accepted to SOM. 13.

EMSAP students wishing to matriculate prior to completing four years of undergraduate experience must apply through the Regular Admissions process and will be subject to requirements for Regular Admissions. o If unsuccessful in gaining admission at this time, the applicant will not be eligible for guaranteed admission through EMSAP in a subsequent year. 16. Complete and submit the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) application no later than August 1 of the application year and subsequently complete and submit a SOM secondary application no later than August 15. In general, admission to EMSAP should not be viewed as an entitlement to SOM admission but as an opportunity to demonstrate superior academic abilities and exceptional non-academic attributes. EMSAP students should have accomplishments in these areas exceeding or at least comparable to what is expected of other premedical students who seek admission to medical school. EMSAP students judged by the School of Medicine Admissions Committee to have notable deficiencies in any of these areas may be dismissed from the EMSAP program and not be admitted through EMSAP. Page | 11 MEDICAL SCIENTIST TRAINING PROGRAM (MSTP or MD/PhD Program) The NIH -funded Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is a combined MD/PhD program designed to prepare students for careers that combine laboratory investigation of disease mechanisms with the practice and teaching of clin ical medicine in an academic setting. Application Applicants must complete t wo applications: o An AMCAS application applying Program type: Combined Medical Degree/Ph.D. o A School of Medicine Secondary Application. AMCAS deadline is November 1 and the Secondary Appl ication deadline is November 15. Application Review Applicants are reviewed by the SOM Admissions Committee and MSTP Admissions Program. The MSTP Admissions Program makes decisions for offering secondary applications and interviews . Interviews Applicants interview with two Committees - The MSTP Admissions Committee and the SOM Admissions Committee. Acceptance Decisions Acceptance to the MSTP requires acceptance from both the SOM Admissions Selection Committee and the MSTP Committee. o The MSTP Committee makes the primary decision for acceptance. o The MSTP is a separate admissions track to the School of Medicine and the evaluation criteria the SOM Admissions Committee employs for this program are different from those for the SOM Regular MD Admissi ons Track in that for MSTP the Committee places significant weight on the applicant's commitment to complete an intensive educational program leading to a career in research In order to be accepted by the SOM Admissions Selection Committee, MSTP applicants must exceed the minimum thresholds for acceptance in the Regular Admissions Program. Out of state MSTP applicants are not required to meet the 3.4 minimum GPA required for Regular MD consideration. MSTP applicants must be accepted by the Admissions Selec tion Committee. Matriculation In order to matriculate to this program, MSTP applicants must meet all minimum and administrative requirements for Regular MD admission to the School of Medicine. MSTP applicants do not have to pay an acceptance deposit. MSTP Students wishing to enter the Regular MD track Students accepted to MSTP who later decide not to complete the combined degree, with approval of the Director of MSTP, may apply for transfer to the SOM Regular MD Program . The SOM Admissions Committee's Cr iteria used in accepting applicants for MSTP are different than those used by the SOM Admission Committee for the Regular MD track, o As with all transferring applicants, in making the decision for accepting the MSTP student in transfer, the SOM Admissions Committee will: Consider how the applicant's current academic and nonacademic attributes contr ibute to the mission of the SOM. Compare the applicant's initial application for medical school with those who were accepted through the Regular MD track to deter mine if the applicant's pre- matriculation preparation and interview were consistent with students in the class in the Regular MD Track. Review the applicant's medical school record to determine if the applicant's academic and non-academic performance is consistent with s tudents in the Regular MD class. The Admissions Selection Committee makes final decisions for acceptance.

Page | 17 ADMISSIONS RELATED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS F OR CLINICAL YEARS PURPOSE: The University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine has four campuses, located in Birmingham, Huntsville, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa, where students complete the Core Clerkships and Medicine AIs of their undergraduate medical education program. To ensure the resources of all four campuses are efficiently utilized, avoiding over enrollment or under enrollment at any one campus, students are assigned proportionately to each campus during the assignment process. POLICY: The University of Alabama at Bir mingham School of Medicine applicants are assigned to one of the School of Medicine's four campuses for their MS -3 and MS -4 years during the acceptance process. Applicants are assigned proportionately to each campus based on application type, applicant pre ference, and availability. 1. Students must take their required clerkships , their Medicine AI (Acting Internship), and their ambulatory AI on their assigned campus. Primary Care Track students must take all acting inter nships on the Tuscaloosa campus. 2. Stude nts may pursue elective, surgery/critical care AI, and elective AI coursework on all UAB medical school campuses . 3. Students assigned to the Tuscaloosa campus will participate in the Longitudinal Integrated Curriculum. 4. Program Based Assignments: Applicants accepted through the Primary Care Track, Rural Medical Scholars Program (RMSP -Tuscaloosa), the Rural Medicine Program (RMP -Huntsville) and MSTP (MD/PhD -Birmingham) programs will be assigned to the appropriate Program campus at the time of acceptance. 5. Other accepted applicants ( Regular Admissions, MD/MBA and MD/MPH ) will be assigned their preferred campus as possible. 6. Once assigned at admission, an applicant's campus assignment is final and binding and will not be reconsidered or changed prior to matriculation 7. Student transfers between campuses will be considered only in the second year and only for situations involving significant and compelling circumstances per the Campus Change Request policy . It is not always possible to accommodate all reasonable requests due to capacity constraints . PROCEDURES: Campus visit programs and other informational activities will be planned to educate students about campuses. Interviewed applicants will be asked to submit their campus preferences using the Admissions Portal by March 1. The Tuscaloosa Regional Campus openings are entirely filled by Rural Medical and Primary Care Track program students and thus, Tuscaloosa is not included in the campus preference process for Regular MD applicants. The number of positions for assignment on each campus is determined at the beginning of the admissions year. Applicants are assigned campuses based on the applicant's preferences and the number of places available on each campus for assignment. Once all 186 positions are filled, positions made available by applicant withdrawals will be filled with applicants accepted from the Wait List. Page | 18 ALABAMA RESIDENCY FOR TUITION PURPOSES In-State Residency Information Alabama, like other states, restricts resident tuition to persons who have been residing in Alabama for purposes other than to obtain an education, and who are able to demonstrate contacts with the State of Alabama that indicate an intent to remain in this state. Resident tuition status is determined by the University, with regard to Alabama law, and the policies of the board of Trustees of the University of Alabama System and the University of Alabama at Birmingham . The guidelines in this document are presented as a summary and are not meant to replace or super sede Board policy or Alabama law. Applicants who meet one of the following conditions are generally reclassified as in- state residents for tuition purposes: The student is the member, the spouse, and/or dependent child of a member in the U. S. military on full-time active duty stationed in Alabama under orders for duties other than attending school. The student is a full -time employee (not temporary) in the state or the spouse or dependent of such an employee. Guidelines Guidelines for determining residency for tuition purposes are independent of other regulations used by state authorities to determine residency in the state of Alabama. For example, having an Alabama driver's license, an Alabama car tag, and/or voter registration would not alone demonstrate residency for tuition purposes. In determining resident or nonresident classification, the primary issue is one of intent. If a person is in Alabama pr imarily for the purpose of obtaining an education, that person will generally be considered a nonresident student. Documents supporting a reclassification application should be, but are not required to be, dated, issued, or filed twelve (12) months before the first day of classes of the semester for which reclassification is sought. To be considered for in- state tuition, the student must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident alien, or a legal alien granted indefinite stay by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If 19 years of age or older, student must establish residency base d on own circumstances and not that of parent(s) or guardian, unless the student is a \"qualifying child\" as defined by the IRS, also known as dependent child as stated in the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama System and the University of Alaba ma at Birmingham policies. Criminal Background Checks Policy Criminal background checks will be conducted on all students accepted for admission to the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. Subsequent criminal background checks may be required, subject to applicable policy. Procedures UABSOM participates in the AMCAS Criminal Background Check Service. Initial checks will be performed only after the applicant has received an offer of acceptance. Applicants offered acceptance as an Advanced Standing/Transfer student are responsible for direct payment of the Criminal Background Check fee to the selected vendor. The offer of acceptance and continued enrollment is contingent on satisfactory results of criminal background checks. Page | 19 Criminal background information released to the School of Medicine will be maintained in a file separate from the student's academic file and, in general, will not be considered in other proceedings of the institution. Confi dentiality will be respected at all steps in the process. Only selected school faculty and administrators have access to CBC information on a need- to-know basis. Accepted applicants and enrolled students will have an opportunity to review an adverse criminal history and to submit a response to the report. If a background check review identifies issues which may preclude acceptance or participation in clinical activities, the case will be referred to Criminal Background Review Committee. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING STUDENTS FOR ADMISSION Policy: The Admissions Selection Committee (ASC) has the final responsibility for selecting students for admission to the School of Medicine . The ASC may delegate authority to a subgroup of the ASC for making offers based on committee ratings and mission- match. Review and selection of applicants for admission to the School of Medicine will not be influenced by any political or financial factors. ADMISSIONS GUIDELINES FOR MANAGING APPLICANT INFORMATION GUIDELINES FOR SHARI NG APPLICANT INFORMA TION Guideline Statement: The Committee does not share application information with entities outside the Admissions process in accordance with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Student Records Policy and the F amily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). APPLICANT RECORDS RE TENTION Guideline Statement: Once an applicant is admitted, the application file is purged to contain documentation necessary for enrollment and student records management.
