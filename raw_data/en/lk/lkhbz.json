Despite this, a significant proportion of a generation may never be able to live independent lives. Many parents find getting the support they need to be an uphill struggle, at best, and worry about what will happen when they can no longer look after their ASD child themselves. Please don't despair however, because homeopathy can improve many of the symptoms of ASD, and many children have recovered almost completely (see below).

The journey of a boy with autism. Nancy Korn had one dream in life-to become a mother. She and her husband Evan wanted a big family. After six years of trying, they finally got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy little boy, Lucas. His development was normal. But when he approached his first birthday, Lucas began to act strangely. By age two, Lucas was diagnosed with autism. Nancy and Evan were devastated. They set out on a mission to bring their son back. Finding few answers in conventional medicine, they turned to alternative therapies. Some helped. Nothing cured. Lucas was still autistic. He still could not talk. One day, Nancy read about a doctor in Los Angeles who was using a centuries-old medical system, homeopathy, to treat autism. The physician, [Dr. Luc De Schepper](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drluc.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3RRUkx06bEN9_aZOiikPHo)- affectionately known as 'Dr. Luc' -- is a medical doctor, licensed acupuncturist and homeopath, an author of 15 books, and a respected teacher and lecturer worldwide. Despite his impressive credentials, the method\u2014and the doctor\u2014were controversial. But Nancy had a feeling. A week later she and her mother-in-law found themselves flying across the country to meet with [Dr. Luc](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drluc.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3RRUkx06bEN9_aZOiikPHo). After starting homeopathic treatment, Lucas begins to improve. The film follows their story over the next year to see if Lucas becomes free of his autism. Saving a Lost Generation Homeopaths in clinics across the UK, the USA and Australia are quietly getting on with their work. Using a protocol of homeopathic medicine and dietary changes a significant number of families are getting their lost children back. Given the paucity of options available for these families, we owe it to this generation of children and their parents to bring this protocol to the public's attention, and to demand that the potential of this approach be thoroughly investigated by a clinical trial.

This was prompted by the miraculous cure of her son's autism with homeopathy. She is dedicated to helping others -- especially families with autistic children -- discover the curative powers of homeopathy. Amy is the author of Impossible Cure: The Promise of Homeopathy (R.L.Ranch Press, 2003), a best-selling introductory book on homeopathy that includes the story of her son's cure as well as dozens of other first-person cure stories contributed by homeopathic patients from all over the world. It serves as a comprehensive patient guide to homeopathic philosophy, history, science, and experience, is used as a first-year text by many homeopathic schools, and has been translated into several other languages.

In many cases, the parents have declared their children 100% cured; in others, the process is still underway with significant improvement. His therapy is mainly based on Isotherapy, a form of homeopathy which is able to detect the causes of autism in children and which redresses them directly. He has made remarkable discoveries as to why autism is on the increase. This book is highly important for parents with autistic children and for all those who are involved in the care of these children. 'In the 9 months of your treatment, our son changed from a non verbal to a child that is able to attend a normal school, speaking in full sentences and making contact with everybody. Amazing! The autism team says it's a miracle. Your CEASE therapy is great. Our life has already completely changed. Thanks for all your knowledge.' \u2014 Mother of Stephan 'After three and a half months of treatment she has become another child. She has woken up, is able to express herself verbally and says what she feels instead of shrieking; she is more flexible, more open and more independent.

With the detoxification Vasco has made great progress. He's almost \"a normal\" 5-year-old kid.' \u2014 Parents of Vasco 'It is as if I am in a second life.

Parents feel devastated, as they are told that ASD is mysterious and there is no cure. The diagnosis is not the end of a process but the beginning.

This broad term seems to range over the whole spectrum from inability to concentrate, dyslexia, hyperactivity to frank autism. Many hundreds of these children have been brought to Foresight for hair testing and programmes over the years, and, as you would expect they all exhibit a lack of Zinc and Manganese. It has been known for many years that lack of Zinc inhibits the development of instinctive mental progress. Many small animals have been subjected to studies which have shown how Zinc deficient young fail to suck well, to cut teeth when expected, to leave the nest and find food for themselves and so on.
