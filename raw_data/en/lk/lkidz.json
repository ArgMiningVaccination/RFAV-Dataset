An early clinical trial (Phase I-II) demonstrated that the EpiVacCorona vaccine is a safe product. The \"Multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, randomized trial to assess the tolerability, safety, immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy of the EpiVacCorona COVID-19 vaccine based on peptide antigens in 3000 volunteers aged 18 years and older\" was performed regarding vaccine safety. The key objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and prophylactic efficacy of the two-dose EpiVacCorona vaccine administered via the intramuscular route. The results of the clinical study (Phase III) demonstrated the safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine. Vaccine administration was accompanied by mild local reactions in 27% of cases and mild systemic reactions in 14% of cases. The prophylactic efficacy of the EpiVacCorona COVID-19 vaccine after the completion of the vaccination series was 82.5% (CI95 = 75.3-87.6%). The high safety and efficacy of the vaccine give grounds for recommending this vaccine for regular seasonal prevention of COVID-19 as a safe and effective medicinal product.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-18", "cleaned_text": "Assessment of Safety and Prophylactic Efficacy of the EpiVacCorona Peptide Vaccine for COVID-19 Prevention coronaviruses can cause a number of diseases ranging from mild acute respiratory infection to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Like other respiratory viral infections, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, through aerosols, contaminated objects, or by direct contact [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00998), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00998), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00998), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00998)]. Coronaviruses have a broad tropism and, in addition to the respiratory tract, can affect the liver, the kidneys, the intestine, the nervous system, the heart, and the eyes [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00998), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00998), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00998), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00998), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00998), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00998)]. Being capable of inducing coronaviruses cause necrosis of the affected tissues, and fibrotic lung scars remain after patients' recovery. Coronaviruses exhibit a strong effect on cell membrane permeability, thus causing electrolyte imbalance and disrupting protein transport [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00998)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00998), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00998), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00998), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00998)]. The emergence of the novel coronavirus proves that diseases caused by this virus family pose a threat to global health because of the pandemic and must be carefully monitored. Mass vaccination is the most reliable method for stopping the pandemic. [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00998), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00998), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00998)]. [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00998)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00998)]. The optimal design for assessing the effectiveness of vaccination involves randomization of an equal number of subjects in the groups of the candidate vaccine and the control group (1:1). In trials that use a control group not vaccinated against a disease, it may be appropriate to use unbalanced randomization (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1) so that the majority of subjects receive the vaccine candidate [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00998)]. Alternative approved antiSARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulation for comparison was not available at the start of phase III clinical trials of the EpiVacCorona vaccine; therefore, in our trials, we reduced the number of volunteers in the control group by a factor of three compared to the vaccine candidate group (3:1), which was approved by the ethics committee. The predictive effectiveness of the vaccine was assumed at 70%. For vaccine effectiveness estimation, we assumed a power of 80% for 95 percent confidence intervals ( = 0.05). The attack rate was estimated in accordance with the weekly data on COVID-19 cases in the Russian Federation obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center \u00ab [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)(accessed on 23 November 2020)\u00bb Based on these assumptions, the sample size for calculating the vaccine effectiveness for cohort studies was estimated at 1640 people, with 407 in unvaccinated control group and 1233 in vaccinated group [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00998)]. [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00998-f001)); this far exceeds the calculated cohort size. After signing informed consent forms, the 2999 volunteers were allocated into groups at a 3:1 ratio. Group 1 consisted of 2253 subjects vaccinated intramuscularly with two doses of EpiVacCorona (0.5 mL each dose), and Group 2 involved 746 subjects vaccinated intramuscularly with two doses of placebo (0.5 mL each dose). 2.2. Vaccine and Placebo [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00998), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00998), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00998), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00998)]. An original algorithm was used to design peptides potentially capable of eliciting a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This investigation included analyzing the spatial structure of coronavirus S protein, reviewing and summarizing the data on linear and conformational epitopes as well as their properties, studying the amino acid variability of coronavirus S protein, identifying potential surface-exposed regions in the S-protein structure, and analyzing the amino acid composition of the bound to synthetic peptides forms nanoparticles with a diameter of 30 nm. Aluminum hydroxide is a vaccine ingredient acting as an adjuvant. 2.3. Physical Examination and Clinical Laboratory Procedures 2.4. Safety Assessment 2.5. Detecting Coronavirus RNA in Nasopharyngeal Swabs 2.6. ELISA Kits for Quantifying Serum Antibodies 2.7. Quantification of Virus-Neutralizing Antibodies in the Neutralization Assay [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00998)] with some modifications. 2.8. Statistical Analysis [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00998), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00998)]. 3. Results 3.1. Information about the Study Subjects 3.2. Safety and Reactogenicity of the EpiVacCorona Vaccine [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00998)]. [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00998-t001)). [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00998)]. The local reactions were classified as mild and were not accompanied by worsening of the volunteer's wellbeing. The severity of systemic reactions was assessed with allowance for acceptable reactions (elevated body temperature, fatigue, and headache). No statistically significant intergroup differences in the analyzed parameters were revealed during the entire follow-up period. [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00998-f002)summarizes the data on local and systemic reactions observed in the study groups. 3.3. Immunologic Effectiveness of the EpiVacCorona Vaccine [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00998-f003)). 3.4. Prophylactic Efficacy of the EpiVacCorona Vaccine [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00998)]. Therefore, the prophylactic efficacy was calculated using the data on COVID-19 incidence after the vaccination series had been completed and the antiviral immunity had developed (day 21 after the second vaccination or day 42 after the first vaccination). COVID-19 cases confirmed by laboratory analysis for detecting SARS-CoV-2 markers were included in the calculations. [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00998-t002)). Volunteers for whom there were protocol violations during the clinical trial (such as non-compliance with the inclusion criteria, meeting the exclusion or withdrawal criteria), as well as volunteers who had been vaccinated with other vaccines or decided to withdraw from the clinical trials, were excluded from calculations. A total of 202 volunteers were excluded from preventive efficacy calculations, including 97 placebo recipients and 105 volunteers who had received the vaccine. Laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus infection documented starting day 42 after the initiation of the vaccination series were taken into account for assessing the preventive efficacy of the vaccine. [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00998)], where OR = (a/b)/(c/d). [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00998-t002)). [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00998-f003)); therefore, the preventive efficacy of the vaccine started to be detected even before vaccination completion. [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00998-f004)shows the pattern of changes in the COVID-19 incidence rate after the completion of the vaccination series. The trend of increasing percentage of infected individuals demonstrates that the vaccine remained efficacious during the entire follow-up period, up to day 180. [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00998-f005). [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00998-t002). 4. Discussion [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00998)]. Our unpublished data in serum antibodies of non-human primates vaccinated with EpiVacCorona indicated significant ADCC against target VeroE6 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Real-time ADCC measurement was carried out using an xCelligence DP cell analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00998)]. NVX-CoV2373 is stored at 2-8 \u00b0C. The effectiveness of this vaccine against infection with the original version of SARS-CoV-2 reached 95.6% [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00998)]. In another study of adults who received two doses of this vaccine, the percentage of protection was 89.7% [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00998)]. CoronaVac (Sinovac) is a -propiolactone inactivated COVID-19 [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00998)], developed on Vero cells, adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide [ [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is given in two doses (0.5 mL) 14 days apart [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00998), [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00998)]. CoronaVac is 83.5% effective compared to a placebo in protecting recipients from symptomatic COVID-19 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine among recipients aged 18-59 years [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00998)]. The Sinopharm vaccine (BBIBP) is an inactivated vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 virus [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00998)]. This vaccine is propagated in Vero cells with subsequent inactivation with -propionolactone. The resulting inactivated viruses are then combined with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant to increase immunogenicity [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is given in two doses with 3 weeks interval. It can be stored at normal temperature in a refrigerator [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00998)]. The efficacy of the BBIBP vaccine reached 78.1% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 112 days after both doses. The Janssen vaccine (the Johnson and Johnson vaccine) is an adenovirus vector vaccine based on the human adenovirus type 26 [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00998)]. Janssen vaccine is administered as a single dose and can be stored for approximately 2 years at 20 \u00b0C or up to 3 months at 2-8 \u00b0C [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00998)]. Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to be 66.3% effective in clinical trials in participants not infected with COVID-19. Maximum protection was observed 2 weeks after vaccination [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00998)]. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is produced using a non-replicating recombinant vector based on a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx) [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is stored at a temperature of 2-8 \u00b0C. This vaccine is administered in two doses 12 weeks apart or more. The effectiveness of the vaccine reaches 82.4% after the second dose [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00998)]. The ZyCoV-D vaccine contains a circular plasmid DNA that encodes the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is administered in three doses via a needleless injector [ [49](#B49-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is stored at 2-8 \u00b0C. The effectiveness of the ZyCoV-D vaccine in clinical trials was 67% [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00998)]. The Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273) is a liquid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine encoding the S protein. The Moderna vaccine is administered in two doses 28 days apart. A booster dose can also be given 6 months after the second dose [ [50](#B50-vaccines-11-00998)]. Moderna vaccine should be stored in cold conditions at 25 to 15 \u00b0C. After thawing, the vaccine should be kept at 2 to 8 \u00b0C for 30 min to 2 h [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00998), [52](#B52-vaccines-11-00998)]. Vaccine efficacy in the age range of 18-65 is 95.6% [ [50](#B50-vaccines-11-00998)]. Moderna vaccine causes unpleasant side effects such as pain and swelling of the arm at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea [ [53](#B53-vaccines-11-00998)]. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) is an mRNA vaccine lipid The Pfizer vaccine encodes SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00998)]. Vaccines are stored at a low temperature of 70 \u00b0C, and providing such conditions is a challenge [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is given in two doses 21 days apart, up to 42 days allowed [ [56](#B56-vaccines-11-00998)]. The effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19, measured 28 days after the first dose, reaches 95%. CureVac (CVnCoV) is another mRNA-based vaccine. This vaccine is similar to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines and encodes the coronavirus S-protein [ [57](#B57-vaccines-11-00998)]. Depending on the ambient temperature, the stability of this vaccine is more flexible, with a shelf life of at least 3 months at +5 \u00b0C [ [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00998)]. The vaccine is given in two doses 29 days apart. The efficacy of this mRNA vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 infection is 47%, which is much lower than the other two mRNA vaccines [ [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00998)]. [60](#B60-vaccines-11-00998)]. The use of the proposed techniques will help decisionmaker in the selection process and administration of safe vaccines for the population at large scale.
