A sign reads COVID -19 Vaccine with an arrow. We follow the arrow and walk down a road to a service member directing traffic. Text appears onscreen in response to their questions. [\"Good morning! Do you have appointments today? Yes, you have appointments, very well. Are you both over the age of 18?\"] Yes, we are older than 18. [\"Alright. Do either of you have disability issues, mobility problems or a problem walking?\"] No. [\"Alright. What's going to happen is you're going to go straight forward. The people in orange are going to show you where to park. Once you park, you're going to go into the big tent. Have a lovely day.\"] The scene changes. We follow a line of people walking into a big white tent. A service member hands out masks to people as they enter. [\"Place this over the top of your current mask. Have your barcode re ady. In the tent to your right.\"] We enter the tent and the scene changes. Text onscreen reads, \"All state vaccination sites have language assistance available.\" Inside the tent, we approach service members behind a table. [\"How are you doing ma'am? Can I see your barcode for your appointment?\"] A phone is presented. [\"Ok, if you head down this way, they'll take care of you over there and assign you to a table.\"] We walk to a different area and approach another service member. [\"How are you guys doing, you guys ready, you excited? Alright, so this is going to be super simple. You don't need your barcode anymore, we're just going to go ahead and we're going to pull it up by your phone number. So when you're ready we're going to send you down to lan e one.\"] We walk to a lane with the sign reading, \"Registration: COVID -19 Vaccine Site, Table 1.\" A service member is seated at a table and types into a laptop. Text appears onscreen in response to their questions. [\"Hi, good morning. Can I get the phone n umber you registered with? Can I get you to verify your name and date of birth? Is this your first dose?\"] Yes. [\"Are you experiencing any COVID symptoms today?\"] No. [\"Have you been exposed to anybody with COVID in the last 14 days?\"] No. WHAT TO EXPECT: VISITING A COVID -19 STATE VACCINATION SITE (AUDIO DESCRIPTION ) TRANSCRIPT 2 [\"Here is some i nformation on the vaccine if you'd like to take one with you and she'll let you know where to go.\"] We pick up a vaccine fact sheet from the table and approach the next service member in a larger space with tables and guards. [\"Hello ma'am, good morning. If you could follow me.\"] We follow the service member to a table, where another service member is seated next to a laptop and vaccine kit. Text appears onscreen in response to their questions. [\"Can I get you to verify your full name and your date of birth please? I've just got a couple of questions for you real quick, my name is Sean Skinner, I'm going to be giving you your vaccine today. Have you been vaccinated in the last 14 days?\" No. [\"Do you have any cold or flu -like symptoms?\"] No. Additional text appears: You'll also be asked about any allergies or past allergic reactions to vaccines. [\"And then do you have any questions at all?\"] Is it going to hurt? [\"You're probably not going to feel anything . If you do it's going to feel less than a pinch. You can go ahead and expose your left shoulder for me.\"] The scene changes. A band aid is placed on an exposed arm. Text onscreen reads, \"Before you know it, you're done!\" The scene changes back to the service member handing us a vaccination card. [\"So this i s your vaccination card. What you're going to do is you're going to fill out your information up here and you're going to want to make sure that you're going to bring this with you for your second dose. This is where they'll document your second dose at. R ight now, you're going to go - head over there to the observation area behind the black curtain so you're going to wait there for 15 minutes and then you're good to go after that!\"] We pass through the large space with tables and approach a black curtain s ectioning off a separate space. Another service member stands at the entrance. [\"Hey, good morning! Please grab any chair on this side. You're going to time yourself for 15 minutes. Raise your hand if you have any questions, concerns. And when you're done with the 15 minutes, your exit is to the left.\" We enter the portioned space. Recently vaccinated people sit on individual folding chairs that are set up six feet apart throughout the room. The screen fades to black with text reading, \"15 minutes later...\" W e stand from the chair and approach a station with images of \"I Got My Shot\" Minnesota Department of Health branding. Text appears on screen, \"Take a selfie at the Selfie Station! Posit it on social media with #RollUpYourSleevesMN!\" We pass the Selfie Sta tion, exit the doors of the tent, and are outside. Text onscreen reads, \"Schedule a COVID -19 vaccine -431-2053, -7 10 am -6 pm.\" The Stay Safe MN logo appears.
