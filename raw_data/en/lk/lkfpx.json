In 2022 we were finally able to implement initiatives that were held up while the world adjusted to Covid-19. This included launching our \"It's Time to T ake Allergy Seriously\" campaign, created from the voices of people living with allergy through our research activities undertaken the previous year. Amongst all the excellent work captured in this report, the one aspect of Allergy UK's work in this period that has been most exciting to finally see lift off, has been the launch of our Patient Charter, the first patient charter for people living with allergic conditions in the UK. Built around three pillars - the right to education and accurate information, the right to quality care and the right to equality in society - the Charter outlines specific calls for each pillar. It was developed in consultation with patients living with allergy, parents or guardians of children with allergy and leading clinicians from across the UK. Acting on these calls, we believe, will immeasurably improve the diagnosis, care and quality of life of those within the allergic community, because they transcend a specific allergic condition. Similarly, over this past year, we've created an Allergy UK Youth Forum, to ensure that, as an organisation, we are listening to the voices of young people. In doing so we can better understand the lived experience of those transitioning from paediatric care to adult care, where we know there can be gaps in support. Our Youth Forum supports and informs the work that Allergy UK will need to undertake to support tomorrow's generation. Both initiatives represent an interesting inflection in Allergy UK's history. Both depart from addressing the here and now of living with an allergy, which often forms the core of much of our services. Both are also optimistic in their purpose and are rooted in a belief that it is possible for there to be a future where our society no longer marginalises those living with allergic conditions, and our healthcare system is suitably designed to support the multifaceted needs of people living with allergies. Until then, as this impact report hopefully demonstrates, Allergy UK will continue to passionately champion the voice and needs of the allergic community. Our work would not be possible without the support and generosity of those who engage with our charity, whether through volunteering, donations, taking part in fundraising challenges and events, or through grants and sponsorship. We thank you all for your on-going support and for working with us to ensure that the UK takes allergy seriously. Carla Jones, CEO Impact Report 22/233 54K1 in 3 people in the UK have one or more allergic conditionsThe year in numbers followers across social media476 children helped through our Dietitian service 6,298 Helpline contacts531K sessions301K downloads/views of free online patient resourcesImpact Report 22/234 Allergy UK is the only patient organisation that supports all areas of allergic disease, covering respiratory, skin, food, eye, venom and drug allergies, including anaphylaxis. We continue to play a vital role in providing information, advice and support, based on up-to-date evidence on best practice, for people affected by allergic disease and their wider families and social networks. The breadth of our work is extensive.Our vision and mission Our vision is 'no one should die from allergy' . We believe in our vision that 'no one should die from allergy' - and we will continue to work towards this and provide support for all those living with allergy in the UK. Over the past year, we have become more actively engaged in campaigning, advocacy and lobbying to change legislation. However, despite our dedicated efforts and hard work, we clearly have a lot more work to do. No one should die of an allergy because of a misunderstanding of this disease and a lack of wide-scale public knowledge. Our new campaign 'It's time to take allergy seriously' is intended to shine a light on the debilitating challenges and fatal consequences that can come with living with allergy. The long-term campaign will focus on raising awareness of the lived reality of those who are affected by allergies across the whole spectrum; respiratory, drug, food and skin. Its aim is ultimately to instigate a shift away from a singular individual responsibility of the allergic person towards a more collective, public responsibility for managing allergy. We believe this is only truly possible, once all corners of the UK - from the public to the healthcare system, government, business, schools and universities - start to take allergy seriously.Our mission is to ensure 'everyone in the UK takes allergy seriously'.

More services are needed to support sufferers and to give GPs more power and tools to deal with allergies\"Impact Report 22/237 The research was instrumental in helping Allergy UK develop its Patient Charter for people who live with allergic disease. Launched in May 2022, the Patient Charter reflects the needs of the community based on insights from clinicians, callers to our Helpline, focus groups with individuals and families of those living with allergies as well as the 2021 research study. Our research pointed to a need for the Patient Charter coalesces around three rights: Our research helps us better understand the impact allergic disease has on those living with it. Our learning is used to inform the services we provide, the public awareness campaigns we undertake and the overall strategy for the organisation. In June 2021, Allergy UK commissioned a two-part research programme to better understand the realities of living with an allergic disease. Speaking to 7000 people in the UK - from the allergic community as well as those who do not live with allergies - it also sought to gain an insight into how well the public understood and recognised allergies and patients' experiences of this. These three pillars define the key calls within the Patient Charter and will determine the strategy and direction for Allergy UK's influencing work over the next few years. The Right to a Quality Standard of Care The Right to Accurate Information and Education The Right to Equality in SocietyThe findings informed the development of Allergy UK's new long-term campaign It's Time To T ake Allergy Seriously which launched in April 2022. The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of the challenges associated with living with an allergy, across the whole spectrum of allergic conditions. It seeks to shift public perceptions of allergy and the needs of those who live with an allergy. The launch focused on the psychological impact of living with allergic disease to reflect findings from the research. Understanding the provision of allergy services In July 2022, NHS England replaced the bodies previously responsible for commissioning healthcare services in their region - GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups - with 42 Integrated Care Systems (ICS). Within each ICS, there is an Integrated Care Board (ICB), and it is now the responsibility of each ICB to commission clinical services for their region according to population needs. One area of clinical service commissioning for which an ICB is responsible is allergy services. To this end, in late March 2023, Allergy UK made a Freedom of Information Request to the 42 NHS England ICBs to understand what data was held on allergy services and patients in their region. The aim of the request was to better understand the existing provision of allergy services within the ICB and the scale of need within each region. With answers due mid-April 2023, the findings will influence Allergy UK discussions with policymakers and health bodies on the provision of allergy services in 2023/24. Impact Report 22/238 In 2022/23 the results of the Allergy UK funded research of a nurse-led allergy clinic were published. Conducted between 2017-2021, the research was led by the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian. The purpose of the project was to evaluate the efficacy of a nurse-led allergy clinic in primary care. The clinic was set up to assess the feasibility of introducing an intermediary service in primary care, addressing the gaps in the provision of allergy services and, to measure the acceptability of the service for patients, their families and the healthcare professionals referring into the service. In conclusion, the clinic was well received and reduced unnecessary referrals onto secondary care. Of those referred into the service, 90% of healthcare professionals stated that they would have referred the patient onto secondary care had the clinic not been available, and only 5% of patients who attended the clinic were referred, improving patient pathways and reducing costs in secondary care.Allergy nurse research project The project ran between 2017-2021 and the results were published August 2022 in Clinical and Translational Allergy . A spotlight on the nurse led allergy service was also published in the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) update in Summer 2022 , eliciting invitations to talk on the project at allergy conferences, including the BSACI and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). This research project has informed our discussions with key health policymakers on alternatives to current patient pathways, for those living with allergic conditions. It has also been central to the Patient Charter call for The Right to a Quality Standard of Care. of patients saw an improvement in their symptoms and how they were managed. \" Allergy patients are needlessly receiving inadequate support on diagnosing and managing their allergies because our healthcare system is not suitably set up to support them. Allergy knowledge and, therefore, good clinical advice at primary care level is a postcode lottery. With 1 in 3 adults now living with an allergy and a paucity of specialist allergy services, Allergy UK's evidence-based solution of introducing one specialist allergy nurse and a dietitian within each ICB will mean patients can access the right clinical advice much more quickly delivering better patient outcomes. \" Margaret Kelman, acting Head of Clinical Services at Allergy UK and one of the nurses involved in the allergy nurse research project.Impact Report 22/239 \"Without Allergy UK we would have been stuck and unknowingly making my daughter's allergy worse. Cannot thank you enough, you are doing a fantastic job. \"EmpoweringImpact Report 22/2310 Our Helpline service supports everyone affected by allergy. It has been running for 32 years and, in that time, has grown and developed to meet the ever-changing needs of the allergic community. The number of people contacting our Helpline grew by over 40% from 4487 in 2021/22, to 6298 this year. Over the last two years, we have seen an increase in calls relating to the emotional impact of living with allergy. The social changes and isolation impact from the pandemic, and the limited access to face- to-face health support, may have contributed to this change. These callers are listened to by our Helpline team, signposted to our in-house Clinical team and, if needed, directed to mental health charities or back to their GP . Since 2022, we have been monitoring the number of callers presenting with emotional or mental health concerns. The data captured indicates that over a third of callers are expressing anxiety, depression, frustration, isolation or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Allergy UK is in discussions with clinical experts in Our Helpline the psycho-social aspects of allergy about ways to support these callers. Our Clinical team and CEO are involved in various guideline developments for healthcare professionals, at national and European level, on how to support the psycho-social needs of patients living with allergy. We have also worked with PhD research students who are looking at Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approaches to support the emotional impact of living with allergy. As the impacts of the stretched health service unfolded, we began recording the volume of calls associated with the practical aspects of living with allergy, such as GP wait times and access to treatments. 1155 of the contacts in 2022/23 were related to these aspects. 2022/23 2021/22vs \" As a first-time mum the situation did cause distress and anxiety but the help and support we received from Allergy UK was fantastic - thank you so much for all your help. \"0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500Online F support for adults Adults contacting our Helpline present with a wide range of queries. Our Helpline service is not limited to only supporting individuals living with allergic conditions; the team also advises employers, family members and healthcare professionals with queries and how to best support the allergic community. Our records show us that the number of callers enquiring about adults allergies increased by 25% this year, to a total of 3216 contacts. The number of adults living with allergies seeking information on private referrals or experiencing issues with being referred on the NHS also increased compared to previous years. T ypes of calls by adults with allergy: Our translation cards allow people with allergies to travel abroad with confidence by helping them effectively communicate their allergies in another language. We offer cards in 35 languages. This service was significantly impacted by Covid-19, when international travel was largely suspended and only started to recover from summer 2022. In 2022/23, we issued 1643 sets of cards. This is an increase of 828% compared to the previous year when Covid-19 was still having an impact on international travel. During this period, we implemented the first price rise in twenty years. This was due to the rising costs of materials. We also offered and promoted PDF cards as a more affordable option.Translation cards35% food allergy eczema 16% anaphylaxis calls seeking information on private referrals or experiencing issues with being referred on the NHScalls had issues with accessing treatment through the NHScalls were due to mental health issues related to their allergies9% annual rhinitis 6% other 4% urticariaImpact Report 22/2312 \" A year ago, with my newborn, I had no idea what cow's milk protein allergy was and how to navigate the NHS to get the help I needed, in my sleep deprived state. I called the Helpline several times and every time the person on the line was so patient, gentle and helpful. It meant so much to me as a new mum and I have now passed this website onto my friend who suspects her daughter may have an allergy. Thank you for your help. It meant so much to me. \"When a parent or carer contacts our Helpline about their child's allergies, usually they have already spoken to a range of healthcare professionals and not found the support they need. Contacting our Helpline is often the beginning of a parent's journey to finding the correct treatment plan for their child. This year, our records show us that we helped 1,918 families find the right support for their child. Compared to last year, this is a growth of more than 20%. Support included: Guiding callers through the NHS system Finding a private practitioner e.g. an allergist or a dietitian Referring to our in-house dietitian, eczema nurse service or external Dietitian Service, anaphylaxis Our Helpline team also signposts callers to the comprehensive range of information produced by our in- house Clinical team, such as Factsheets, videos and podcasts, to help parents understand and manage their children's condition at home. The number of callers expressing psychological distress over their child's allergies corresponds with the number of contacts about anaphylaxis. These contacts usually require a lot of sensitivity, as parents are calling us at a time of great anxiety.T ypes of calls about children with allergy:Impact Report 22/2313 Our external Dietitian Service, with funding from Nutricia and Abbot, has been running for eight years, offering one-to-one appointments for under-fives with a paediatric dietitian. In this time, the service has supported 1679 families with allergic children. Extra funding in 2022/23 enabled us to increase support from four to seven appointments a week, supporting 235 families, 10% more than was possible in 2021/22. For those parents struggling to get any kind of dietetic support, in a post-pandemic healthcare system, the service is invaluable. Our external Dietitian Service consistently receives unsolicited feedback, praising the work it does and the difference it has made to the children and families it has supported.Dietitian Service Children seen by our in- house dietitianChildren received 'external' dietitian advice \"T alking with you was such a relief as I felt like I was able to take some kind of first step to finding out what the issues are for my child and how we can deal with them.

Intolerance reactions are usually delayed, occurring several hours and sometimes up to several days after eating the offending food. Allergy UK Helpline Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm: 02/25 Version 1 1This factsheet has been written to help you understand more about cow's milk allergy in adults. Information on cow's milk allergy in babies and younger children can be found in the following factsheet: Does my child have a cow's milk allergy? (a detailed guide on suspected cow's milk in babies and children). How common is cow's milk allergy? Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies to affect babies and young children. Most children will have outgrown their allergy to milk by the time they reach school age (around 5 years of age). In a small number of people who do not outgrow their allergy to cow's milk it will persist into adulthood. Where this happens, people are more likely to experience more severe allergic reactions. The sudden development of an allergy to cow's milk as an adult can happen but is very rare and as a result there has been little research carried out about it and why it might occur. What is the difference between cow's milk allergy and intolerance? There is a lot of confusion around what is an allergy or intolerance. Cow's milk allergy is an abnormal response by the body's immune (defence) system in which proteins in a food (in this case casein and whey proteins in cow's milk) are recognised as potentially harmful. There are two main types: Immediate allergy (IgE mediated) is quick to appear and caused by the immunoglobulin E antibody. T ypically, these allergic symptoms happen within minutes of consuming cow's milk or up to two hours afterwards. This type of reaction is described as IgE mediated food allergy. This is the most common type in adults. In some adults with mild IgE-mediated milk allergy, a period of prolonged and strict avoidance may result in the allergy becoming more severe.Y our quick guide to:Cow's Milk Allergy in Adults Allergy UK is the operational name of The British Allergy Foundation, a charitable company limited by guarantee and registered in England and Wales, Company no: 4509293, Charity no: 1094231. Registered in Scotland. Charity no: SCO39257.If you have any comments about this Factsheet, contact Allergy UK on info@allergyuk.org. The guidance in this Factsheet is based on current best practice and may be subject to change in the light of new relevant information.Delayed allergy (non IgE mediated) is slow to appear and caused by a different part of the immune system reacting in a different way. This type of reaction is described as Non-IgE mediated food allergy but it is less common in adults. The symptoms typically develop from two hours after consumption but can take up to 72 hours. If cow's milk continues to be consumed in the diet, the immune system will continue to produce such symptoms over days or even weeks. Intolerance reactions do not involve IgE antibodies or the immune system. The most common mechanism for a milk intolerance is due to the milk sugar lactose. Reactions are usually delayed, occurring several hours and sometimes up to several days after eating the offending food. The symptoms caused by these reactions are usually gut symptoms, such as bloating, diarrhoea, constipation and IBS. For more on lactose intolerance, this is explained later in the factsheet. How do you know if it is a delayed milk allergy or intolerance? The answer is that this can be difficult to work out without a healthcare professional to look at a history of all your symptoms. In simple terms, if you have developed symptoms as you have got older and your symptoms are more delayed then an intolerance is more likely. It is not uncommon for some people to think they have a cow's milk allergy when cow's milk in the diet causes unwanted symptoms often affecting the gut for example bloating and wind. Some people report having increased mucus and/or a cough after having milk in their diet this is not a symptom of cow's milk allergy and is related to the texture of the milk rather that the milk causing an increase in mucus being made. Many people can develop symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose may be one of many foods that helps to alleviate symptoms.

Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies to affect babies and young children in the United Kingdom. While it mostly affects formula fed babies, breast fed babies can also be affected. Allergic symptoms can happen immediately after feeding or they can be delayed, as explained below. What is a Cow's Milk Allergy? It is an abnormal response by the body's immune (defence) system in which proteins in a food (in this case cow's milk) are recognised as potentially harmful. In individuals whose immune system has made this mistake, the immune system becomes 'sensitised'. This means that the next time that cow's milk is consumed , the immune system remembers this protein may be harmful and may react to it by producing allergic symptoms. Are there different types of Cow's Milk Allergy? There are two types of cow's milk allergy depending on how the immune system reacts. Symptoms that are 'immediate' (quick to appear) are caused by the immunoglobulin E antibody (called IgE). T ypically these allergic symptoms happen within minutes of consuming cow's milk or up to two hours afterwards. This type of reaction is described as IgE mediated food allergy. The other type of milk allergy happens when symptoms are 'delayed' (slow to appear) and are caused by a different part of the immune system reacting in a different way. This type of reaction is described as Non-IgE mediated food allergy and is the most common type. The symptoms typically develop from two hours after consumption but can take up to 72 hours. If cow's milk continues to be consumed in the diet, the immune system will continue to produce such symptoms Y our quick guide to:Does my child have a Cow's Milk Allergy?

How quickly or slowly symptoms appear will help to identify the type of reaction. With delayed symptoms the diagnosis is more difficult to make. It is rare but possible to have a combination of both immediate (IgE) and delayed (Non-IgE) symptoms. Are there other types of reactions to cow's milk? Cow's milk is made up of three main ingredients - protein, sugar and fat. In cow's milk allergy, it is the proteins called casein and whey that usually cause the problem. However, the sugar (lactose) in milk can also cause symptoms in some. This is referred to as Lactose Intolerance. It is important to understand the difference between lactose intolerance and cow's milk allergy and to be aware that the management of lactose intolerance is very different from that of cow's milk allergy. There are two types of lactose intolerance. Primary Lactose Intolerance is the more common form and happens where there are reduced levels of the enzyme lactase in the digestive system. This enzyme is needed to break down lactose sugar found in milk, which the body can then absorb and use. As young children grow up and drink less milk, the amount of this enzyme gradually and naturally decreases. For some children, especially those from Asian or African ethnic backgrounds, this may mean that over time not all the lactose in the diet is broken down. Very gradually tummy symptoms begin to develop when lactose in milk is consumed. These symptoms may include bloating, tummy pains, wind and very loose poos (diarrhoea) - all of which can also be seen in milk allergy. However, this does not usually happen until later in childhood and is very unlikely to occur in young babies, which is the group most likely to show symptoms of cow's milk allergy.

Chickpeas are also known as garbanzo bean and gram Peanut and soya are part of the legume family There are over 20 different types of beans Allergy UK Helpline Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm: review: 09/25 Version 1 1Legumes are a group of foods that belong to the Fabaceae family and include beans, lentils, pulses, peas, lupin, fenugreek, soya, and peanut. Individuals with legume allergy may need to avoid only one legume or may have reactions to other legumes. People with a peanut and/or soya allergy do not automatically need to avoid all other legumes. Please refer to our factsheets on peanut and soya here. More attention has been given to legumes because of the rising trend of plant-based vegetarian and vegan diets. Legumes are a dietary staple in these diets and present with many nutritional benefits. Increased consumption and use of legumes in foods may be one reason why reports of legume allergy are on the rise. How common is legume allergy? There is significant variation in legume allergy across different countries, likely due to cultural diversity and dietary habits. In the UK, peanut is the legume most often causing symptoms. In other countries, such as India, lentils and chickpeas are a staple food and allergy is commonly reported whereas lupin allergy is seen frequently in European countries such as France, and in Norway, due to the addition of lupin to bread, in place of soya flour. In Spain, legume allergy is the fifth most common food allergy for children under five years. Lupin, peanut, and soya must be clearly labelled on food packaging as they are three of the 14 allergens required to be listed by law. Unfortunately, there is no requirement for other legumes. It is thought that legumes are the next most common group outside the main allergens, although there is limited research to date. Symptoms of legume allergy Like other food allergens, the symptoms of legume allergy can present as mild such as itching, hives or vomiting to more life-threatening reactions that affect breathing and circulation that require an adrenalin autoinjector (anaphylaxis).

Legumes can be found in a wide range of foods. Some common foods include: Vegetarian food and plant-based meat alternatives (vegetarian sausages, burgers, sauces) Processed meats (sausages, burgers, hotdogs, scotch eggs) Gluten and free from free foods (gram, pea and bean flours used in bread products, pastry, breadcrumbs, batter. Lentil and pea used as pasta substitute) Baking mixes and baked goods Cereals Sauces Salads Alternative milk products such as milk, cheese, yoghurts Hummus Falafel Crisps/snacks Soups Chinese cuisine such as stir fries and fried rice Indian cuisine such as dahl and bhaajis Mexican cuisine such as chilli, burritos and enchiladas Mediterranean dishes such as cassoulet The increase in pea protein in food and drink manufacturing has increased in recent years as manufacturers respond to consumer interest in plant-based and high- protein foods and sustainable diets. T ypes of legumes There are various foods that fall under the legume 'umbrella'; however, many are not part of the 14 main allergens which means food manufacturers do not have to highlight legumes as a potential allergen in an ingredients list. This can make it particularly difficult to identify and time consuming when reading food labels. It is important to read the ingredients list carefully every time even if you have had the product before. Legumes can be found in a wide range of foods, most commonly in vegetarian food and plant-based meat alternatives Visit us at: www.allergyuk.org or call our Helpline: 01322 619 898 Key facts: Immediate allergy (IgE mediated) is the most common type of milk allergy in adults Allergy testing for immediate reactions to cow's milk can be done by a blood test and/or a skin prick test. Intolerance reactions are usually delayed, occurring several hours and sometimes up to several days after eating the offending food. Allergy UK Helpline Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm: 02/25 Version 1 1This factsheet has been written to help you understand more about cow's milk allergy in adults. Information on cow's milk allergy in babies and younger children can be found in the following factsheet: Does my child have a cow's milk allergy? (a detailed guide on suspected cow's milk in babies and children). How common is cow's milk allergy? Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies to affect babies and young children. Most children will have outgrown their allergy to milk by the time they reach school age (around 5 years of age). In a small number of people who do not outgrow their allergy to cow's milk it will persist into adulthood. Where this happens, people are more likely to experience more severe allergic reactions. The sudden development of an allergy to cow's milk as an adult can happen but is very rare and as a result there has been little research carried out about it and why it might occur. What is the difference between cow's milk allergy and intolerance? There is a lot of confusion around what is an allergy or intolerance. Cow's milk allergy is an abnormal response by the body's immune (defence) system in which proteins in a food (in this case casein and whey proteins in cow's milk) are recognised as potentially harmful. There are two main types: Immediate allergy (IgE mediated) is quick to appear and caused by the immunoglobulin E antibody. T ypically, these allergic symptoms happen within minutes of consuming cow's milk or up to two hours afterwards. This type of reaction is described as IgE mediated food allergy. This is the most common type in adults. In some adults with mild IgE-mediated milk allergy, a period of prolonged and strict avoidance may result in the allergy becoming more severe.Y our quick guide to:Cow's Milk Allergy in Adults Allergy UK is the operational name of The British Allergy Foundation, a charitable company limited by guarantee and registered in England and Wales, Company no: 4509293, Charity no: 1094231. Registered in Scotland. Charity no: SCO39257.If you have any comments about this Factsheet, contact Allergy UK on info@allergyuk.org. The guidance in this Factsheet is based on current best practice and may be subject to change in the light of new relevant information.Delayed allergy (non IgE mediated) is slow to appear and caused by a different part of the immune system reacting in a different way. This type of reaction is described as Non-IgE mediated food allergy but it is less common in adults. The symptoms typically develop from two hours after consumption but can take up to 72 hours. If cow's milk continues to be consumed in the diet, the immune system will continue to produce such symptoms over days or even weeks. Intolerance reactions do not involve IgE antibodies or the immune system. The most common mechanism for a milk intolerance is due to the milk sugar lactose. Reactions are usually delayed, occurring several hours and sometimes up to several days after eating the offending food. The symptoms caused by these reactions are usually gut symptoms, such as bloating, diarrhoea, constipation and IBS. For more on lactose intolerance, this is explained later in the factsheet. How do you know if it is a delayed milk allergy or intolerance? The answer is that this can be difficult to work out without a healthcare professional to look at a history of all your symptoms. In simple terms, if you have developed symptoms as you have got older and your symptoms are more delayed then an intolerance is more likely. It is not uncommon for some people to think they have a cow's milk allergy when cow's milk in the diet causes unwanted symptoms often affecting the gut for example bloating and wind. Some people report having increased mucus and/or a cough after having milk in their diet this is not a symptom of cow's milk allergy and is related to the texture of the milk rather that the milk causing an increase in mucus being made. Many people can develop symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose may be one of many foods that helps to alleviate symptoms.

Allergy alerts: Sometimes, we are informed by the Food Standards Agency or a food retailer of missing or incorrect allergen information on food products. We alert the public via our website, social media and directly by emails from our database, which are sent to individuals who opt-in to hear about specific food allergens.

It can be associated with increased anxiety, low self-esteem and poor mental health. Research has highlighted that more support is needed in this area which instigated Parent Pathways, our project to develop a digital hub of information for parents and carers of children living with allergy. Launched in March 2023, this resource is aimed at parents/carers of children between the ages of five and 25, who are living with any type of allergy, including food, hay fever, asthma and eczema. It takes parents/carers on a journey through each stage of transition, which is broken down by age range. It explores the common challenges that a child could face within each transitional phase and provides information, advice and resources to help parents/carers to support their child to learn to live independently with their allergies. Parent Pathways The hub launched with three key topics for each age group and received 100 views within its first week of launch. Parent Pathways will continue to evolve over the coming year, with new topics being introduced such as managing anxiety for five to 11 year olds, social responsibility at secondary school, starting university and travelling.

One of the main activities of our trading subsidiary is a programme of product endorsements, through which independent testing provides information on products that may be of benefit to people living with allergy. There are two product endorsements schemes run by Allergy Research Ltd, whose awards are utilised worldwide and recognised globally: The Seal of Approval Award is for products which have been independently, scientifically tested to prove they either contain a significantly reduced allergen content or that they reduce the presence of allergens in the indoor environment and have been proven to be suitable for people affected by allergy. Seal of Approval and Allergy Friendly Product Award BRITISH ALLERGY FOUNDATION ALLERGY UK SEAL OF APPROVALThe Allergy Friendly Product Award is for products which are 'unlikely or less likely to cause a reaction' and 'may be of benefit' when used by someone affected by allergy. These products are assessed based on their formulation and benefit. Through our online product directory , we signpost visitors to products that are of greater benefit to those who live with allergies, compared to other products available on the market. We currently have 221 live licences for product endorsements, covering a vast range and variety of product types from household and cleaning products, to appliances and skincare products, and many more. We had 218 annual licence renewals in 2022, which is a testament to the value the endorsement holders are gaining from working with us. The number of product endorsement licences is on track to increase for 2023.

They are considered a major indoor aeroallergen all over the world that precipitate allergic reactions including rhinoconjunctivitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and allergic asthma (Okasha 2021). Interestingly, it is not the creature itself, but the droppings that cause the allergy, which continues even after the mite has died. We still have a lot to learn about HDM and its place in allergic disease, as well as its impact on the allergic proteins within the body -and therefore how it causes such issues for a tiny creature (Fan Xu 2021) What is it? House Dust Mite is a tiny creature measuring around 0.25mm and therefore invisible to the naked eye. They thrive in warm, humid environments rich in human skin scales, as they eat these once they have been partially digested by moulds. They are normal in the human habitat, as we like homes which are warm and comfortable - and aren't a problem for everyone. We can never completely eradicate house dust mite, but we can minimise their numbers and impact for those sensitive to them. HDM is one of the major perennial allergens for both allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma (Calderon 2015), and one of the most common triggers in the home environment. It can also be one of the most common eczema triggers (Allergy UK 2022). It is particularly problematic because it is often present in homes despite normal cleaning measures, and invisible to the naked eye. They are found everywhere, but particularly in rooms with more soft furnishings such as bedding and upholstery. For this reason they are usually more problematic in the bedroom - causing nocturnal symptoms. Children will generally present with perennial symptoms (i.e. all year round) which tend to appear at night, or first thing in the morning. They might tell you they cough, and that it wakes them up - or they might say that they cough when they go to bed or first thing in the morning. What is important, is to take a thorough clinical history including family and personal history of atopy, other concurrent conditions and whether the reactions or symptoms are situational or always present. We often find ourselves as specialist clinicians re-taking the histories to understand whether symptoms are seasonal, situational or perennial.

The outcomes from this work will inform a project of work to develop a new schools' training programme for 2024, superseding our current School Allergy Action Group (SAAG) online toolkit. To develop an effective new training programme, during 2022/23, Allergy UK engaged extensively with parents, teachers, support staff and healthcare professionals. This listening exercise enabled us to hear about the experiences, challenges and issues both parents and teachers face. It also identified gaps in knowledge that could be filled by an accessible and comprehensive training programme. Training for schools Some key insights from this exercise highlighted: 80% of teachers surveyed said they need and want more training in allergy. Variation in the quality of care for pupils with allergies, remains a significant concern for pupils, parents and staff. Skills are lacking in how to manage and support a child in an emergency situation. Some parents experiences have been so distressing, children have been withdrawn from their school. Training on adrenaline auto-injectors is given as part of First Aid training, but little else on allergy is included to support the allergic child in their school environment. Impact Report 22/2323 We are in the process of developing a comprehensive food allergy awareness training programme for food hospitality businesses, which is online, interactive and draws on real-life examples, taking a pragmatic approach. Its purpose is to provide high-quality allergy training to the catering industry and will be hosted via the Allergy UK website. Allergy training for this industry supports our mission, for everyone to take allergy seriously, through educating, influencing and empowering the catering industry with better knowledge and support. While also supporting the Allergy UK Strategy for Change 2022-2025 programmes including: Advocacy for the allergy community Quality of life and psychosocial needs of the allergy community Improved allergy food safety Income generationTraining for catering industry Our training work reflects the aims of our Patient Charter to; the right to clear and accurate information needed to make safe food choices, to confidently eat out of home, without fear of allergic reaction the right to live without fear of discrimination, exclusion or prejudice promote a better awareness and understanding of allergy Allergy UK's training programmes will address and, in part, be a solution to the concerning lack of allergy awareness in catering, reported in our 2021 Allergy Perceptions survey and also echoed in the calls we receive through our Helpline.

There is increasing evidence that allergies are associated with anxiety, low self-esteem, isolation and depression in children and young people. Our main objective is to increase self-esteem and develop coping strategies for feelings of isolation and anxiety for children and young people with allergies. Again, this year, we partnered with the national charity Over the Wall to deliver an innovative virtual 'Camp in the Cloud' for families and children living with allergies. At Camp in the Cloud, participants are encouraged to share their experiences with others who live with allergy and participate in activities to develop coping strategies. This year's camp was attended by 48 children and young people. In attendance also, were some of the children's extended families and siblings, taking the number of people online to over 130. The morning session dealt with introductions and ice breakers, whilst the afternoon was all about getting the children to consider what their superhero might look like, as well as their superpowers. The final session in the evening was a quiz and everyone was invited to attend. The camp is a free transformational and therapeutic recreational programme for allergic children and young people and is designed to alleviate mental health and well-being issues. Originally, the camp was delivered in person, but owing to Covid-19, it moved online and has become known as Camp in the Cloud. The February 2023 camp was extremely well received by those in attendance and the key objectives were achieved.

Following the deep-dive research conducted in 2021 to better understand the allergic community's needs, we created a Patient Charter to identify the gold standard of care and rights for the allergic community. Developed in collaboration with clinicians, allergy patients and their families, the Charter was launched at the Houses of Parliament in May 2022. Attended by parliamentarians, the allergic community and clinicians, the event set out the Charter's vision: Click here to visit our Patient Charter hub To achieve a quality standard of care for everyone with allergy throughout the UK. To empower patients with allergic conditions to understand and manage their condition with support from informed healthcare professionals. To promote better awareness and understanding of allergy so that people with allergic conditions are not discriminated against in any aspect of their daily lives. Impact Report 22/2328 Since its launch, the Charter has been used to leverage conversations with and support from parliamentarians on how to translate the vision into action. Over the given period, Allergy UK has secured three additional parliamentarians as new Allergy Champions to bring the total to nine. Their involvement has resulted in two MP visits to the Allergy UK office to meet with members of the allergic community and hear directly how allergies impact lives on a daily basis.Public affairs In this past year, Allergy UK also contributed to policy consultations and recommendations on a wide range of issues, including public schools' catering, vegan food labelling and edible insects and allergy. Through our involvement with coalition groups such as National Voices and the Alliance for Health Conditions in Schools, we ensure that the voice of the allergic community is included in relevant policy consultations and communications where a collective voice is especially impactful. Click here to meet our Parliamentary Allergy Champions Impact Report 22/2329 Allergy UK is a core member of the National Allergy Strategy Group (NASG), a collaboration between the British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI), Allergy UK and Anaphylaxis UK. During 2022/23, the focus of the group has been to further engage with the government in relation to the NASG supported 2021 report 'Meeting the Challenges of the National Allergy Crisis'. As part of this initiative, Allergy UK has been involved in proactive discussions with the Department of Health and Social Care Long Term Conditions team to explore establishing an expert working group to lead on the development of a national strategy for improving allergy services. These discussions are ongoing. In addition, the NASG has sought to engage a wider range of stakeholders in the group to ensure there is a collaborative and aligned approach to proactive advocacy work with government. The NASG supported the launch of Allergy UK's Patient Charter in May 2022. Allergy UK provides in-kind Secretariat support to the NASG, which includes the NASG's in-kind Secretariat role for the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on allergy. National Allergy Strategy Group 29 Impact Report 22/2330 With the field of allergy being so far reaching, Allergy UK believes in the value of collaboration with partner organisations to share best practice, explore one voice solutions and amplify the issues and challenges the allergic communities face. Allergy UK plays an active member role in a number of international organisations, including the World Allergy Organisation (WAO), European Academy of Allergy and Immunology (EAACI), and Diagnosis and Rationale for Action Against Cow's Milk Allergy (DRACMA). Our CEO, Carla Jones, has been on the Board of the European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients' Associations (EFA) for the last five years and is currently the elected President.

In the UK, Allergy UK is proud to work with and influence a number of healthcare professional Collaborative working organisations. These include contributing and presenting at symposiums and conferences for organisations such as the British Dietetic Association (BDA), British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI), Children and Young People's Allergy Network Scotland (CYANS), Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA), Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS), as well as regional allergy groups e.g. Paediatric Allergy Network East Anglia (PANEA). Our clinical expertise is also harnessed by a breadth of healthcare bodies and organisations. Over the last year, our Clinical team has played a vital role in developing updated healthcare professional guidelines on allergic conditions, including immunotherapy for peanut allergy, immunotherapy for house dust mite, cow's milk allergy, eczema and allergic asthma, as well as discussions on approving new medicines with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) committees. We have also leveraged events such as The Free From Show and The Pharmacy Show to engage with new audiences on the work that Allergy UK does to support those living with allergic disease. Organisations we work with: 30 Impact Report 22/2331 The year began with the launch of Allergy UK's new public facing campaign, It's Time to T ake Allergy Seriously. It was supported with paid media activity across digital platforms to begin to identify and understand the motivations and resonance with the public in a data-driven way. With key findings from the research informing the overarching call to action - to take allergy seriously - the emphasis of the launch focused on the under-recognised psychological impact that comes with living with allergies. Having sown the foundations for a national conversation exploring allergies through a mental health and wellbeing lens, towards the end of 2022, the emphasis of the It's Time campaign switched to food allergies. As most of the UK excitedly prepared for social gatherings such as Halloween, Christmas and New Year, many of the 2 million people living with food allergies were approaching it with trepidation. This became the focus of our conversations with media and on Allergy UK's own digital channels, with social media content especially resonating. The average number of those following Allergy UK's social media channels during this period increased by 5.1%, further enhancing the reach and influence of our voice in the social media space. Press and PR As 2022 concluded, the cost-of-living crisis began to bite hard. Our press activity reflected this by highlighting the additional financial penalty paid by the food allergic community, due to the cost of free- from foods and 'may contain' labelling. Reports on the impact of this appeared in The Guardian, The Sun, BBC News, The Sun on Sunday and Hits Radio among others. This post attracted over 350 new followers on Instagram Alongside proactive press outreach, Allergy UK ensured the voice of the allergic community was present in a host of leading national news stories around hay fever, thunderstorms and climate change, mould, the withdrawal of Kenalog injections and pholcodine containing cough medicines as well as the publication of research findings which support the early introduction of peanut in babies to mitigate the risk of developing allergies. Sadly, Allergy UK was also involved in providing comments and insight to press coverage around the tragic cases of fatalities linked to allergies. These included Jess Prinsloo, Celia Marsh, Ruben Bousquet, Awaab Ishak and Owen Carey. Impact Report 22/2332 Allergy UK's social media presence is an invaluable resource for the allergic community. Our platforms aim to provide timely information and allergy news, with the aim of building resonance with those who are living with allergic conditions to better advocate. At Allergy UK, we believe our social channels also enable us to gain a better understanding of the needs of individuals with allergies. This informs our insights into unmet needs and issues which are important to the community. The growth and engagement of our social media presence has shown a significant upward trend, indicating a growing demand for accessible allergy- related information and community support. Particularly noteworthy is the remarkable 21% increase in our Instagram followers over the last year. From April 2022 to March 2023, we have employed a more strategic approach to the social content published to build a more engaged following. Starting with the launch of the It's Time campaign in April 2022, over the course of the last year, our social content has started and supported vital conversations on allergy such as the need to build a base of food allergy allies within the non-allergic Social 477,564 impressionsInstagram Facebook T witter followers 1,123 followers 1,583 followers community, the cost-of-living burden to the allergic community, and the psychological impact and burden of allergies. The result is an ever more engaged community, underscoring our role as the voice of the allergic community and a growing number of followers. Allergy UK continues to manage and moderate a Facebook support group which serves as a forum for those in the allergic community to forge connections and seek peer-to-peer support. 2021/22 2022/23vsImpact Report 22/2333 Fundraising and income generation \"So powerful you are turning an unimaginable tragedy into something positive to save others. Thank you\"Impact Report 22/2334Judith's Wish was our Christmas 2022 fundraising campaign. The campaign tells the story of Ruben Bousquet, the 14-year-old son of Judith, who tragically lost his life during a routine visit to the cinema with his dad in 2019. The campaign sought to educate people about the dangers of severe food allergies, highlight the need to improve the labelling of food and drink products and raised much-needed funding for Allergy UK. Judith's Wish was disseminated digitally to 24,000 people (whose lives have been affected by allergies) across the UK in November 2022. A further 3,000 copies of the campaign leaflet were distributed in England, whilst an additional 1,000 copies were issued in South Wales. On December 1st, 2022, Allergy UK hosted a carol concert to launch the campaign. Up to 160 (virtual and in-person) guests attended to hear the Military Wives Choir (Brompton/Sidcup) perform a medley of festive tunes with some allergy friendly refreshments. Guests of honour included representatives from the Bousquet Family and the London Knights in-line skating hockey team. During the evening, Ruben's former coach Barry delivered a powerful and moving reading of 'Hope Remains', a poem written by Ruben shortly before his death, on the night. Fundraising campaign Judith's Wish was the focus of the day for Allergy UK when we spent an awareness and fundraising day at Bexleyheath shopping centre. Over the course of the day, we collected donations and distributed over 1,000 copies of our Judith's Wish campaign leaflet. To date, Judith's Wish has received donations exceeding our target by over 11%. Our most sincere and heartfelt thanks extend to the Bousquet family, The London Knightz, Molyneux Press, Pandolfinos and all those who have so generously supported this campaign and our other fundraising efforts over the past year. My son suffers with an egg and cashew nut allergy. We follow everything we have been told, check ingredients, inform the chef, or establishment we are looking to purchase from, yet we are let down...constantly. Sadly, people are not fully educated regarding allergies and do not understand nor fully comprehend how dangerous allergies are to every individual in the UK population, affected by this condition. We need to unite to protect our family members and promote the dangers!
