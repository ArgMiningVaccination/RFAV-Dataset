Avoiding [mosquito bites](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/mosquito-bite-avoidance) is a very important part of protecting yourself from yellow fever. See the [yellow fever page](/advice/disease-prevention-advice/yellow-fever) for further information. The yellow fever vaccine protects against yellow fever. After you have received the vaccine you are given a yellow fever vaccine certificate to prove that you have received the vaccine and are protected from infection. This certificate is designed to fit inside your passport, and is valid for life. The vaccine can be recommended for two reasons: - To protect you from being infected when you travel to a country where yellow fever virus occurs. See the individual [country pages](/destinations)for specific information for your destination. - To prevent the international spread of disease between countries. The countries that require proof of vaccination are those where either the disease occurs, or where it could occur because they have the correct mosquito and monkey species that could harbour the infection. Proof of vaccination is most often required for travellers journeying from countries with yellow fever to countries where transmission could occur (and sometimes for travellers transiting through such countries). Yellow Fever Pre-vaccination Checklist The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) and Public Health Scotland (PHS) have produced a yellow fever pre-vaccination checklist that should be completed by all those considering yellow fever vaccine. The pre-vaccination checklist has been produced in interactive PDF format to give users the option of completing and saving the document electronically, instructions on how to download and use the yellow fever pre-vaccination checklist can be found here: Yellow Fever Vaccine Stamaril\u00ae is the yellow fever vaccine that is available in the UK. It is manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur and is made in chicken eggs. The vaccine can be given from 9 months of age, and may be given to infants from 6 months but only in special circumstances. Stamaril\u00ae is a live vaccine, which means that it contains a weakened form of the yellow fever virus. Live vaccines do not cause disease in healthy people but are not suitable for people with an impaired immune system, for example, caused by drug treatment or underlying illness. This is because the weakened viruses can multiply and may cause a yellow fever like disease in these individuals. One dose of yellow fever vaccine provides lifelong protection in most people. A booster dose would only be recommended if you were previously vaccinated in one of the following circumstances: - while pregnant - less than two years old - had a weakened immune system - whilst infected with [HIV](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/hiv-travellers) - before undergoing a bone marrow transplant Contraindications to vaccination There are some people who cannot be given the yellow fever vaccine, these include: - infants less than 6 months of age - an allergy to eggs or chicken proteins - an allergy to a previous dose of yellow fever vaccine - a suppressed immune system due to disease - a suppressed immune system due to medication such as chemotherapy drugs, methotrexate, azathioprine or steroids - a disorder or disease of the thymus gland e.g. myasthenia gravis, Di George syndrome or have had their thymus removed (for any reason) - having a first degree relative who has had a serious complication to the vaccine Cautions Yellow fever vaccination should usually be avoided during pregnancy and when breastfeeding. A healthcare practitioner will discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination in these circumstances. The vaccine can be given to those with [HIV](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/hiv-travellers) infection, but only if their CD4 counts are > 200 and they are stable on treatment. Latex: the tip caps of the prefilled syringes contain a natural rubber latex derivative, which may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals. Side Effects Common Side effects It is common to experience mild side effects after having the yellow fever vaccine such as: - mild fever - headache - joint and muscle pain - nausea and/or vomiting - soreness at the injection site These side effects can occur from the day of vaccination up until 14 days after vaccination and usually last no more than 3 days. Rare side effects Rarely, serious complications occur after receiving the yellow fever vaccine. These are more common in those over 60 years of age. These include: - Yellow fever vaccine associated neurological disease (YEL-AND) is a condition affecting the brain and nervous system, causing symptoms such as confusion and problems with movement and co-ordination. The risk of YEL-AND is estimated as follows: - over 60 years of age = 2.2 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine administered - less than 60 years of age = 0.8 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine administered - Yellow fever vaccine associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) is similar to yellow fever itself with multi organ failure and death in approximately 48% of cases. The risk of YEL-AVD is estimated as follows: - over 60 years of age = 1.2 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine administered - less than 60 years of age = 0.3 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine administered Vaccination in Those Older Than 60 Years of Age If you are 60 years of age or older, you can receive yellow fever vaccine, but only if you are fit and well, understand the risks of vaccination and have a real risk of yellow fever virus at your destination (rather than requiring the vaccine just for certificate purposes). A healthcare practitioner will discuss your risk of disease at your destination and the potential risks of the vaccine, to help you to make an informed decision regarding vaccination. Medical Exemption Certificates A healthcare practitioner will decline to vaccinate you if there is a contraindication to the vaccine and may decline to vaccinate you if the risk of serious vaccine side effects is assessed as being higher than the disease risk. If the risk of disease is deemed low, and you agree, a medical exemption certificate can be issued in these circumstances. - A medical exemption certificate is only valid for one trip. - You must practice strict [mosquito bite avoidance](/advice/general-travel-health-advice/mosquito-bite-avoidance)during travel because you will not have any protection from the vaccine against potential infection. - You must be reassessed on subsequent trips. Avoiding Travel to a Yellow Fever Risk Area If you have a contraindication to the vaccine or the risk of serious side effects is high, and there is a significant risk of contracting yellow fever on your trip you are likely to be advised to cancel or change your travel plans. Healthcare practitioners are not obliged to administer yellow fever vaccine if they believe it unsafe to do so, or it is not required for your trip. If you have any medical conditions, it is best to seek travel advice before you book your trip. If you have recently received the yellow fever vaccine and feel unwell please contact your GP or the [111 service](https://www.nhs24.scot/our-services/111/when-to-phone-111/) if your GP practice is closed. In a medical emergency, when someone is seriously ill and their life is at risk, dial 999.
