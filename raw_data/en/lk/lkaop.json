If you start feeling stuffy after an afternoon outside, it's hard to know if you should head to your local pharmacy for [Claritin](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/best-allergy-medicine/) or a [rapid test](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-home-covid-tests/). According to infectious disease specialists and allergists, allergies and COVID-19 have some symptoms in common, making it hard to tell exactly which culprit is behind your sinus pressure or runny nose. But there are also distinct symptoms that set them apart. It's essential to know how COVID-19 and allergy symptoms differ so you can more accurately determine the root cause of your sickness and create a treatment plan best designed to keep both yourself and others safe. Allergies vs. COVID-19: How to Tell the Difference COVID-19 is an upper respiratory virus primarily spread through cough, sneeze or breath droplets, says Edward Mitre, M.D., an infectious disease doctor and professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. Because of this path of transmission, many symptoms of COVID-19 affect the respiratory system, which can lead to coughing, a sore throat and a runny nose. However, allergies also affect the respiratory system and can cause coughing, a sore throat and runny nose, explains Shawn Nasseri, M.D., a Harvard Medical School-trained ear, nose and throat surgeon in Beverly, Hills, California. \"The main overlapping symptom between allergies and [the COVID-19 variant] omicron is nasal congestion,\" he says. \"When the weather goes back and forth\u2014as it often does in the spring\u2014it can cause nasal obstruction, sinus pressure and sinus pain.\" This reaction can also occur with COVID-19, he adds, but the similarities between allergies and the COVID-19 virus don't end there\u2014tiredness and muscle aches are common with both as well. Fortunately, there are still symptoms that set them apart. Use the chart below to identify their commonalities and distinctions, according to experts. |Symptoms||Allergies||COVID-19| |Sneezing||Yes||No| brain fog||No||Yes| Symptoms of COVID-19 If you aren't sure whether you have allergies or COVID-19, one of the first steps to take is to check your temperature, advises Stephen Thomas, M.D., an infectious disease doctor and professor at Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse, New York. While a fever is a common COVID-19 symptom, you're unlikely to develop a fever from allergies. \"Also, most seasonal allergies will not cause shortness of breath, chest pain or loss of taste and smell,\" adds Dr. Thomas. So if you have any of those symptoms, it's much more likely that you have COVID-19 than allergies. Still, what's tricky about COVID-19 is that it affects people in vastly different ways and to different degrees, adds Dr. Thomas. One person may test positive for COVID-19 and have no symptoms at all. Someone else with the virus may lose their sense of taste and smell while another person may not. A scratchy throat is common for some but not everyone. \"Not all infections are created equal, meaning not everyone gets infected in the same way or has the same amount of virus in their bodies, which can impact their symptoms,\" says Dr. Thomas. \"In addition, not everyone has the same anti-COVID immunity, which is required to fight the virus. People who have not been vaccinated, had two doses of vaccine, had three doses of vaccine or had a natural infection may have different levels of protection from COVID, and this can impact their symptoms.\" Brain fog is another common symptom of COVID-19, and it's one that some people report experiencing even three months after testing positive. So if you're having trouble focusing or thinking clearly, it might be another indicator that you could have the virus. Genetics and someone's general health (including if they have any underlying medical conditions) also affects how COVID-19 symptoms may or may not manifest, adds Dr. Mitre. \"In any case, it should be emphasized that the primary action individuals can take to protect themselves from severe disease and hospitalization is to get vaccinated against COVID,\" he says. Again, COVID-19 affects different people in different ways, but the most common symptoms to be on the lookout for include: - Fever - Chills - Shortness of breath - Coughing - Fatigue - Loss of smell or taste - Brain fog If you have any of these symptoms, all three doctors recommend getting tested for COVID-19, whether through [a rapid test](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/how-to-use-at-home-covid-tests/) or PCR test. \"Knowing if your symptoms are due to COVID is helpful because [if you test positive] you'll then know to self-isolate to protect others and stop it from spreading,\" says Dr. Mitre. This action is especially important, he adds, if you're around people who are elderly or have a compromised immune system. Symptoms of Allergies While a loss of taste or smell and chills are common indicators of COVID-19, [allergies](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/seasonal-allergies/) have their own unique symptoms, too. Sneezing and itchy or watery eyes are two common symptoms of allergies that don't happen with COVID, says Dr. Nasseri. (Coughing is a common COVID-19 symptom, but sneezing is more likely tied to allergies.) Allergies can cause eyes to water or itch or your nose to run because the allergens threaten the immune system, which creates an inflammatory reaction, he explains. Allergens release histamine, a chemical that causes inflammation. This inflammation, in turn, can cause the blood vessels in the eyes to swell and itch. They may also look a little red. When allergens release histamine, this response can lead to feeling fatigued as well. In terms of brain fog, Dr. Nasseri says it can happen with allergies, but the difference is that it doesn't last as long as it can with COVID-19. \"If you spend the day at a friend's house and their cat is causing your allergies to act up, this can cause brain fog. But the brain fog should go away when you go home and are no longer exposed to the cat,\" says Dr. Nasseri. This pattern is in stark contrast to COVID-19-induced brain fog, which can last for months. Below is a list of the most common symptoms related to allergies: - Sneezing - Itchy or watery eyes - Fatigue - Short-term brain fog While knowing the symptoms of COVID-19 and allergies is helpful, Dr. Mitre points out that someone can have allergies and the virus at the same time. \"The presence of one does not rule out the presence of the other,\" he says. Therefore, he recommends getting tested for COVID0-19 any time you think there's a chance you could be positive. That way, you know to self-isolate if you do test positive so you can keep others around you safe. When to See a Doctor There are times when you should see a doctor, both in terms of COVID-19 infection and [allergies](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/best-allergy-medicine/). If you have any underlying conditions and either test positive for COVID-19 or would like to be tested for the virus, Dr. Mitre says it's best to book an appointment. \"There are treatments, including antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, that can reduce the risk of progression to severe disease,\" he says, adding that these treatments are most effective when given early in the course of infection. Dr. Thomas also recommends seeing a doctor if you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and your home test is negative. That way, you can get a PCR test, which produces more accurate results. If your COVID -19 symptoms are severe\u2014such as chills being so bad that you sweat through your sheets or you have trouble breathing\u2014Dr. Nasseri says to see a doctor as soon as possible. There are also times when it's worth it to see a doctor for your allergies. If your allergy symptoms are making it hard to breathe or are getting in the way of you navigating daily life, book an appointment. An allergist can [run tests](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/allergy-tests/) to determine exactly what your body is reacting to and can either prescribe [medication](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/best-allergy-medicine/) to help or use immunotherapy (in the form of an [allergy shot](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/allergy-shots/) or tablet) to alleviate symptoms. It's important to know the root cause of your health woes to figure out the best way to feel better and keep others safe. But if you're vaccinated from COVID-19, the odds are low that being infected with the virus will lead to hospitalization. All three experts emphasize that being vaccinated and boosted is the best way to protect yourself and others\u2014advice that applies not just during allergy season, but year-round.
