STS-107: Providing 24/7 Space Science Research Space shuttle mission STS-107, the 28th flight of the space shuttle Columbia and the 113th shuttle mission to date, will give more than 70 international scientists access to both the microgravity environment of space and a set of seven human researchers for 16 uninterrupted days. The STS-107 crew. Seated in front are astronauts Rick Husband, commander, and Willie McCool, pilot. Standing are (from le ft) mission specialists Dave Brown, Laurel Clark, Kalpana Chawla, Mike Anderson (payload commander) and payload specialist Ilan Ramon, representing the Israeli Space Agency. Columbia's 16-day mission is dedicated to a mixed complement of competitively selected and commercially sponsored research in the space, life and physical sciences. An international crew of seven, including the first Israeli astr onaut, will work 24 hours a day in two alternating shifts to carry out experiments in the areas of astronaut health and safety; advanced technology development; and Earth and space sciences. 1 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The Spacehab Research Double Modul e is prepared for flight at Kennedy Space Center 2 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration When Columbia is launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39A it will carry a SPACEHAB Research Double Module (RDM) in its payload bay. The RDM is a pressurized environment that is accessible to the crew while in orbit via a tunnel from the shuttle's middeck. Together, the RDM and the middeck will accommodate the majority of the mission's payloads/experiments. STS-107 marks the first flight of the RDM, though SPACEHAB Modules and Cargo Carriers have flown on 17 previous space shuttle missions. Astronaut Rick Husband (Col onel, USAF) will command STS-107 and will be joined on Columbia's flight deck by pilot William \"Willie\" McCool (Commander, USN). Columbia will be crewed by Mission Specialist 2 (Flight Engineer) Kalpana Chawla (Ph.D.), Mission Specialist 3 (Payload Commander) Michael Anderson (Lieutenant Colonel, USAF), Mission Specialist 1 David Brown (Captain, USN), Mission Specialist 4 Laurel Clark (Commander, USN) and Payload Specialist 1 Ilan Ramon (Colonel, Israeli Air Force), the first Israeli astronaut. STS-107 marks Husband's second flight into space - he served as pilot during STS-96, a 10-day mission that saw the first shuttle docking with the International Space Station. Husband served as Chief of Safety for the Astronaut Office until his selection to command the STS-107 crew. Anderson and Chawla will also be making their second spaceflights. Anderson first flew on STS-89 in January 1998 (the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission) while Chawla flew on STS-87 in November 1997 (the fourth U.S. Microgravity Payload flight). McCool, Brown, Clark and Ramon will be making their first flights into space. 3 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration STS-107 Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon, from Israel, trains on equipment at SPACEHAB, Cape Canaveral, Fla. 4 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The seven crewmembers will work in two shifts throughout their 16 days in space. The Red Shift will include Husband, Chawla, Clark and Ramon, while the Blue Shift will include McCool, Brown and Ander son. The seven astronauts will wo rk round-the-clock to complete a multidisciplinary research program involving 32 payloads with 59 separate investigations. Under an agreement with NASA, SPACEHAB, Inc. has marketed 18 percent of the module's capacity of 9,000 pounds to international and industry commercial users from around the world - NASA research will utilize the remaining 82 percent of the payload capacity. Experiments in the SPACEHAB RDM include nine commercial payloads involving 21 separate investigations, four payloads for the European Space Agency with 14 investigations, one payload/investigation for ISS Risk Mitigation and 18 payloads supporting 23 investigations for NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR). In the physical sciences, three studies inside a large, rugged chamber will examine the physics of combustion, soot production and fire quenching processes in microgravity. These experiments will provide new insights into combustion and fire-suppression that cannot be gained on Earth. An experiment that compresses granular materials, in the absence of gravity, will further our understanding of construction techniques. This information can help engineers provide stronger foundations for structures in areas where earthquakes, floods and landslides are common. Another experiment will evaluate the formation of zeolite crystals, which can speed the chemical reactions that are the basis for chemical processes used in refining, biomedical and other areas. Yet another experiment will use pressurized liquid xenon to mimic the behaviors of more complex fluids such as blood flowing through capillaries. 5 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration At SPACEHAB, Cape Canaveral, Fla., members of the STS-107 crew familiarize themselves with experiments and equipment for the mission. Pointing at a piece of equipment (center) is Mission Specialist Laurel Clark. At right is Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla. In the area of biological applications, two separate OBPR experiments will allow different types of cell cultures to grow together in weightlessness to enhance their development of enhanced genetic characteristics - one will be used to combat prostate cancer, the other to improve crop yield. Another experiment will evaluate the commercial usefulness of plant products grown in space. A facility for forming protein crystals more purely and with fewer flaws than is possible on Earth may lead to a drug designed for specific diseases with fewer side effects. A commercially sponsored facility will house two experiments to grow protein crystals to study possible therapies against the factors that cause cancers to spread and bone cancer to cause intense pain to its suffere rs. A third experiment will look at developing a new technique of encapsulating anti-cancer drugs to improve their efficiency. Other studies will focus on changes, due to spaceflight, in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems; in the systems which sense and respond to gravity; and in the capability of organisms to respond to stress and maintain normal function. NASA is also testing a new technology to recycle water prior to installing a device to recycle water permanently aboard the International Space Station. 6 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The European Space Agency (ESA), through a contract with SPACEHAB, is flying an important payload focused on astronaut health, biological function and basic physical phenomena in space. These experiments will address different aspects of many of the same phenomena that NASA is interested in, providing a more thorough description of the effects of spaceflight, often in the same subjects or specimens. ESA will perform seven in-flight experiments, and one ground-based, on the cardiopulmonary changes that occur in astronauts. Additional ESA biological investigations will examine bone formation and maintenance; immune system functioning; connective tissue growth and repair; and bacterial and yeast cell responses to the stresses of spaceflight. A special facility will grow large, well-ordered protein and virus crystals that are expected to lead to improved drug designs. Another will study the physical characteristics of bubbles and droplets in the absence of the effects of Earth's gravity. SPACEHAB is also making it possible for universities, companies and other government agencies to do important research in space without having to provide their own spacecraft. The Canadian Space Agency is sponsoring three bone-growth experiments, and is collaborating with ESA on two others. The German Space Agency will measure the development of the gravity-sensing organs of fish in the absence of gravity. A university is growing ultra-pure protein crystals for drug research. Another university is testing a navigation system for future satellites. The U.S. Air Force is conducting a communications experiment. Students from six schools in Australia, China, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein and the United States are probing the effects of spaceflight on spiders, silkworms, inorganic crystals, fish, bees and ants, respectively. 7 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Columbia's payload bay doors are ready to be closed for mission STS-107. Installed inside are the Hitchhiker Bridge, a carrier for the Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science, Technology, Applicat ions and Research (FREESTAR) that incorporates eight high priority secondary attached shuttle experiments, plus the SHI Research Double Module (SH I/RDM), also known as SPACEHAB. There are also experiments in Columbia's payload bay, including three attached to the top of the RDM: the Combined Two-Phase Loop Experiment (COM2PLEX) , Miniature Satellite Threat Reporting System (MSTRS) and Star Navigation (STARNAV). There are six payloads/experiments on the Hitchhiker pallet - the Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science, Technology, Applications and Research (FREESTAR), which is mounted on a bridge-like structure spanning the width of the payload bay. These six investigations look outward to the Sun, downward at Earth's atmosphere and inward into the physics of fluid phenomena, as well as testing technology for space communications. FREESTAR will hold the Critical Viscosity of Xenon-2 (CVX-2), Low Power Transceiver (LPT), Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX), Space Experiment Module (SEM- 14), Solar Constant Experiment-3 (SOLCON-3) and Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE-2). The SEM is made up of 11 separate student experiments from schools across the U.S. and is the 14 th flight of a SEM on the space shuttle. Additional secondary payloads are the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust Experiment (SIMPLEX) and Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO). 8 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Summary Timeline (Last Updated: Dec. 8, 2002) Below is a brief outline of what each STS-107 crewmember will be doing on any given Flight Day during their mission.

The RDM is a pressurized aluminum habitat that is carried in the space shuttle's cargo bay to expand working space aboard the shuttle. The RDM is connected to the shuttle middeck by a pressurized access tunnel. Boeing-Huntsville performed the RDM's systems integration for SPACEHAB and serves as the company's mission integration contractor. SPACEHAB Single Modules outfitted for research or logistics and Double Modules outfitted for logistics have flown on 15 space shuttle missions to date. The SPACEHAB Research Double Module ( RDM) and pressurized access tunnel are lowered toward Columbia's payload bay. 26 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The RDM is approximately 20 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 11 feet high. Outfitted as a state-of-the-art laboratory, it has a pressurized volume of 2,200 cubic feet and can hold up to 61 space shuttle middeck lockers (up to 60 pounds and 2 cubic feet each) plus six Double Racks (1,400 pounds and 45 cubic feet each). The RDM also can accommodate International Space Station Payload Racks (ISPRs). The Module has two viewports and can carry powered rooftop payloads (three on STS-107) using feed-through plates in the module ceiling. The RDM, which has a payload capacity of 9,000 pounds, will carry about 7,500 pounds of research payloads on STS-107. An additional 800 pounds of SPACEHAB-integrated payloads are flying on the shuttle middeck, making a total of 8,300 pounds of research payloads on STS-107. 27 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration STS-107 crewmembers check out equipment in the SPACEHAB RDM. Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla (left) holds a data manual while Mission Specialist David Brown stretches out on the floor to get a closer look during the Crew Equipment Interface Test activities, which include equipment and payload familiarization.

Effects of Phototropism Moss from STS-87, show- ing spiral growth patterns developed in the dark inmicrogravity.Seeking the Light Gravity Without the Influence of Gravity All living things sense gravity like humans might sense light or sound. The Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC-14)experiment, explores howmoss cells sense and respond to gravity and light. This experiment studies how gravity influences the internal structure of moss cells and seeks tounderstand the influences of the spaceflight envi-ronment on cell growth. This knowledge will helpresearchers understand the role of gravity in theevolution of cells and life on earth. Plants respond to gravity (gravitropism) and light (phototropism). Typically, plant shoots willgrow away from the direction of gravity and growtowards a light source. Some plants are primarilygravitropic while others are primarily phototropic.The moss, Ceratodon, is comprised of long chains of cells that grow from the filament tips. On earth,heavy particles in these tip cells fall toward grav-ity, causing the moss to grow away from the direc-tion of gravity. When exposed to the microgravityenvironment of space, gravitropic forces no longer affect the moss. Dueto decreased grav-ity, heavy particlesdon't fall out growth character-istics. Light direc-tion is not altered inmicrogravity so the plant will still grow phototropically (towards light)just like on earth.The scientist's origi- nal hypothesis was thatboth random cell cell growthwould occur in space.The objectives forBRIC-14 experimentwere developed from the knowledge gained during a previous shuttleflight, STS-87. Unexpectedly,moss specimens grown onSTS-87 showed non-randomsubcellular component distri-bution and spiral growth. For STS-107, the BRIC-14 experiment expands on theprevious results with threemajor objectives.1. Determine the age or developmental stage atwhich moss grows ina non-random patternwhen exposed to microgravity conditions; 2. Determine the minimum illumination level required to impose a phototropic response onthe growth pattern of the moss in the absenceof gravity; and 3. Understand how microgravity affects the distribution of cell substructures. 34 Background Information Columbia Approximate location of this payload aboard STS-107. Non-random spiral growth after distribution(from the STS-87 experiment).Science Discipline Supported This research primarily addresses Fundamental Space Biology, butcan also be related to other disciplines. Future Similar Experiments on International Space Station Similar flight experiments can be conducted on the International Space Station to increase knowledge of how natural processes react to space and enrich life on Earth through people living andworking in space. KSC-2002-057eTo address the first objective of this flight experiment, selected moss colonies will be grown while exposed to a directional light for six days before launch. Once in space, the lights will be turned off and the moss will continue to grow in dark- ness. This moss will be compared to moss that is grown without anyexposure to light but has had similar exposure time to microgravity. This part of the experiment will helpdetermine the age and developmen- tal growth stage of the moss at which non-random spiral growth is exhibited. The second objective of the experiment is to determine the illumination intensity required to induce a phototropicresponse in the absence of gravity. This part of the experi-ment will expose moss to three different levels of light and observe at which light intensity samples respond. The moss will grow in the dark for seven days in space prior to thelights turning on. This will allow the moss time to establish a random growth pattern prior to exposure to a directional light source. The third objective is to understand how the non- random distribution of cell substructure takes place in space.Scientists have known for quite some time that fibersinside cells are responsible for the organization of subcellu- lar components called organelles. An unexpected finding from STS-87 is that these heavy organelles, which are affected by gravity on earth, form non-random groups within the cells. The investigators hypothesize that this group- ing is organized by these same fibers, although nor-mally, the fibers don't cause grouping on earth. To test this theory, chemicals willbe applied that breakdown the fibers. If the fibers play a role, then the organellesshould become randomly distributed inside the cells during spaceflight. Thisexperiment will provide information about how the positions of heavy organelles arecontrolled and organized inside cells on earth. The astronauts will check the temperature and verify that the flight hardware is functioning each day. They willalso switch the growth lights on and off at various locationsin the flight hardware and will use a specialized tool to apply chemicals to the moss. These chemicals, called fixa- tives, will stop the growth process of the moss and preservethe specimens for analysis after the mission has ended. 35 Standard cell culture in 1g 5 min. 30 min. 5 hoursStandard cell culture in mg 5 min. 30 min. 5 hours STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration A Good Neighborhood for Cells Bioreactor Demonstration System (BDS-05) Good neighborhoods help you grow. As with a city, the lives of a cell are governed by its neighbor- hood connections. Connections that do not workare implicated in a range of diseases. One of thoseconnections \u2014 between prostate cancer and bonecells \u2014 will be studied on STS-107 using theBioreactor Demonstration System (BDS-05). Prostate cancer strikes about 200,000 men a year and is easily cured when diagnosed early, accord-ing to the AmericanCancer Society. Once itspreads to the skeletonit is inevitably fatal andkills more than 30,000men a year. The publichealth cost is more than$2 billion a year. Toimprove the prospectsfor finding novel thera-pies, and to identifybiomarkers tissuemodels that behave thesame as metastatic orspreading cancer. This is one of several NASA-sponsored lines of cell science research that use the microgravityenvironment of orbit in an attempt to grow lifeliketissue models for health research. As cells replicate, they \"self associate\" to form a complex matrix of collagens, proteins, fibers, andother structures. This highly evolved microenviron-ment tells each cell who is next door, how it shouldgrow and into what shapes, and how to respond tobacteria, wounds, and other stimuli. Studying these mechanisms outside the body is difficult because cells do not easily self-associateoutside a natural environment. Most cell culturesproduce thin, flat specimens that offer limitedinsight into how cells work together. Ironically,growing cell cultures in the microgravity of spaceproduces cell assemblies that more closely resemblewhat is found in bodies on Earth. NASA's Bioreactor comprises a miniature life sup- port system and a rotating vessel containing cell speci-mens in a nutrient medium. Orbital BDS experimentsthat cultured colon and prostate cancers have beenhighly promising. Long-duration experiments areplanned for the International Space Station where multiple generations of cells can be grown. Principal Investigator: Dr. Leland W.K. Chung, Emory University, Atlanta, GA Project Scientist and Project Manager: Thomas J. Goodwin, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TXProstate cancer is a key health issue that eventually affects 1 in 6 American males. For African-American males, the disease and mortality rates are up to 50 percent and 200 percent higher, respec-tively, according to the National Prostate Cancer Coalition. http://spaceresearch.nasa.govCell constructs grown in a rotating bioreactor on Earth (left)eventually become too large to stay suspended in the nutrient media. In the microgravity of orbit, the cells stay suspended.Rotation then is needed for gentle stirring to replenish the media around the cells.Targeted health issues Therapies : Musculoskeletal tissue disorders (in space and on Earth) Cancer models : Prostate, breast, ovary, lung, and colon cancers Diabetes : Pancreatic tissue for transplant Drug efficacy : Non-animal/nonclinical testing of drug effects and toxicity On STS-107, the BDS will grow a three-dimen- sional prostate culture model to support studies of the cellular interaction between the prostate andbone stromal (connective tissue) cells. The modelwill help scientists assess the effects of gene therapyon the growth of prostate cancer cell aggregates inresearch, clinical diagnoses, and treatments. 36 Background Information FS-2002-06-068-MSFCResearch partners National Institutes of Health: Center for Three Dimensional Tissue Culture, studying HIV-1 pathogenesis in tissue models, among other health issues. Juvenile Diabetes Foundation: Studying the best route for cultivat- ing and transplanting beta cells into Type 1 diabetics. StelSys: Research in drug development and on a liver-assist device.Science A key factor in the growth of prostate cancer is the stimu- lation of tumor cells by the hormone testosterone. Under- standing the factors that control the reproduction and spreadof tumor cells will help researchers discover how to slow or stop the growth of a cancer. The BDS-05 experiment will cul- ture human prostate cancer cells in microgravity so investi-gators can characterize the biochemical, molecular, and behavioral alterations of prostate cancer cells derived from reconstituted prostate organoids (RPCaO) grown under hor-mone-enriched or -deprived conditions. This will support studies of the \"bystander\" effects of toxic gene therapy on organoids. The ultimate goal is to develop a model for pre-clinical studies of drug and gene therapy, preparatory to the establishment of an effective clinical trial protocol. Flight Research Equipment The heart of the BDS is a clear plastic rotating wall vessel, about the size of a soup can, containing the cell culture. A cylindrical filter down the center of the vessel rotates with the vessel and passes oxygen in and carbon dioxide out.Periodically, spent media are pumped into a waste bag and replaced by fresh media. The vessel rotates to provide gentle stirring of media without causing shear forces that woulddamage or kill the cells. An Experiment Control Computer controls the Bioreactor, records conditions, and alerts the crew when problemsoccur. The crew operates the system through a laptop com- puter. The Biotechnology Specimen Temperature Controller holds cells until their turn in the Bioreactor, and a Biotech-nology Refrigerator holds fixed tissue culture bags at 4 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F) for return to Earth and analysis. A Gas Supply Module provides oxygen.On STS-107, the crew will monitor the BDS, inject specimen cells, and periodicallywithdraw and fix cells and media samples for post-flight analy-ses. The crew also will exchange media bags as needed. At the endof the mission they will deactivate the system and fix allremaining cultures. This prostate cancer construct was grown during NASA-sponsored bioreactor studies on Earth. Cells are attached to a biodegradableplastic lattice that gives them a head start in growth. Columbia Approximate location of this payload aboard STS-107.Commercial applications In 1990, NASA granted Synthecon Inc. of Houston an exclusive commercial license to NASA patents for the bioreactor system.Since then, Synthecon has sold more than $2 million worth ofRotary Cell Culture Systems and sponsored several relatedresearch agreements. In 2000, NASA signed a Space Act Agreement with StelSys, a new venture formed by Fisk Ventures, Inc. and In Vitro Technolo-gies, Inc. StelSys, based in Baltimore, will develop commercial medi-cal products based on Bioreactor technology. They will focus ondrug development and a liver-assist device for patients in need oftransplant surgery.The major component of the BioreactorDemonstration System is the transparentrotating wall vessel. It resides in a lockercontaining nutrient media bags and anoxygenator, plus associated plumbing tooperate the system. Photos. NASA.Previous Results Experience aboard Mir has turned microgravity Bioreactor research into a mature science. In its first long-duration ex- periment, large cultures of bovine cartilage cells grew in the Bioreactor. The last NASA stay aboard Mir was crucial as it brought everything together in an effort to culture human tissue in the Bioreactor. Since then, the NASA Bioreactor team has been synthesizing these lessons into an advanced program being developed for the International Space Station . The principal investigator's team has conducted exten- sive ground-based experiments on prostate tumors inrotating-wall vessels and developed an extensive under- standing of many of the chemical pathways and chromo- somal changes involved in growing prostate cells. One setof results suggests that bone stromal cells can serve as \"suicidal carriers\" that deliver and express toxic genes that mediate tumor cell kills in vivo . 37 STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration The Effect of Microgravity on the Smallest Space Travelers Bacterial Physiology and Virulence on Earth and in Microgravity http://spaceresearch.nasa.govPrincipal Investigator : Dr. Barry Pyle, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana Project Scientist : Marilyn Vasques, NASA Ames Research Cen- ter, Mountain View, CA Project Manager : Rudy Aquilina, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CASince the first human flights outside of Earth's gravity, crew health and well-being have been major concerns. Exposure to microgravity dur-ing spaceflight is known to affect the humanimmune response, possibly making the crewmembers more vulnerable to infectious disease.In addition, biological experiments previouslyflown in space have shown that bacteria growfaster in microgravity than they do on Earth. The ability of certain antibiotics to control bacterial infections may also differ greatly inmicrogravity. It is therefore critical to understandhow spaceflight and microgravity affect bacte-rial virulence, which is their ability to cause dis-ease. By utilizing spaceflight hardware providedby the European Space Agency (ESA), Dr. BarryPyle and his team at Montana State University,Bozeman, will be performing an experiment tostudy the effects of microgravity on the virulenceof a common soil and water bacterium, Pseudomo- nas aeruginosa . Importantly, these bacteria have been detected in the water supplies of previousSpace Shuttle flights. The experiment will exam-ine the effects of microgravity exposure on bac-terial growth and on the bacterium's ability toform a toxin called Exotoxin A . Another goal is to evaluate the effects of microgravity on the physiology of the bacteriaby analyzing their ability to respire (produceenergy), by studying the condition of the plasmamembrane surrounding the cell, and by deter-mining if specific enzymes remain active. Proteinsproduced by the bacteria will also be assayed tosee if the normal functions of the bacteria areaffected. In the context of human life support inspaceflight, the results of this experiment will Bacterial respiration in response to microgravity is measured by providing cells with an indicator of respiratory enzyme activity, r-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT). Respiring cells takeup INT and convert it to an insoluble form. Upon return to Earth, the cells are visualized via staining with the fluorescent molecule SYBR Green, and cells that were respiring on orbit(fluorescent cells containing black spots) are counted. Earth Benefits and Applications This experiment will provide valuable insight to the field ofmicrobiology regarding the growth, physiology, and virulenceof the common soil and water bacterium, P . aeruginosa, that is also able to cause disease in humans.offer guidance in providing the highest possible water quality for the Shuttle in order to limit therisk of infection to human occupants and to mini-mize water system and spacecraft deterioration. 38 Columbia Picture credits. Pyle (page 1), Ames Research Center (page 2)Approximate location of this payload aboard STS-107.Background Information KSC-2002-057d Science Pathogenic species such as P . aeruginosa cause disease by producing toxins that affect the physiological functions of the host cells. Before launch, a strain of P. aeruginosa thatproduces Exotoxin A will be cultured in the laboratory un- der conditions that repress toxin production. Samples will be loaded into the cassettes and kept at +5 \u00b0C until they are activated on orbit to stimulate toxin production. The cassettes will be incubated for 24 \u00b11 hours at +37 \u00b0C, exposed to vari- ous treatments, and refrigerated at +5 \u00b0C until landing. Upon return to Earth, assays for exotoxin production, cell toxicity,proteins, and bacterial physiology will be performed. Hardware This experiment will be performed using ESA's Biopack spaceflight hardware which provides an incubator with cen- trifuges and a built-in cooler. On board the Space Shuttle, samples can be exposed to gravity levels ranging from microgravity to twice Earth's gravity. Biopack is designed toaccommodate small biological samples, e.g. bacterial cul- tures, mammalian cell, tissue cultures and small plants or The experiment cassettes developed for the Biopack hardware contain the bacteria samples in culture chambers that will be activatedin flight. Each Phorbol cassette contains six culture chambers (leftside of cassette), six activation chambers (upper chambers, right side)and six fixative chambers (lower chambers). Pre-flight, cultures andsolutions are loaded into their respective chambers. At the time ofactivation, the green/activation sluice is turned to the \"open\" positionand the contents of the activation chambers is injected into the culturechambers using a plunger tool. The sluice is then closed and thecassettes are incubated. At the time of termination, a similar procedureis followed (red/termination sluice).Science Discipline Supported This experiment supports NASA's priorities for research aimed atunderstanding and alleviating problems that may limit astronauts'ability to survive and/or function during prolonged spaceflight,and will provide the field of microbiology valuable insight into thegrowth, physiology, and virulence of the common soil and waterbacterium, P . aeruginosa. insects. Dr. Pyle's experiment use the +37 \u00b0C incubator, while pre- and post-incubation refrigeration will be provided by a +5 \u00b0C Passive Thermal Conditioning Unit (PTCU). The cultures will be housed in experiment cassettes that are contained in sealed containers. The experiment willutilize a total of 16 of these devices. Eight containers will comprise the flight set and eight containers will comprise the ground control set. On flight day 8, the astronaut crewwill activate the cultures by pushing six activator plungers to transfer the bacteria into the growth medium. The con- tainers will then be placed in the Biopack +37 \u00b0C incubator for 24 hours. For the flight experiment, four containers will be incubated in a stationary holder to expose the bacteria to the effects of microgravity, and four containers will becentrifuged for the on-orbit 1g control. Following incuba- tion the crew will return the cassettes to refrigeration for the duration of the flight. Previous Results Preliminary data analysis from the NASA/ESA Biorack program (STS-81, Shuttle Atlantis , January 1997) suggests that the numbers of attached cells in biofilms grown in microgravity were several times greater than their Earth-based counterparts. The STS-107 experiment proposes to uti- lize this research opportunity to obtain further data on the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on the growth, physi-ology and virulence of waterborne bacteria. The results from this experiment will further our understanding of bacterial behavior in spaceflight and on Earth. 39 STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Understanding How Astronauts Adapt to Space and to Earth Anatomical Studies of Central Vestibular Adaptation http://spaceresearch.nasa.govPrincipal Investigator : Dr. Gay Holstein, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York Project Scientist : Marilyn Vasques, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA Project Manager : Rudy Aquilina, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CASignificant changes take place in the nervous systems of astronauts during and following expo- sure to microgravity. These changes, particularlyin the part of the brain that controls balance, thevestibular system, can cause sensations of rotation,dizziness, and vertigo, as well as space adaptationsyndrome. Adaptation to the microgravity environ-ment usually occurs within one week, and a sub-sequent re-adaptation period of several days isoften required upon return to Earth. In order torealize long-term spaceflight, effective countermea-sures for these symptoms must be developed. The structural changes that take place in one of the vestibular regions of the brain (the cerebellarcortex) during the process of adaptation to Earth'sgravity remain unclear and are the subject of anexperiment being conducted on STS-107 by Dr. GayHolstein of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine inNew York. Using the rat as a model, Dr. Holsteinand her team will seek to identify the cellularchanges underlying the vestibular changes experi-enced by astronauts.

The five flight animals will be flown aboard theShuttle in one AEM, for a total of 16 days. Ground based 72-hour delayed control rats will be housed in the other AEM. Ultrastructural studies will then be carried out usingelectron microscopy. The results of this experiment will help to identify the cellular bases underlying the vestibular changes experienced by astronauts during periods ofadaptation and re-adaptation to altered gravitational forces, and may provide insights for the development of effective pharmacotherapeutic countermeasures. Science Discipline Supported This experiment supports NASA's priorities for research aimed at understanding fundamental biological processes in which gravityis known to play a direct role and alleviating problems that maylimit astronauts' ability to survive and/or function during prolongedspaceflight. This experiment is part of the Fundamental Rodent ExperimentsSupporting Health (FRESH)-02 payload which consists of 13 ratshoused in 3 AEMs. The animals, which will be shared among severaldifferent investigators, will experience microgravity for 16 days onboard the Shuttle Columbia . The AEMs have been used successfully on many previous shuttle flights.The AEM has been designed for minimum crew inter- action and the animals adapt very well to this virtually self-contained system. The only nominal operations required are a daily hardware check, a daily visual animal healthcheck, and periodic water refills. Hardware The AEMs is a rodent habitat that provides ventilation, continuous filtered air flow to control waste and odor, timedlighting, food in the form of foodbars attached to the side of the cage, and a water supply which can be refilled as re- quired. Rodents in the cage compartment of the AEM arenot accessible but can be viewed through the clear lexan cover. This also allows for viewing of water level remaining in the AEM water box.Earth Benefits and Applications The results of this experiment will help to identify the cellular bases underlying vestibular changes that occur during periods of adap-tation and re-adaptation to different gravitational forces. In that light,the findings may provide insights for the development of effectivepharmacotherapeutic countermeasures for vestibular changes dur-ing spaceflight. In addition, since the short- and long-term changesin neural structure and connectivity that occur during adaptation tomicrogravity mimic the neuronal alterations that occur in many pro-gressive neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson's Dis-ease, findings from this study using a rat model could offer guid-ance in the development of strategies for neurorehabilitation andtreatment of these disorders. Previous Results The results from a previous experiment flown on STS-90 suggest that immediately following exposure to spaceflight, substantial structural reorganization takes place in the regions of the brain involved in controlling balance and equilibrium. Observations of brain tissue ob-tained after 24 hours of spaceflight indicate that several structural alterations occur in specific regions and cells of the rat brain. These alterations are not apparent in the cagecontrol animals. The primary goal of the present project is to study these ultrastructural alterations in greater detail. 41 STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Understanding How Space Travel Affects Blood Vessels Arterial Remodeling and Functional Adaptations Induced by Microgravity http://spaceresearch.nasa.govPrincipal Investigator : Dr. Michael Delp, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX Project Scientist : Marilyn Vasques, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA Project Manager : Rudy Aquilina, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CAEver rise quickly from the couch to get some- thing from the kitchen and suddenly feel dizzy? With a low heart rate and relaxed muscles, thecardiovascular system does not immediately pro-vide the resistance necessary to keep enoughblood going to your head. Gravity wins, at leastfor a short time, before your heart and bloodvessels can respond to the sudden change inposition and correct the situation. Actually, the human cardiovascular system is quite well adapted to the constant gravitationalforce of the Earth. When standing, vessels in thelegs constrict to prevent blood from collectingin the lower extremities. In the space environ-ment, the usual head-to-foot blood pressure andtissue fluid gradients that exist during theupright posture on Earth are removed. The subsequent shift in fluids from the lower to the upper portions of the body triggers adap-tations within the cardiovascular system toaccommodate the new pressure and fluid gradi-ents. In animal models that simulate micrograv-ity, the vessels in the head become more robustwhile those in the lower limbs become thinand lax. Similar changes may also occur inThis figure shows feed arteries and first-order arterioles from control rats and from rats that have experienced simulatedmicrogravity. After flight, the small blood vessels in hindlimb skeletal muscles that provide blood pressure resistance will be analyzed for their responses to chemical signals andpressure changes, and for changes in vessel structure and gene expression.Earth Benefits and Applications This experiment will contribute toward attaining a better under- standing of how fundamental biological systems, such asthe cardiovascular system, respond to the microgravityenvironment.The detailed study of the resulting vascular adap-tations triggered by microgravity will yield essential informationon the basic physiological responses of individual blood vesselsinvolved in blood flow and pressure regulation. This informationwill also support the development of treatments or countermea-sures to improve crew health and performance following their return to a gravitational environment. humans during spaceflight and while these adaptations are appropriate for a microgravityenvironment, they can cause problems when theastronauts return to Earth or perhaps anotherplanet. Astronauts often develop orthostatic intoler- ance which means they become dizzy or faint when standing upright. This dizziness can persist for a number of days making routine activities difficult. In aneffort to understand the physiological details ofthese cardiovascular adaptations, Dr. MichaelDelp at Texas A&M University, uses the rat as amodel for his studies. For the experiment flownon STS-107, he will test the hypothesis that bloodvessels in the rats' hindlimbs become thinner,weaker, and constrict less in response to pressurechanges and to chemical signals when exposedto microgravity. In addition, he will test thehypothesis that arteries in the brain becomethicker as a result of microgravity-induced fluidshifts toward the head. 42 Columbia Picture credits.

The AEMs have been used successfully on many previous shuttle flights.This experiment will address the effects of microgravity on vascular smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cell function and structure in resistance arteries and arteriolesisolated from skeletal muscle and the brain. Three groups of rats will be studied. These will consist of 8 rats flown in microgravity, 8 rats from a ground-based vivarium cage con-trol group, and 8 rats from a ground-based AEM control group. Resistance arteries or arterioles will be isolated and used for physiology experiments, in gene expression studies,and structural analyses. This work will provide potentially important information about the mechanisms underlying the orthostatic intolerance experienced by astronauts returningto Earth.

The only nominal operations required are a daily hardware check, a daily visual animal health check,and periodic water refills.Science From previous studies using models that simulate microgravity, it is now evident that the shift of fluid towardthe head and the unloading of postural muscles together alterthe mechanical forces exerted on arteries, the vessels respon- sible for regulating blood flow and arterial blood pressure. The purpose of the present study is to determine whetherthe fluid shifts and muscle unloading that occur in actual microgravity, similarly alter rodent arterial vessel structure and function. 43 STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Understanding Fluid Shifts in the Brain Choroidal Regulation Involved in the Cerebral Fluid Response to Altered Gravity http://spaceresearch.nasa.govPrincipal Investigator : Dr. Jaqueline Gabrion, University of Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France Project Scientist : Marilyn Vasques, NASA Ames Research Center Project Manager : Rudy Aquilina, NASA Ames Research CenterFluid balance and regulation of body fluid pro- duction are critical aspects of life and survival on Earth. In space, without gravity exerting its usualdownward pulling effect, the fluids of the humanbody shift in an unnatural, headward direction.After awhile, humans and other mammalian spe-cies adapt to the microgravity environment whichleads to changes in the regulation and distributionof these body fluids. Previous spaceflight experi-ments have indicated that production of fluid inthe brain and spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) , might be reduced in rats exposed to microgravity. Dr. Gabrion will study the effects of microgravity on proteins responsible for water and ion transport in the brain and in othertissues. The choroid plexus which produces CSF is located in the cerebral ventricles (left). The right panel illustrates detec- tion of aquaporin 1 messenger RNAs in the choroid staining). CSF production is influenced by the neurotransmitter seroto-nin. In frozen brain sections, serotonin receptor messengerRNAs in choroid plexus are shown in red (left). Serotonin receptors have also been detected in choroid plexus through their capability to specifically bind a serotonin-like probe (right,in red). investigated in other areas of the brain and body to better understand the regulatory responsesaffecting these important water channel proteins. In addition to producing essential and basic information about fluid production in the brainand body, this experiment will reveal funda-mental information about the mechanismsinvolved in cerebral adaptation and fluid balanceduring spaceflight. In this experiment conducted by Dr. Jacqueline Gabrion (University of Pierre and Marie Curie,France), proteins important for CSF production,and several molecules that regulate water and min-eral transport, will be investigated in rats flown onthe Shuttle. Dr. Gabrion and her team will deter-mine the amounts of these proteins and moleculespresent in the brain in order to evaluate whetherany changes have taken place during the rats'adaptation to microgravity. The levels of differentaquaporins (proteins that act as a channel forwater transport in and out of cells) will also be Earth Benefits and Applications Because of its impact on fluid balance, spaceflight provides uniqueopportunities to investigate mechanisms of adaptation that involvefluid balance in the brain, kidneys and lungs. This experiment willcontribute to a better understanding of basic mechanisms whichregulate body fluid balance and homeostasis, and is important forthe advancement of fundamental biology. 44 Columbia Picture credits. Gabrion (pages 1, 2), Ames Research Center (AEM).Approximate location of this payload aboard STS-107.Background Information KSC-2002-057bScience Spaceflight is well known to induce headward fluid shifts and thus offers unique opportunities to analyze the role of gravity in body fluid distribution and fluid balance.However, the difficulties involved in measuring CSF volume and flow in these extreme experimental conditions, have prevented extensive study of CSF production and itstransport processes during adaptation to altered gravity. To begin to understand CSF balance during adaptation to altered gravity, Dr. Gabrion and her team initiated studies over 10years ago to determine the effects of spaceflight on choroidal structures and regulation in the rat. This STS-107 experiment specifically focuses on 2 important families of transport proteins and on the biochemical signaling molecules that regulate CSFproduction. Biosynthesis of choroidal Aquaporin 1 and sodium-potassium (Na-K) dependent ATPase will be studied using molecular staining techniques on fixed and/ or frozensamples of choroid plexus. The expression levels of different aquaporins will also be investigated in other brain areas, the hypophysis, the kidney, and the lung. This experiment is part of the Fundamental Rodent Experi- ments Supporting Health (FRESH)-02 payload which consists of 13 rats housed in 3 Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs). Theanimals, which will be shared among several different investi- gators, will experience microgravity for 16 days on board the Shuttle Columbia .

Immunodetection of aquaporin 1 (in green) and sodium- potassium ATPase (in red) at the apical pole of choroid plexus,(A, B) in a control rat and (C, D) in a ground-based model simulating some effects of spaceflight. A net decrease in both proteins was noted at the epithelial cells, suggesting that CSFproduction was decreased.Previous flight experiments have demonstrated that reduced gravity dramatically alters the fine structure, functions, and maturation of the choroid plexus in the rat brain. Although no direct measurements of CSF secretion inmicrogravity have been performed to date, these findings indicate that adult rats likely experience a net reduction in CSF production during spaceflight. Such results might begeneralized to humans and could partly explain headaches frequently endured by astronauts in space.

The experimentwill be located in the SPACEHAB module and isabout the size of a household microwave oven. The goal of the experiment is to improve our understanding of the basic phenomenon of howplants respond to gravity. The BioTube/MFAexperiment specifically examines how gravitationalforces serve as a directional signal for growth inthe low-gravity environment of space. As with allbasic research, this study will contribute to animproved understanding of how plants grow andwill have important implications for improvingplant growth and productivity on Earth. In BioTube/MFA, magnetic fields will be used to determine whether the distribution of subcellu-lar starch grains, called amyloplasts, within plantcells predicts the direction in which roots will growand curve in microgravity. On Earth amyloplasts in plant cells accumu- late in the direction of gravity causing a changein the cell. This essentially translates to a signalindicating which direction is \"up\" or \"down\". TheBioTube/MFA experiment utilizes high-gradientmagnetic fields to change the distribution ofSTS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration http://spaceresearch.nasa.govamyloplasts in flax roots. The magnetic field is concentratedat a specific point which pro-duces magnetic gradient. As theroot grows, it approaches thewedge and moves into the mag-netic gradient. The starch grains are then repelledby the magnetic gradient, causing the roots to curvein the direction of the displaced starch grains. The BioTube/MFA experiment contains dry flax seeds (also known as Linum usitatissimum ) that will germinate in space. The seeds will be wateredand the roots will begin to grow across the high-gradient magnetic field wedges in two MagneticField Chambers. A third Magnetic Field Chamberwill provide a uniform (non-gradient) magneticfield for the roots as a comparison to the high-gradient magnetic field. Time-lapse imagery willrecord pictures of the roots as they grow. Approxi-mately 48 hours after seed watering, a chemicalfixative will preserve the flax specimens formicroscopic analysis and the experiment will end. The science objectives of the BioTube/MFA experiment address three major questions:1. Are amyloplasts the organelles in plant cells that perceive gravity? 2. Does the position or movement of the amylo- plasts (sedimentation on earth, or, response toa high gradient magnetic field in orbit) affectthe root growth direction? 3. Does gravity exert an effect on the deposition of cell wall material and the organization ofplant cells organelles? Principal Investigator: Dr. Karl H.

These goals will provide insight into the fundamental organization and operation of the gravity response system of plants and determine if, other than the root cap, other partsof the plant require cues for directional growth.Science Discipline Supported The BioTube/MFA research primarily addresses Fundamental Space Biology, but applies to other disciplines. Astronauts will turn on the BioTube/MFA experiment three days prior to landing. All experiment operations will be complete within a 48 hour period. The BioTube/MFA soft- ware automatically controls a series of events that willdeliver water to the seeds, take images of the growing roots and deliver a chemical fixative which preserves the roots for later analysis. The astronaut crew will periodically check onthe equipment as the experiment progresses and will turn the power off following chemical fixation.The left panel depicts the random orientation of amyloplasts in a simulated spaceflight experiment.

ColumbiaFuture Similar Experiments on International Space Station Similar flight experiments could be conducted on the International Space Station to increase the knowledge of how biological pro- cesses are affected by microgravity. KSC-2002-057f 47 Did you know that when astronauts are in space, their height increases about two inches? This happens because the weightlessness of space allows the spine, usually compressed in Earth'sgravity, to expand. While this change is relativelyharmless, other more serious things can happenwith extended stays in weightlessness, notablybone loss. From previous experiments, scientists haveobserved that astro-nauts lose bone massat a rate of about onepercent per monthduring flight. Scientistsknow that bone is adynamic tissue \u2014 con-tinually being madeand repaired by spe-cialized bone cellsthroughout life. Certaincells produce newbone, while other cells are responsible for remov-ing and replacing old bone. Research on themechanisms of bone metabolism and the effectsof space flight on its formation and repair arepart of the exciting studies that will be performedduring STS-107. Calcium plays a central role because 1) it gives strength and structure to bone and 2) all types ofcells require it to function normally. Ninety-ninepercent of calcium in the body is stored in theskeleton. However, calcium may be released, orresorbed , from bone to provide for other tissues when you are not eating. To better understand how and why weight- lessness induces bone loss, astronauts willparticipate in a study of calcium kinetics \u2014 thatis, the movement of calcium through the body,including absorption from food, and its role in theformation and breakdown of bone. They willreceive small amounts of special forms of calciumknown as tracers. These allow scientists to tracethe movement of calcium in the body. By trackingthese tracers, we will see how calcium wasprocessed and where it traveled in the body. Then,comparing the results from before, during, and afterflight, we will learn how calcium metabolismchanges when humans are in space.

For this to occur we must pr ovide adequate nutrition, including calcium, along with exer cise. The pr eferr ed exer cises ar e those that ar e weight bearing \u2014 walking, dancing, weight lifting, and other exer cises that place weight on the legs. Astr onauts exer cise in space to try to keep their bones and muscles in shape. Despite this, bone loss still occurs, ther eby pr oviding an ideal laboratory to study the br eakdown and r ebuilding of bone and the path that calcium takes in r eaching bone. Bone loss in micr ogravity has serious implications for bone health, including incr eased risk for bone fractur es and kidney stones during flight and upon r eturn to Earth. The bone loss experienced by astr onauts in space is similar to the bone loss experienced by patients with osteopor osis or paralyzed individuals. T o better understand calcium and bone changes during space flight, calcium kinetics andother aspects of bone and calcium metabolism will be meas - ured. These measur ements will be made befor e, during , and after flight. Information on the mechanisms of space-inducedbone loss will be applicable to developing ef fective counter - measur es for astr onauts, and may help in developing treatments for osteopor osis or other bone-r elated diseases on Earth. The calcium kinetics experiment will study how space flight af fects calcium balance, calcium absorption, and bone resorption. This pr ocedur e requir es that astr onauts take two stable, non-radioactive forms of calcium (one orally and oneintravenously). Samples of blood, urine, saliva, and feces(befor e and after flight only) will be collected and analyzed for the two calcium tracers. Using mathematical modelingtechniques, scientists will determine the rates of calciummovement based on the tracer analyses. Specific parametersto be determined include the absorption of calcium fr om food, r emoval of calcium fr om the body , deposition of calcium in bone, and r esorption of calcium out of bone. Hormones, and other compounds which play a r ole in the contr ol of bone and calcium metabolism, will also be measur ed to pr ovide a mor e complete pictur e of themechanisms involved. This study will deepen our under - standing of calcium movement thr ough the body , the ef fects of weightlessness on r egulation of bone and calcium, and the r ecovery of these systems after r eturn to Earth. Operations The calcium tracers will be administer ed befor e, during, and after flight, with biological samples collected for up to10 days after each tracer administration. Biochemical, hor - mone, and other endocrine markers of bone metabolismwill be measur ed fr om blood and urine samples. Food intake during flight will be r ecorded to measur e the amount of calcium entering the body . Mathematical modeling tech - niques (developed by the National Institutes of Health) willbe utilized to integrate the data and determine the move - ment of calcium thr ough the body . Specifically , these analyses will determine the rates of calcium absorption, therates of calcium excr etion in urine and feces, and the rates of bone calcium deposition and r esorption. Earlier Results Calcium loss has been measur ed since the Skylab mis- sions of the 1970s, which showed that calcium excr etion increased compar ed to pr eflight levels. Biochemical mark - ers of bone also indicated that bone r esorption was gr eatly increased during the Skylab missions. Calcium studies continued during the Mir missions of the 1990s. Mircrewmembers showed 1) decr eased vitamin D, a vitamin/hormone that plays an important r ole in calcium balance; 2) unchanged or decr eased levels of osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase, markers of bone eased of pr oducts fr the eakdown of collagen, a major str uctural pr otein of bone. Since suf fi- cient subjects ar e needed to obtain meaningful data, this resear ch continues calcium kinetics studies performed previously on NASA- Mir and Shuttle- Mir missions. Dietary calcium is an important sour ce of calcium for the body . The calcium is absorbed into your body fr om the food you eat and then stored in your bones. FS-2002-03-051-JSCApproximate location of this payload aboar d STS-107.Columbia 49 The organisms that make us ill, such as bacte- ria, viruses, and fungi, are like attacking armies. We now know a great deal more about thisunseen world of microscopic invaders. Fort-unately for us, the human immune system is evervigilant against them. Microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi occupy almost every corner of the Earth,and even parts of the human body. Some organ-isms are beneficial to us, helping to produce milk,cheese or yogurt. Others are potentially harmful,yet we don't always develop illnesses from them;they are kept in check by the sentinels of ourimmune system. Our immune system is routinelychallenged by these organisms every day. Whenthe immune response is diminished, our ability tofight off these \"bugs\" is lowered. And that's whenwe become ill. Space flight presents a challenge to the immune system. Scientists believe that the stress-ful conditions of space flight \u2014 launch into orbit,adapting to microgravity, heavy workloads, andisolation from family and friends, to name but afew \u2014 reduce the astronauts' immunity. Thisimmune suppression makes them more suscepti-ble to common illnesses from bacteria and tore-infections from latent viruses in the body. Inaddition, risk of spreading illness in the confinedenvironment of the Space Shuttle is high.Understanding changes in immune function willhelp scientists develop ways to keep astronautshealthy in space. This knowledge can also benefitearthbound populations. This experiment will give scientists insight into the immune system by comparing how certaincells of astronauts' innate immune system \u2014 thefirst line of defense against invaders \u2014 functionafter flight compared to before flight. Principal Investigator: Dr. Duane Pierson, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TXProject Scientist: Dr. Jacob Bloomberg, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TXProject Manager: Angie Lee, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TXAstronauts John Grunsfeld (left) and Richard Linnehanparticipate in a space walk on STS-109 to work on theHubble Space Telescope. Space walks can present signifi-cant physical and psychological stress on astronauts,possibly challenging their immune systems. Earth Benefits and Applications With greater understanding of the immune system in space, we can: Prevent impaired immunity for humans in confined conditions on Earth, such as polar stations, submarines, hospitals, and nursing homes Develop better vaccines Develop more precise treatments and drugs for illnesses Prevent emerging diseases.Letting Our Cells Do the Fighting Flight-Induced Changes in the Immune ResponseSTS-107:Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov 50 Science To minimize the health risk during flight, astr onauts under go pr eventive measur es (such as immunization and physical exams) befor e flight. In or der to understand the changes the immune system under goes in micr ogravity and upon r eturn to Earth, scientists must learn how immune cells behave befor e and after flight \u2014 measur ed as the response to invaders or the intensity of that r esponse. The body's immune system actually consists of two types of systems \u2014 the adaptive immune system and the innate immune system; they complement each other to pr o- vide ef fective pr otection. The adaptive arm r esponds to a foreign invader to destr oy it and then r etains a memory , an antibody against that specific invader should it ever attackagain. This system is at work when you ar e vaccinated. Vaccination exposes you to a small, non-vir ulent dose of the foreign micr oorganism, which will not make you ill but allows your adaptive immune cells to r espond and know what to look for in the futur e. The innate arm of the immune system is the first line of defense, so its cells do not focus on specific invaders. In thisway, it is non-specific and attacks cells r ecognized as for eign to eliminate them quickly . Innate cells destr oy mainly thr ough an action called phagocytosis, by which the for eign micr oorgan- ism is engulfed and destr oyed. They can also work with the adaptive immune system to destr oy invaders. The cells of inter est in this experiment ar e thr ee types of white blood cells of the innate immune system \u2014 specifi - cally , neutr ophils, monocytes, and a special set of lymphocytes called natural killer cells; all of these playimportant r oles in war ding of f infection and illness. However , like any military for ce, these soldiers have dif ferent methods of attack. Neutr ophils, r eady as the first line of defense, cir culate in the bloodstr eam. They move out of the blood and into infected tissue to destr oy infected cells. The r esults of their action can be seen in everyday life; for example, the pusfrom a boil is mostly a collection of dead neutr ophils that have destr oyed the also cir culate in the bloodstr eam. These cells are important not only for their defense in the bloodstr eam, but also because they matur e and migrate into tissues wher e they become potent macr ophages. These macr ophages the ability to engulf for eign antigens and destr oy them with certain enzymes. Macr ophages can also br eak down the micr oorganism into smaller pieces and pr esent these to other immune cells for antibody pr oduction. Natural killer (NK) cells ar e the last type of white blood cell to be studied. They belong to a subset of white bloodcells known as lymphocytes. NK cells r ecognize for eign tar - gets in a non-specific manner and destr oy them. They play key r oles in fighting tumor cells and cells infected with viruses or bacteria. OperationsThe data for this experiment will come fr om blood samples taken befor e and after flight. Thr ee blood samples will be taken \u2014 10 days befor e flight, on the day of r eturn to Earth, and 23 days after r eturn. The only r estriction given to the astr onauts is that they must r ecord any medication taken. Once isolated fr om blood samples, these cells will be tested for any alteration in function. Earlier Studies Similar studies performed befor e and after shorter mis - sions (lasting 5 to 1 1 days) have shown a decr ease in the function of neutr ophils and monocytes immediately befor e and after space flight when compar ed to non-astr onauts. This suggests that astr o- nauts ar e str essed befor e launch and after flight when returning back to Earth. These ef fects may also be dependent on mission length. Previous studies per - formed on Apollo, Skylab , and Shuttle missions have studiedthe adaptive arm of the immune system. While NKcells wer e previously studied by Russian inves tigators, this is the first study to investigate the neutr ophils and monocytes of the innate immune system. This STS-107 study examines how the complex space flight envir onment af fects the functions of immune cells befor e and after the mission. This contributes to our ever - maturing understanding of the immune system as itperforms on Earth and in micr ogravity .Immune cells in action: one kind ofa human white blood cell, thelymphocyte, is shown her e. Backgr ound Information FS-2002-03-052-JSC 51 Your body protects you from illness with its own security system \u2014 the immune system. This system keeps illness at bay not only by mounting a defenseagainst foreign organisms, but also by controlling thepopulation of bacteriaand viruses that nor-mally live in yourbody. But noneed panic: bodywithout causing ill-ness. Some bacteriaare even beneficial\u2014like the E. coli in the large intestine that arean important source ofvitamin K. While viruses are not exactly consid-ered beneficial, theycan also inhabit thehuman body is virustype 1 (HSV1), more commonly known as coldsores or fever blisters. This virus infects 70 to 80percent of all adults but remains latent much ofthe time. While latent, the virus within cellsremains dormant. Activation of the dormant virus causes it to make copies of itself (known as replica- tion) constantly\u2014detectable in body fluids suchas urine or saliva in a process called shedding.When a person becomes sick or stressed, however,this weakened condition allows the virus toreactivate and multiply. These elevated levelsmay be enough to produce symptoms, but shed-ding can also occur without symptoms. Thisability to shed without showing signs of infection,or asymptomatic shedding, is of great interest, asit increases the chances of infecting others. The stresses associated with space flight \u2014 adapting to microgravity, isolation from familyand friends, living and working in a confinedspace, sleep deprivation, and busy schedules, toname but a few \u2014 may weaken astronauts'immune systems, leaving them at greater risk ofviral reactivation. Members of the STS-107 crewwill participate in this experiment, Incidence ofLatent Viral Shedding in Space Flight, to help sci-entists understand how reactivation works inspace, and at what level replication reaches beforesymptoms begin to show. This study also prom-ises more insight into the behavior of the largervirus family, herpesvirus, which will help usunderstand how to prevent infection in populationson Earth and reactivation in those already infected. Maintaining the Body's Immune System Incidence of Latent Virus Shedding During Space Flight http://spaceresearch.nasa.govEarth Benefits and Applications Better understanding of latent virus shedding, which affects pop- ulations on Earth, will improve approaches for minimizing shedding and further infecting others This molecular approach may be a rapid and reliable tool for early detection of stress and diminished immunity This technology may provide clinically relevant data to help patients suffering from chronic and acute stress Viral monitoring may lead to early intervention that minimizes adverse health effects of acute and chronic stress.

Exercise is one way to counter the negativeeffects of space flight.STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics andSpace Administration 52 Science Roughly 80 million people in the United States ar e infected with the herpes vir us, which is the leading infec - tious cause of blindness. While we do not fully understand how vir uses establish latency and later become r eactivated, we do know that a weakening of the immune systemincreases the incidence (how often people ar e affected) and duration (how long they ar e affected) of viral r eactivation and shedding. The r esults of this study will help develop treatments for fighting vir uses and for r educing the spr ead of latent vir uses on Earth as well as in space. Additionally , scientists will consider other questions: What ar e the levels for latent shedding, and how much does it dif fer between indi - viduals? At what level of reactivation does the virus pr oduce symp - toms? Since astr onauts rely on medical car e from physicians on Earth, finding answers to these questions andminimizing health risksare critical for success. With this study , sci- entists will test theirhypothesis that the inci and duration ofvirus reactivation and shedding will incr ease in flight. Astr face any num - ber of str esses befor e and during their mission, which can weaken their immune systems; scientists ther efore expect to see a higher count of vir uses during space flight as com - pared to befor e or after . In addition, scientists will compar e the astr onauts' data to data collected fr om a contr ol gr oup of people who r emain on Earth to show whether the shed - ding in astr onauts is dif ferent fr om the general earthbound population. Space flight may well be a major factor in viralreactivation and this study will help validate this hypothesis. The vir uses of inter est in this investigation belong to the herpesvir us gr oup, which is the most r eadily detectable of all latent vir uses. The tar geted strains ar e the herpes sim - plex vir us types 1 and type 2, cytomegalovir us, varicella zoster vir us, and Epstein-Barr vir us. Operations For this study , astr onauts give samples of saliva and urine, and blood\u2014the body fluids into which vir uses ar e shed\u2014at various times befor e, during, and after flight accor ding to the schedule shown in the following table. Saliva and urine samples ar e analyzed for the pr esence of the four herpesvir uses using an analytic pr ocess called the polymerase chain r eaction (PCR), which allows the detection and counting of both symptomatic and asympto - matic vir us shedding. T o test blood samples, scientists use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . This test will r eveal the levels of antibody generated against the four vir uses,indicating how active or weak the immune system is.Antibody levels befor e flight can be compar ed to levels after flight, showing how each astr onaut's immune system changed. These r esults ar e also compar ed to those fr om the ground-based population, to determine if space flight and its str essors played a detectable r ole. Earlier Results Earlier studies fr om short-duration (Space Shuttle) and long-duration (Russian space station Mir) flights support the scientists' hypothesis of incr eased r eactivation and shedding during space flight, in some cases incr eased by eight- to ten-fold. These r esults wer e also supported by findings fr om analogous envir onments on Earth, such as Antar ctic winter excursions and closed-chamber studies. These data give an indication that space flight and analo - gous envir onments on Earth do indeed have some r ole in viral r eactivation. Approximate location of this payload aboar d STS-107.

Microbes fill every niche in the world\u2014from 20 miles below the Earth's surface to 20 milesabove, and at temperatures from less than -20 \u00b0Cto hotter than water's boiling point. These organ-isms are ubiquitous because they can adaptquickly to changing environments, an effectivestrategy for survival. Although we may not realize it, microbes impact every aspect of our lives. Bacteria andfungi help us break down the food in our bodies,and they help clean the air and water around us.They can also cause the dark, filmy buildup onthe shower curtain as well as, more seriously, ill-ness and disease. Since humans and microbesshare space on Earth, we can benefit tremen-dously from a better understanding of theworkings and physiology of the microbes. Thisinsight can help prevent any harmful effects onhumans, on Earth and in space, as well as reap thebenefits they provide. Space flight is a unique environment to study how microbes adapt to changing environmentalconditions. To advance ground-based research inthe field of microbiology, this STS-107 experimentwill investigate how microgravity affects bacteriaand fungi. Of particular interest are the growthrates and how they respond to certain antimicro-bial substances that will be tested; the same testswill be conducted on Earth at the same times.Comparing the results obtained in flight to thoseon Earth, we will be able to examine how micro-gravity induces physiological changes in themicrobes.

Fr om this knowledge, we have developed antimicr obial agents and antibiotic tr eatments. This does not mean, however , that we have a complete knowledge of micr obial physiology . Bacteria, for example, ar e constantly adapting and may develop r esistance to antimicr obial agents. W ith the rise in the last few decades of antibiotic use and coincident r esistance, the mechanisms for developing resistance ar e being studied intensely . We still have much to learn about micr obial physiology and the genetic pr ogram - ming that allows for adaptation to changing conditions. Gravity plays a unique r ole in that it is one envir onmental condition in which all life forms have evolved. In these exper - iments, the absence of gravity will pr esent the micr obes with a challenge that they have not befor e encounter ed. The experiment consists of two separate micr obial studies: one with bacteria (four species) and fungi (four species) assubjects, and the other with fungi alone (two species). Bothstudies follow the same pr ocedur es and use the same har d- ware. Their investigators ar e looking for the same data parameters \u2014 gr owth, use of components of the gr owth medium (dif ferent nitr ogen and r eac- tion to antimicr obial agents \u2014 to of micr ogravity on the micr oorganisms. These studies will continue during a second phase in futur e flights to test the micr obes against specific formulations of gr owth media and obials. Hardwar e These studies measur e micr obial gr owth during flight using a device called the automated micr obial analysis sys - tem (AMS), a ument manufactur ed by bioM\u00e9rieux V itek, Inc., that has been adapted for space flight. Befor e flight, the bacterial and fungal strains to be tested ar e intr oduced, or inoculated, to car ds containing the various gr owth media or antimicr obial agents being tested. These car ds ar e refrigerated, sealed, and placed onto car d trays to minimize the handling of the test cultur es by crewmembers. This measur e ensur es the health of the cr ew was well as pr eserving the integrity of the experiment. Once the car ds containing the test strains have beenloaded into the AMS, its heater and cir culation fan maintain constant incubator temperatur es for micr obial gr owth. The optical array of the AMS measur es the optical density of each micr obial sample, indicating the population and growth over time. Alaptop computer serves as the interface between cr ewmembers and the AMS and also saves the data for analysis after flight. Operations The experiment will begin on the first day of flight with the setup and activation of the AMS. The six car d trays for bacterial and fungal testing will be loaded into the AMS and tested in 24-hour incubation cycles for days one thr ough six on orbit. The car d trays for fungal testing alone will be loaded and tested in 48-hourincubation cycles for daysseven thr ough ten. T o pr o- duce contr ol data, identical procedur es will be per - formed simultaneously onthe gr ound with the same card populations. By com - paring the data obtained inflight with those on Earth,resear chers will be able to home in on the physiological response to micr ogravity .

Columbia 55 STS-107:Space Research and You Building Muscles, Keeping Muscles Protein Turnover During Space Flight As we age we lose muscle mass and strength. The problem is a matter of use it or lose it and more \u2014 a fact to which any active senior can attest. An imbalance in the natural cycle of protein turn-over may be a contributing factor to decreasedmuscle mass. But the answer is not so simple,since aging is associated with changes in hormones,activity levels, nutrition, and often, disease. The human body constantly uses amino acids to build muscle protein, which then breaks downand must be replaced. When protein turnovergets out of balance, so that more protein breaksdown than the body can replace, the result is mus-cle loss. This is not just the bane of aging,however. Severely burned people may have diffi-culty building new muscle long after the burnedskin has been repaired. Answers to why we lose muscle mass and strength \u2014 and how doctors can fix it \u2014 maycome from space. Astronauts usually eat a well-balanced diet and maintain an exercise routine tostay in top health. During long-duration flight,they exercise regularly to reduce the muscle lossthat results from being in a near-weightless envi-ronment. Despite these precautions, astronautslose muscle mass and strength during most mis-sions. They quickly recover after returning toEarth \u2014 this is a temporary condition in an other-wise healthy population. Members of the STS-107 crew are participat- ing in a study of the effects of space flight,hormone levels, and stress on protein turnover.When we are under stress, the body responds with a change in hormone levels. Researchers hypothe- size that this stress-induced change in hormonesalong with the near-weightlessness might result inthe body synthesizing less muscle protein, causingmuscles to lose their strength and size. Astronauts, whomust perform numerous duties in a confined andunusual environment, experience some stress duringtheir flight, making them excellent candidates fortesting the researchers' hypothesis.National Aeronautics and Space Administration Principal Investigator: Dr. Arny Ferrando, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TXProject Scientist: Dr. Jacob Bloomberg, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TXProject Manager : Angie Lee, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX http://spaceresearch.nasa.govMission Specialist Scott Parazynski takes a blood sample fromU.S. Senator John Glenn, Jr., during STS-95. Senator Glennand Mission Specialist Pedro Duque were the first to partici-pate in the protein turnover study. Data collected duringSTS-107 will be added to that from STS-95. Earth Benefits and Applications Hormone models derived from missions mean better treatments for muscle atrophy on Earth. Hormone therapy may be more than a treatment for post- menopausal women; it may be the route to healthier muscles for the aging population, people with metabolic problems, and astronauts. 56 Backgr ound Information Science Muscle pr otein is always being cr eated and br oken down. If something disr upts this pr ocess, by decr easing the formation of new muscle, or speeding up the br eakdown of existing muscle, we lose muscle. It usually is part of aging and can af fect people with metabolic pr oblems, but it is tr eatable. Testoster one incr eases lean body mass and pr omotes muscle development during puberty . As we age, testos - terone levels normally decr ease fr om youthful levels. Str ess and lack of physical activity may also cause a r eduction in testoster one. Cortisol, a ster oid pr oduced by the adr enal glands incr eases as we age. T oo much cortisol in the blood - stream can cause the muscles to lose much of their amino acid content. The muscle pr oteins loose these amino acids, which ar e used instead to make glucose in the liver . This may cause diabetes r esult- ing fr om incr eased blood glucose levels, but alsomeans an additional lossof muscle pr otein. During space flight, a decr ease in testos- terone and an incr ease in cortisol may be muscle mass. Resear chers will examine the ef fects of str ess, hor - monal levels, and pr otein turnover in astr onauts. By studying the r elationship between alter ed hormonal levels and changes in pr o- tein turnover caused bythe str esses of space flight, r esear chers can apply this informationtowar d preventing muscle loss in astr onauts. Operations Two months befor e determine astr onaut's lean body mass. Blood sam - ples ar e taken over thr ee days, starting 60 days befor e launch. Befor e breakfast, astr onauts give their first sample, and then they ar e given an alanine capsule containing a tracer chemical. Alanine is an amino acid that transports nitrogen thr oughout the body . By measuring the alanine and tracer in the blood, r esear chers know how quickly the body is cr eating muscle. T welve hours after the first cap - sule, astr onauts take 3-methylhistidine capsule labeled with a tracer . Thr ee-methylhistidine, an amino acid pr oduced when muscle is br oken down, is used to determine the rate of pr otein br eakdown. Another blood sample is taken 10 minutes later .The sampling pr ocess is conducted twice befor e launch, twice during flight, and twice mor e after landing. DEXA whole-body images ar e collected befor e and after flight. Astr onauts log everything they eat, medications they take, and exer cise they do. W omen also note wher e they ar e in their menstr ual cycle. Findings fr om STS-107 will be com - pared to data fr om similar tests on the gr ound. Earlier Results Studies focusing on healthy , active men suggest that muscle loss in older individuals may r esult fr om the body's inability to makemuscle pr oteins. This may be a r esult of hormone imbalance, lack of physi - cal activity , or poor nutrition. Furthermor e, men over 60 with lowtestoster one levels who take supplements tomaintain normal levelshave incr eased muscle volume and impr oved strength within months of beginning tr eatment. Burn patients also experiencebetter muscle developmentwith testoster har ness while exer cising aboar d the International Space Station . Approximate location of this payload aboar d STS-107. FS-2002-03-053-JSC Loss of muscle can af fect mobility and independence. A well-balanced diet and moderate exer cise, combined with hormone therapy only if needed,may help the elderly and people withmetabolic illnesses maintain andimprove their str ength. Columbia 57 Renal stones, popularly known as kidney or bladder stones, are small rock-like objects formed in the kidneys or urinary tract by deposits of cal-cium and other minerals. The problem ariseswhen the stones block the drainage of the kidney,resulting in urinary obstruction and pain. Passingthese stones can be one of the most painful expe-riences a person will endure so doctors oftenprescribe pain relievers to ease the experience. Drinking plenty of fluids, which help flush waste out of the body, and eating a well-balanceddiet are the first steps to preventing stones. Forindividuals at risk, this may not be enough, and adoctor may recommend a special diet and med-ications. Unfortunately, approximately 60 percentof people who have had a renal stone will experi-ence a recurrence. This is particularly true of men,who are four to five times more likely to developstones than women. Renal stones do not discrim-inate based on age; even children are at risk. Astronauts are particularly at risk of develop- ing renal stones because they lose bone andmuscle mass; calcium, other minerals, and proteinnormally used for bone and muscle end up in thebloodstream and then in the kidneys. Withoutplenty of fluid to wash them away, crystals canform and then grow into stones. This factor com-pounds the risk for astronauts, since they alsoperceive that they are less thirsty in space and willdrink less than normal during the mission. Tominimize all of these factors, doctors must insteadtreat the stone-forming compounds with medica-tion. This study will use potassium citrate toreduce the risk of stone formation. Renal stones are never convenient, but they are a particular concern for astronauts who havelimited access to treatment during flight.Researchers are examining how earthboundpreventions for renal stone formation work inflight, ensuring missions are not ended prema-turely due to this medical condition. DuringSTS-107, earthbound preventions and treatmentsbecome astronauts' gain.

Usually , if a person drinks enough water , this diluted waste is washed out as urine. However , painful r enal stones occasionally form. Changes in diet (in the United States, vegetarians ar e half as likely as meat-eaters to develop stones) and an increase in fluids can minimize stones, but for some, these pr ecautions ar e not enough. Anumber of med - ical conditions, such asosteopor osis and hyper cal- curia, also incr ease calcium and other minerals in urineand cannot be corr ected with diet alone. Potassium citrate, used in the STS-107 study , is a common pr eventive treatment for r enal stones. Citrate binds to calcium in the urine, pr eventing the calcium fr om crystallizing and developing into a stone. Citrate also makes the urine lessacidic, r educing the risk of uric acid stones. By testing potassium citrate on astr onauts, who have no medical con - ditions other than exposur e to space to be at risk for stones, resear chers examine the dir ect ef fect of the medication on excess minerals and the potential development of stones. Operations During STS-107, each cr ewmember r eceives a packet of pills. They take two pills at dinnertime, beginning thr ee days befor e launch and ending 14 days after landing. The crewmembers also log everything they eat or drink, when they exer cise, and what medication they take. They pr ovide samples using urine collection kits. After flight, r esear chers measur e how much urine each crewmember voided during the mission and examine it for stone-forming chemicals, such as calcium and sodium. They also check the urine's pH, to see if the potassium cit - rate raised the pH to a less acidic value. The STS-107 datawill be compar ed with r esults obtained fr om International Space Station (ISS) missions. Participation by the ISS Expedition Thr ee cr ewmembers, who wer e in space for sev - eral months, helps r esear chers determine the ef fectiveness of potassium citrate over a longer period of time. Hardwar e Each urine collection kit comes with a urine collection device (UCD) designed for either men or women. Each UCD contains lithium chloride, which acts as a volumemarker when it is filled. By measuring the amount oflithium in the urine sample, r esear chers determine how much urine the astr onaut pr oduced during flight. The astr o- naut uses a syringe to r emove a small sample fr om the UCD. Both the UCD and the syringe sample ar e closed in aleak-pr oof container and stor ed at r oom temperatur e until the end of the flight, when they ar e returned to a laboratory for car eful analysis. Earlier Results While in space, astr onauts have an incr eased risk of developing stones due to 1) the excess salts and minerals intheir bodies, 2) the fact that they drink less fluids, and 3) thelower volume of urine pr oduced. Earlier studies show that drinking extra fluid after flight, during the period whenastronauts ar e readjusting to normal gravity , helps r educe the risk of r enal stones. Drinking extra fluid inflight, however , simply washes the excess saltsand minerals into thekidneys, incr easing the astronauts' risk makesmedication, such aspotassium citrate, themost pr omising way to stop stone formation. On the gr ound, potassium citrate, com - bined with a car efully regulated diet, has shown promising r esults in reducing the risk of stone formation. For those withstones, taking potassiumcitrate can significantlyreduce the r ecurr ence of a renal stone. Stones can form in the kidney , ureter, and bladder . New tr eatments involving medication, ultrasound , or other non-invasive methods allowdoctors to br eak up larger stones that cannot pass thr ough the ur eter.

An important wayfor humans to remedy fatigue and maintain alert-ness is to get plenty of rest. Astronauts, however,commonly experience difficulty sleeping whilein space. During flight, they may also experiencedisruption of the body's circadian rhythm \u2014 thenatural phases the body goes through every dayas we oscillate between states of high activity dur-ing the waking day and recuperation, rest, andrepair during nighttime sleep. Both of these factors areassociated with impairment of alertness and per-formance, which could have important consequencesduring a mission in space. The human body was designed to sleep at night and be alert and active during the day. Wereceive these cues from the time of day or amountof light, such as the rising or setting of the sun.However, in the environment of the Space Shuttleor the International Space Station where light lev-els are highly variable, the characteristics of a24-hour light/dark cycle are not present to cuethe astronauts' bodies about what time of the dayit is. Astronauts orbiting Earth see a sunset andsunrise every 90 minutes, sending potentially dis-ruptive signals to the area of the brain thatregulates sleep. On STS-107, researchers will measure sleep- wake activity with state-of-the-art technologyto quantify how much sleep astronauts obtainin space. Because light is the most powerful timecue to the body's circadian system, individuallight exposure patterns of the astronauts will alsobe monitored to determine if light exposure isassociated with sleep disruption. The results of this research could lead to thedevelopment of a new treatment for sleep distur-bances, enabling crewmembers to avoid thedecrements in alertness and performance due tosleep deprivation. What we learn about sleep inspace informs treatment for earthbound popula-tions, such as the elderly and insomniacs, whoexperience frequent sleep disturbances or alteredsleep patterns.

Scott Altman, mission commander for STS-109, sleeps on the flight deck of the Space Shuttle Columbia . http://spaceresearch.nasa.govSTS-107:Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration 60 Backgr ound Information Science Astr onauts will wear a light-r ecording and activity- monitoring device called the Actilight watch for the duration of the mission. Data on sleep-wake activity and light exposur e patterns obtained during flight will be com - pared with those measur ed for two weeks on Earth, appr oximately 90 days prior to flight. This will allow r esear chers to compar e how much the astr o- nauts slept in space versus howmuch they sleep normally . Astr o- nauts will also wear the Actilight watch for the 1 1 days immediately prior to launch to determine ifastronauts sleep less prior to flight. Recovery fr om space flight will also be assessed for one week fol - lowing landing. Each astr onaut will also fill out a sleep log each morning. Thelogs ar e their subjective evaluation of the amount and quality of sleep.If an astr onaut r eports that his or her sleep was disturbed, questions in the log addr ess the cause of the disturbance. The astr o- nauts will also r eport how much caf feine they consumed or if they took medication, as both could impact sleep. Hardwar e The Actilight watch and a sleep log will be used for each astr onaut in the study . The Actilight watch is a flight- appr oved version of the Actiwatch-L product, made by Mini-Mitter , Inc. This device r esembles a small wristwatch and measur es the wear er's activity and exposur e to ambient light. It is power ed by a lithium manganese battery and can r ecord data for about 30 days. The sleep log is a har d copy booklet.Operations The cr ewmembers will don their Actilight watches as soon as possible in flight, and simply wear them continu - ously on their non-dominant wrists outside of their sleeves. The watches can be r emoved temporarily for specific activ - ities, such as a spacewalk. Upon landing they will turn inthe watches for analysis. In addition, each cr ewmember will complete a sleep log every day , recording how long they slept and rating the quality of sleep and how alert they feel. Baseline data will be collected befor e and after the flight using the same methods. Comparison of the dataobtained in flight to baseline data will indicate to scient-ists the changes in astr onauts' sleep-wake cycle and light exposur e patterns. Earlier Results The r esults of pr evious r esear ch on both short- and long-duration space missions suggest that appr oximately 25 per cent of cr ewmembers experience dramatic impair - ment of amount and/or qualityof sleep. Hypnotic medica - tions ar e the most fr equently administer ed medications after the first several days in flight.This suggests that insomnia isa pr evalent symptom among astronauts.

Columbia 61 Deciphering the Role of Desert Dust in the Climate Puzzle The Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) http://spaceresearch.nasa.govNumerous studies have shown that aerosol par- ticles may be one of the primary agents that can offset the climate warming induced by the increasein the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases.Desert aerosols are probably the most abundant andmassive type of aerosol particles that are presentin the atmosphere worldwide. These aerosols are carried over large distances and have various global impacts. They interact withclouds, impact the efficiency of their rain produc-tion and change their optical properties. They con-stitute one of the primary sources of minerals foroceanic life and influence the health of coral reefs.They have direct effects on human health, especiallyby inducing breathing difficulties in children. It waslately discovered that desert particles carry patho-gens from the Sahara desert over the Atlantic Ocean, a fact that may explain the migration of certaintypes of diseases. Aerosols not only absorb solar radiation but also scatter it, so that their climatic effect is influencednot only by their physical properties and heightdistribution but also by the reflectivity of the under-lying surface. This latter property changes greatlyover land and is low over ocean surfaces. Aerosol plumes are emitted from discrete, sporadic sources in the desert areas of the world and are trans-ported worldwide by the atmosphere's wind systems.For example, Saharan dust reaches Mexico City,Florida, Ireland, Switzerland and the Mediterraneanregion, while Asian dust reaches Alaska, Hawaii andthe continental United States. This means that in orderto assess its global effects, one must observe dust from Principal Investigators: Prof. Zev Levin and Prof. Joachim Joseph, Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences, Tel-AvivUniversity, Israel Project Scientists: Prof. Yuri Mekler, Dr. Peter Israelevich, Dr. Eli Ganor, Tel-Aviv University, Israel Participating NASA Scientists: Dr. Ernest Hilsenrath and Dr. Scott Janz, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD Payload Manager: Dr. Adam Devir, Tel-Aviv University, Israel; Maj.

The Space Shuttle is a unique platform, because it flies over the major deserts of our planet, enablingmeasurements and remote sensing of the aerosolsas they travel from source to sink regions. Suchefforts must always be accompanied by in-situ datafor validation and calibration, with direct samplingof the airborne particles. MEIDEX is a joint projectof the Israel Space Agency (ISA) and NASA, undera cooperation agreement between the two agencies. Three primary study areas for MEIDEX. The upper edge of Area I is the northern limit of Columbia's orbit. The long-range impact of the Saharan dry season can be seen infour days of images taken by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, June 15-18, 1999. The color scale shows the aerosol index from red (heaviest amounts of dust present) to green(the thinnest present). Under the darkest red the amount of ultraviolet sunlight is reduced to half its normal value, while under the green areas, UV sunlight is reduced by about 20 percent. 62 Columbia aibmuloC Approximate location of MEIDEX aboard STS-107.Background Information NP-2002-5-289-HQScience The primary mission of the Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) is to study the temporal and spatial distribution and physical properties of atmospheric desert aerosols over North Africa, the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. This aim is achieved by a remotesensing experiment operated by the astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle. The second aim of the MEIDEX will be the inter-calibration of two primary current methods for theremote investigation of desert aerosols. Spectral channels of the MEIDEX radiometric camera combine in one multispec- tral camera, two wavelengths of the Total Ozone MappingSpectrometer instrument in the ultraviolet band and four of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (on the Terra satellite) in the visible and near-infrared parts of thesolar spectrum. These remote measurements will be complemented by airborne in-situ measurements of aerosol properties such assize distributions and chemical composition as well as other atmospheric parameters. Research flights will be conducted daily by a team of scientists in an instrumented airplanebased in Sicily, when the Shuttle passes over the Mediterra- nean Sea. The co-location and simultaneity of Shuttle, air- craft and ground-based correlated data will enable thevalidation of the remote space based observations. Forecast models will be used in order to predict the location and extent of dust clouds. The output of the remote sensing experiment will be sequences of images of the target areas. In order to derivethe desert aerosol properties from these images, the radiancefrom each pixel in an image will be analyzed. The problemof finding desert aerosol parameters will be the inversion ofradiative transfer equations for a scattering and absorbingatmosphere above the surface with the given bi-directional reflection distribution functions (BDRF). Special computer models will be used to solve this problem. Hardware The payload consists of a radiometric camera (Xybion IMC-201) equipped with six narrow-band filters centered at 340 nm, 380 nm, 470 nm, 555 nm, 660 nm, and 860 nm. The Xybion camera has a field of view of 10.7 \u00d7 14.0, with a nadir footprint (looking straight down) of 52 \u00d7 68 km. It is boresighted with a second, wide (60 \u00b0) field of view video camera that functions as a viewfinder. Both cameras aremounted on a special gimbaled truss housed inside a pres- surized Getaway Special canister with a coated quartz win- dow. The truss can be tilted 22 \u00b0 to each side; this enables the crew to point the cameras to targets not directly below the Shuttle ground-track. Images from the cameras are recorded on three digital video recorders in the canister and insidethe crew cabin. The MEIDEX canister is located on the aft side of FREESTAR in the payload bay.

Sea-Surface Bi-Directional Reflection Function (BDRF): The BDRF is a crucial parameter in remote sensing and in any prob-lem involving climate and weather. The properties of the oceanBDRF are still a subject of investigation. The sea surfacealbedo will be measured directly by instruments aboard the air-craft, and measured from space by the MEIDEX cameras whenthere are no clouds or dust in the area. 63 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Localized Exhaust (SIMPLEX) SIMPLEX is a Department of Defense experiment that observes shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System engine burns. The orbiter OMS thruster firings are used to create ionospheric disturbances for observation by the SIMPLEX radars. There is no flight hardware associated with this payload. The SIMPLEX radars are located at: 1) Arecibo, Puerto Rico, 2) Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, 3) Millstone Hill, Mass., 4) Jicamarc a, Peru, and 5) the Very Large Array near Socorro, N.M. The purpose of SIMPLEX is to determine the source of Very High Frequency (VHF) radar echoes caused by the Orbiter's OMS engines. On STS-107 a burn will be performed over the VLA. 64 STS-107:Space Research and You The ozone layer above Earth is our planet's fragile sunscreen, protecting people, vegetation, and wildlife. NASA has been measuring ozonefor more than 20 years by looking down, butSOLSE-2 will show that more information isavailable by looking at ozone from the side, atEarth's limb or atmospheric boundary. When the ozone layer is compromised, increased ultraviolet (UV) levels from the suncause health problems ranging from severe sun-burns to skin cancer and cataracts. A concertedglobal effort has been made to reduce or eliminatethe production of chemicals that deplete ozone,but the ozone layer is not expected to recover formany decades because these chemicals can remainactive in the atmosphere for up to 100 years. We know now that ozone monitoring needs to be focused in the lower stratosphere. The discovery ofthe ozone hole in 1985 demonstrated that very largechanges in ozone were occurring in the lower strato-sphere near 20 km, instead of the upper stratosphereas first expected, and where current ozone instru-ments are focused. Measuring ozone from a tangen-tial perspective that is centered at the limb providesozone profiles concentrated in the lower stratosphere. The first flight of SOLSE proved that this technique achieves the accuracy and coverage oftraditional measurements, and surpasses the altitude resolution and depth of retrieval of con-ventional techniques. Results from the first flightconvinced the science community to design thenext generation ozone monitoring satellite basedon SOLSE. The Ozone Mapping and ProfilingSuite (OMPS) is currently being built for theNPOESS satellite. The primary objective ofSOLSE-2 is to confirm the promising results of the first flight over a wider range of viewingconditions and spectral wavelengths. Sometimes a really hard problem can be solved when you look at it from a different angle!While scientists conduct research, protect your-self by observing the UV index and spend lessunprotected time outdoors.National Aeronautics andSpace Administration Looking at Ozone From a New Angle Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment-2 (SOLSE-2) http://spaceresearch.nasa.govThis illustration shows how ozone is seen using light scattered from the Earth's limb. Principal Investigators: Dr. Richard McPeters and Dr. Ernest Hilsenrath, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD Project Scientist: Dr. Scott Janz, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD Project Manager: Tammy Brown, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 65 Science SOLSE demonstrates a conventional ozone measuring technique fr om a new perspective in or der to focus on the stratospher e. The atmospher e scatters UV radiation fr om the sun back into space. When viewed fr om above, as current ozone monitoring instr uments do, this is called \"backscatter .\" Backscatter ed measur ements cannot r esolve ozone down to the lower stratospher e wher e ozone levels ar e changing the most. Limb scatter ed sunlight varies with alti- tude, so that SOLSE can distinguish the altitude distribution with high r esolution into the lower stratospher e. Strato- spheric ozone depletion is a global concern because the ozonelayer ther e keeps 95 per cent of the UV radiation fr om striking the Earth. High altitude r esolution and global coverage ar e necessary to r educe the uncertainty of the ozone tr ends derived fr om the measur ement. Limbscatter ed measur ements will also incr ease the capability of atmospheric models to evaluate other factors in ozone depletion. The Shuttle pr ovides the perfect testbed to demonstrate new technology and measur ement techniques without committing the funds for a flight instr ument. Once pr oven over a wider range of viewing conditions, the SOLSE technique will be used to r outinely measur e ozone by the next generation weather satellites. NASA, NOAA, and theDepartment of Defense form the Integrated Pr ogram Of fice (IPO) that funds the SOLSE-2 demonstration as a riskreduction for OMPS.Backgr ound designed to pr oduce high quality 2-dimensional images of the limb in visible and UV light while minimizing internal stray light. Aholographic grating disperses the image of the limb into a spectr um that is focused onto a CCD array of 1024 \u00b7 1024 pixels. The back- thinned array is sensitive to UV and visible wavelengths.The optical slit is masked with a linear attenuation filterthat normalizes the intensity of the limb that varies by a fac - tor of 100 fr om top to bottom. Ashutter contr ols the exposur e of each frame. The Limb Ozone Retrieval Experiment (LORE) is a complementary filter wheel imagingphotometer with a linear diode array detector . The filter wheel housing encloses 6 ion-assisted deposition filters at UVand visible wavelengths. T ogether , SOLSE and LORE r etrievals span the atmospher e from 15 to 50 km above Earth's surface. Previous Results SOLSE and LORE pr ovided the first r etrieval of stratospheric ozone by limb scattering as a Shuttle payload on STS-87 in1997. The r esults fr om the first flight demonstrated that limb sounding of ozone can achieve 1-3 km altitude r esol- ution down to 15 km. The spectral coverage of SOLSE was changed for the r eflight to include visible wavelengths in addition to UV to achieve LORE's depth of r etrieval, which clearly detected the edge of the tr opospher e. The gr ound track of STS-107 is limited to 39 \u00b0latitude north and south, but higher latitude coverage will be simulated with Shuttlemaneuvers to observe the poles and seasonal patterns to verifythe limb-viewing technique over wider viewing conditions.

Earth will gain more heat and hence the temperature will rise. Another perturbation of the balance can occur through variation of the amount of energy emittedby the sun. When the sun emits more energy, thiswill directly cause a rise of temperature on Earth. For a long time scientists believed that the energy emitted by the sun was constant. The \"solar constant\"is defined as the amount of solar energy received perunit surface at a distance of one astronomical unit (theaverage distance of Earth's orbit) from the sun. Accu-rate measurements of the variations of the solar con-stant have been made since 1978. From these we knowthat the solar constant varies approximately with the 11-year solar cycle observed in other solar phenom- ena, such as the occurrence of sunspots, dark spotsthat are sometimes visible on the solar surface. Whena sunspot occurs on the sun, since the spot is dark,the radiation (light) emitted by the sun drops instan-taneously. Oddly, periods of high solar activity, whena lot of sunspot numbers increase, correspond toperiods when the average solar constant is high. Thisindicates that the background on which the sunspotsoccur becomes brighter during high solar activity.STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Measuring Solar Radiation Incident on Earth Solar Constant-3 (SOLCON-3) http://spaceresearch.nasa.govLife on Earth is possible because the climate conditions on Earth are relatively mild. One ele- ment of the climate on Earth, the temperature, isdetermined by the heat exchanges between theEarth and its surroundings, outer space. The heatexchanges take place in the form of electromagneticradiation. The Earth gains energy because it absorbssolar radiation, and it loses energy because it emitsthermal infrared radiation to cold space. The heat exchanges are in balance: the heat gained by the Earth through solar radiation equals the heat lost through thermal radiation. When the balanceis perturbed, a temperature change and hence a cli- mate change of the Earth will occur. One possible perturbation of the balance is the CO 2 greenhouse effect: when the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases, this will r educe the loss Variation of the solar constant with time since 1978. The varia- tion has a of period of approximately 11 years. The downwardspikes correspond to the occurrence of dark sunspots which mark the height of the solar cycle. Some dark sunspots are visible on the background image of the sun.136213631364136513661367136813691370 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000TSI (W/m 2)SARR Total Solar Developer and Initiator: Dr. Dominique Crommelynck, Royal Me- teorological Institute of Belgium, Brussels Principal Investigator: Dr. Alexandre Joukoff, Royal Meteorologi- cal Institute of Belgium, Brussels Project Scientist: Dr. Steven Dewitte, Royal Meteorological Insti- tute of Belgium, Brussels Project Manager: Andre Chevalier, Royal Meteorological Institute of clouds landand oceans 51%Conduction andrising air 7%Earth's Energy Budget Earth gains energy through solar radiation and loses energy through thermal infrared radiation lost to space.

SOLCON measures the solar irradiance from space to avoid perturbations by the atmosphere of the earth. SOLCON is used as a reference to construct a long duration time series of the solar irradiance.Science To know the influence of the sun on climate changes on Earth, it is necessary to make long-term, accurate measure- ments of the solar constant. The most accurate measurements can be made from space, thus avoiding perturbations by Earth's atmosphere. A number of instruments to measurethe solar constant have been flown since 1978 on satellites. Each of these satellite instruments has a limited lifetime. As the different instruments measure a different mean levelof the solar constant, and as their measurements have to be combined into one single time series of the solar constant, a common reference, the Space Absolute Radiometric Refer-ence (SARR), has been defined. It provides, for each indi- vidual instrument, a SARR adjustment coefficient to bring all the different instruments to the same mean level. The SOLCON instrument is a reference instrument for the measurement of the solar constant. It is flown regularlyduring short periods on the Space Shuttle. During shuttle flights SOLCON is used to determine the SARR adjustment coefficients of the satellite instruments that are active at thesame time. Instrument Principle The SOLCON radiometer is the first differential abso- lute solar radiometer in space, developed at the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium. Basically solar radiationis measured through absorption in a cavity covered with black paint. The SOLCON radi- ometer's core is formedby two blackened cavi- ties constructed side byside on a common heat sink. In between each cavity and the heat sinka heat flux transducer is mounted. The difference between the two trans-ducers' outputs gives a differential heat mea- surement. This measure-ment principle is analo- gous to a household pair of scales which give a dif-ferential measurement of weight. Both cavity chan- nels are equipped witha shutter in fr ont to block or admit light to the cavity. In the openshutter phase, solar radiation flowsinto the cavity through a precisionaperture and is absorbed. Besides the heating of the cavity by the sun, the cavity can be heated electricallytrough a resistor. Equilibrium between the two cavity heat fluxes is maintained bya regulating servo system. In the de- fault measurement sequence a con- stant electrical power is fed into onecavity, the \"reference\" cavity, while its shutter remains closed. The elec- trical power in the other cavity, the\"measurement\" cavity, is regulated continuously, while its shutter sequentially opens and closes (bothopen and close phases take 90 sec- onds). When the instrument is pointed at the sun, the equilibriumelectrical power in the measurement cavity drops proportionally to the absorbed solar power when goingfrom the closed to the open phase. Accurate electrical power measurements are obtained by separate measurement of the voltage over and the currentthrough both cavity heating resistors. The basic measurement of the solar radiative flux is proportional to the drop in the measurement cavity electrical power divided by the pre-cision aperture area. Earlier Results The SOLCON type instrument flew on the space shuttle on Spacelab 1 (1983), the Atmospheric Laboratory for Appli- cations and Science missions \u2014 ATLAS 1 (1992), 2 (1993),and 3 (1994) \u2014 and on Hitchiker missions as SOLCON-1 (1997) and -2 (1998). During this last mission, SOLCON was used to determine the SARR adjustment coefficients of theVariability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity (VIRGO) radiometers on the Solar Oscillation and Helio- spheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite, and to verify the SARRadjustment coefficients of the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM 2) and Earth Radiation Budget Satellite instruments. During its flight on Fast ReactionExperiments Enabling Science, Technology, Applications and Research (FREESTAR), SOLCON will be used to determine the SARR adjustment coefficient of the ACRIM 3 instrument,and to verify the stability of the SARR adjustment coefficients of the VIRGO radiometers on SOHO.

But this airflow also obscures many of thefundamental processes that we need to understandif we are to fine tune the many ways we controlcombustion in manufacturing, transportation, heat-ing, fire safety and pollution. Conducting combustion experiments in the microgravity environment of orbit eliminates gravi-tational effects and slows many combustion pro-cesses so they become easier to study. Almosteverything about fires changes in microgravity,and many differences are counter-intuitive: Microgravity fires may spread faster upwind than downwind, opposite to the behavior seenon Earth, While fire in space is often weaker than on Earth, flames in microgravity can be sustainedunder more extreme conditions than flames onEarth, and Turbulent flames, thought to be completely independent of gravitational influence, havedoubled in size in microgravity conditions.Professor Gerard Faeth at the University of Michigan has said that these findings show thatgravity has impeded the rational development ofcombustion science much as the atmosphere hasimpeded astronomy. To build on what we have learned from space about combustion, the STS-107 mission will reflythe Combustion Module that flew on the Micro-gravity Sciences Laboratory 1 and 1R (STS-83 and-94) in 1997. Upgraded and designated CM-2, themodule will accommodate three experiments, Laminar Soot Processes (LSP) : Evaluate and predict flame shape and internal structures; determine the nature of the soot emission process; validate new universal equations forsoot and temperature in a flame; and investigate the soot-bursting hypo- thesis. Results will improve ourunderstanding of turbulent flames found in many combustion devices on Earth. Structures of Flame Balls At Low Lewis-Number (SOFBALL-2) : Improve our understanding of the flame ball phenomenon and lean (low fuel) burning combustion; determine theconditions under which they can exist; test predictions of duration; and derive better data for critical modelcomparison. Results will lead to improvements in engine efficiency, reduced emissions, and fire safety. Mist: Measure the effectiveness of fine water mists to extinguish a flame propagating inside a tube to gain a better understanding of the mist fire- suppression phenomenon. What islearned will help us design and build more effective mist fire-suppression systems for use on Earth, as well asin space.STS-107: Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration CM-2 Experiments http://spaceresearch.nasa.govProject Manager: Ann Over, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleve- land, OH Deputy Project Manager: David Frate, NASA Glenn Research Cen- ter, Cleveland, OH CM-2 Science Contact: Dr. David Urban, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OHLaminar Soot Processes (LSP-2), Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number (SOFBALL-2), andWater Mist Fire Suppression Experiment (Mist).

FS-2002-06-070-MSFCCM-2 Background The Combustion Module (CM) is a state-of-the-art space laboratory to let a wide range of users perform combustion experiments in space. Until 1997, combustion experiments were developed for individual experiments. This was time-consum- ing and costly. NASA decided that a better and less expensiveapproach was a reusable, modular combustion facility that could accommodate diverse experiments with the same sup- port hardware and unique Experiment Mounting Structures(EMS). This approach led to the CM. CM-2 Design Most CM-2 subsystems are in a double rack and a single rack standing side-by-side in the SPACEHAB module. Flight spares and EMS's are carried in a Maximum Envelope Stow-age System that is the same size as a double rack. Central to the CM-2, in the double rack, is the Experiment Package, a 90-liter combustion chamber with six ports for three intensi-fied near-infrared cameras, one color camera, and three black and white cameras; a gas chromatograph; crew switches; and thermistors. The Fluid Supply Package, in the single rack, isa complex gas control and distribution system containing 20 composite overwrapped compressed gas bottles. The Videocassette Recorder Package consists of four Hi-8 video recorders. The Exhaust Vent Package includes a blower,canister, and other fluid components for cleanup and evacua- tion of chamber gases. The Dedicated Experiment ProcessorPackage is the main processor for experiment command and control, and connects to the crew laptop (the CM-2 human interface). The Video Interface Package is the primary videointerface for switching, routing, and display. The Diagnostic Processor Package is the video frame grabber and storage sys- tem for digital data. The Power Distribution Package controlsand conditions the power from the Shuttle/SPACEHAB for all CM-2 packages. Finally, the EMS are experiment-unique cham- ber inserts. Each contains an ignition system and specialsensors; the Mist EMS also contains test gases, a water mist generator, and a canister to remove water and carbon monox- ide after each test.CM-2 Statistics Size: Main racks \u2014 2.13 m tall by 1.52 m wide by 0.91 m deep (7\u00d75\u00d73 ft) Weight: Main racks \u2014 835 kg (1840 lb); other CM-2 hardware \u2014 161 kg (355 lb) Subsystems: Eight rack-mounted components, three chamber inserts Power Usage: Average \u2014 419 W (dc);Peak \u2014 543 W (dc) Chamber Size: 40 cm (16 in.) dia. \u00d7 76 cm (30 in.) long; 91 liters (23.4 gal.) empty Cameras: Seven \u2014 one color, three intensified near-infrared, three black and white Lasers: Two sets of low-power beams for LSP and Mist measurements Sensors: Dozens of pressure, temperature, and radiation sensors Gas Analysis: Gas chromatograph determines percent of each kind of gas Gas Bottle Sizes: 21 \u2014 three \u00d7 10 liters, nine \u00d7 3.8 liters, eight \u00d7 0.7 liters, one \u00d7 0.4 liters Gas Bottle Usage: Fourteen SOFBALL mixes, two air, two LSP fuel, three gas chromatographs Software: Three 25 MHz computers, ~35,000 lines of Four VCRs, frame grabber, and two-channel downlink capability; 15.2 cm (6-in.) diagonal screen onboard Data: 13.3 gigabytes storage (20 hard drives/flash memory cartridges) Crew Time: 92 hours Flight Operations Although the flight crew is in the spotlight for shuttle mis- sions, a team of engineers, scientists, and other support per-sonnel on the ground will make it all possible. The CM-2 team, comprising almost 40 engineers and scientists, will work side- by-side with the NASA Johnson Space Center Mission Controlteam in Houston, TX. For STS-107, 16 days of around-the-clock operations are conducted to ensure safety and mission success. The CM-2 experiments timeline spans the entire mission. The LSP experiment includes 15 burns lasting about five minutes each, with active participation by the crew to adjusttest conditions during the burn. The 15 SOFBALL burnsrange from 25 to 167 minutes each, during which the Shuttle is placed in \"free drift\" with no attitude control so that the flame balls float freely inside the combustion chamber. Thecrew checks on the flame balls every ten minutes and adjusts camera gains as needed. The 36 Mist burns are each very short ranging from less than one second to several sec-onds in duration. Mist includes six tests run by the crew and 30 tests run by the ground team using commands sent directly to CM-2's on-board computer.

Yet it readily flows through the nozzle of a spray can to reach the dessert plate.This demonstrates the phenomenon of shearthinning that is important to many industrial andphysical processes. Paints, film emulsions, andother complex solutions that are highly viscous under normal con-ditions but becomethin and flow easilyunder shear forces. A simple fluid, such as water, does not exhibitshear thinning undernormal conditions. Veryclose to the liquid-vaporcritical thinning.At the critical atoms interactover long distances ina classical model ofcooperative pheno-mena. Physicists rely on this system tolearn how long-rangeorder arises. The Critical Viscosity of Xenon Experiment(CVX-2) will measurethe behavior low shear-rate flowFluctuation inhigh shear-rate flow xenon, a heavy inert gas used in flash lamps andion rocket engines, at itscritical point. Althoughit does not easilycombine with otherchemicals, its viscosityat the critical point canbe used as a model for arange of fluids. Viscosity originates from the interactionsof individual mol-ecules. It is so compli-cated that, except forthe simplest gas, it can-not be calculated accu-rately from theory.Tests with critical flu-ids can provide keydata, but are limited onEarth because criticalfluids are highly com-pressed by gravity.CVX-2 employs a tinymetal screen vibrat-ing between two electrodes in a bath of criticalxenon. The vibrations and how they dampen areused to measure viscosity . CVX flew on STS-85 (1997), where it revealed that, close to the critical point, the xenon is partly elastic: itcan \"stretch\" as well as flow. For STS-107, the hard-ware has been enhanced to determine if criticalxenon is a shear-thinning fluid. http://spaceresearch.nasa.govWhipped cream and the filling for pumpkin pie are two familiar materialsthat exhibit the shear-thinning effect seen in a range of industrial applica- tions. It is thick enough to stand onits own atop a piece of pie, yet flows readily when pushed through a tube. Shear thinning will cause anormally viscous fluid (below) to deform and flow more readily under high shear conditions. Resembling a bit of window screen,the oscillator at the heart of CVX-2will vibrate between paddle-like Applications Understanding shear thinning in a simple fluid such as xenon mayhelp scientists understand morecomplex, industrially importantfluids, such as: foams Polymer food, and cos- metic products.

Except for low density helium, fluid viscosity cannot be predicted accu- rately by current theory. Progress is being made with experiments using simple flu-ids near their criti- cal points, a com- bination of pres-sure and tempera- ture at which a fluid is balancedbetween the liq- uid and gaseous states. This causesthe fluid to fluc- tuate spontaneously between liquid and gas at a microscopic scale. It is somewhat like a soft drink with carbonation bub-bling in and out. Experiments on Earth are highly limited. At 0.001 C above its critical temperature (T c), xenon (a heavy, inert gas) is 6,000 times more compressible than air. Even a fluid layer as thin as a dime (1mm)compresses under its ownweight. Experiments in the microgravity of orbit elimi-nate density differences andallow extended experiments to achieve the precision that scientists need. Flight Research Equipment The heart of CVX-2 is a nickel screen that vibrates between two pairs of brass electrodes in a xenon bath.The grid is 7 \u00d7 19 mm (0.28 \u00d7 0.74 in) and weighs less than1 mg. An electrode is posi-tioned 4 mm (0.16 in) to each side of the screen. An electri- cal charge applied by theelectrodes will oscillate the screen. The electrodes measure the screen's displacementand period, like a pendulum swinging in a liquid. The cell holds a small quantity ofxenon near its critical tem- perature (T c=16.6 \u00b0C, or 62 \u00b0F) and critical density (1.1 times that of water) at 58 atmo- spheres, equivalent to a depth under water of almost0.6 kilometer (1,914 ft).

The cell sits inside a ther-mostat (bottom) providing threelayers of insulation.The thermostat for CVX sits inside thewhite cylinder on a support structure thatis placed inside a pressure canister.A similar canister holds the electro- nics and control systems. The CVX-2 arrangement is identical. The experiment plan involves four \"sweeps\" as the tem- perature gently moves up and down throughT c while the screen oscillates and data are continuously recorded. CVX-2 will determine Tc to within 0.001 \u00b0C. These first results will be compared to those from CVX. On CVX, the screen oscillated at less than13 cycles per second(13 Hz) through a dis- tance of less than 0.01 mm, less than the thick-ness of a hair, to avoid disrupting the density fluctuations in the xenon. On CVX-2, the screen vibrates at up to25 Hz and amplitudes of 0.3 mm in a deliberate attempt todisrupt the density fluctuations and cause shear thinning. Previous Results CVX operated well on its first flight on STS-85 in 1997. It accurately measured the viscosity of xenon to within 0.0001 \u00b0C of T c and showed a viscosity increase of 37 per- cent, double the best measurements on Earth. CVX alsoshowed that xenon's viscoelastic response (a partly elasticresponse to shear stress) was twice as great as predicted by theory. The r esults were published in two journals, Physical Review Letters [82, 920 (1999)] and Physical Review E [60, 4079 (1999)]. Photos.

Besides looking andsmelling bad, soot is a health hazard. Particles rangefrom big enough to see to microscopic and canaccumulate in the lungs, potentially leading todebilitating or fatal lung diseases. Soot is wasted energy, and therein lies an inter- esting paradox: Sootforms in a flame'shottest glow is sootradiating heat),among other effects. The mechanisms of soot formation are among the most important unresolved problems of combustionscience because soot affects contemporary life in somany ways. Although we have used fire for centuries,many fundamental aspects of combustion remainelusive, in part because of limits imposed by the effectsof gravity on Earth. Hot or warm air rises quicklyand draws in fresh cold air behind it, thus givingflames the classical teardrop shape. Reactions occurin a very small zone, too fast for scientists to observe,in detail, what is happening inside the flame.The Laminar Soot Processes (LSP-2) experi- ments aboard STS-107 will use the microgravityenvironment of space to eliminate buoyancy effectsand thus slow the reactions inside a flame so theycan be more readily studied. \"Laminar\" means asimple, smooth fuel jet burning in air, somewhatlike a butane lighter. This classical flame approxi- mates combustion in diesel engines, aircraft jet pro- pulsion engines, and furnaces andother devices. LSP-2 will expand that, ifproven, will beused to modeland control combustion systems on Earth. STS-107experiments also will help set the stage for extendedcombustion experiments aboard the International Space Station . Principal Investigator: Prof. Gerard M. Faeth, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Project Scientist: Dr. David L. Urban, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH Project Manager: Ann Over, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OHApplications Fine-tune burner design and operation to: Control soot production in combustion processes, Reduce radiative heat transfer from soot particles that can damage engines Improve electric power generation efficiency by increasing radiative transfer from soot in flame to furnace walls whilemaintaining complete soot burnout (no emission), Enhance soot production in processes for carbon black used in tires and applications, Enhance computational combustion studies to design new sys- tems that are optimized at the start, and retrofit existing systems.National Aeronautics and Space Administration STS-107: Space Research and You Soot belched by a diesel engine ismore than ugly \u2014 it's dangerous. Whilethe largest particles may wash out of the air when it rains, smaller particles linger and possibly endanger humanhealth and the environment.Soot particles from MSL-1 experiments(top) are about 10 to 60 nm across andformed aggregates 1,000 nm (1 micron) wide. This is similar to soot formed in terrestrial sources. http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov 73 Background Information Science Microgravity provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate soot processes relevant to practical flames. The chemical pathways that form soot are highly controversialin the science community. When the flame temperature falls below about 1300 \u00b0K (1900 \u00b0F), no soot is formed. Above that, hydrocarbon fuels pyrolyze or break down, even as most of the reactions form car- bon dioxide and water vapor. These mole- cular fragments pro- duce other molecules, including polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) that coalesce into solid carbonaceous particles \u2014 soot \u2014 that are linked to humancancers in a numberof studies. The LSP investiga- tion pro-cesses within laminar jet diffusion burns in produces nonbuoyant jetflames which allow ob- servations of soot pro- that cannot beduplicated on Earth. Normal gravity gener- ates buoyant motion due to the large varia- tions of gas densities in flames. These motionsintroduce soot particle motions that do not represent most practical flame environments where local effects of buoyancy are small. Hardware LSP-2 experiments will be conducted inside the Com- bustion Module (CM-2) facility flown in 1997 and modified for SPACEHAB. CM-2 will also host the Struc- ture of Flame Balls at Low-Lewis number -2(SOFBALL-2) and W ater Mist experiments. CM-2 is detailed in a separate fact sheet. Diagnostic instru-ments for LSP include a color camera, a soot volume fraction system (using thedimming of a laser shin- ing through the flame),and a soot temperaturemeasurement system. An Experiment Mounting Structure provides a large volume to allow laminar flames to form on one of two burners with diameters of 0.4 mm (0.016 in.) and0.8 mm (0.0315 in). They produce a flame 20 to 60 mm long (0.8 to 2.4 in). Soot samplers (for six test points) snap through the flame to capture particles for post-flight analysis. On-Orbit Operations LSP-2 science operations will last almost 42 hours and cover 15 test points using ethylene or propane fuel in air. LSP-2 is operated by the flight crew through a laptop computer connected to the CM-2. Setting the smoke heightwill require guidance from the science team at Johnson Space Center. Previous Results On the Microgravity Sciences Lab-1 mission in 1997, LSP yielded several surprises. The LSP team discovered a new mechanism of flame extinction caused by radiation from soot. The mechanism is unusual because the flame quenches near its tip, unlike conventional extinction of buoyantflames where the flame quenches near its base. This phenomenon hassignificant implications for spacecraft fire safety and for selecting test con-ditions for future studies of nonbuoyant soot con- taining flames. The teamalso made the first obser- vations of steady soot- containing nonbuoyantflames both with and without soot emissions. These provided textbook examples of soot formation processes in practical flames that are invaluable for developing methods for controlling the emissions of pollutant soot.Affected Fields Transportation: Internal combustion engines on aircraft (jet and piston), rail, ships, trucks, buses. Industry: Power plants, process plants that use combustion heating. Safety: Reduced loss of life and property due to improved understanding of building fires. LSP uses a small jet burner, similar to a classroom butane lighter, thatproduces flames up to 60 mm (2.3 in)long. Measurements include colorTV imagery (above), and lasershadowgraphs whose dimmingindicates the quantity of soot pro-duced in the flame (below).

Project Manager: Buddy Guynes, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Overview Scientists are going to space to understan d how earthquakes and other forces disturb grains of soil and sand. They will examine how the particle arrangement and structure of soils, grains and powders are changed by external forces and gain knowledge about the strength, stiffness and volume changes properties of granular materials at low pressures. The Mechanics of Granular Materials (MGM) experiment uses the microgravity of orbit to test sand columns under conditions that cannot be obtained in experiments on Earth. Research can only go so far on Earth because gravity-induced stresses complicate the analysis and change loads too quickly for detailed analysis. This new knowledge will be applied to improving foundations for buildings, managing undeveloped land, and handling powdered and granular materials in chemical, agricultural, and other industries. NASA wants to understand the way soil behaves under different gravity levels so that crews can safely build habitats on Mars and the Moon. Future MGM experiments will benefit from ex tended tests aboard the International Space Station, including experiments under simulated lunar and Martian gravity in the science centrifuge. 75 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Flight History MGM has flown twice on the space shuttle (STS-79 and -89), involving nine dry sand specimens. Several significant finds have emerged from these flights and are helping scientists test a number of hypotheses about soil behavior. For example, results showed strength properties two to three times greater and stiffness properties 10 times greater than conventional theory predicted. Experiment Operations On STS-107, scientists will investigate conditions with water-saturated sand resembling soil on Earth. Three sand specimens will be used in nine experiments. The heart of the experiment is a column of sand held in a latex sleeve and compressed between tungsten metal plates. Each cell uses about 1.3 kilograms (2.8 pounds) of Ottawa F-75 banding sand, 7.5 centimeters in diameter by 15 centimeter wide (3 x 6 inches). Ottawa sand, natural quartz sand with fine grains, is widely used in civil engineering experiments. The specimen assembly is contained in a wa ter-filled Lexan jacket. A load cell measures force, and three CCD cameras videotape the experiment. The flight crew controls the experiment through a laptop computer. The system takes the volume of four middeck lockers in the SPACEHAB module. After return to Earth, computed tomography (CT) scans produce a series of 1024 x 1024- pixel images to make three-dimensional images showing internal details. Then, specimens are stabilized by injecting epoxy in sand pore s. Finally, the columns are sawed into 1- millimeter (0.4 inch) thick disks for detaile d inspection under an optical microscope.

The apparent weight- lessness experienced by astronauts and experiments on the Shuttle is a balancing act, the result of fr ee-fall, or continuously falling around Earth. An easy way to visualize what is happening is with a thought experiment that Sir Isaac Newtondid in 1686. Newton envisioned a mountain extend-ing above Earth's atmosphere so that friction withthe air would be eliminated. He imagined a can-non atop the mountain and aimed parallel tothe ground. Firing the cannon propels the cannon- ball forward. Atthe same time,Earth's the cannonball,objects orbitingEarth are in con- tinuous free-fall, and it appears that gravity hasbeen eliminated. Yet, that appearance is deceiving. Activities aboard the Shuttle generate a range of accelerationsthat have effects similar to those of gravity. Thecrew works and exercises. The main data relayantenna quivers 17 times per second to prevent'stiction,' where parts stick then release with a jerk.Cooling pumps, air fans, and other systems addvibration. And traces of Earth's atmosphere, even200 miles up, drag on the Shuttle. While imperceptible to us, these vibrations can have a profound impact on the commercial researchand scientific experiments aboard the Shuttle. Mea-suring these forces is necessary so that researchersand scientists can see what may have affected theirexperiments when analyzing data. On STS-107 thisservice is provided by the Space Acceleration Mea-surement System for Free Flyers (SAMS-FF) andthe Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment(OARE). Precision data from these two instrumentswill help scientists analyze data from theirexperiments and eliminate outside influencesfrom the phenomena they are studying duringthe mission. SAMS Shuttle Project Manager: Ronald J. Sicker, Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH PIMS Project Manager: Kevin M. McPherson, Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OHSAMS and OARE will record data in two separate areas of the vibration spectrum, and with a modest amount of overlap. Differentactivities have different effects on sensitive payloads on the Shuttle, and the broad range that each has. Frequency (Hz) indicates vibrations per second.

Gravity gradient effects Solar Radiation PressureCrew motion & Orbiter rotationPumps, fans, machineryOrbiter drag ISS locations of this payload aboard STS-107.Background Information FS-2002-06-073-MSFCThe primary means for scientists to learn more about the microgravity conditions affecting their research is from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS). TheSAMS system is produced by the Microgravity Environment Program (MEP) at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The MEP produces a variety of microgravity measurement hard-ware for on-orbit spacecraft (the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle) and ground-based flights (drop towers, parabolic aircraft, and sounding rockets). The vari-ous SAMS (SAMS, SAMS-FF (free flyer), and SAMS-II) have supported 22 shuttle missions, and the Mir space station, and provide long-term support on the ISS. STS-107 will usea SAMS-FF. This is the second Shuttle mission for the SAMS-FF, which is a third-generation SAMS system. It uses industrial- grade components to provide a flexible, modular system thatis easily customized for each particular mission. Space Acceleration Measurement System-Free-Flyer SAMS-FF consists of a control and data acquisition unit (CDU), three remote acceleration sensor heads, and a fiber- optic gyroscope (FOG). The CDU is similar to a desktop com-puter packaged to meet the rigors of spaceflight. It controls the operation from the ground and process data from the sensors through a telemetry data stream, which can be seenon NASA computers on the ground. This lets experimenters view the data collected during the mission so they can cor- relate their science results with the SAMS data in real time.Three accelerometers are precisely mounted at right angles to form a triaxial sensor head (TSH). This allows the sensor head to detect vibrations in three different directions of move-ment: what would be on Earth up and down, forward and backward, and side-to-side (called X, Y , and Z axes). The data are processed to provide the resultant vector of the magni-tude and direction, as well as the frequency content, of vari- ous time intervals. The TSH is a microcontroller-based data acquisition system capable of measuring the microgravityaccelerations of the Shuttle. Sensitive inertial grade acceler- ometers are used to resolve the very low forces experienced during quiet periods and have the dynamic range to measurethe larger vibration disturbances.A new sensor on STS-107 is a fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG). To fully capture the motion of the vehicle, not only are the forces examined in three linear directions, but also the rotation of the vehicle is measured to understand thetorque forces. FOG has no moving parts and is used to mea- sure precisely the roll, pitch, and yaw of the shuttle. It does this by comparing the phases of beams of light traveling inopposite directions around a very long coil of fiber. If there is no rotation, the beams recombine at exactly the same phase. However, if the coil is rotated in a particular direction, traveltakes longer in the opposite direction before it exits the coil. This difference is detected by sensitive electronic circuits to determine the rate at which the rotation occurs. Lower gradeversions of FOG gyroscopes are used in automobiles, combined with GPS data for electronic positioning displays. Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment In addition to SAMS, the OARE accelerometer system characterizes (measures) the quasi-steady ronment. OARE measures very low frequency microgravity accelerations caused by upper atmospheric drag (as the shuttle passes through the upper atmosphere), rigid bodyinertial rotations, gravity-gradient effects, shuttle's mass expulsion, and crew activities. OARE acceleration data complement that of SAMS by providing the scientists a morethorough understanding of the various accelerations that can affect the experiments onboard the shuttle or any orbiting spacecraft in a low Earth orbit. Principal Investigator Microgravity Services The PIMS group at NASA Glenn is responsible for pro- cessing, analyzing, and archiving the acceleration data mea- sured by the two accelerometer systems previously described. During STS-107, acceleration data will be trans-mitted to the ground via telemetry links for real-time pro- cessing and analysis so that the scientists can assess the impact of the reduced-gravity environment in near real timeon their experiments. Specialized displays are developed by the PIMS group to help the scientists make near real-time decisions in order to lessen the impact of the reduced-grav-ity environment on their science results, thereby maximiz- ing good science data collection. PIMS will prepare an STS-107 mission microgravity characterization summaryreport which will highlight the reduced-gravity environment during the STS-107 mission to help the scientists take into account the adverse impact of the environment on their sci-ence results. PIMS will provide real-time support and post mission support to the Combustion Module-2 (CM-2) facility. SAMS-FF includes the control data unit (left), a triaxial sensor head (center) and the fiber-optic gyroscope (right). Two additional triaxialsensor heads will be remotely mounted with payloads. 79 National Aeronautics and Space Administration Great (Flame) Balls of Fire! Structure of Flame Balls a t Low Lewis-number-2 (SOFBALL-2) Everyone knows that an automobile engine wastes fuel and energy when it runs with a fuel- rich mixture. \"Lean\" burning, mixing in more airand less fuel, is bet-ter for the environ-ment. But lean mix-tures also lead to en-gine misfiring andrough operation. Noone knows the ulti-mate limits for leanoperation, for \"weak\"combustion that isfriendly to the envi-ronment while stillmoving us around. This is where the accidental verifica-tion of a decades-old prediction may have strongimplications for designing and running low-emis-sions engines in the 21st century. In 1944, Sovietphysicist Yakov Zeldovich predicted that station-ary, spherical flames are possible under limitedconditions in lean fuel-air mixtures. Dr. Paul Ronney of the University of Southern California accidentally discovered such \"flameballs\" in experiments with lean hydrogen-air mix-tures in 1984 during drop-tower experiments thatprovided just 2.2 seconds of near weightlessness.Experiments aboard NASA's low-g aircraft con-firmed the results, but a thorough investigation washampered by the aircraft's bumpy ride. And stableflame balls can only exist in microgravity. The potential for investigating combustion at the limits of flammability, and the implications forspacecraft fire safety, led to the Structure of FlameBalls at Low Lewis-number (SOFBALL) experimentflown twice aboard the Space Shuttle on theSTS-107: Space Research and You Microgravity Sciences Laboratory-1 (MSL-1) in 1997. Success there led to the planned reflight on STS-107. Flame balls are the weakest fires yet produced in space or on Earth. Typically each flame ball pro-duced only 1 watt of thermal power. By comparison,a birthday candle produces 50 watts. The Lewis-number measures the rate of diffusion of fuel into the flame ball relative to therate of diffusion of heat away from the flame ball.Lewis-number mixtures conduct heat poorly.Hydrogen and methane are the only fuels that provide low enough Lewis-numbers to produce stable flame balls, and even then only for veryweak, barely flammable mixtures. Nevertheless,under these conditions flame balls give scientiststhe opportunity to test models in one of the simplestcombustion experiments possible. SOFBALL-2science objectives include: Improving our understanding of the flame ball phenomenon, Determining the conditions under which flame balls exist, Testing predictions of flame ball lifetimes, and Acquiring more precise data for critical model comparison.

Weiland, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH Project Manager: Ann Over, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleve- land, OH http://spaceresearch.nasa.govFlame balls (seen in a 1997 space experiment) seem to shine bright as stars,but only because they are observed in the dark by a video camera with an image intensifier. Under normal lighting in a spacemodule, the flame balls would be invisible \u2014 to the eye and to fire detectors \u2014 and thus potentially hazardous. Applications Lean-burning car engines under consideration to meet California's ultra low emissions standards, or natural-gas powered cars, like the test model (above) in New York. Assessment of fire and explosion hazards in mine shafts, oil refineries, and chemical plants. Spacecraft safety where gases from waste systems or fuel cells could provide a fuel source for long-lived flame balls. 80 Background Information Affected Fields Combustion physics: Study the simplest interaction of chemistry and transport. Spacecraft design: Systems that handle hydrogen or biological products (food, waste, lab animals) that produce hydrogen and other combustible gases. Automotive engineering: Design of lean-burning engines using pure hydrogen or using hydrocarbon fuels in which hydrogencombustion is a significant component.Science SOFBALL burns extremely lean fuel-air mixtures that are near the lower limit of combustion. Because the mix- ture is lean and has a low Lewis-number, the flame does not spread across the mixture. It forms a spherical shell filled with combustion products. Fuel and oxygen diffuseinward while heat and combustion products diffuse out- ward. This diffu- sion-controlledcombustion pro- cess produces the weakest knownflames and pro- vides a mechanism to study the limitsof lean combus- tion. This works only in the micro- gravity environ- ment, in the ab- sence of buoyantflow would otherwise over- whelm diffusion. Hardware exper- iments will be conducted the CombustionModule-2 (CM-2) facility flown on Spacelab in 1997and modified for flight on SPACE- HAB. CM-2 willalso host the Laminar Soot Processes (LSP) and Water Mist experiments. CM-2 is described in a separate fact sheet. The SOFBALL-2 Experiment Mounting Structure in CM-2 is a cylinder about 62 cm long and 40 cm in diameter (24.4 \u00d7 15.7 in), and weighs approximately 39 kg (87 lb). The main components are the spark igniter; temperature sensors,arranged as a rake of six thin thermocouple wires; two pairs of radiometers; a mixing fan; and volume compensators to reduce the amount of gas needed for each test. Improvementsfor SOFBALL-2 include longer tests times, two new gas mixtures, addition of a close-up camera, and using an accelerometer for real-time decisions during tests.On-Orbit Operations The flight crew will run the first three test points through the CM-2 laptop computer. The SOFBALL science team onEarth will adjust conditions from one burn to the next, butthe flight crew will ini- tiate combustion, deter-mine whether flame balls exist, adjust and monitor instruments, terminatethe experiment, andinitiate a reburn if needed. SOFBALL oper- ations will take about 160 hours of flight time. Key science measure- ments include: flame ballsize, brightness, temperature, radiant emission, lifetime, and combustion product composition. SOFBALL test points will use five gas combinations \u2014 at 1 to 3 atmospheres, each with varying concentrations. Flame balls will burn for 1,500 to 10,000 seconds (almost 2.8 hours) depending on experiment objectives. Previous Results The biggest discovery from the first SOFBALL flights (MSL-1 and 1R) was the long life of flame balls. Scientists expected that flame balls would extinguish or drift into thechamber walls in a few minutes. Instead, most couldhave burned for hours had they not been automati-cally terminated at 500 seconds.The experimentsalso provided con- clusive evidence about the limita- tions of existing computer models of lean com bus- tion, and demon- strated the effects of fl ames reabsorbing their own radiation, which can also affect large engines and industrial boilers.Fuel concentration ~ 1-1/r (rises with distance) Reaction zoneTemperature ~ 1/r (drops with distance)Fuel & oxygen diffuse inward Heat & products diffuse outwardInterior filled with combustion products Higher Lower Drift DirectionAffected ballFuel concentrationFuel concentration profile Adjacent ball All the combustion in a flame ball takes place in a razor-thin reaction zone that depends ondiffusion to keep the ball alive (above).

Industrial Partner for Essenti al Oil Production Experiment: International Flavors and Fragrances, New York Commercial Space Center Manager: Steve Lambing, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Overview Two commercial plant investigations will be conducted during the STS-107 mission: living flower essential oil production and gene transfer. The research will be done using the ASTROCULTURE hardware, which builds on similar experiments flown in the past on the space shuttle. A miniature rose was grown in space for the first time during the STS-95 space shuttle mission in the fall of 1998. Scientists at the company sponsoring this research - International Flavors and Fragrances in New York - verified that microgravity altered the fragrance of the rose and produced a new scent. The fragrance ingredient produced in space was incorporated into two commercial products: a perfume, called Zen, developed by Shiseido in 2000 and a body spray, called Impulse, developed by Unilever in early 2002. The search for new aromas is always important to the multibillion-dollar-a-year flav ors and fragrances business, which is why International Flavors and Fragrances decided to team with the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics (WCSAR) again to conduct another novel experiment on the STS-107 mission. 82 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration This research will investigate how microgravity might affect the formation of the volatile chemical compounds - the essential oils - produced by two different types of living flowers. The flowers will be cultured in the ASTROCULTURETM plant chamber, which provides an enclosed and controlled environment. As the flowers bloom in space, they will produce essential oils, and these volatile compounds will be collected using Internationa l Flavors and Fragrance' s proprietary Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) technology. They will be preserved using WCSAR-developed technology. After they are returned to Earth, the Micro Extraction devices will be sent to International Flavors and Fragrance's analytical laboratory for constituent and structural analysis. The gene transfer experiment examines a newly developed transformation system to see if it operates efficiently in the microgravity environment. This research is important for the development of genetically engineered crops, also known as transgenic crops. It also is useful for producing valuable proteins. On a prior flight, scientists used bacteria to transfer a gene carrying a desirable trait to soybean seedlings. The traits are inherited by subsequent generations of plants. On Earth, the expected transformation event for soybeans is at best 1 plant in 1,000 or 0.1 percent. Previous commercial research on STS-95 and STS-101 has shown that agrobaterium - based transformation system greatly improved the transformation events or efficiency in microgravity. The increased effectiveness is partially because microbes, such as bacteria used to transfer the desired traits, thrive in microgravity. This experiment, again sponsored by Producers' Natural Processing Corp. in West Laffeyatt, Ind., will demonstrate the effectiveness of a refined agrobacterium -based transformation system using wheat microspores as target material. Experiment Operations Both the ASTROCULTURE glovebox and the ASTROCULTURE plant growth unit were developed by one of NASA's 17 Commercial Space Centers - the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This center specializes in the development of controlled environment technologies/facilities and agri-biotech research, and has conducted eight experiments on the space shuttle and two experiments on board the International Space Station. Applications The food industry and the flavors and fragrances industry are multibillion-dollar businesses.

This research encompasses more than 20 separate experiments including cancer research, commercial experiments and hands-on student experiments from 10 schools as part of ITA's ongoing University Among the Stars program. Protein crystal growth experiments will address t he structure of uroki nase - a protein that has been identified as a key enzyme in the spread of brain, lung, colon, prostate and breast cancers. Crystals of Bence Jones, a protein associated with bone cancer, will also be grown. Understanding their structures may help scientists develop treatments. In a related area, the Microencapsulation of Drugs (MEPS) is an anti-cancer drug delivery system, based on a 10-year partnership with NASA's Johnson Space Center. On this mission, the co-encapsulation of antibodies and immune stimulants will be made in sub-micron microcapsules to target pulmonary and bacterial infections. 85 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Other investigations include: Regeneration of Nerve-cell Growth Factor in Micro-g, Biospace Group and Oakwood College, both in Huntsville, Ala.

EdVenture Lab Crystal Growth Experiments, The Challenger Center, Alexandria, Va. Student Crystal Growth Experiments (Elementary Students), Lockheed Martin, Houston, Texas Muscle Cell Gene Expression, Brown University, Providence, R.I. More than 3,000 students and 50 teachers have participated in Iota's University Among the Stars. This will be the seventh shuttle mission carrying ITA student experiments. Flight History ITA has provided low-cost multi-user space hardware for 19 missions on the space shuttle, the Russian space station Mir and sounding rockets. The STS-107 mission uses hardware that was flown in 1998 on STS-95 as CIBX-1. An STS-95 experiment produced a large crystal of the Bence Jones protein that showed details of the protein's structure. This helped scientists identify the active site on the protein related to its painful disposition in the tissues of bone cancer patients. Now, scientists are producing better crystals on Earth for mapping analysis and to find ways to block the active site that causes the excruciating pain of bone cancer. These results are typical of the commercial, proprietary results obtained by ITA and its partners. Experiment Operations Two sets of equipment, the Dual-Materials Dispersion Apparatus (DMDA) and the Liquids Mixing Apparatus (LMA) are used. The DMDA is a multi-user space-processing laboratory. It accommodates microgravity experiments in cell biology, thin film membrane casting, macromolecular and inorganic crystal growth, seed germination, collagen research, fluid sciences, diffusion experiments, microencapsulation of drugs, and other biomedical and technical disciplines. 86 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration The LMA is a manually operated system that holds larger volumes per sample than the DMDA. It is used to mix two or three liquids or biomaterials in microgravity at predetermined times. Applications These experiments have a variety of biomedical applications.

DeLucas, O.D., Ph.D. Commercial Space Center Manager: John West, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Overview Within the human body, there are thousands of different proteins that serve a variety of different functions, such as making it possible for red blood cells to carry oxygen in our bodies. Yet proteins can also be involved in diseases. Each protein has a particular chemical structure, which means it has a unique shape. It is this three-dimensional shape that allows each protein to do its job by interacting with chemicals or binding with other proteins. If researchers can determine the shape, or shapes, of a protein, they can learn how it works. This information can then be used by the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs or improve the way medications work. The NASA Commercial Space Center sponsoring this experiment - the Center for Biophysical Sciences and Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham - has more than 60 industry and academic partners who grow protein crystals and use the information in drug design projects. Experiment Operations While there are several ways to determine the structure of proteins, the most widely used method is protein crystallography. Just as water evaporates from a sugar solution to form sugar crystals, protein crystals will form in a solution that contains water. For this flight, numerous samples are processed in the Protein Crystallization Facility, which supports large-scale protein crystal growth. 88 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration When the crystals are returned to Earth, scientists can study them using X-ray diffraction. Scientists send a beam of X-rays through the crystals and measure how the X-rays are bent by the atoms of the crystal. By studying the pattern made by the X-rays, they can then map the locations of the different atoms, allowing them to create a diagram of the protein's structure. With this as a guide, researchers can determine how the protein does its job. Once this is known, researchers can find ways to help or hinder a given protein by designing pharmaceutical compounds that fit the protein like a key in a lock. Because the drug is targeted at a specific protein, less of the drug may be necessary. The drug may be more effective because it reacts only with a specific protein. There may be few, if any, side effects, which are caused when drugs react with other compounds in the body. Flight History Protein crystal growth experiments began flying on the space shuttle in 1985. Today, more than 40 protein crystal payloads have flown, producing diffraction-quality crystals of many proteins. Applications Structural studies of microgravity-grown crystals have provided information for the development of new drugs. For example, studies conducted by Dr. Lawrence DeLucas on crystals grown on shuttle flights have been used in the design of inhibitors, which may serve as broad-spectrum antibiotics. More information on this experiment and other STS-107 is 89 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Water Mist Fire Suppression Experiment (MIST) Experiment Name: Water Mist Fire Suppression Experiment (MIST) Mission: STS-107 Experiment Location: In NASA's Combustion Module-2 inside the SPACEHAB Module Commercial Space Center: The Center for Commercial Applications of Combustion in Space (CCACS), Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colo. Commercial Space Center Director: Dr. F.D. Schowengerdt Project Scientists: J. Thomas McKinnon, Angel Abbud-Madrid and Edward P. Riedel -- all of CCACS Industry Partners: Environmental Engineering Concepts Inc., Palm Springs, Calif., and Arizona Mist Inc., Gilbert, Ariz. Commercial Space Center Manager : Jeneene Sams, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Overview Researchers are going to space to study how a water mist system puts out flames. The research is aimed at developing a commercially viable, water-based fire-fighting system. This system could replace the current fire-fighting chemicals including Halons, which are being banned because they damage Earth's ozone layer. This ban makes water, once again, the prime tool for fighting fire, since no other replacements have been found. How do you put out fires with water and still reduce or eliminate pr operty damage? Fine water mists may be the answer on Earth as well as in the air on commercial and military planes and even on spacecraft. The STS-107 experiment that studies fine water mist fire suppression is sponsored by two companies -- MicroCool, in Palm Springs, Calf., and Arizona Mist Inc., in Gilbert, Ariz. They are working with the Center for the Commercial Applications of Combustion in Space (CCACS) -- one of NASA's 17 Commercial Space Centers that help industry conduct space experiments. Space may be the ideal place to examine how water interacts with flame. On Earth, gravity causes lighter, hotter air to rise -- creating air currents that make it difficult to study the combustion process and fire-fighting techniques. 90 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration In microgravity -- the low-gravity environment created as the space shuttle orbits Earth -- these currents are reduced or eliminated. This allows scientists to study exactly what happens in the combustion process. For this experiment, scientists will observe how water droplets, like those in a fine fog, interact with a flame and extinguish it. These observations will help industry determine the optimum water concentration and water droplet size needed to suppress fires. The information can be used to improve models for designing the next generation of environmentally friendly, low-cost fire-fighting systems. Flight History/Background This is the first spaceflight for the experiment, but the companies and CCACS have conducted extensive ground-based research, as well as research in drop towers and NASA's KC-135 aircraft, which both expose experim ents to microgravity for brief periods. Research conducted at the Arvada Fire Training and Research Center in Arvada, Colo., demonstrated that the ultra-fine misting heads developed by Environmental Engineering Concepts produced fine mists that were extremely effective in fighting common fires. Tests showed that mists used significantly less water to put out fires than larger water droplets produced by conventional sprinkler systems. Experiment Operations The Water Mist experiment studies how different sizes and concentrations of droplets affect a thin layer of flame, known as a laminar flame. The water droplets will be between 20 to 40 microns in size, as opposed to droplets from conventional sprinklers that are larger than 1 millimeter. The flame will be produced by igniting a mixture of propane and air inside a transparent tube in the Combustion Module-2 (CM-2). The Combustion Module, which has flown on several shuttle flights, was developed by NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. It enables safe combustion research in space and is the forerunner for a similar fac ility being designed for the International Space Station. Future water mist investigations on the space station can be larger and more complex, enabling companies to test different water injection systems, droplet sizes, and other fire scenarios. 91 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Applications With halon replacements expected to become an increasingly large part of the $2 billion-a- year fire suppression industry, this experiment is of great commercial interest to the fire fighting industry.

More information on the Water Mist experiment and other STS-107 experiments is 92 STS-107: and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Zeolite Crystal Growth Experiment Name: Zeolite Crystal Growth Mission: STS-107 Experiment Location: SPACEHAB Module Space Center: Center for Advanced Microgravity Materials Processing (CAMMP) at Northeastern University, Boston, Mass. Commercial Space Center Director: Dr. Al Sacco Commercial Space Center Manager: Jeneene Sams, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Overview Zeolites are as hard as rocks but work like s ponges. They have a rigi d crystalline structure with a network of interconnected tunnels and cages, similar to honeycomb. These tunnels can store chemicals, like fuels, and then release them when the zeolites are heated. The Center for Advanced Microgravity Materials Processing (CAMMP) - one of 17 NASA- sponsored Commercial Space Centers - is working to improve zeolite materials for storing hydrogen fuel. The center is also applying zeolite research to detergents, optical cables, gas and vapor detection for environmental monitoring and control, and chemical production techniques that significantly reduce hazardous by-products. Experiment Operations A large part of CAMMP's research depends on figuring out the molecular structure of zeolites. Because the molecules are extremely small (2 to 8 microns), it is difficult to get accurate structural information about zeolites. Such information can be obtained, if zeolites can be grown 200 to 1,000 times their normal size. Through prior space experiments, CAMMP has discovered that it is possible to grow such large crystals in the microgravity conditions on the space shuttle. STS-107 research will use new and improved hardware developed and al so being used on the International Space Station. The hardware consists of sample tubes that hold the components that form zeolites, and a furnace unit used to process samples. 93 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operations will begin with the crew using a cordless screwdriver to mix the component elements in the sample tubes together. The mixi ng protocol will vary with each sample so that researchers can gain a better understanding of the nucleation process - the beginning of crystal formation -- and how to control it. Once mixing is complete, the samples will be placed in the furnace for automated processing. Scientists will analyze the samples after they are returned to Earth. Data from the shuttle experiment can also help scientists select the best types of samples for long-term processing in the zeolite furnace, now being operated on the International Space Station. When e nough is known about these materials to manipulate both the nucle ation and the growth, CAMMP can custom design them for specific applications, such as hydrogen fuel storage. Applications Zeolites could help us move from an economy that relies on petroleum to one that uses hydrogen for its fuel. Hydrogen would be infinitely renewable, pollution-free fuel. It is the most abundant element in the universe, and the main product of hydrogen combustion is water. One of the major problems to be solved is the efficient storage of hydrogen, but zeolite and zeo-type materials are being tested as a possible storage medium. Since chemical processing is a trillion-dollar industry worl dwide, any improvement in understanding zeolites could have an enormous economic impact. More information on this experiment and other STS-107 experiments is 94 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Low Power Transceiver One of the FREESTAR experiments, the Low Power Transceiver (LPT) experiment is a low-power, lightweight software programmable transceiver prototype technology demonstration that is being developed by NASA as a low-cost S-band spacecraft navigation and communication device. The LPT prototype receives Global Positi oning System (GPS) satellite signals for spacecraft navigation support and provides both forward and return, low-rate data communications links to the Merritt Island (MILA) and Dryden Flight Research Facility (DFRC) ground stations and to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The experiment is designed to demonstrate the system's ability to do simultaneous communications and navigation, as well as multi-mode communications and reconfiguration. LPT is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and sponsored by NASA/HQ Code M. The LPT experiment consists of one thermally conductive box containing the electronics stack, three S-band antennas and one L-band antenna. The LPT payload uses general Orbiter services, including power control, command, and telemetry provided through the HHC avionics. On-orbit, the LPT payload will be primarly operated via direct communications between LPT and ground stations (MILA, WLPS, or DFRC) and/or TDRSS, with backup capa bility provided via the hitchhiker avionics and remote Payload Operations Control Center. During operations, LPT will utilize high S- band frequencies for communications. The LPT TDRSS (and GN) forward link (uplink) frequency is and their (and link (downlink) frequency is 2287.5 MHz (utilizing Left-handed Circular Polarization to work with the TDRSS MA system). Two standard switch panel switches will be utilized to prohibit inadverten t operation of the antenna. An additional inhibit will be provided th rough the HH avionics power relay to the LPT. For more on this experiment see the section on FREESTAR experiments in this press kit. 95 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ram Burn Observations (RAMBO) Ram Burn Observations (RAMBO) is a Department of Defense experiment that observes shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System engine burns for the purpose of improving plume models. On STS-107 the appropriate sensors will observe selected rendezvous and orbit adjust burns. 96 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Vapor Compression Distillation Flight Experiment Mission: Launch and return on STS-107 Experiment Location: SPACEHAB module double rack Principal Investigator: Cindy F. Hutchens, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Overview: One of the major requirements associated with operating the International Space Station is the transportation -- space shuttle and Russian Progress spacecraft launches - necessary to re-supply station crews with food and water. The Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD) Fl ight Experiment, managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., is a full-scale demonstration of technology being developed to recycle crewmember urine and wastewater aboard the International Space Station and thereby reduce the amount of water that must be re-supplied. Based on results of the VCD Flight Experiment, an operational urine processor will be installed in Node 3 of the space station in 2005. Experiment Summary: Vapor compression distillation systems mechani cally mimic Earth's natural process of evaporation. Instead of heating water with the power of the Sun, however, these systems boil wastewater to produce and collect water vapor that is 97 percent free of minerals, chemicals and microbes. However, the bo iling process relies on gravity-driven buoyancy and convection not present in the low gravity environment of the space station. The VCD Flight Experiment is designed to verify the vapor compression distillation processing concept in \"weightlessness,\" as well as the performance of the various components. Urine is processed using a \"phase change\" process - from the liquid phase to the vapor phase and back to liquid. The heart of the experiment is the distillation assembly. To efficiently induce this phase change, the pr essure inside this cy lindrical distillation assembly is lowered to 0.7 pounds per square inch so that the boiling point where liquid turns to vapor is also lowered. For the VCD experiment, de-ionized water containing some salts will be used instead of urine. The water will be fed into the distillation assembly's rotating drum, spinning at 220 revolutions per minute, where it will form a thin film that will coat the walls of the drum. In the low-pressure environment, liquid will boil off at between 90 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit. T he water vapor will be collected by a \"de-mister\" in the center of the drum and then fed into a compressor to raise the pressure slightly. It is then injected on to a thin wall around the outside of the drum where it condenses, transferring its 97 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration heat to another thin film of liquid inside the wall of the drum to continue the recycling process. For the flight experiment, the process ends there. In actual operation aboard the station, however, after the brine - leftover solids and some liquid - reaches a high concentration, the brine and its tank are returned to Earth for cleaning and replaced with a clean tank, while the clean water will then be sent to a water processing assembly aboard the station. This assembly will further improve it before going into a clean water storage tank to be used for cleaning, cooking, drinking or other personal use aboard the station. The VCD Flight Experiment is an intermediate risk mitigation step between the design of flight hardware and actual installation aboard the station. Hardware/Operations: The VCD Flight Experiment occupies a refrigerator-sized rack in the SPACEHAB module in the shuttle payload bay for the STS-107 missi on. The key components are the distillation assembly, two pumps, wastewater storage feed tanks, air injection tank, a gas/liquid separator apparatus and a recycling filter tank. The crew will activate the experiment on flight day three of the mission. The first day of operations will be devoted mainly to pumping the air out of the distillation assembly to create a low pressure boiling environment without increasing the temperature. During the second, third and fourth days, the system will undergo a series of normal and abnormal operating scenarios, such as shutting down the processor at full speed and then starting it again. The VCD Flight Experiment is largely automated, with the experiment team monitoring operations and receiving data in a control room at Johnson Space Center in Houston. The crew will be involved in setting up and activating the experiment for its six-hour run time each day. They are required to open and close air injection valves and collect water samples throughout the test period. Background/Flight History Experimental vapor compression distillation equipment and re lated Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLSS) hardware has undergone development at the Marshall Center since 1986. The Volatile Removal Assembly, including part of the station's water processor system, was tested on a SpaceHAB module on the STS-89 space shuttle mission in January 1998. Another VCD Flight Experiment was flown aboard a KC-135 aircraft in 2002 to simulate the microgravity conditions it would encounter aboard the shuttle. That hardware included a clear acrylic drum so that engineers could observe the fluid behavior. 98 STS-107: Space Research and You National Aeronautics and Space Administration Benefits When install ed on the space station, VCD technol ogy will process about 4,400 pounds (2,000 kg) of water annually to support station crews. Human exploration beyond the Moon will require such recycling systems. The technology may also have applications on Earth, where many people do not have an abundant, reliable and affordable source of drinking water. As the human population surpasses 6. 2 billion, water is becoming a precious commodity. 99 STS-107:Space Research and YouNational Aeronautics and Space Administration The Advanced Respiratory Monitoring System (ARMS) is a suite of monitoring instruments and supplies used to study the heart, lungs, andmetabolism. Many experiments sponsored by theEuropean Space Agency (ESA) will be conductedusing ARMS during STS-107. The near-weightless environment of space causes the body to undergo many physiologicaladaptations, and the regulation of blood pres- sure is no exception.Astronauts also exper-ience a decrease inblood volume as anadaptation to micro-gravity. Reduced blood volume may notprovide enough bloodpressure to the headduring entry or land-ing. some-times even fainting,when they standshortly after returningto Earth. To help regulate blood pressure and heart rate, baroreceptors, sen-sors located in artery walls in the neck and nearthe heart, control blood pressure by sendinginformation to the brain and ensuring blood flowto organs. These mechanisms work properly inEarth's gravity but must adapt in the micrograv-ity environment of space. However, upon returnto Earth during entry and landing, the cardiovas-cular system must readjust itself to gravity, whichcan cause fluctuation in the control of blood pres-sure and heart rate. Although the system recoversin hours or days, these occurrences are not easilypredicted or understood \u2014 a puzzle investigatorswill study with the ARMS equipment. In space, researchers can focus on aspects of the cardiovascular system normally masked bygravity. The STS-107 experiments using ARMSwill provide data on how the heart and lungsfunction in space, as well as how the nervoussystem controls them. Exercise will also becombined with breath holding and straining (theValsalva maneuver) to test how heart rate andblood pressure react to different stresses.This understanding will improve astronauts'cardiopulmonary function after return to Earth,and may well help Earthbound patients whoexperience similar effects after long-term bed rest. http://spaceresearch.nasa.govExploring Heart and Lung Function in Space ARMS Experiments Project Scientist: Dr. Andre Kuipers, European Space Agency Project Manager: Michael Cork, European Space Agency Operations Engineer: Marine LeGouic, European Space AgencyEarth Benefits and Applications Studies with ARMS during STS-107 mean: Better understanding of the basic workings of the heart, lungs, and supporting systems Helping to develop new diagnostic tools for predicting illness and establishing rehabilitation techniques when problems do occur Applying rehabilitation techniques to treatment of patients con- fined to long-term bed rest. ARMS measurements are taken during exercise, with astronautsubject Mike Anderson, in a ground-based test of the equipment. 100 Science ARMS experiments will investigate pulmonary (lung), respiratory (airway), and car diovascular (heart and blood vessels) changes during r est and exer cise.

The SSPP designs, develops, tests, integrates and flies a group of small payload carrier systems for the space shuttle. These carriers - the Hitchhiker, Getaway Specials (GAS), and Space Experiment Module (SEM) - support payloads supplied by NASA, other U.S. government agencies, universities, high schools, domestic commercial customers, and foreign nationals and governments. These carriers can support payloads that range in size between 50 lbs. (23 kg) and 4,000 lbs. (2,270 kg). Payload Description The FREESTAR payload will include six separa te experiments mounted on a crossbay support structure.

This aim is achieved by a remote sensing experiment operated by the astronauts aboard the space shuttle. In addition to the primary desert aerosol observations, MEIDEX will accomplish diverse secondary science objectives by performing slant visibility observations, sea-surface reflectivity observations, desert surfac e observations and observations of Transient Luminous Events, better known as sprites. The MEIDEX experiment includes remote as well as in-situ measurements of light scattering by desert aerosol particles in six different wavelength intervals from the near Ultraviolet to the Solar Infrared. The wavelengths selected for space-borne remote measurements of desert aerosols include two wavelengths used by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer instruments as well as four of those installed on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, an instrument aboard both NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecraft. This facilitates the calibration of the TOMS-lik e information acquired by the instrument in the UV spectral region by that provided simultaneously by the MODIS-like bands on the same instrument. The MEIDEX scientific initiative will also incorporate supporting ground-based and airborne measurements in order to provide both optical observations and direct sampling. The airborne measurements will be planned so as to fly under or in the vicinity of the shuttle orbits. MEIDEX Physical Description A Xybion IMC-201 radiometric camera equipped with six narrow-band filters centered at 340 nm, 380 nm, 470 nm, 555 nm, 660 nm, and 860 nm. The Xybion camera has a field of view of 10.7 x 14.0 \u00b0 with a nadir footprint (looking straight down) of 52 x 68 km. Second wide (60 \u00b0) field of view video camera that operates as a viewfinder. Both cameras are mounted in a single-axis gimbaled truss located in a standard Hitchhiker 5.0 cubic-foot canister equipped with a 5-inch extension and a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly. The MEIDEX canister is also equipped with a 16-inch quartz window with a broadband anti-reflective coating. Other Hitchhiker equipment consists of two Hitchhiker Video Interface Units. 105 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration SOLCON-3 History/Background To understand the influence of the Sun on climate changes on Earth, it is necessary to make long-term, accurate measurements of the solar constant, the amount of solar energy received per unit surface at a distance of one astronomical unit (the average distance of Earth's orbit) from the Sun. The SOLCON instrument is a reference instrument for the measurement of the solar constant. It is flown regularly during short periods on the space shuttle. SOLCON-3 Experiment Description The SOLCON instrument is designed to accurately measure the solar constant and identify variations in the value during a solar cycle. SOLCON measures the solar irradiance forms in space to avoid perturbations by the atmosphere of the Earth. It is also used as a reference to construct a long duration time se ries of the solar irradiance. This data will ensure continuity of the solar constant level obtained by instruments mounted on free flyers, over climate time scale duration. Solar measurements are performed by determining the power difference required to bring two cavities into thermal balance when one is open to the Sun and the other is closed. The SOLCON-3 payload utilizes general space shuttle services including power control, command, and telemetry provided through the Hitchhiker carrier avionics equipment. SOLCON- 3 Physical Description Solcon-3 will be mounted on an HH Single Bay Pallet on top of the Hitchhiker Multipurpose Equipment Support Structure Solcon-3 consists of a radiometer and a digital processor unit covered by a thermal blanket to provide Passive Thermal Control The radiometer unit houses the Sun pointing monitor, shutter assembly, radiometer assembly and electronics The digital processor unit houses the experiment control and interface to the Hitchhiker avionics The radiometer unit consists of two channels through which solar radiation may be sensed Each channel contains a radiation sensor and has two apertures 106 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Independent shutters protect the first aperture of each channel. Each shutter seals out any solar radiation from the radiation sensor when closed and allows the sensor to receive solar radiation when open An opening and closing outer cover on the radiometer unit provides protection from contamination during non-operating periods SOLSE-2 History/Background The discovery of the ozone hole in 1985 demonstrated the very large changes in ozone that were occurring in the lower stratosphere near 20 km, instead of the upper stratosphere as first expected, and where current ozone instruments are focused. The Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE- 2) will show that more information is available by looking at ozone from the side, at Earth's limb or atmospheric boundary. Ozone monitoring should be focused in the lower stratosphere by measuring ozone from a tangential perspective that is centered at the limb, which provides ozone profiles concentrated in the lower stratosphere. Stratospheric ozone depletion is a global concern because the ozone layer there keeps 95 percent of the UV radiation from striking the Earth. The first flight of the Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE) proved that this technique achieves the accuracy and coverage of traditional measurements, and surpasses the altitude resolution and depth of retrieval. SOLSE demonstrated that vertical profiles of ozone could be measured with high resolution using solar ultraviolet scattering from the Earth's atmospheric limb. SOLSE-2 Experiment Description SOLSE is an imaging spectrometer designed to produce high quality 2-dimensional images of the limb in visible and UV light while minimizing internal stray light. As one of the experiments flying aboard the Hitchhiker payload, the principle mission of SOLSE-2 is to demonstrate a new technique to measure the vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere. The ozone layer near the tangent point strongly absorbs radiation at particular wavelengths of light. SOLSE infers the presence of ozone with high altitude resolution by measuring the relative absence of radiation at those wavelengths according to height. Using a limb viewing geometry, SOLSE-2 will demonstrate the feasibility of measuring limb- scattered radiation to retrieve ozone with improved vertical resolution than a traditional nadir looking instrument can achieve. Second, SOLSE will demonstrate the feasibility of using Charged Coupled Device technology to eliminate moving parts, which could lead to simpler, cheaper, ozone mapping instruments. The shuttle provides the perfect testbed to demonstrate new technology and measurement techniques without committing the funds for flight instrument. Once proven over a wider range of viewing conditions, the SOLSE-2 107 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration technique will be used to routinely meas ure ozone by the next generation weather satellites. SOLSE-2 Physical Description The instrumentation subsystem consists of a visible and UV spectrograph with a CCD array detector, photodiode array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker canister with canister extension ring and equipped with an Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly The optical slit is masked with a linear attenuation filter that normalizes the intensity of the limb that varies by factor of 100 from top to bottom A shutter controls the exposure of each frame The filter wheel housing encloses 6 ion-assisted deposition filters at UV and visible wavelengths CVX-2 History/Background The Critical Viscosity of Xenon-1 Experiment first flew on STS-85 in 1997 as part of the Hitchhiker payload TAS-01. CVX revealed that when close to the liquid vapor critical point, xenon is partly elastic: it can \"stretch\" as well as flow. For STS-107, the hardware has been enhanced to determine if critical xenon is a shear thinning fluid. An understanding of shear thinning in a simple fluid will enable scienti sts to understand the phenomenon in more complex, industrially important fluids, such as: paints, emulsions, foams, polymer melts, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic products. CVX-2 Experiment Description The Critical Viscosity of Xenon-2 Experiment will measure the viscous behavior of xenon - a heavy, inert gas used in flash lamps and ion rocket engines - at its critical point. The effects of gravity limit viscosity experiments on Earth. Xenon, near the critical point, will collapse under its own weight when exposed to Earth's gravity, thereby increasing the density at the bottom. Experiments in the microgravity of orbit eliminate density differences and allow extended experiments to achieve the precision that scientists need. Shear thinning occurs in complex fluids, such as paints and blood that become \"thin\" and flow easily under a shear stress such as stirring or pumping. CVX-2 will be the first experiment to examine the shear-thinning phenomenon in a simple fluid. 108 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration CVX-2 Physical Description Viscometer comprised of a nickel screen that vibrates between two pairs of brass electrodes in a xenon bath The grid is 7x 19 mm (0.28 x 0.74 in) and weighs less than 1 mg. An electrode is positioned 4 mm (0.16 in) to each side of the screen An electrical charge is applied by the electrodes that will oscillate the screen The electrodes then measure the screen's displacement The sample cell is a copper cylinder, 62 mm long by 38 mm wide (2.45 x 1.5 in), that conducts heat and adds thermal inertia to ensure slow, even changes in temperature The cell is enclosed in a three-layer thermostat to improve thermal control CVX-2 is contained in two Hitchhiker canisters mounted on the Multi-Purpose Equipment Support Structure One canister houses the Experiment Package. The second canister houses the Avionics Package which includes the data acquisition and control electronics, and the power conditioning systems The experiment plan involves four \"sweeps.\" That is, the temperature will be gently moved up and down while the screen oscillates and data are continuously recorded LPT History/ Background The paradigm of spacecraft design is changing throughout the space industry. Designs are requiring smaller, cheaper, and more capable systems. A key technology component that will enable these types of designs is a small, highly integrated, reprogrammable, multi-purpose communications and navigation payload that can withstand the radiation environments encountered over a variety of orbits. LPT Experiment Description The Low Power Transceiver (LPT) is a compact, flexible device that can be configured to perform custom communications and navigation functions in terrestrial, airborne, and space applications. The LPT is a collection of interchangeable hardware modules that form a software programmable platform for a variety of communication and navigation applications. The LPT can simultaneously process multiple radio frequencies (RF bands) in 109 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration the transmittance or retrieval direction, and simultaneously process multiple data channels within each RF band; further, its modular architecture provides a flexible arrangement of signal processing resources. This technology thrust strives to return the maximum possible scientific information from instruments on board a spacecraft to the customer/principal investigator on Earth. GSFC engineers are working rapidly to prototype and demonstrate applicable Internet technologies and methodologies and to infuse them into flight missions where they will significantly reduce development costs and greatly increase mission flexibility. Furthermore, they expect these tec hnologies to enable entirel y new, distributed, system and mission models in the future. LPT Physical Description One thermally conductive box containing the LPT electronics stack. The LPT experiment will be mounted on two HH Single Bay Pallets, one of which is shared with SOLCON-3, on top of the HH MPESS. LPT has been integrated with a commercial processor board functioning as the flight computer, along with an three S-Band Receive Antenna, and one L-Band Antenna or Low Gain Transmit Antenna, all mounted to the top of the HH Multi-purpose Equipment Support Structure (MPESS) via a HH Single Bay Pallet (SBP). The flight computer will use GPS-Enhanced Orbit Navigation System (GEONS) software to process the Global Positing System (GPS) data. The flight computer will run the Linux operating system, and use Mobile IP over all of the RF links. The LPT TDRSS (and GN) forward link frequency is 2106.40625 MHz and the TDRSS (and GN) return link frequency is 2287.5 MHz. Two Standard Switch Panel (SSP) switches will be incorporated to prohibit inadvertent Radio Frequency (RF) transmission from the antenna. SEM- 14 Experiments Does Popcorn Pop the Same After Being in Space? Does a crystal grow the same in space as it does on Earth? Does heat transfer any differently in zero gravity? Now there's a way for students to answer questions like these. NASA has developed an educational program for kids who want to discover more about space by building 110 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration experiments that may ultimately fly on a space shuttle. The program is called the Space Experiment Module or SEM. SEM is open to U.S. students in grades K-12 and university level. Grades 9-12 may also apply through the NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP), which is an annual national competition. Through SEM, kids will learn all about putting a scientific experiment into space. With the help of a teacher or mentor, students will create, design and build an experiment that is their own. The SEM program focuses on the science of zero gravity and microgravity. Selected student experiments are flown in NASA provided modules. The SEM carrier system accommodates 10 modules in a standard Get Away Special canister that mounts in the cargo bay of the space shuttle. Experiments are qualified for the program through a flight certification process that includes an experiment proposal review and a Customer Agreement. There is no cost for student experiments to fly in the program. For more information on grades 9-12 NSIP competition visit: http://www.nsip.net/index.cfm International students interested in SEM should contact the SEM mission manager: Charles.L.Brodell.1@gsfc.nasa.gov \"Garden from the Stars\" - Central Park Middle School, Schenectady City School District, and Farnsworth Middle Schoo l, Guilderland Central School District, Guilderland, N.Y. The experiment involves sending selected seeds, representative of wildflowers from the ecologically unique and sensitive land area of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve, into space to measure effects of spaceflight and zero gravity on growth of plants. It is hypothesized that there will be measurable difference s in growth of plants from \"space\" seeds compared with plants grown from \"nonspace\" control seeds. These differences may include germination period, size of plant, number of petals, shape of leaves, and color variations. Plants grown from the \"space\" seeds will be donated to the City of Schenectady's Central Park Gardens and some will be returned to the Pine Bush to help in restoration of the native plant population. 111 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration \"United Voyager, Moving and Shaking at M.S. 135 & M.S. 143\" - Frank D. Whalen Middle School and Peter Tetard Middle School, New York, N.Y. Students from Frank D. Whalen Middle School & Peter Tetard Middle School in New York City will partner in this experiment. They will be investigating cosmic radiation, g-forces of space travel, and effects of space travel on plant growth patterns. The plant growth investigation will use tomato seeds (native to the Bronx) along with soil samples. Other sample materials will include chalk, marbles, gum, gum/taffy, iron filings, small magnets, candles, crayons, film, yeast, and a pendulum watch. Control groups will be maintained on Earth and used to determine the changes caused by the spaceflight. \"Wearable Radiation Protection\" - The Mott Hall-CCNY STARS Program, the Mott Hall School-IS223 & The City College of New York, New York, N.Y. Living and non-living things that travel outside of the Earth's atmosphere and the Earth's magnetic field will be subjected to levels of radiation that are higher than those to which they are exposed on the surface of the Earth. This experiment tests the effectiveness of various flexible materials as a barrier to this radiation. Natural and synthetic fabrics made of organic and inorganic materials will be wrapped around dosimeters that measure exposure to radiation. It will then be possible to see if any of the tested materials provide a significant amount of protection against radiation when worn. The students in the SEM team are participating in a program called the Mott Hall-CCNY STARS (Student Apprenticeships in Research). STARS is a partnership between the City College of New York and The Mott Hall School. Each year eighth-graders spend three hours a week working with mentors in CCNY science and engi neering research laborat ories. The goal of STARS is to empower and encourage minority students to pursue careers in science and engineering. The Mott Hall School - IS 223 is a public school in Community School District 6 in the North Harlem/Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City. It is a grade 4-8 magnet school for 450 students offering advanced studies in math, science and technology. Most of the students, 85 percent of the student population, are first- or second- generation immigrants from Latin America, especially the Dominican Republic. About 10 percent are African Americans. The others are almost all immigrants from other countries. \"NYC KISS (Kids Investigations in Sp ace Science)\" - American Museum of Natural History, Rose Center for Earth and Space, New York, N.Y. The NYC KISS program consists of the Rose Center for Earth and Space, part of the American Museum of Natural History, working in conjunction with six New York City educators to introduce hundreds of New York City schoolchildren to space and the hazards and beauties that it holds. Experiments will determine how the space environment will change a variety samples. Experiment samples will include DNA samples, composting materials, magnets, film, sunscreen, and other passive material samples. 112 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration \"VIRUS- T4\" - Bishop Borgess High School & Academy, Redford, Mich. Students will study two different aspects of the effect of the Near-Earth Space Environment (NESE) on biological materials. In one experiment, they will study the degradation of antibiotic activity in NESE compared to cont rol (terrestrial) samp les. They will perform standard Kyrby-Bauer antibiotic sensitivity tests on the NESE and terrestrial samples of various antibiotics. The second experiment will measure the viability of the T4 Virus samples exposed to the NESE (X-rays and Gamma Rays) and compare that to the viability of terrestrial samples. A radiation dosimetry badge will be enclosed in the module for measuring radiation exposure. Students will perform a standard dilution plaque assay on both the space and terrestrial samples, under the direction of a trained microbiologist. Students will learn experimental design and data interpretation, and will calculate antibiotic and virus viability using their math skills. They will also study the effects of radiation on fluorescent dyes to determine if they will glow brighter after exposure to the NESE. The students will communicate their results in a written report, in which data will be presented in tabular and graphic forms. This will also include a brief oral presentation. \"OGRE\" - Ogdensburg Public Sc hool, K-8, Ogdensburg, N.J. Students at the Ogdensburg School are preparing an experiment that will test the affects of radiation and weightlessness on florescent minerals. Ogdensburg is famous for its Sterling Hill Mine where there is an abundance of florescent minerals. These minerals have been displayed in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Natural History in New York and other museums around the world. Students will be collecting mineral samples and dividing them into a control group, which will stay on Earth, and an experimental group, that will fly in the space shuttle. They will photograph both groups of minerals under ultraviolet light, so they can compare their luminescence once the minerals return from space. Mineral spectrogr aphs will be taken before and after flight using the Cary Variance Florescent Mineral Spectrophotometer at Varian technologies. The mass of the minerals will also be measured to see if any changes occur from the space environment. \"Worms & Mold in Space\" - East No rriton Middle School, Norristown, Pa. The first part of this experiment addresses food preservation as it's affected by zero gravity and above normal levels of radiation. Five samp les of bread will be sent into space while five identical samples will be maintained on Earth for control purposes. Examination and comparison of variables and controls will hopefu lly show if zero gravity and radiation had any effects on bread mold growth and life ac tivities. Data will then possibly be applied to future NASA missions. The second part of the experiment will investigate mealworms. Mealworms are popular sources of food for reptilian pets and they also go through a metamorphosis. Their food and oxygen requirements are minimal. The hope is that the samples will survive the trip and return to Earth for comparison with the earthbound control group. Mutations and compatibility with populations left on Earth will be examined. 113 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration \"C.D. in Space?\" - Country Centre 4-H Space Science Project, Sacramento, Calif. \"CD in Space\" is an extension of the Country Centre 4-H Space Science \"A Seed for Larger Service\" project. This hands-on 4-H space science project encourages experiencing math, science, scientific research and the scientific process in an after school setting. The experiment team is comprised of one 4-H space science project leader and 14 youth ranging between the ages of 5 and 16 who reside in Sacramento County. Other individuals involved include professionals in the greater community to consult and aid in the experiment process. The purpose of this experiment is to test how radiation, vibration and temperature extremes in the space environment might affect a compact disc. A control group of CDs will remain on Earth and, using technology and scientific methods of analysis, the youths will compare the control group with the flight group. \"How Do Our Space Beans Grow?\" - J.M. Bailey School Kindergarte n, Bayonne, N.J. The kindergarten students at John M. Bailey School in Bayonne, N.J., will send bean seeds into space. This experiment will be done in conjunction with the life science curriculum \"PLANTS -Seeds and Plant Growth.\" Children will discover if a change in environment will affect the growth rate of seeds. Will seeds kept in the dark germinate? Will it make a difference if they are in air, sand, soil or water? After seeds return from space, they will be planted along with a control group of seeds kept on Earth. Both sets of seeds will be monitored for rate of growth. Children will compare the development of buds, flowers and leaves. Math skills will be incorporated th rough m easuring and graphing plant growth. Children will keep a journal to record obs ervations and data during the project. \"St. John's Seeds\" - St. John the Ba ptist Preschool, New Freedom, Pa. The experiment will investigate how the space environment will affect tomato seeds. The students suspect that the seeds will grow \"funny \" on their return. The students will get to see first-hand the effects of space travel. The group will be connecting this experiment to units on spring and the life cycle of the seed. \"Natural Space Art (NSA)\" - Shoshone-Bannack High School, Fort Hall, Idaho Students and staff at the Shoshone-Bannock High School located on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation at Fort Hall, Idaho, are planning an experiment that will investigate if urine-filtered water will mix with paint dyes. The team will be building on past space science projects and experiments. The team will fly the mixtures to see how they react in space. Students and staff will also paint small objects like canvas, wood, rocks, and metal with the mixtures and see how they survive the extreme temperatures of space. The team will run a control in the lab and compare results. Some of the questions to be investigated include: Will the rigors of spaceflight affect the painted materials? Will solutions of urine, water and dyes be usable once returned back from space? Could astronauts use filtered urine water for art purposes in space? 114 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration National Space Development Ag ency of Japan (NASDA) Space Experiment Project Mission Overview The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) will implement protein crystal growth experiments for about 16 days on space shuttle mission STS-107 prior to actual utilization of the Japanese Exper iment Module (JEM) \"K IBO.\" Biological fundamental research experiments and experiments on medical applied research for pharmaceuticals will be conducted with the Co mmercial Macromolecul ar Protein Crystal Growth (CMPCG) equipment. NASDA is also providing an opportunity for a space education program in protein crystal growth for high school students. In addition, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) will clar ify the effects of space on living organisms using rodents carried aboard the space shuttle in the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM). The experiments using the space environment will produce significant results for protein research and the BSP. Significance of Protein Research Today we recognize numerous growing threats to human bodies including aging, viruses, various diseases, and chemical substances such as environmental hormones, which are strongly related to various functions of proteins, important components of living organisms. The functions of proteins heavily depend on their three-dimensional structure. Clarifying the protein's functions and its structure at the atomic level will contribute to research in bioscience and medicine. Decoding of the human genome was almost completed in June 2000, and analyses of protein functions and structures have received much attention as post-genome-sequence research. Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD), which applied the protein research in a medical development for disease treatment, has attracted many pharmaceutical companies. Protein Crystallization in Space High-quality single-protein crystals suitable for research are essential for highly detailed protein structure analysis by X-ray diffraction, the instrument used for determining the 3-dimensional structure of macromolecules. On Earth, gravity causes crystal sedimentation and convection, which affect the quality of crystals. The microgravity environment of space has been used to grow high-quality crystals; however, there are still more challenges to growing high-quality crystals with high probability. Hence 115 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration experiments in space must be conducted continuously to clarify the crystallization process. Protein crystal growth experiments will be performed to clarify functions of various biologically important proteins and differ ences between proteins crystallized in space and on the Earth. High-quality crystals produced in space provide a better understanding of the relation between protein functions and structures and of conditions necessary for growing crystals of high quality. Science research themes are: study of the relationship between crystallization condi tion and crystal quality for of comple x protein crystals in microgravity. Applied research themes for the STS-107 experiments are: applied research on protein crystallization in space for designing anti-inflammatory and anti-somnolent drugs; molecular design of novel drugs for parasitic diseases based on the crystal structure; drug discovery study for specific inhibitor of geriatric diseases; and studies on crystallization of a photoreceptor protein. NASDA is developing common and basic techniques leading to success for space experiments. Such techniques would enable the prediction of optimum experimental conditions in space from the results of ground experiments. Protein crystal growth experiments will be performed to verify the developed optimal techniques for microgravity experiments using vapor diffusion. NASDA will also provide an opportunity for high school students to conduct protein crystal growth experiments using CMPCG aboard the space shuttle. Students will learn the significance of research on proteins and microgravity by conducting preparative and space experiments and writing papers on their analyses. Animal Research The International Space Station will be assembled at the beginning of the 21 st Century. The advance of humans into space will then have finally started in earnest. It is essential to perform animal studies using mammalians, such as rodents, to ensure safe human space activities. Detailed analysis of the effects of the space environment on mammalian physiology is very important from the life science and medical viewpoints. 116 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) Rodent experiments will be performed to clar ify functions of various biologically significant differences between space and Earth environments. Nine experiments in the following four scientific fields will be performed on STS-107 by Japanese principal investigators. The four fields are bone and muscle, metabolism and endocrinology, neural system and radiation biology. The nine experiments are: Effects of spaceflight on the gene expression of skeletal muscle in rats Effects of spaceflight on the characteristics of fast and slow hindimb muscles of rats Osteoactivin: A novel glycoprotein inhibiting adhesion of osteoblastic cells to bone matrix Analysis of gene and protein expressions of cytochrome P450 and stress- associated molecules in rat livers after spaceflight The effects of microgravity on mRNA expression in the vestibular endorgans Effect of space environment on the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism in rats Gene expression of p53-regulated gene after exposure to space environment in rat Effects of spaceflight on spermatogenesis in rat-expression and quantification factors implicated spermatogenesis Effects of microgravity on the fiber component of the aortic depressor nerve in the Fisher 344 rat Commercial Macromolecular Protein Crystal Growth (CMPCG) CMPCG equipment provided by the University of Alabama at Birmingham and SPACEHAB, Inc. will be carried aboard the s pace shuttle. The CMPCG consists of 1,008 crystal growth cells, using vapor diffusion methods, trays for loading the cells, and an incubator for cell-temperature control. NASDA will use 306 of the 1,008 cells for crystal growth experiments. Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) The Animal Enclosur e Module (AEM) provi ded by NASA Ames Research Center will be carried aboard the space shuttle for the experiments on rodents. 117 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Hardware Description The AEM is a rodent-housing facility that suppor ts up to six 250-gram rats. The unit fits inside a standard space shuttle middeck or SPACEHAB locker with a modified locker door. The AEM remains in the stowage locker during launch and landing. On orbit, the AEM may be removed partway from the locker and the interior viewed or photographed through a Lexan cover on the top of the unit. With the addition of an Ambient Temperature Recorder, temperatures at up to four locations within the unit can be recorded automatically. Subsystems Air Quality: Cabin air is exchanged with the AEM through a filter system. Four fans create a slight negative pressure inside the AEM, ensuring an inward flow of air and particulate entrapment by the treated outlet filter. Cabinet air is drawn through front panel inlet slots, then along the side plenum walls to the rear of the AEM, then through the inlet filter, across the cage/animal habitat area, through the exhaust filter, and exits the front of the AEM. High-efficiency air (inlet and outlet) filters (electrostatic and phosphoric acid-treated Fiberglas pads) prevent the escape of particulate matter into the cabin atmosphere. Treated charcoal inside the filters helps contain animal odor and neutralize urine within the AEM. The filter system is rated for 21 days of odor control. Lighting: Four internal incandescent lamps (two used as backup) provide illumination and are controlled by an automatic timer to provide a standard 12:12 light/dark cycle. The timer is programmable for other light/dark cycles and a backup battery maintains the timer if AEM power is disrupted. Only two lamps are used during the light cycle to keep cage compartment heating to a minimum. The lamps are covered with clear caps to protect them from animal debris and breakage. Food: Rodent food bars are attached to four slide-in food bar plates inside the rodent cage. The food, a sterilized laboratory formula (either standard or principal investigator- formulated), is molded into rectangular bars accessible to the animals at all times during the mission. Water Box: The AEM accommodates an internal water supply containing four lixit drinking valves and two flexible plastic bladders for water storage. Remaining water can be observed through the Lexan window on top of the water box. Water Refill Box: This water refill box (WRB) is used for in-flight refill of drinking water in the AEM. Water can be pumped from the refill box to the AEM by the WRB's peristatic pump. The bladder in the box can hold up to 3 liters. The box also can be refilled from the orbiter galley if necessary. 118 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Specifications: Dimensions: 17(W) x 20(D) x 9.6 (H) inches Weight: 55 lbs (including rodents, food and water) Power: 35 W (2 lights only) 119 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration STARS Student Experiments SPACEHAB's complement of commercial experiments includes six educational experiments designed and developed by students in six different countries under the auspices of Space Technology and Research Students (STARS), a global education program managed by SPACEHAB subsidiary Space Media. The student investigators who conceived these experiments will monitor their operations in space. The experiments will be housed in BioServe Space Technologies' Isothermal Containment Module (ICM --a small temperature-controlled facility that provides experiment support such as physical containment, lighting, and video imaging) and stowed in a middeck-size locker aboard the Research Double Module. ASTROSPIDERS - SPIDERS IN SPACE Glen Waverely Secondary Co llege, Melbourne, Australia http://www.gwsc.vic.edu.au/stars/index.htm Spider silk is one of the strongest materials on Earth. Each fiber can stretch 40 percent of its length and absorb 100 times as much energy as steel without breaking. The spider's unique method of silk production is comparable to methods for producing advanced materials such as carbon fiber and Kevlar. While artificial fibers can be expensive and environmentally unfriendly, spiders can manufacture superior materials in the relatively benign environment of their internal organs. The spider species chosen for flight is the Garden Orb Weaver (Eriophora biapicata), because it builds a perfect orb web, renews its web every night, is nonpoisonous, has a placid nature, and is commonly found in Australia and New Zealand while similar species are found in North America. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the spider will build a different web than the sort of web it would make on Earth. The web's makeup may also be affected. The aim of this experiment is to investigate how a spider adapts to life in microgravity, determine how spiders spin their webs in microgravity, observe how spiders eat in a weightless environment, and capture web samples for analysis on Earth. The Victorian Department of State and Regional Development is sponsoring this experiment. The Melbourne Zoo and the RMIT University are providing assistance. SILKWORM LIFE CYCLE DURING SPACEFLIGHT Jingshan School, Beijing, China The objective of this experiment is to observe and characterize the effects of spaceflight on the development of silkworm eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. Upon their return to Earth, the silkworms and the silk they produce in space will be examined and compared to 120 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration equivalent organisms and silk grown under identical environmental conditions on the ground. The hypothesis for this experiment is that silkworm larvae will develop differently in a low- gravity environment, possibly due to the direct effects of microgravity or to indirect effects such as altered eating habits or other behavioral changes; that microgravity will affect the placement and construction of the silkworms' cocoons as well as the process of emergence for adult moths; and that microgravity will affect the development of silkworm eggs, particularly during the first hours of cell division. China Time Network is providing support to Jingshan School for this experiment. CHEMICAL GARDEN Ort-Matzkin School, Haifa, Israel This experiment is designed to allow investigators to observe the growth of cobalt and calcium chloride salt filaments in a sodium silicate solution. In Earth gravity, thin crystal filaments grow towards the surface of the aqueous medium. Investigators surmise that this preference toward upward growth may be negated during spaceflight, allowing them to investigate the growth mechanisms of crystalline fibers. Investigators anticipate that, in space, the crys talline fibers or filaments will grow differently in microgravity because the fiber growth mechanisms are gravitropic. One hypothesis is that air bubbles often appearing at the tips of growing filaments could act as a buoyant force, pulling filaments toward the top of the aqueous medium. A second hypothesis involves the effects of hydrostatic pressure differential. Typically, filaments grow in small stages, appearing somewhat like a continual stack of tiny spheres. The pressure differential between the top and the bottom of a sphere may cause the top of the sphere to crack and act as the nucleation site for the next sphere. In either case, elimination of the gravity field should provide insight into the growth mechanisms of salt filaments. Technion University is providing support to this experiment. FLIGHT OF THE MEDAKA FISH Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan This experiment will examine the effect of microgravity on a closed aquatic environment including Medaka fish embryos during a 16-day spaceflight. Student investigator Maki Nihori of Ochanomizu University has hypothesized that Medaka fish fry will develop faster in microgravity, possibly due to lower expenditure of energy. She also anticipates that Medaka fish fry hatched in microgravity will behave normally and have an adaptation period followed by normal swimming behavior after returning to Earth. 121 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Sponsors and partners for this experiment include the Tokyo Institute of Technology Foundation, the Japanese Space Promotion Center, and the Japan-U.S. Science, Technology and Space Applications Program. Paragon Space Development Corp. of Tucson, Arizona, is providing its Autonomous Biological System, a self-contained life support system, for this experiment; Paragon also provided the student investigator with a two-month internship in ecosystems research. SPICE BEES IN SPACE Liechtenstein Gymnasium, Liechtenstein This experiment studies the behavior of carpenter bees. Female carpenter bees construct nests by boring tunnels in flower stalks or wood. When the bees construct tunnels in wood, their chewing can be heard from several feet away. A female bee may construct several tunnels a season. Each finished tunnel branches into a series of cells, in which the female deposits pollen and nectar and then lays eggs on the food mass. Investigators hypothesize that carpenter bees will exhibit different behaviors in microgravity than they do on Earth. Their tunneling habits will likely be altered since they may find it difficult to determine their gravity vectors in space. Tunnels drilled in space therefore may take on a different shape than those made on the ground. The VP Bank of Liechtenstein is sponsoring this experiment. ANTS IN SPACE Fowler High School, Syracuse, New York The objective of this experiment is to observe and characterize the effects of spaceflight on the tunneling behavior of harvester ants, focused on their activity level and social interactions. Upon their return to Earth, the ants and their tunnels will be examined and compared to an equivalent colony kept under similar environmental conditions on the ground. A special transparent gel will serve as the ants' tunneling medium, food and water source, and antifungal material. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the ants will tunnel at a slower rate in microgravity than they do on Earth. Investigators anticipate that ants will tunnel and forage differently in microgravity, possibly due to the direct effects of microgravity or indirect effects such as altered eating habits or other behaviors. As the ants begin to build their tunnels as a means of foraging for food, microgravity may affect the ants' placement and construction of tunnels as well as their foraging habits. Further, microgravity may affect the structure of tunnels once they are made, particularly during the latter stages of flight. Because ants are highly social and collectively industrious creatures, some changes in colony behavior can be expected. The stresses involved in adapting to microgravity may cause deterioration in the social fabric of the colony and changes in collective behavior. 122 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Syracuse University is providing support to this experiment.

Pre- and Post-flight Detailed S upplementary Objectives (DSOs) Pharmacokinetics & Contributing Physio logic Changes During Spaceflight - Protocol B (DSO 632) Changes in gastrointestinal function and physiology as a result of spaceflight affect drug absorption and the bioavailability of oral me dications, which can compromise therapeutic effectiveness. This DSO will lead to the design and development of effective pharmocological countermeasures and therapeutic adjustments for spaceflight. Spatial Reorientation Following Spaceflight (DSO 635) A previous observation suggested that discordant sensory stimuli caused by an unusual motion environment disrupted spatial orientation and balance control in a returning crewmember by triggering a state change in central vestibular processing. The findings of the current investigation are expected to demonstrate the degree to which challenging motion environments may affect post-flight (re)adaptation to gravity. 124 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Reference Data Shuttle Abort History RSLS Abort History: (STS-41 D) June 26, 1984 The countdown for the second launch attempt for Discovery's maiden flight ended at T-4 seconds when the orbiter's computers detected a sluggish valve in main engine #3.The main engine was replaced and Discovery was finally launched on August 30, 1984. (STS-51 F) July 12, 1985 The countdown for Challenger's launch was halted at T-3 seconds when on- boardcomputers detected a problem with a coolant valve on main engine #2. The valve wasreplaced and Challenger was launched on July 29, 1985. (STS-55) March 22, 1993 The countdown for Columbia's launch was halted by on-board computers at T-3seconds following a problem with purge pressure readings in the oxidizer preburner onmain engine #2 Columbia's three main engines were replaced on the launch pad, andthe flight was rescheduled behind Discovery's launch on STS-56. Columbia finallylaunched on April 26, 1993. (STS-51) August 12, 1993 The countdown for Discovery's third launch attempt ended at the T-3 second markwhen on- board computers detected the failure of one of four sensors in main engine #2which monitor the flow of hydrogen fuel to the engine. All of Discovery's main engineswere ordered replaced on the launch pad, delaying the Shuttle's fourth launch attemptuntil September 12, 1993. (STS-68) August 18, 1994 The countdown for Endeavour's first launch attempt ended 1.9 seconds before liftoffwhen on-board computers detected higher than acceptable readings in one channel of asensor monitoring the discharge temperature of the high pressure oxidizer turbopump inmain engine #3. A test firing of the engine at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi onSeptember 2nd confirmed that a slight drift in a fuel flow meter in the engine caused aslight increase in the turbopump's temperature. The test firing also confirmed a slightlyslower start for main engine #3 during the pad abort, which could have contributed tothe higher temperatures. After Endeavour was brought back to the Vehicle 125 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration AssemblyBuilding to be outfitted with three replacement engines, NASA managers set October2nd as the date for Endeavour's second launch attempt. Abort to Orbit History: (STS-51 F) July 29, 1985 After an RSLS abort on July 12, 1985, Challenger was launched on July 29, 1985. Fiveminutes and 45 seconds after launch, a sensor problem resulted in the shutdown ofcenter engine #1, resulting in a safe \"abort to orbit\" and successful completion of themission. 126 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Reference Data Shuttle Abort Modes RSLS ABORTS These occur when the onboard shuttle computers detect a problem and command a halt inthe launch sequence after taking over from the Ground Launch Sequencer and before SolidRocket Booster ignition. ASCENT ABORTS Selection of an ascent abort mode may become necessary if there is a failure that affectsvehicle performance, such as the failure of a space shuttle main engine or an orbitalmaneuvering system. Other failures requiring early term ination of a flight, such as a cabinleak, might also require the selection of an abort mode. There are two basic types of ascent abort modes for space shuttle missions: intact aborts and contingency aborts. Intact aborts are designed to provide a safe return of the orbiter toa planned landing site. Contingency aborts are designed to permit flight crew survivalfollowing more severe failures when an intact abort is not possible. A contingency abort would generally result in a ditch operation. INTACT ABORTS There are four types of intact aborts: abort to orbit (ATO), abort once around (AOA), transoceanic abort landing (TAL) and return to launch site (RTLS). Return to Launch Site The RTLS abort mode is designed to allow the return of the orbiter, crew, and payload tothe launch site, Kennedy Space Center, approximately 25 minutes after lift-off.The RTLS profile is designed to accommodate the loss of thrust from one space shuttle main engine between lift-off and approximately four minutes 20 seconds, at which time not enough main propulsion system propellant remains to return to the launch site. An RTLS can be considered to consist of three stages--a powered stage, during which the space shuttle main engines are still thrusting; an ET separat ion phase; and the glide phase, during which the orbiter glides to a landing at the Kennedy Space Center. The powered RTLS phase begins with the crew selection of the RTLS abort, which is done after solid rocket booster separation. The crew selects the abort mode by positioning the abort rotary switch to RTLS and depressing the abort push button. The time at which the RTLS is selected depends on the reason for the abort. For example, a three-engine RTLS is selected at the last moment, approximately three minutes 34 seconds into the mission; whereas an RTLS chosen due to 127 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration an engine out at lift-off is selected at the earliest time, approximately two minutes 20 seconds into the mission (after solid rocket booster separation). After RTLS is selected, the vehicle continues downrange to dissipate excess main propulsion system propellant. The goal is to leave only enough main propulsion system propellant to be able to turn the vehicle around, fly back towards the Kennedy Space Center and achieve the proper main engine cutoff conditions so the vehicle can glide to the Kennedy Space Center after external tank separation. During the downrange phase, a pitch-around maneuver is initiated (the time depends in part on the time of a space shuttle main engine failure) to orient the orbiter/external tank configuration to a heads up attitude, pointing toward the launch site. At this time, the vehicle is still moving away from the launch site, but the space shuttle main engines are now thrusting to null the downrange velocity. In addition, excess orbital maneuvering system and reaction control system propellants are dumped by continuous orbital maneuvering system and reaction control system engine thrustings to improve the orbiter weight and center of gravity for the glide phase and landing. The vehicle will reach the desired main engine cutoff point with less than 2 percent excess propellant remaining in the external tank. At main engine cutoff minus 20 seconds, a pitchdown maneuver (called powered pitch-down) takes the mated vehicle to the required external tank separation attitude and pitch rate. After main engine cutoff has been commanded, the external tank separation sequence begins, including a reaction control system translation that ensures that the orbiter does not recontact the external tank and that the orbiter has achieved the necessary pitch attitude to begin the glide phase of the RTLS. After the reaction control system translation maneuver has been completed, the glide phase of the RTLS begins. From then on, the RTLS is handled similarly to a normal entry. Transoceanic Abort Landing The TAL abort mode was developed to improve the options available when a space shuttle main engine fails after the last RTLS opportunity but before the first time that an AOA can be accomplished with only two space shuttle main engines or when a major orbiter system failure, for example, a large cabin pressure leak or cooling system failure, occurs after the last RTLS opportunity, making it imperative to land as quickly as possible. In a TAL abort, the vehicle continues on a ballis tic trajectory across the Atlantic Ocean to land at a predetermined runway. Landing occurs approximately 45 minutes after launch. The landing site is selected near the nominal ascent ground track of the orbiter in order to make the most efficient use of space shuttle main engine propellant. The landing site also must have the necessary runway length, weather conditions and U.S. State Department approval. Currently, the three landing sites that have been identified for a due east launch are Moron, Spain; Zaragoza, Spain; and Ben Guerur, Morocco (on the west coast of Africa). 128 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration To select the TAL abort mode, the crew must place the abort rotary switch in the TAL/AOA position and depress the abort push button before main engine cutoff. (Depressing it after main engine cutoff selects the AOA abort mode.) The TAL abort mode begins sending commands to steer the vehicle toward the plane of the landing site. It also rolls the vehicle heads up before main engine cutoff and sends commands to begin an orbital maneuvering system propellant dump (by burning the propellants through the orbital maneuveringsystem engines and the reaction control system engines). This dump is necessary to increase vehicle performance (by decreasing weight), to place the center of gravity in the proper place for vehicle control, and to decrease the vehicle's landing weight. TAL is handled like a nominal entry. Abort to Orbit An ATO is an abort mode used to boost the orbiter to a safe orbital altitude when performance has been lost and it is impossible to reach the planned orbital altitude. If a space shuttle main engine fails in a region that results in a main engine cutoff under speed, the Mission Control Center will determine that an abort mode is necessary and will inform the crew. The orbital maneuvering system engines would be used to place the orbiter in a circular orbit. Abort Once Around The AOA abort mode is used in cases in which vehicle performance has been lost to such an extent that either it is impossible to achieve a viable orbit or not enough orbital maneuvering system propellant is available to accomplish the orbital maneuvering system thrusting maneuver to place the orbiter on orbit and the deorbit thrusting maneuver. In addition, an AOA is used in cases in which a major systems problem (cabin leak, loss of cooling) makes it necessary to land quickly. In the AOA abort mode, one orbital maneuvering system thrusting sequence is made to adjust the post-main engine cutoff orbit so a second orbital maneuvering system thru sting sequence will result in the vehicle deorbiting and landing at the AOA landing site (White Sands, N.M.; Edwards Air Force Base; or the Kennedy Space Center). Thus, an AOA results in the orbiter circling the Earth once and landing approximately 90 minutes after lift-off. After the deorbit thrusting sequence has been executed, the flight crew flies to a landing at the planned site much as it would for a nominal entry. CONTINGENCY ABORTS Contingency aborts are caused by loss of more than one main engine or failures in other systems. Loss of one main engine while another is stuck at a low thrust setting may also necessitate a contingency abort. Such an abort would maintain orbiter integrity for in-flight crew escape if a landing cannot be achieved at a suitable landing field. 129 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Contingency aborts due to system failures other than those involving the main engines would normally result in an intact recovery of vehicle and crew. Loss of more than one main engine may, depending on engine failure times, result in a safe runway landing. However, in most three-engine-out cases during ascent, the orbiter would have to be ditched. The inflight crew escape system would be used before ditching the orbiter. ABORT DECISIONS There is a definite order of preference for the various abort modes. The type of failure and the time of the failure determine which type of abort is selected. In cases where performance loss is the only factor, the preferred modes would be ATO, AOA, TAL and RTLS, in that order. The mode chosen is the highest one that can be completed with the remaining vehicle performance. In the case of some support system failures, such as cabin leaks or vehicle cooling problems, the preferred mode might be the one that will end the mission most quickly. In these cases, TAL or RTLS might be preferable to AOA or ATO. A contingency abort is never chosen if another abort option exists. The Mission Control Center-Houston is prime for calling these aborts because it has a more precise knowledge of the orbiter's position than the crew can obtain from onboard systems. Before main engine cutoff, Mission Control makes periodic calls to the crew to tell them which abort mode is (or is not) available. If ground communications are lost, the flight crew has onboard methods, such as cue cards, dedicated displays and display information, to determine the current abort region. Which abort mode is selected depends on the cause and timing of the failure causing the abort and which mode is safest or improves mission success. If the problem is a space shuttle main engine failure, the flight crew and Mission Control Center select the best option available at the time a space shuttle main engine fails. If the problem is a system failure that jeopardizes the vehicle, the fastest abort mode that results in the earliest vehicle landing is chosen. RTLS and TAL are the quickest options (35 minutes), whereas an AOA requires approximately 90 minutes. Which of these is selected depends on the time of the failure with three good space shuttle main engines. The flight crew selects the abort mode by positioning an abort mode switch and depressing an abort push button. 130 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Reference Data Space Shuttle Rendezvous Maneuvers COMMON SHUTTLE RENDEZVOUS MANEUVERS OMS-1 (Orbit insertion) - Rarely used ascent abort burn OMS-2 (Orbit insertion) - Typically used to circularize the initial orbit following ascent, completing orbital insertion. For ground-up rendezvous flights, also considered a rendezvous phasing burn NC (Rendezvous phasing) - Performed to hit a range relative to the target at a future time NH (Rendezvous he ight adjust) - Performed to hit a delta-height relative to the target at a future time NPC (Rendezvous plane change) - Performed to remove planar errors relative to the target at a future time NCC (Rendezvous corrective combination) - First on-board targeted burn in the rendezvous sequence. Using star tracker data, it is performed to remove phasing and height errors relative to the target at Ti Ti (Rendezvous te rminal intercept) - Second on-board targeted burn in the rendezvous sequence. Using primarily rendezvous radar data, it places the Orbiter on a trajectory to intercept the target in one orbit MC-1, MC-2, MC-3, MC-4 (Rendezvous midcourse burns) - These on-board targeted burns use star tracker and rendezvous radar data to correct the post-Ti trajectory in preparation for the final, manual proximity operations phase 131 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Reference Data Space Shuttle Main Engines Developed in the 1970s by NASA's Marshall Spac e Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., the Space Shuttle Main Engine is the most advanced liquid-fueled rocket engine ever built. Its main features include variable thrust, high pe rformance, reusability, high redundancy, and a fully integrated engine controller. The shuttle's three main engines are mounted on the Orbiter aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. Spaced so that they are movable during launch, the engines are used - in conjunction with the Solid Rocket Boosters - to steer the shuttle vehicle. Each of these powerful main engines is 14 feet (4.2 meters) long, weighs approximately 7,000 pounds (3,150 kilograms) and is 7.5 feet (2.25 meters) in diameter at the end of its nozzle. The engines operate for about eight-and-one-half minutes during liftoff and ascent -- burning more than 500,000 gallons (1.9 millio n liters) of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants stored in the huge external tank attached to the underside of the shuttle. The engines shut down just before the shuttle, traveling at about 17,000 mph (28,000 kilometers per hour), reaches orbit. The Main Engine operates at greater temperature extremes than any mechanical system in common use today. The fuel, liquefied hydrogen at -423 degrees Fahrenheit (-253 degrees Celsius) is the second coldest liquid on Earth. When it and the liquid oxygen are combusted, the temperature in the main combustion chamber is 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit (3,316 degrees Celsius), hotter than the boiling point of iron. The main engines use a staged combustion cycle so that all propellants entering the engines are used to produce thrust or power -- more efficiently than any previous rocket engine. In a staged combustion cycle, propellants are first burned partially at high pressure and relatively low temperature -- then burned completely at high temperature and pressure in the main combustion chamber. The rapid mixing of the propellants under these conditions is so complete that 99 percent of the fuel is burned. At normal operating level, the engines generate 490,847 pounds of thrust (measured in a vacuum). Full power is 512,900 pounds of thrust; minimum power is at 316,100 pounds of thrust. The engine can be throttled by varying the output of the pre-burners, thus varying the speed of the high-pressure turbopumps and, therefore, the flow of the propellant. 132 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration At approximately 26 seconds into launch the main engines are throttled down to 316,000 pounds of thrust to keep the dynamic pressure on the vehicle below a specified level -- about 580 pounds per square foot or max q. Then, the engines are throttled back up to normal operating level at approximately 60 seconds. This reduces stress on the vehicle. The main engines are throttled down again at approximately seven minutes 40 seconds into the mission to maintain 3 g's - three times the Earth's gravitational pull - again reducing stress on the crew and the vehicle. This acceleration level is about one-third the acceleration experienced on previous crewed space flights. Approximately 10 seconds before Main Engine Cutoff or MECO, the cutoff sequence begins; about three seconds later the main engines are commanded to begin throttling at 10-percent thrust per second to 65-percent thrust. This is held for approximately 6.7seconds, and the engines are shut down. The engine performance has the highest thrust for its weight of any engine yet developed. In fact, one Space Shuttle Main Engine generates sufficient thrust to maintain the flight of two-and-one-half 747 airplanes. The Space Shuttle Main Engine is also the first rocket engine to use a built-in electronic digital controller, or computer. The controller will accept commands from the Orbiter for engine start, change in throttle, shutdown, and monitor engine operation. In the event of a failure, the controller automatically corrects the problem or safely shuts down the engine. NASA continues to increase the reliability and safety of shuttle flights through a series of enhancements to the Space Shuttle Main Engines. The engines were modified in 1988, 1995, 1998 and 2001. Modifications include new high-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps that reduce maintenance and operating costs of the engine, a two-duct powerhead that reduces pressure and turbulence in the engine, a single-coil heat exchanger that lowers the number of post flight inspections required. Another modification incorporates a large-throat main combustion chamber that improves the engine's reliability by reducing pressure and temperature in the chamber. NASA projects an upcoming enhancement - the Advanced Health Management System - will further improve safety, reliability and performance. The Advanced Health Management System is a high tech system that couples optical and vibration sensors with advanced processing and computing technology. It will monitor the main engines and \"see\" any problems. After the orbiter lands, the engines are removed and returned to a processing facility at Kennedy Space Cent er, Fla., where they are rech ecked and readied for the next flight. Some components are returned to the main engine's prime contractor, Rocketdyne Propulsion & Power unit of the Boeing Company, Canoga Park, Calif., for regular maintenance. The main engines are designed to operate for 7.5 accumulated hours. 133 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Reference Data Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters The two SRBs provide the main thrust to lift the space shuttle off the pad and up to an altitude of about 150,000 feet, or 24 nautical miles (28 statute miles). In addition, the two SRBs carry the entire weight of the external tank and orbiter and transmit the weight load through their structure to the mobile launcher platform. Each booster has a thrust (sea level) of approximately 3,300,000 pounds at launch. They are ignited after the three space shuttle main engines' thrust level is verified. The two SRBs provide 71.4 percent of the thrust at lift- off and during first-stage ascent. Seventy- five seconds after SRB separation, SRB apogee occurs at an altitude of approximately 220,000 feet, or 35 nautical miles (40 statute miles). SRB impact occurs in the ocean approximately 122 nautical miles (140 statute miles) downrange. The SRBs are the largest solid-propellant motors ever flown and the first designed for reuse. Each is 149.16 feet long and 12.17 feet in diameter. Each SRB weighs approximately 1,300,000 pounds at launch. The propellant for each solid rocket motor weighs approximately 1,100,000 pounds. The inert weight of each SRB is approximately 192,000 pounds. Primary elements of each booster are the motor (including case, propellant, igniter and nozzle), structure, separation systems, operational flight instrumentation, recovery avionics, pyrotechnics, deceleration system, thrust vector control system and range safety destruct system. Each booster is attached to the external tank at the SRB's aft frame by two lateral sway braces and a diagonal attachment. The forward end of each SRB is attached to the external tank at the forward end of the SRB's forward skirt. On the launch pad, each booster also is attached to the mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four bolts and nuts that are severed by small explosives at lift-off. During the downtime following the Challenger accident, detailed structural analyses were performed on critical structural elements of the SRB. Analyses were primarily focused in areas where anomalies had been noted during postflight inspection of recovered hardware. One of the areas was the attach ring where the SRBs are connected to the external tank. Areas of distress were noted in some of the fasteners where the ring attaches to the SRB motor case. This situation was attributed to the high loads encountered during water impact. To correct the situation and ensure higher strength margins during ascent, the attach ring was redesigned to encircle the motor case completely (360 degrees). Previously, the attach ring formed a C and encircled the motor case 270 degrees. 134 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Additionally, special structural tests were performed on the aft skirt. During this test program, an anomaly occurred in a critical weld between the hold-down post and skin of the skirt. A redesign was implemented to add reinforcement brackets and fittings in the aft ring of the skirt. These two modifications added approximately 450 pounds to the weight of each SRB. The propellant mixture in each SRB motor consists of an ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer, 69.6 percent by weight), aluminum (fuel, 16 percent), iron oxide (a catalyst, 0.4 percent), a polymer (a binder that holds the mixture together, 12.04 percent), and an epoxy curing agent (1.96 percent). The propellant is an 11-point star-shaped perforation in the forward motor segment and a double-truncated-cone perforation in each of the aft segments and aft closure. This configuration provides high thrust at ignition and then reduces the thrust by approximately a third 50 seconds after lift-off to prevent overstressing the vehicle during maximum dynamic pressure. The SRBs are used as matched pairs and each is made up of four solid rocket motor segments. The pairs are matched by loading each of the four motor segments in pairs from the same batches of propellant ingredients to minimize any thrust imbalance. The segmented-casing design assures maximum flexibility in fabrication and ease of transportation and handling. Each segment is shipped to the launch site on a heavy-duty rail car with a specially built cover. The nozzle expansion ratio of each booster beginning with the STS-8 mission is 7-to-79. The nozzle is gimbaled for thrust vector (direction) control. Each SRB has its own redundant auxiliary power units and hydraulic pumps. The all-axis gimbaling capability is 8 degrees. Each nozzle has a carbon cloth liner that erodes and chars during firing. The nozzle is a convergent-divergent, movable design in which an aft pivot-point flexible bearing is the gimbal mechanism. The cone- shaped aft skirt reacts the aft loads between the SRB and the mobile launcher platform. The four aft separation motors are mounted on the skirt. The aft section contains avionics, a thrust vector control system that consists of two auxiliary power units and hydraulic pumps, hydraulic systems and a nozzle extension jettison system. The forward section of each booster contains avionics, a sequencer, forward separation motors, a nose cone separation system, drogue and main parachutes, a recovery beacon, a recovery light, a parachute camera on selected flights and a range safety system. Each SRB has two integrated electronic assemblies, one forward and one aft. After burnout, the forward assembly initiates the release of the nose cap and frustum and turns on the recovery aids. The aft assembly, mounted in the external tank/SRB attach ring, connects with the forward assembly and the orbiter avionics systems for SRB ignition commands and nozzle thrust vector control. Each integrated electronic assembly has a 135 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration multiplexer/ demultiplexer, which sends or receives more than one message, signal or unit of information on a single communication channel. Eight booster separation motors (four in the nose frustum and four in the aft skirt) of each SRB thrust for 1.02 seconds at SRB separation from the external tank. Each solid rocket separation motor is 31.1 inches long and 12.8 inches in diameter. Location aids are provided for each SRB, frustum/drogue chutes and main parachutes. These include a transmitter, antenna, strobe/converter, battery and salt water switchelectronics. The location aids are designed for a minimum operating life of 72 hours and when refurbished are considered usable up to 20 times. The flashing light is an exception. It has an operating life of 280 hours. The battery is used only once. The SRB nose caps and nozzle extensions are not recovered. The recovery crew retrieves the SRBs, frustum/drogue chutes, and main parachutes. The nozzles are plugged, the solid rocket motors are dewatered, and the SRBs are towed back to the launch site. Each booster is removed from the water, and its components are disassembled and washed with fresh and deionized water to limit salt water corrosion. The motor segments, igniter and nozzle are shipped back to Thiokol for refurbishment. Each SRB incorporates a range safety system that includes a battery power source, receiver/ decoder, antennas and ordnance. HOLD-DOWN POSTS Each solid rocket booster has four hold-down posts that fit into corresponding support posts on the mobile launcher platform. Hold-down bolts hold the SRB and launcher platform posts together. Each bolt has a nut at each end, but only the top nut is frangible. The top nut contains two NASA standard detonators, which are ignited at solid rocket motor ignition commands. When the two NSDs are ignited at each hold-down, the hold-down bolt travels downward because of the release of tension in the bolt (pretensioned before launch), NSD gas pressure and gravity. The bolt is stopped by the stud deceleration stand, which contains sand. The SRB bolt is 28 inches long and is 3.5 inches in diameter. The frangible nut is captured in a blast container. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued by the orbiter''s computers through the master events controllers to the hold-down pyrotechnic initiator controllers on the mobile launcher platform. They provide the ignition to the hold-down NSDs. The launch processing system monitors the SRB hold-down PICs for low voltage during the last 16 seconds before launch. PIC low vo ltage will initiate a launch hold. 136 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration SRB IGNITION SRB ignition can occur only when a manual lock pin from each SRB safe and arm device has been removed. The ground crew removes the pin during prelaunch activities. At T minus five minutes, the SRB safe and arm device is rotated to the arm position. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued when the three SSMEs are at or above 90- percent rated thrust, no SSME fail and/or SRB ignition PIC low voltage is indicated and there are no holds from the LPS. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are sent by the orbiter computers through the MECs to the safe and arm device NSDs in each SRB. A PIC single-channel capacitor discharge device controls the firing of each pyrotechnic device. Three signals must be present simultaneously for the PIC to generate the pyro firing output. These signals--arm, fire 1 and fire 2--originate in the orbiter general-purpose computers and are transmitted to the MECs. The MECs reformat them to 28-volt dc signals for the PICs. The arm signal charges the PIC capacitor to 40 volts dc (minimum of 20 volts dc). The fire 2 commands cause the redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel. This ignites a pyro booster charge, which is retained in the safe and arm device behind a perforated plate. The booster charge ignites the propellant in the igniter initiator; and combustion products of this propellant ignite the solid rocket motor initiator, which fires down the length of the solid rocket motor igniting the solid rocket motor propellant. The GPC launch sequence also controls certain critical main propulsion system valves and monitors the engine-ready indications from the SSMEs. The MPS start commands are issued by the onboard computers at T minus 6.6 seconds (staggered start--engine three, engine two, engine one--all approximately within 0.25 of a second), and the sequence monitors the thrust buildup of each engine. All three SSMEs must reach the required 90- percent thrust within three seconds; otherwise, an orderly shutdown is commanded and safing functions are initiated. Normal thrust buildup to the required 90-percent thrust level will result in the SSMEs being commanded to the lift-off position at T minus three seconds as well as the fire 1 command being issued to arm the SRBs. At T minus three seconds, the vehicle base bending load modes are allowed to initialize (movement of approximately 25.5 inches measured at the tip of the external tank, with movement towards the external tank). At T minus zero, the two SRBs are ignited, under command of the four onboard computers; separation of the four explosive bolts on each SRB is initiated (each bolt is 28 inches long and 3.5 inches in diameter); the two T-0 umbilicals (one on each side of the spacecraft) are retracted; the onboard master timing unit, event timer and mission event timers are started; the three SSMEs are at 100 percent; and the ground launch sequence is terminated. 137 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The solid rocket motor thrust profile is tailored to reduce thrust during the maximum dynamic pressure region. ELECTRICAL POWER DISTRIBUTION Electrical power distribution in each SRB consists of orbiter-supplied main dc bus power to each SRB via SRB buses A, B and C. Orbiter main dc buses A, B and C supply main dc bus power to corresponding SRB buses A, B and C. In addition, orbiter main dc bus C supplies backup power to SRB buses A and B, and orbiter bus B supplies backup power to SRB bus C. This electrical power distribution arrangement allows all SRB buses to remain powered in the event one orbiter main bus fails. The nominal dc voltage is 28 volts dc, with an upper limit of 32 volts dc and a lower limit of 24 volts dc. HYDRAULIC POWER UNITS There are two self-contained, independent HPUs on each SRB. Each HPU consists of an auxiliary power unit, fuel supply module, hydr aulic pump, hydraulic reservoir and hydraulic fluid manifold assembly. The APUs are fueled by hydrazine and generate mechanical shaft power to a hydraulic pump that produces hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system. The two separate HPUs and two hydraulic systems are located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB nozzle and aft skirt. The HPU components are mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators. The two systems operate from T minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank. The two independent hydraulic systems are connected to the rock and tilt servoactuators. The APU controller electronics are located in the SRB aft integrated electronic assemblies on the aft external tank attach rings. The APUs and their fuel systems are isolated from each other. Each fuel supply module (tank) contains 22 pounds of hydrazine. The fuel tank is pressurized with gaseous nitrogen at 400 psi, which provides the force to expel (positive expulsion) the fuel from the tank to the fuel distribution line, maintaining a positive fuel supply to the APU throughout its operation. The fuel isolation valve is opened at APU startup to allow fuel to flow to the APU fuel pump and control valves and then to the gas generator. The gas generator's catalytic action decomposes the fuel and creates a hot gas. It feeds the hot gas exhaust product to the APU two-stage gas turbine. Fuel flows primarily through the startup bypass line until the APU speed is such that the fuel pump outlet pressure is greater than the bypass line's. Then all the fuel is supplied to the fuel pump. The APU turbine assembly provides mechanical power to the APU gearbox. The gearbox drives the APU fuel pump, hydraulic pump and lube oil pump. The APU lube oil pump 138 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration lubricates the gearbox. The turbine exhaust of each APU flows over the exterior of the gas generator, cooling it, and is then directed overboard through an exhaust duct. When the APU speed reaches 100 percent, the APU primary control valve closes, and the APU speed is controlled by the APU controller electronics. If the primary control valve logic fails to the open state, the secondary control valve assumes control of the APU at 112-percent speed. Each HPU on an SRB is connected to both servoactuators on that SRB. One HPU serves as the primary hydraulic source for the servoactuator, and the other HPU serves as the secondary hydraulics for the servoactuator. Each sevoactuator has a switching valve that allows the secondary hydraulics to power the actuator if the primary hydraulic pressure drops below 2,050 psi. A switch contact on the switching valve will close when the valve is in the secondary position. When the valve is closed, a signal is sent to the APU controller that inhibits the 100-percent APU speed control logic and enables the 112-percent APU speed control logic. The 100-percent APU speed enables one APU/HPU to supply sufficient operating hydraulic pressure to both servoactuators of that SRB. The APU 100-percent speed corresponds to rpm, 110-percent to 79,200 rpm, and 112-percent to 80,640 rpm. The hydraulic pump speed is 3,600 rpm and supplies hydraulic pressure of 3,050, plus or minus 50, psi. A high-pressure relief valve provides overpressure protection to the hydraulic system and relieves at 3,750 psi. The APUs/HPUs and hydraulic systems are reusable for 20 missions. THRUST VECTOR CONTROL Each SRB has two hydraulic gimbal servoactuators: one for rock and one for tilt. The servoactuators provide the force and control to gimbal the nozzle for thrust vector control. The space shuttle ascent thrust vector control portion of the flight control system directs the thrust of the three shuttle main engines and the two SRB nozzles to control shuttle attitude and trajectory during lift-off and ascent. Commands from the guidance system are transmitted to the ATVC drivers, which transmit signals proportional to the commands to each servoactuator of the main engines and SR Bs. Four independent flight control system channels and four ATVC channels control six main engine and four SRB ATVC drivers, with each driver controlling one hydraulic port on each main and SRB servoactuator. Each SRB servoactuator consists of four independent, two-stage servovalves that receive signals from the drivers. Each servovalve controls one power spool in each actuator, which positions an actuator ram and the nozzle to control the direction of thrust. 139 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The four servovalves in each actuator provide a force-summed majority voting arrangement to position the power spool. With four identical commands to the four servovalves, the actuator force-sum action prevents a single erroneous command from affecting power ram motion. If the erroneous command persists for more than a predetermined time, differential pressure sensing activates a selector valve to isolate and remove the defective servovalve hydraulic pressure, permitting the remaining channels and servovalves to control the actuator ram spool. Failure monitors are provided for each channel to indicate which channel has been bypassed. An isolation valve on each channel provides the capability of resetting a failed or bypassed channel. Each actuator ram is equipped with transducers for position feedback to the thrust vector control system. Within each servoactuator ram is a splashdown load relief assembly to cushion the nozzle at water splashdown and prevent damage to the nozzle flexible bearing. SRB RATE GYRO ASSEMBLIES Each SRB contains two RGAs, with each RGA containing one pitch and one yaw gyro. These provide an output proportional to angular rates about the pitch and yaw axes to the orbiter computers and guidance, navigation and control system during first-stage ascent flight in conjunction with the orbiter roll rate gyros until SRB separation. At SRB separation, a switchover is made from the SRB RGAs to the orbiter RGAs. The SRB RGA rates pass through the orbiter flight aft multiplexers/ demultiplexers to the orbiter GPCs. The RGA rates are then mid-value- selected in redundancy management to provide SRB pitch and yaw rates to the user software. The RGAs are designed for 20 missions. SRB SEPARATION SRB separation is initiated when the three solid rocket motor chamber pressure transducers are processed in the redundancy management middle value select and the head-end chamber pressure of both SRBs is less than or equal to 50 psi. A backup cue is the time elapsed from booster ignition. The separation sequence is initiated, commanding the thrust vector control actuators to the null position and putting the main propulsion system into a second-stage configuration (0.8 second from sequence initialization), which ensures the thrust of each SRB is less than 100,000 pounds. Orbiter yaw attitude is held for four seconds, and SRB thrust drops to less than 60,000 pounds. The SRBs separate from the external tank within 30 milliseconds of the ordnance firing command. 140 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration The forward attachment point consists of a ball (SRB) and socket (ET) held together by one bolt. The bolt contains one NSD pressure cartridge at each end. The forward attachment point also carries the range safety system cross-strap wiring connecting each SRB RSS and the ET RSS with each other. The aft attachment points consist of three separate struts: upper, diagonal and lower. Each strut contains one bolt with an NSD pressure cartridge at each end. The upper strut also carries the umbilical interface between its SRB an d the external tank and on to the orbiter. There are four booster separation motors on each end of each SRB. The BSMs separate the SRBs from the external tank. The solid rocket motors in each cluster of four are ignited by firing redundant NSD pressure cartridges into redundant confined detonating fuse manifolds. The separation commands issued from the orbiter by the SRB separation sequence initiate the redundant NSD pressure cartridge in each bolt and ignite the BSMs to effect a clean separation. 141 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Shuttle Reference Data Space Shuttle Super Light Weight Tank (SLWT) The super lightweight external tank (SLWT) made its first shuttle flight June 2, 1998, on mission STS-91. The SLWT is 7,500 pounds lighter than the standard external tank. The lighter weight tank will allow the shuttle to deliver International Space Station elements (such as the service module) into the proper orbit. The SLWT is the same size as the previous design. But the liquid hydrogen tank and the liquid oxygen tank are made of aluminum lithium, a lighter, stronger material than the metal alloy used for the shuttle's current tank. The tank's structural design has also been improved, making it 30% stronger and 5% less dense. The SLWT, like the standard tank, is manufactured at Michoud Assembly, near New Orleans, Louisiana, by Lockheed Martin. The 154-foot-long external tank is the largest single component of the space shuttle. It stands taller than a 15-story building and has a diameter of about 27 feet. The external tank holds over 530,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in two separate tanks. The hydrogen (fuel) and liquid oxygen (oxidizer) are used as propellants for the shuttle's three main engines. 142 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration Acronyms and Abbreviations A/D Analog to Digital ACCESS Advanced Carrier Equipment Support System ADC Analog-to-Digital Conversion ADVCR Airborne Digital Video Camera Recorder AIA Avionics Interface Adapter AIREX TBD AMP Avionics Mounting Plate AMS Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AIA Analog Multiplexer AP Avionics Package APVM TBD ASPC Attached Shuttle Payload Center ATLAS Analysis of Thrust Structure Loads and Stresses B-SROC Belgian Space Remote Operation Center B-USOC Belgian-University Science Operation Center BDRF Bidirectional Reflectivity BIA Bus Interface Adapter C&DH Command and Data Handling Subsystem CANDOS Communications and Navigation Demonstration on Shuttle CCD Charge Coupled Device CCTV Closed-Circuit Television CDHS Command and Data Handling System CGSE Customer Ground Support Equipment CPM Central Processing Module CPU Central Processing Unit CVX Critical Viscosity in Xenon D/A Digital to Analog DACS Digital Acquisition and Control System dc direct current DFRC Dryden Flight Research Facility DIARAD Differential Absolute Radiometer DPU Digital Processing Unit DSP Digital Signal Processor DTMF Dual Tone Multifrequency DTP Data Take Period EDO Extended Duration Orbiter EEPROM Electrically Erasable Read-Only Memory 143 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration EMI Electromagnetic Interference EMP Experiment Mounting Plate EP Experiment Package EPROM Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory ESA European Sp ace A gency ESOC European Space Operations Cent EURECA European Retrievable Carrier EVA Extravehicular Activity FCP Fuel Cell Purge FES Flash Evaporator System FOV Field of View FREESTAR Fast Reaction Enabling Science Technology and Research GLAS Geoscience Laser Altimeter System GMT Greenwich Mean Time GN Ground Network GPS Global Positioning System GRC Glenn Research Center GSE Ground Support Equipment GSFC HH-Jr. Hitchhiker Paraffin HRIU Hitchhiker Remote Interface Infrared IRIG-B Interrange Instrumentation Group Type B ISS International Space Station JSC Johnson Space Center KUSP Ku-Band Signal Processor LED Light Emitting Diode LEP Lower End Plate LISA Lid Interlock Switch Assembly LMT Landmark Track Maneuver 144 STS-107 Shuttle Press Kit National Aeronautics and Space Administration LORE Limb Ozone Retrieval Experiment LOS Loss of Signal LPT Low Power Transceiver LV Low Voltage MA Multiaccess MCC-H Mission Control Center -
