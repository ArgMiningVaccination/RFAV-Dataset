How do we mitigate and manage COVID-19 cases on board? We have consulted with leading medical experts to create an extensive response plan for mitigating and managing COVID-19 cases on our ships, and have also made arrangements with local port, health and transportation authorities to support our ships should it become necessary. We have enhanced our shipboard medical capabilities with the necessary staffing, medications, supplies, oxygen, equipment and procedures to triage and treat multiple COVID-19 cases across the full clinical spectrum including intensive care. Our highly experienced doctors and nurses are up to date on the latest COVID-19 scientific status and trained on all relevant COVID-19 procedures. In addition to our onboard Medical Centres, our shoreside Health Operations Centre is staffed 24/7 by our team of dedicated medical and public health professionals. Other measures in place include, but not limited to: - COVID-19 viral testing capabilities, including PCR; - Detailed quarantine management plan including isolation staterooms for COVID-19 positive cases, as well as isolation ward and beds in the medical centre; - Enhanced cleaning and sanitising, including guest rooms and public areas; - Onboard signage and regular communication to guests about COVID-safe practices; and, - Regular monitoring of disease activity and health regulations in the destinations we visit so we can adjust our cruise itineraries as necessary. Do I need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to cruise? Carnival Cruise Line has welcomed the decision to lift all government mandated COVID restrictions for guests in Australia. These changes will be effective immediately across all Carnival Cruise Line operations. You should always ensure you understand all requirements to travel from your home country and the destinations you plan to visit. Details continue to be updated regularly and official websites and apps developed by government departments & agencies, and tourism ministries are the recommended resources, including: - Smart Traveller - Home Affairs - Safe Travel What happens if during my cruise I have COVID-19 or test positive? Any guests exhibiting symptoms of illness are encouraged to go to our medical centre. Guests who are diagnosed with contagious illnesses may be required to move to an isolation stateroom until our medical team determines if it is safe to resume cruise activities. Any guest who must isolate during their cruise, will be entitled to a Future Cruise Credit for the days spent in isolation. The Future Cruise Credit will be the value of the cruise fare paid for the number of cruise days missed less government taxes, fees and port expenses, and will be subject to our standard terms and conditions for Future Cruise Credits. What health care is available on board and how do I access it? Each ship has a dedicated team of medical staff operating the onboard medical centre to serve the general health care needs for guests and crew. Our highly experienced doctors and nurses are up to date on the latest COVID-19 scientific status and trained in relevant COVID-19 procedures. We have also enhanced our shipboard medical capabilities in terms of staffing, medications, supplies, oxygen, equipment and procedures to triage and treat multiple COVID-19 cases across the full clinical spectrum including intensive care. You can contact the medical centre using the phone in your room to request non-urgent appointments. This avoids congregation of patients in the medical centre and allows the medical staff to pre-determine the best location for the consultation, including your room. Whenever possible, anyone suspected of COVID-19 will be assessed and treated in their room with all medical first responders wearing full PPE. Medical staff will arrange safe transfer of any unwell individuals to the ship's Medical Centre if additional treatment is required that cannot be provided in the guest's room. All cruises on our ships are outside the scope of Australian Medicare, New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation and private health insurance. What is the cost of onboard health care? For cruises to or from Australia, there is a medical facility onboard where guests can have an initial consultation and COVID-19 related testing at their expense. Different policies may apply in other jurisdictions. Non-COVID-19 related medical consultations, treatment and medication will be charged at private rates, and must be paid for by the guest and should be claimed on guest's international travel insurance. All cruises on our ships are outside the scope of Australian Medicare, New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation and private health insurance. What happens if my medical needs cannot be supported on board and I need to be transported off the ship? While our onboard Medical Centres are equipped to handle many medical conditions, including COVID-19, there may be occasions where it becomes necessary to disembark or evacuate a guest to receive further essential medical treatment. To ensure guest safety, this decision will be made by the onboard doctor and the captain, in coordination with the relevant port and health authorities. Depending on medical water vessel or road ambulance, or a combination of these. Guests will be responsible for the costs of any evacuation required to treat COVID-19. Our CareTeam will provide support to any guest who requires medical evacuation, along with their family and travel party. What are the disembarkation arrangements for guests who test positive and close contacts? Guests who are in isolation, or a close contact, will be disembarked in a controlled manner, separate from other guests. Isolation arrangements can vary by country/region. For guests disembarked in Australia: - If a guest is well enough to travel home, they can proceed with their plans to return home. - If a guest is unwell and requires ongoing medical treatment, we will make the necessary arrangements to transfer them to a local hospital or medical facility. If the guest does not require medical attention and prefers to stay locally until they recover, Carnival will assist in making arrangements however the guest will be responsible for any expenses. Our CareTeam will provide assistance and support, as required, to guests who test positive to COVID-19 during their cruise, their families and any close contacts, to ensure they arrive home safely. I have an existing medical condition. Can I still cruise? We recommend guests seek advice from their medical practitioner about their condition and any possible risk associated with cruise travel. If you are travelling with a specific medical requirement, please let us know at the time of booking as we may require you to complete a medical questionnaire prior to travel. Guests who use oxygen (concentrators or tanks) and those who are undergoing dialysis are welcome to travel on cruises 7 days or less, but please let us know at the time of booking. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to welcome guests on board cruises of 8 nights or longer who are dependent on supplemental oxygen tanks or who are undergoing haemodialysis. Our medical experts have determined that, for the guests own safety, this is the right decision. We remain optimistic that our approach on future departures will become more flexible. Do I need travel insurance? We strongly recommend you purchase comprehensive international travel insurance that has both cruise and COVID coverage. Certain ports of call may impose a requirement that you hold travel insurance if you are medically disembarked from the ship. International medical and repatriation costs can be high and are outside the scope of Australian Medicare. NOTE: Guests traveling on a South Pacific cruise that calls on New Caledonia (Noumea or Lifou) must present printed proof of travel insurance at time of check-in. The selected international travel insurance must have both cruise and COVID coverage. Guests may also be requested to present it during the cruise. Any guest who is unable to provide proof of holding suitable travel insurance will be denied boarding. Will the cruise itinerary be altered if there are COVID-19 cases on board? Our cruise itineraries are never guaranteed and may be altered for various reasons. In the event of COVID-19 cases on board, depending on the level of transmission and perceived risk by local port and health authorities, we may not be permitted to visit certain destinations included in the cruise itinerary. How will guests be advised of COVID-19 positive cases and level of transmission on board? If there are a small number of controlled cases, only close contacts will be notified by the onboard medical staff. When there is a potential risk of ongoing COVID-19 transmission, guests will be advised, as required by health authorities. Communication may include onboard announcements, letters to guest rooms and additional information in the Carnival Hub App. Do guests need to be aware of and comply with Government entry requirements when returning from an international cruise, or when visiting the countries included in the itinerary? Guests arriving on a cruise that has transited international ports are responsible for ensuring they meet local government entry requirements. Failure to do so may result in denial of boarding, being issued a fine, deportation or the ship being denied entry. Guests are also responsible for ensuring they meet the entry requirements of the countries included in their itinerary, including any vaccination requirements. Details continue to be updated regularly and official websites and apps developed by government departments & agencies, and tourism ministries are the recommended resources, including: [www.smarttraveller.gov.au](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/) [www.homeaffairs.gov.au/COVID19/vaccination-testing](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/COVID19/vaccination-testing) [www.safetravel.govt.nz](https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/) What if a guest fails to comply with the required health protocols during their cruise? Anyone who doesn't comply with the onboard public health measures may be disembarked at the first available opportunity. Other consequences could include being denied service, required isolation in their room and being banned from cruising with Carnival Cruise Line and other Carnival Corporation and plc brands in future. For any guest who is non-compliant, no refund will be issued of the cruise fare for missed cruise days, nor will travel expenses (if flying home) be covered. If the travel party of a guest who is non-compliant is impacted and they are required or voluntarily choose to disembark with them, the same policies will apply to travel party: no refund of cruise fare for missed cruise days or coverage of travel expenses home. What if I test positive to COVID-19 within 5 days prior to sailing? If you test positive within 5 days prior to your cruise departure, you will not be able to travel and you should notify us or your travel agent as soon as possible so we can cancel your booking. In addition, if you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms at embarkation, you will be asked to complete a health screen and if you test positive to COVID-19, you will be denied boarding. If you have a valid travel insurance policy, please submit a claim with your insurance provider. In the event that your claim is denied, please contact reviews@carnival.com with your booking details and any relevant documentation, including a letter of denial from your insurance provider. Claims are reviewed on a case-by-case scenario, and there is no guarantee of reimbursement. What are the implications for guests travelling from overseas to join a cruise departing from Australia? Guests travelling from overseas to join a cruise departing from Australia must ensure they are able to meet the Australian government entry requirements, and ensure the COVID-19 vaccination course they have received is approved or recognised by the [Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) ](https://www.tga.gov.au/international-covid-19-vaccines-recognised-australia) We strongly recommend guests obtain appropriate international travel insurance which may cover costs associated with changes to travel arrangements. Also, it is a condition of entry into some countries that guests hold specific travel insurance. It is your responsibility to inform yourself about what insurance you are required to hold and carry proof of any coverage. Guests travelling from overseas should also ensure their travel insurance provides cover for COVID-19 related medical care. If ongoing medical treatment is required after disembarkation, any associated costs will be incurred by the guest. How will a COVID-19 outbreak on board be managed? We have a COVID-19 response management plan covering varying levels of risk determined by the number of positive COVID-19 cases, clusters and close contacts. In the unlikely event there is an outbreak of COVID-19 on board which is considered to be higher risk, all non-essential services will be suspended, and guests who are not isolating will be asked to minimise their movements around the ship and remain in their room as much as possible or utilise outdoor areas while maintaining physical distancing. Masks will also be required to be worn by guests at all times when outside their rooms, except while consuming food & drinks. The ship may still call at destinations for the provisioning of essential stores, subject to local health and port authority approvals, however shore visits will be suspended. In consultation with relevant health and port authorities, arrangements may be made to shorten the cruise and return to the closest suitable port to safely disembark all guests Where an outbreak is considered to be moderate risk, some services may be modified or suspended in order to mitigate the risk, as outlined in Question 21. Enhanced cleaning and sanitisation will be implemented in all areas, and hand washing or sanitiser use will be enforced at all food outlets and restaurants. Guests will be kept informed onboard of any COVID-19 outbreak and any changes to the situation and what this means, including any changes to onboard health protocols. In addition, guests due to board the next cruise after a COVID-19 outbreak of moderate to higher risk has occurred will be informed of this prior to boarding. Will activities be cancelled if there is a COVID-19 outbreak? Where an outbreak is considered to be moderate risk, some activities and services may be modified or suspended in order to mitigate the risk, which may include: - Reduced capacity in dining venues and lounges, with extended hours to facilitate physical distancing; - Suspension of dining events, such as Chef's table; - Walk-up bar service suspended, and only table service will be provided; - Modification or suspensions of Kids Club centre and procedures and activities; - Modification of entertainment, activities and shows, which may include reduced capacity, suspension, venue changes, shortening shows to increase frequency; - Closure of waterslides; - Reduced capacity in onboard shops; - Reduced capacity in the gym, with masks required to be worn at all times and increased sanitising; and - Closure of self-serve guest laundries. During a moderate level outbreak, where we are still permitted to call at a destination as determine by the local health and port authorities, some shore tours may need to be modified or cancelled. In the unlikely event there is an outbreak of COVID-19 on board which is considered to be higher risk, all non-essential services will be suspended. "}
