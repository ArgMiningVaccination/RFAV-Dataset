It's normal to feel tired or not completely on top of things every once in a while. However, feeling constantly fatigued or unable to focus is not normal for healthy people. Symptoms are your body's way of telling you something is wrong, and ignoring them can lead to even bigger problems. A [chiropractor](https://thinkvida.com/services/chiropractic/) can assess your spinal health and address musculoskeletal problems that rob your energy and your ability to concentrate. Chiropractic Care and Your Health Many factors can cause a decrease in your normal energy levels. Diet, stress, poor sleep, and even a misaligned spinal column could be to blame. Calling the chiropractor may not be your first thought when you feel fatigued, but maybe it should be. Chiropractic care takes a whole-body approach to health care. [Your chiropractor](https://thinkvida.com/blog/how-often-should-you-get-a-chiropractic-adjustment) isn't just interested in treating symptoms. Correcting the cause of those symptoms is the goal. With regular chiropractic care, you can improve your overall health, including energy levels and brainpower. How Does Chiropractic Care Affect Energy Levels? Imagine you have to carry a bowling ball around all day, but instead of carrying it close to your body to minimize strain, you have to hold it out in front of you. Walking around for hours holding a heavy ball like that would be exhausting. Something similar happens when your spine is not properly aligned. The human head weighs about the same as an average bowling ball. When your spine is out of alignment, your body has to work extra hard to hold up your head. It's as if your spine is carrying a bowling ball in an uncomfortable position 24 hours a day. The extra effort it takes to keep your head and the rest of your body upright and moving is a big drain on your energy reserves. In addition, subluxations (blockages) prevent the normal flow of nutrients and nerve activity to the muscles. Even before the misalignment is severe enough to cause pain, it is causing your entire system to work harder, and robbing it of vital energy flow. As problems progress, they can interrupt your sleep, which adds to daily fatigue. The Hormonal Factor One more way in which spinal misalignment affects energy is hormonal balance. Subluxations can cause an imbalance in hormone output, draining your adrenals and, ultimately, your energy. When the adrenals don't have an opportunity to recover, the cycle continues and worsens. Hormonal imbalance leads to overworked adrenals which leads to more hormonal imbalance. Instead of trying to increase your energy with caffeinated drinks, make an appointment with your chiropractor. Removing blockages in your spine will improve blood, which is essential to healthy, energized muscles. By relieving discomfort, an adjustment can also help you sleep better and wake more refreshed. Improve Concentration and Focus With Chiropractic Care Everyone experiences a moment of brain fog now and then, but when the inability to focus interferes with your productivity it's time to take it seriously. Brain fog is that feeling of being disconnected or unable to concentrate no matter how hard you try. When the musculoskeletal system becomes unbalanced, it can lead to decreased brain activity. Misalignment in the spine reduces nerve function, and blockages disrupt the flow of communication to and from the brain. The muscle stress caused by misalignment may also lead to a lack of focus. When your body is uncomfortable it creates stress \u2014 and stress is a distraction even if you're not aware of it. Taking medications to remedy the pain caused by subluxations adds even more stress to your already weakened system. Subluxations can also lead to headaches. Even minor headaches affect your ability to concentrate. People who sit at a computer for most of their workday are especially vulnerable to headaches that disrupt their ability to remain focused. Poor ergonomics plus eye strain can be a painful combination. Chiropractic care teaches that all things in the body are connected. A healthy spinal column is essential for top brain function. Correcting a misaligned spine will also help to relieve pain that may be distracting you or causing a tension overload that makes it difficult to concentrate. Improve Your Posture Too One more way that chiropractic care helps to increase energy and improve concentration is by improving your posture. This is especially true if poor posture is caused by sitting. Some of the benefits of good posture include deeper breathing \u2014 slower, deeper breaths bring more oxygen to the brain and muscles. Good posture also: - Increases concentration - Reduces pain and discomfort - Has a positive effect on self-confidence - Increased energy levels - Improves circulation See Your Chiropractor for Better Health Having more energy and better focus will benefit your life in many ways. Imagine having the energy to work out or socialize after work instead of going home and flopping into your favorite chair.
