Western drugs such as glucocorticoids, antihistamines, and leukotrienes are routinely utilized in clinics. However, drawbacks like high recurrence rates and adverse effects limit their use. As one of the most promising natural medicine systems, traditional Chinese medicine offers distinct benefits in treating allergic illnesses, such as maintaining long-term treatment, preventing disease recurrence, and producing fewer adverse reactions. We analyzed and discussed recent developments in traditional Chinese medicine used in allergic diseases from three perspectives: Chinese herbal formula, Chinese patent medicine, and active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine, and explained their main components, efficacy, and mechanisms of action. We also reviewed the modification of Chinese herbal formulas and the combined application of Chinese medicine with Western medicine or nonpharmaceutical therapies. Traditional Chinese medicines are becoming increasingly important in treating allergic disorders. Improving traditional Chinese herbal formulas and developing safe and effective Chinese patent medicines are currently the most pressing and important aspects of research on traditional Chinese medicine.
