We know that life returning to \"normal\" is critical for a child's optimal adjustment. An important part of \"normal\" life for children is continuing their education, whether through home bound teaching or attending school. Parents and children often face new obstacles when a child returns to school. To help, we created the HEAL program staffed by educational professionals to help address a child's educational care. Our Mission - Help medically fragile children experience success in learning despite limitations imposed by their medical condition - Educate students, parents, and school staff about the unique cognitive and social/emotional needs of medically fragile children and their impact on school success in order to obtain appropriate school services - Work with students and their parents to understand the impacts of illness and treatment on learning Who should receive HEAL services? - HEAL serves school-age patients at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford who's acquired medical condition impacts his/her ability to learn and participate in regular school or life experiences. - Resources for parents: [Returning to School Handbook in English](/content-public/pdf/returning-to-school-english.pdf)/ [Returning to in Spanish](http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/content-public/pdf/returning-to-school-spanish.pdf) What services are provided? - Neuropsychological testing based on referral from LPCH physician - Educational assessment as needed - Information for parents and schools about necessary specialized education and support services - School presentations to peers regarding a child's illness - Attendance at Individual Education Program (IEP), 504, or Student Support Team (SST) meetings to advocate for child's needs - Bridging between hospital, school, and parents - Recommendations for school interventions - Referrals to other professionals or agencies that can provide additional assessments and therapy How do I contact HEAL? - Pediatric patients are referred to HEAL based on the request from parents or medical/hospital staff - A liaison will send forms to the patient's family. Upon receipt of the forms a staff person will call the family to assess the patient's needs and to determine what services are required Additional Resources - Disability Rights California, 1-800-776-5746 - legal help - Family Advocacy Program - Youth and Education Law Project - Clinics - Stanford Law School, 650-723-4336 - Procedural Safeguards Division CA Department of Education - 1-800-926-0648 - U.S. Department of Education - [www.ed.gov](http://www.ed.gov) - California Online School - [k12.com](http://www.k12.com) HEAL Team Jeanne Kane, MA, is our Program Supervisor and Educational Specialist.
