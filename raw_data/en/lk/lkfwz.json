Below you can meet some of our staff. Wholistic and Holistic are actually variant spellings of the same practice. The (W)holistic practice is to treat the whole body as the body is designed to work together, rather than to treat individual parts. Traditional psychiatry can often view the brain as an isolated chemical organ and fall short of recognizing the dynamic interplay between the gut, brain, heart, and body and how we move through the world in our lives. Medical Staff The ATMC medical team consists of licensed medical professionals such as psychiatric prescribers, a naturopathic doctor, registered nurses, and an acupuncturist. The team blends approaches from both east and west to find the right balance of allopathic and natural methods in healing. Our medical staff works collaboratively with each other and the resident to find the best treatment for their unique needs. Medical Consultants Often, we consult with outside medical professionals so as to provide the highest quality of care for our population. The consultants have a history with ATMC, and serve as experts when and if needed for guidance as it relates to patient care. Clinical Staff Our clinical team is comprised of skilled and experienced clinicians such as psychologists, therapists, and care managers. Each resident is assigned their own therapist and care manager, each of whom they meet with on a weekly basis. In addition, residents have weekly meetings with their clinical team to collaborate on treatment planning and their unique needs. Holistic Detox Shoppe This team is comprised of supplement specialists and holistic detox shoppe members. They include massage therapists, specialists in physiological and metabolic repair, and persons who apply many of the core environmental medicine tenants of the ATMC program. Care Provider Staff The care provider team is available 24 hours a day to address the needs of our residents. Our care team prides itself on providing care with kindness, compassion, and respect. Graduates often offer gratitude for the care team stating that they go above and beyond for them. Administrative Staff Our administrative staff work both behind the scenes as well as being present and available in the therapeutic milieu. They are a diverse group of talented individuals who are passionate about this work. Support Staff Our support staff consists of a team of chefs who prepare all the delicious meals using only organic and whole foods.
