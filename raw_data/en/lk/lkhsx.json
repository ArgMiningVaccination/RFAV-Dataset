These problems are not caused directly by the negative feelings, but by behaviors that negative emotions can influence due to a lack of emotional regulation. For example, some people enjoy smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol as a way to relieve stress. However, those habits put you at a greater risk for [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm), heart disease, and other illnesses.

[Meditation](https://www.webmd.com/balance/meditation-directory) helps you to notice your thoughts and emotions, which is key to emotional wellness. Watch how you talk about yourself. Negative self-talk can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, or just put you in a negative mindset. Work on creating a positive image of yourself with your words. Your thoughts may soon follow. Set goals and celebrate your achievements. Give yourself something to strive for, and celebrate your accomplishments to build self-esteem and positive feelings about yourself. Use substances in moderation. Sometimes drinking too much alcohol is a way to numb difficult emotions. Notice when you are using substances more than usual, and think about whether there's an emotional cause for this. Learn strategies for resilience. This is your ability to react to difficult emotions and stressful situations. Many of the same things that help you with emotional health can also improve your [resilience](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/overcome-obstacles-resilience). Get enough sleep. Studies show that a lack of sleep lessens your ability to sense the emotions of others and your ability to process emotions in general. Exercise. Staying physically active for at least 30 minutes a day can help to improve your overall emotional health. The exercise doesn't need to be overly tough or intense. Just going for a walk or dancing around your house can help. Find meaning in your life. Some people have jobs that give them a feeling of purpose, but that's not the only way to find meaning in your life. Something as simple as caring for a pet or volunteering for a cause that you're passionate about can also give you that feeling. Know when to reach out for help. You don't have to handle negative emotions on your own. Knowing when to reach out to a mental health professional for help with difficult emotions is a useful skill to have. You should also reach out to one if you have tried to improve your emotional health, but still aren't feeling your best. "}
