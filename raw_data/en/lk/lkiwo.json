Where they disagreed the most was with the use of traditional healing in the intensive care units, only 16.9% agreed with the use of this treatment for serious illness, such as cardiac or respiratory compromise, whether in the hospital (21.2% agreed) or as outpatients (26.4% agreed). Nearly half (48.6%) agreed with using traditional medicines for chronic illnesses, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes or Parkinson's disease (Zubek, 1994, p. 1926). One instance where physicians were unwilling to allow their patients to use Native medicine was while the patient is in the hospital, because the physician could be held legally responsible for any treatment administered while admitted under their care. There is also the problem of differentiating between legitimate Native healing practitioners and those who would take advantage of anyone not aware of the proper rituals and techniques that need to be performed (Zubek, 1994, p. 1929). This could be overcome by having a formalized licensing organization such as is used by Western practitioners (i.e. American Society of Clinical Pathology [ASCP]). That poses another problem though, as to whether traditionalists would be willing to have such an organization. Many contemporary Indians use \"white man's medicine\" to treat \"white man's diseases.\" For example, diabetes, cancer, and gallbladder disease, and use Indian medicine to treat Indian problems (pain, disturbed family relationships resulting in physical symptoms, or sicknesses of the spirit, which may include mental illness and alcoholism).In addition, many Western pharmaceuticals were actually based on Indian herbal medicines (for example, aspirin is derived from willow bark). From the dawn of time healing has been influenced by many different issues, such as religion, politics of the time, different philosophies, and vested interest such as money. There had been conflicts between Eastern and Western medicine for a long time. Eastern medicine is viewed by many people in the Medicine is very common nowadays. People today will go to medicine as their first source when it comes to illness. There are Many indigenous systems of medicine were totally neglected and lost their significance in maintaining health. Health care services which were available only in general hospitals located in big cities and commercial centers were largely curative in nature. Later on, some preventive measures were adopted for the control of epidemics, and There are some ailments that they can't make go away with a pill or needle filled with an anti- Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. The first reason for supporting alternative medicine is because it's effective. In fact, Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for more than 5,000 years with proof of its effectiveness (Sutton, 2010, 95). In addition, TCM has punch of methods for treating patient's widely such as herbs and other (Sutton, 2010, 94-95). That means alternative medicine has proved its worth and won people's respect. A fair criticism of many practices within contemporary medicine is that they are too conventional: they rely too much on convention and not enough on scientific evidence. Unfortunately, much of medicine is based on tradition, orthodoxy, and convention. Labeling these medicine as a whole such as conventional medicine, traditional medicine, Alternative Medicine and the Christian Responsibility Acupuncture, ayurveda, chiropractice, homeopathy, meditation, osteopathy, and yoga are just a few of the many types of medicine practiced all over the world. According to the western establishment, all these forms of medicine are called alternative medicines. However, some of the aforementioned techniques have been in continuous use for over six thousand years, predating western medicine by over four thousand years. Yet, still many M.D.'s reject alternative forms of medicine. One of the buzzwords in medicine in recent years has been \"holistic medicine\". Physicians are becoming more aware of the need to treat the whole patient rather than just certain symptoms. Due to this Alternative Medicine Therapies Alternative remedies, sometimes known as complementary remedies, offer a wide variety of products and methods in improving well-being separate from contemporary medicinal practices. According to Basically, we have two choices to make when we develop a condition or disease: Treatment or Detoxification. If we choose treatment, we have two additional choices. The first choice is allopathic (pharmaceutical) medicine, which is the status-quo medical or chemical approach. The second choice is natural (traditional) medicine, which uses products made from natural sources or herbs to treat the symptoms. If we choose the allopathic approach to \"fight\" our disease, it is important to understand that allopathic medicine offers only three types of treatment for any condition: chemical medicines, radiation or surgery. Pharmaceutical companies spend a lot of money developing drugs and training medical (allopathic) doctors in how to use these Alternative Medicine Although \"Alternative\" or \"Complementary\" medicine has been kept on the fringes of the medical sciences in the past, it is becoming increasingly more popular, and more reputable. Alternative medicines are those medical systems which are not taught to or practiced by most conventional medical doctors. Alternative medicines seemingly have always existed, changing and conforming to the current climate of society. There seems to be an almost endless number of alternative medicines, each with their own method of gaining perfect health. Often people who are dissatisfied with conventional medicine turn to alternative medicine for their medical needs. Many similarities link the diverse extremities of alternative medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). On the other hand, it has many advantages in improving the human health. The main aim of practicing modern medicine is to eliminate the signs and symptoms of diseases, people who have a disability. For instance, normally doctors prescribed drugs for reducing fever, reducing the discomforts of the patient and observing the healing speed. They eliminate under control and uncomfortable signs and symptoms that help a patient "}
