The Children's Friend and Family Services Division is diverse and vibrant. A team of dedicated leaders and staff formed an initiative over a year ago called \"Listen-Learn-Lift\" to promote ongoing learning and action that contributes to a sense of belonging for all of our team members and persons served. Our monthly \"Courageous Conversations\" bring together people from across the Division and JRI to share space and engage in conversation with each other, which we believe contributes to racial healing. Building upon this, we collectively move towards action through policy and legislative advocacy, support through our various Affinity Groups, and professional growth opportunities through our [higher education partnerships](https://jri.org/about/careers/educational-opportunities)and other learning opportunities! - The Healing Powers of Nature, Mindfulness, and Creative Expression! Our teams include many expressive therapists, horticultural therapists, and individuals who strive to bring mindfulness, nature, and creativity into the work we do. From our Therapeutic Garden in Salem to our \"SEED\" Programming that encompasses \"Specialized Ecotherapies for Emotional Development\" our belief is that nature is a healer and an ongoing resource for our youth and families if we can help them to discover it. - Our team members are valued and we promote use of indoor and outdoor areas for mindfulness, meditation, and recharging. We have designated employee spaces for nursing moms to pump, like this (see photo below) Relaxation Room at our Salem Site. We strive to bring concrete self-care strategies to our teams including trauma sensitive yoga and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. We support our team members in exploring all elements of establishing life-work balance and ongoing career and professional growth.

They serve as our primary caregivers. Simply put - when families are strong, communities thrive.

At some point, we'll all be affected by one hardship or another. While no one is impervious to the strains of family life, not all families have the resources to deal with them. In many cases, some of those challenges are just too difficult to handle alone. That's why we're here. Every day, we come to work ready to help people who span the socio-economic scope improve their lives and better their families. We welcome your interest in supporting our mission \"To improve the lives of children and promote strong families.\" Fresh and inspiring clinical spaces have been created to welcome our persons served and provide a positive atmosphere for the therapeutic experience. Our offices support our range of nature infused, expressive, and mindfulness based approaches including SMART (Sensory Motor Arousal Regulation Treatment) as well as evidence-based practices like Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure and Response Prevention, and the Positive Parenting Program - Triple P. With trained horticultural therapists as a part of our team, we have grown and nurtured both indoor and outdoor spaces for individual and group therapy. Our garden provides a sensory experience for children and adults alike, with private spaces for outdoor sessions and ecotherapy interventions.

The PAT program works with parents from prenatal to kindergarten age by doing family centered assessments and following structured curriculum. Each participant is assigned a certified Parent Educator. A certified Parent Educator will do four interrelated and integrated components to the PAT model: - Personal Visits - Group Connections - Screening - Resource Networking How We Can Help The PAT model is designed to achieve four primary goals: - Increase parent knowledge of early childhood development & improve parenting practice - Provide early detection of developmental delays and health issues - Prevent child abuse and neglect - Increase children's school readiness and school success Who is eligible? To enroll in the PAT program, the parent must meet some simple requirements: - Reside in the Greater Lawrence area - Be pregnant or have a child up to kindergarten age (age 5) - Be present for and participate actively in all scheduled visits We provide Coordinated Specialty Care for people experiencing symptoms such as: marked change in thoughts or new decline in social functioning, feelings of unease or paranoia, or sometimes auditory or visual hallucinations. These experiences can sometimes be labeled as psychosis symptoms. Research shows that getting the right type of help for these kinds of concerns will help reduce the risk that they will continue or occur again. Psychosis can be hard to talk about because of stigma around it in our culture, movies and TV; but the truth is that it is much more common than most people think. The PEACE team focuses on information and hope for optimal recovery. OUR TEAM: Each young person will have a Master's level therapist. Our therapists use NAVIGATE as a treatment model; which focuses on education and discussion for individuals and families. The therapist will coordinate care with other providers you may be working with. A Young Adult Peer Mentor is someone who has gone through mental health challenges of their own. They can provide individual support, coaching and perspective in meetings or in other life activities. One of their main jobs is to help the young person's voice to be heard on the team. A Family Partner is a parent or caregiver who bring their own lived experience of helping their child through a mental health challenge. They can be a listening ear as well as offer practical advice on navigating the mental health system and a cheerleader on how to speak up for your family's needs; and how to take time to recharge.
