Hepatitis A is an acute, short-term illness that mainly targets the liver and causes symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, poor appetite, fever, joint pain, itching, jaundice, dark yellow urine and grey or clay-colored stools. Vaccination is key for long-term protection against the virus. Thorough handwashing, practising safe sex, and minimizing close personal contact with infected individuals reduce the risk of transmission of Hepatitis A. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A, as most cases resolve independently over 4-6 weeks. Supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and a healthy diet, is recommended. Alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver should be avoided. "}
