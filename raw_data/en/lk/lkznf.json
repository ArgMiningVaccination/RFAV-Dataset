U. S. Postage Education and Health Care Volume 4, Issue 3 July/August 2008 New aid policy will lower tuition debt, widen career choices The School of Medicine has over- hauled its nancial aid policy with a major boost in aid to middle-income families by reducing the required parental contribution for families making less than $100,000 per year, medical school Dean Robert J. Alpern, C\u000e:\u000e , announced in April. This change is made possible by the addition to the school's budget of approximately $1.1 million in new need-based scholarship funds from endowment income. According to Richard Belitsky, C\u000e:\u000e , deputy dean for education, the rising pressure of student debt has been accelerating a trend in career choices away from primary care and other lower-paying specialties. In ad-dition to making medical school signi cantly more affordable for middle-income fami-lies, the new policy will also lower nancial barriers for students who wish to enter less lucrative elds of medicine. \"Our goal is to reduce the debt burden on students and replace it with scholarship aid, so they can make career choices based on what they want to do, rather than what pays the most,\" said Belitsky.

Roth-man will come to Y ale from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he is now a professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, the Clyde and Helen Wu Professor of Chemical Biology and director of the Columbia Genome Center. In addition to directing Cell Biology, Rothman is the rst recruit to Y ale's recently opened West Cam-pus in West Haven, Conn., where he will launch a Center for High-Throughput Cell Biology. At the new center, multi- disciplinary teams of scientists will develop tools and techniques to rapidly decipher the cel-lular functions of the 25,000 known The Class of 2008 mourns the death of a compassionate classmate On the morning of Saturday, April 19, Mila Rainof, a member of the School of Medicine's Class of 2008, was struck by a car as she crossed a busy street at the northern edge of the medical campus. Rainof, who was scheduled to begin a residency in emergency medicine in Oakland, Calif., in June, died the next day of severe head injuries. At a medical school \"town meeting\" called by Dean Robert J. Alpern, C\u000e:\u000e , the Mon- day after Rainof died, Alpern said, \"The medical school family has lost a member\u2014way too young in age.\" The Class of 2008 is a close-knit group, said class co-president Kristina Zdanys \u000e The loss of any of its mem- bers would have been deeply felt, but Rainof was special. \"Whenever she walked into a class or [the student cafeteria], she was always smiling or had something nice to say,\" Zdanys said. One month later, as a procession of the 96 members of her class walked to Y ale's Old Campus for Commence-ment ceremonies, each graduate paused at the corner of Y ork Street and South Frontage Road, where one by one, they placed a carnation in remembrance of Rainof, a beloved classmate who would not be with them on that joyous day. Because she had ful lled all of the School of Medicine's requirements for gradu-ation, Rainof was awarded the C\u000e:\u000e degree posthumously as a member of the Class of 2008. In the wake of her death, Rainof's friends and classmates found many ways to honor her. Her close friends stood by Rainof's parents and sister when they came to New Haven and organized a memorial service in the medical school's Rose Garden, where friends remem-bered Rainof and called upon those gathered to perpetuate her memory by treating others with the same warmth, compassion and kindness that she showed to all. \"Like everyone else,\" said her boyfriend and classmate James Troy, \"I was instantly won over by her amazing smile. All of us who spent time with her had no choice but to love her.\" Friend and classmate Ellen House, who shared clinical rotations with Rainof, said that patients asked for \"the smiley one.\" She mourned for Rainof and for protein-coding genes in the human genome, providing fresh insights into disease and new molecular targets for therapy. Under Rothman's leadership the Department of Cell Biology will be signi cantly expanded, and will be co-located at the West Campus along with its present location at the main campus of the School of Medicine.

In this newly created position, Vender, re-porting to OC=\u00019;E David J. Leffell, C\u000e:\u000e , will assume operational respon-sibilities and will work to continue to advance the medical school's health care mission. Vender was also appointed as the medical school's associate dean for clinical affairs. Vender will work with medical school and hospital leadership on strategic planning; achieving high sat-isfaction from patients and referring physicians; ensuring patient safety and high-quality, cost-effective patient care; and establishing measures to ensure excellence in clinical care. Vender, who graduated from the School of Medicine in 1977 and completed his internship, residency and a fellowship at Y ale-New Haven Hospital ( OD>> ), has held leader- ship at several New Haven-area hospitals, including OD>> , Milford Hospital and the Hospital of St. Ra-phael, where he has served as section chief of gastroenterology since 1993. In 1997 he founded, with two colleagues, the Gastroenterology Center of Con-necticut, a private practice with of ces in Hamden, Milford and Guilford. Vender has twice received the Vincent DeLuca Award for Outstand-ing T eacher of Gastroenterology. In May, he received the Distinguished Clinician Award from the American Gastroenterological Association. 3POBME\u00017FOEFS Christine Jacobs-Wagner, F>\u000e:\u000e , the Maxine Singer Associate Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Devel-opmental Biology at Y ale, has been named an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( >>C? ), a non-pro t medical research organiza- tion that is one of the nation's largest philanthropies. Jacobs-Wagner is one of the world's leading authorities on the in-ternal organization of bacteria. Work-ing with the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus , a common inhabitant of freshwater lakes and streams, Jacobs-Wagner and colleagues discovered that the organism contains intermedi-ate laments, a cytoskeletal structure previously thought to be present only in animal cells.

Jacobs-Wagner, who received her doctorate at the University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, becomes one of 17 scientists at Y ale who now hold the prestigious basics of stem cell biology is Yale's unique approach This summer marks the second anniversary of the opening of the Y ale Stem Cell Center ( OI99 ). By any mea- sure, say OI99 Director Haifan Lin, F>\u000e:\u000e , professor of cell biology, and Associate Director Diane S. Krause, C\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001F>\u000e:\u000e , professor of laboratory medicine and pathology, the center has been a smashing success. Before the center opened its doors, there was only one laboratory at Y ale involved in human embryonic stem cell (h ;I9)\u0001research. T oday, there are 12, an enormous leap forward for the medical school and the state of Connecticut, according to Lin, who calls stem cells \"the next frontier of biomedical research.\" This increase in capacity is critical because h ;I9s have many advantages over the so-called adult stem cells that can be gathered from tissues such as bone marrow or skin cells: h ;I9s are easier to collect, they can be grown in large numbers and they in principle can differentiate into any of the cell types that make up the diverse tissues\u2014heart, bone, brain, muscle, and more\u2014of the human body. Although very recent advances in reprogramming adult cells to act more like embryonic stem cells may ultimately help bypass ethical issues, for now, h ;I9s remain the gold stan- dard against which reprogrammed cells are measured, and the best hope for future medical advances. The OI99 's state-of-the-art facili- ties have enabled more researchers to enter the eld by helping them scale both the regulatory and technical hurdles involved in stem cell research, Lin says. The center, which occupies the second fl oor of the new research building at 10 Amistad St., consists of four \"cores\": stem cell culture, directed by Caihong Qiu, F>\u000e:\u000e ; imaging; cell sorting and analysis; and genomics. Because the space used for h ;I9 research is not supported by fed-eral funds, researchers there are not restricted by government regulations that limit support for h ;I9\u0001 research to an approved list of already estab-lished stem cell lines. \"So far, we have been using the approved cell lines, but we are capable of deriving our own lines, or using non-approved cells lines here,\" Lin says of the OI99 . \"This building is like a Shangri-La for stem cell research.\" Part of what made the center pos- sible is a 2005 state law that estab-lished Connecticut as a safe haven for h ;I9\u0001 research and established the Connecticut Stem Cell Research Program in the state's Department of Public Health, which will provide $100 million to fund h ;I9 research over 10 years. In the rst year of that initiative, Y ale received $7.7 million, of which $2.5 million went to Lin to establish the stem cell culture core facility. Krause received $1 million to expand her work on leukemia to include studies on h ;I9s. Michael Snyder, F>\u000e:\u000e , professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology and of molecular biophysics and biochemistry, received $3.8 million to investigate how h ;I9s differentiate into brain cells. Three other research-ers also received smaller seed grants to support new projects. In the second round of grants, an- nounced in March, Y ale received $5.6 million out of the total $10 million put up by the state. The OI99 itself received $1.8 million, and the rest was awarded to 11 faculty members based on original research proposals. Among the researchers sup- ported by the latest state funding are D. Eugene Redmond Jr., C\u000e:\u000e , who received $1.12 million to sup-port his work using h ;I9s to replace the neurons that die off in Parkin-son's disease. Dianqing Wu, F>\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001F>\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001associ- ate professor of and biomedical engineering, and Flora M. Vaccarino, C\u000e:\u000e , associate professor of neurobiology, each received nearly $500,000 to study heart, blood vessel A 'Shangri-La' for stem cell research at Y ale and neuronal stem cells, respectively. In addition, seven other labs received smaller seed grants to work on both basic and clinical applications of stem cells. The bene ts of the OI99\u0001 go be- yond Y ale. The mission of the center, says Lin, is to provide a centralized source of technical expertise to the community, including colleagues at other institutions. Researchers at the University of Connecticut and Wesleyan University, who have also shared in the state's stem cell funds, have access to the Y ale core facilities for their work. Besides its new labs, the stem cell center boasts 38 af liated faculty members from departments across Y ale, and six months ago Lin and Krause welcomed their rst new fac- ulty recruit, Natalia Ivanova, \u0001F>\u000e:\u000e , assistant professor of genetics and the Robert T. McCluskey, C\u000e:\u000e\u0001 Y ale Scholar. Ivanova is a leader in the use of gene expression pro ling to trace the pathways by which undifferenti-ated embryonic stem cells progress to mature cell types. \u0001<7C?BO\u0001E<\u0001@7C;I\u000197L7D7=> , of the Y ale College Class of 1942, gathered in the School of Medicine's Medical Historical Library before a luncheon at the venerable Mory's to celebrate Cavanagh's gift of $500,000 to support medical education at Y ale.

When a doctor doesn't speak the native tongue of a patient, translators are often called in to help, but because one's health is an intimate and private matter, intro-ducing a third party into a medical discussion is not an ideal solution. For Linda Kantor, of Orange, Conn., these issues are more than the-oretical. Kantor is a founder and vice president of the Board of Directors of Casa Oto\u00f1al (\"Autumn House\"), a campus-like complex of buildings dedicated to housing the elderly of New Haven's Hispanic community. \"We've found that when some of our elderly are at the hospital, many times they have to bring along a child or a grandchild as an interpreter,\" she ex-plains. \"But it's not ethically or medi-cally a good idea to have an 8 year old in an Ob/Gyn clinic translating for a grandmother.\" According to Kantor's husband, Y ale immunologist Fred S. Kantor, C\u000e:\u000e , the Paul S. Beeson Pro- fessor of Medicine, even having the services of a professional translator has its limits. \"As a physician, it's won-derful to have a capable translator, but it's not the same as having even rudimentary Spanish\" when treating a Spanish-speaking patient, he says. Michael Vlock, a Branford, Conn.-based executive and philan-thropist who has known the Kantors since he was 10 years old\u2014they were close friends of his parents\u2014recently joined his wife, Karen Pritzker, in making a $250,000 gift to the School of Medicine to honor the couple's lifetime of service to Y ale and to New Haven. Vlock and Pritzker asked the couple to help choose how the money would be spent. \"With this wonderful gift and its income, we didn't want to sponsor an annual lecture or a prize,\" says Fred Kantor. \"Our task was to integrate our interests\u2014medicine, the Hispanic community and the elderly.\" The result was a course in \"medical Spanish\" taught in Y ale-New Haven Hospital's Fitkin Amphitheatre last fall. The course drew 60 students and was taught in four sections, twice a week, by Tricia Walter, C\u000e7\u000e , a lecturer in Y ale's Department of Latin American Studies. Fred Kantor, who took the course himself, says it has been a real boon to his practice of medicine. \"I had no knowledge of Spanish at all, and even after one semester I found I could com-municate better with the patients,\" he says. \"Their faces brighten when they realize that somebody is trying to communicate with them in their language.\" Vlock is pleased that his donation provided the foundation for an initia-tive that is so much in keeping with the Kantors' varied commit-ments to the community. \"Their ties to both the School of Medicine and to the Hispanic community are very deep,\" Vlock says. \"Their convictions as to the signi cance and potential lifesaving capacity of teaching medi-cal Spanish were pretty persuasive, and Karen and I are thrilled to be able to empower them, given all that they've done for my family and for the community.\" Although elementary Spanish does not negate the need for a trained interpreter, Linda Kantor says that even a rudimentary knowledge of Spanish will make a difference to doc-tors and patients. \"For physicians to at least have a modicum of Spanish, to be able to introduce themselves, to say 'I hope you feel better,' and to be able to ask some pertinent questions in Spanish,\" she says, \"will help to put both the patient and the physician more at ease, and lead to better medi-cal practice.\"Opening up the lines of communication About 8 percent of the population has an appendectomy at some point in their lives, usually prompted by an attack of acute appendicitis. Until about 2000, appendectomies were performed using traditional \"open\" surgery techniques, in which surgeons gained access to the abdomen through a single, fairly large incision. For the past decade or so, appendectomies have more commonly been per-formed laparoscopically, with surgical instruments and a ber-optic video camera inserted through three small incisions in the abdomen. In the latest advance for this rela- tively common procedure, Kurt E. Roberts, C\u000e:\u000e , assistant profes- sor of surgery, has pioneered a new laparoscopic technique that requires only a single 11-millimeter incision, or \"port.\" In July 2007, Roberts per-formed the world's rst true single- incision, or single-port, laparoscopic appendectomy at Y ale-New Haven Hospital, when he removed the ap- pendix of a 22-year-old woman using only one small incision in the navel. He has since performed 12 more single-port appendectomies, and he has also broadened the technique to complete 4 single-port umbilical hernia repairs and, recently, 10 gall bladder removals. \"This is exciting news because a single-port appen-dectomy performed with only one small incision is even less invasive than the widely performed three-port laparo-scopic appendecto- my, which uses three incisions,\" explains Roberts. \"One incision equates to even less pain and shorter recovery time for the pa-tient than the usual three.\" Similarly, Roberts is now able to remove the gall bladder through only one incision in the navel, an operation traditionally performed with four incisions. In recent years, the trend in abdominal surgery has been to reduce the number of incisions whenever possible. Roberts' procedure, nick-named the \"puppeteer technique,\" involves entering the abdomen, grasping the appendix, dissecting and removing it, all through one tiny incision. Because the surgical port is hidden in the navel, Roberts says, an already small incision becomes nearly invisible once the wound has healed, resulting in \"tremendous medical and cosmetic bene ts for the patients.\" Roberts is keenly interested in ap- plying his single-port methods in nat-ural ori ce transluminal endoscopic surgery, or DEJ;I , a growing trend in which operations are performed through bodily ori ces such as the mouth, or, in women, the vagina. Using DEJ;I , surgeons can avoid visible scarring, signi cantly reduce post-operative pain and gain unprec-edented access to internal organs. Roberts believes that surgery is at the beginning of a revolution in which many procedures, including hernia re-pair and gastric banding for the treat- ment of obesity, may soon be per- formed using these new techniques of single-port surgery and kindest \"all future memories of Mila that I will never have.\" Karen J. Jubanyik, C\u000e:\u000e , assistant professor of surgery, recalled a dif- cult shift she worked in the Emer- gency Department at Y ale-New Haven Hospital the day after Rainof died. \"It was a typical Monday. The ambulance bay looked like Noah's ark; they were coming in two by two. I had intubated two patients by 8 a.m. A woman with a breech baby came in active labor, looking like she was going to deliver on our doorstep. And more than a few patients were looking for speci c narcotic medications by name . . . I just thought, 'What would Mila do?' She would dig in hard and contribute in every way possible. She would go to the patient's bedside, hold their hand and genuinely listen to them, without judgment. Her life will go on if we all take what we learned from Mila and incorporate it into our daily life, in the world of medicine and at home. And if we teach this by Chair from page 1 Aid from page 1between intracellular compartments and across cell membranes, Roth-man has received numerous honors, including Columbia's Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize and the Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, two prizes that are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"pre-Nobels\" because so many recipients of the Horwitz and Lasker awards have gone on to become Nobel laureates. Much of this work was done using a \"cell-free\" approach, in which Rothman isolated intracellular components crucial to molecular transport in a laboratory dish. This strategy allowed him to perform elegant, focused experiments that sidestepped the complexity of working with complete cells. \"Jim Rothman is one of the most brilliant researchers of our time,\" said Robert J. Alpern, C\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine. \"When Jim started his career, a number of successful biochemists were recogniz-ing the importance of studying mo-lecular processes in cell-free systems, but no one imagined that you could study vesicle traf cking in a cell-free system. Jim had the courage to try and the skills to succeed, and this bold approach revolutionized the eld. Jim continues to bring this combination of brilliance and intensity to his re-search, and now also to the continued development of an exceptional cell biology department.\" Carolyn W. Slayman, F>\u000e:\u000e , Ster- ling Professor of Genetics and deputy dean of academic and scienti c af- fairs, added, \"Jim Rothman has helped to shape the eld of cell biology over the past two decades, and it will be exciting to have him join the scienti c community at Y ale.\" Rothman has many personal and scienti c connections to Y ale. He graduated summa cum laude from Y ale College in 1971 with a degree in phys-ics, and conducted research as an un-dergraduate in Y ale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochem-istry with Eugene Higgins Professor Donald M. Engelman, F>\u000e:\u000e (then an assistant professor) and Harold J. Morowitz, F>\u000e:\u000e now Clarence J. Robinson Professor of Biology and Natural Philosophy at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. Both of Rothman's children are Y ale College graduates, and his spouse, Joy Hirsch, F>\u000e:\u000e is a former profes- sor at Y ale School of Medicine who now directs the Program for Imaging and Cognitive Sciences at Columbia University. \"My life's work on membrane traf cking in cells was inspired by the discoveries of George Palade, who founded Y ale's cell biology depart-ment in 1973, and indeed founded the eld of cell biology as we know it today,\" Rothman said. \"It is a privilege to lead the department he began as we rede ne molecular cell biology and catalyze its impact on medicine, and a unique pleasure to return to Y ale.\" George E. Palade, C\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001a No- bel Prize-winning cell biologist, led Y ale's department for its rst decade and established its current direc-tions. Beginning in the 1950s, electron microscope images made by Palade and other scientists revealed that tiny spherical sacs known as vesicles encapsulate and shuttle proteins, hormones, neurotransmitters and other substances between intracellular organelles and to the cell surface. In these micrographs, vesicles were seen to fuse with membranes, spilling their contents into intracellular organelles, or, in the case of the membrane at the cell surface, into the extracellular In an e-mail to the medical school community, Alpern wrote, \"It is criti-cal to the health of medicine and to society in general that medical educa-tion is available to students from all segments of society. Medical schools also have an obligation to prepare students for careers in all the special-ties, so that patients with every kind of medical need can be served.\" Beginning with the 2008 aca- demic year, no contribution toward tuition will be expected from parents earning less than $100,000 whose as-sets are typical of their income level. Contributions from parents earning more than $100,000 will be calibrated according to a sliding scale based on a realistic assessment of income and assets. The change will apply to both current and newly enrolled students. The school is also raising its \"base loan\" amount (which students are expected to cover by taking out a loan before receiving scholarships and grants) from $17,000 to $18,000, but this amount will remain among the lowest of all peer private institutions. The total cost of medical school at Y ale in 2008-2009 will be $62,010 for an incoming student, including tu-ition, room, board, books, transporta-tion and other expenses. The average medical education debt of School of Medicine students who graduated with outstanding loans in 2007 was $115,000, compared to a national average of $157,000 for graduates of private medical schools. The average debt gure is estimated at $125,000 for this year's graduating class at Y ale. In 2007-2008, medical students at Y ale received $7.3 million in grants and $9.2 million in student loans. Overall, 87.6 percent of Y ale medical students receive some form of nancial aid. The new policy refl ects a growing trend among universities with large endowments to make more nancial aid available. Y ale College announced in January that it would reduce the cost of undergraduate education by up to 50 percent for families with need. Families earning up to $60,000 a year will make no contribution and families earning up to $120,000 will pay no more than 10 percent of their income toward Y ale College costs. Belitsky said, \"If you're without any resources, there's scholarship money available to pay for medical school, and if you're wealthy, there's family money to pay for it. What we've found is that it's the middle-income families who have been taking it on the chin.\" Alpern added, \"The school's previous nancial-aid for- mula assumed that families earning as little as $45,000 a year could contrib-ute to their children's medical school costs, when in fact, they often cannot. We're correcting that now.\" space, where the released vesicular cargo could interact with neighbor-ing cells or enter the bloodstream to affect distant ones. This latter process, known as exocytosis, is basic to life and occurs in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans; in our own case, exocytosis underlies physiological functions ranging from the secretion of insulin to the regulation of the brain neurotransmitters responsible for movement, perception, memory and mood. Rothman discovered the molecular mechanisms and machin-ery responsible for these and related processes. After graduating from Y ale, and basic science training as a medical student at Harvard Medical School ( >CI ), Rothman soon resolved to learn more about the mechanisms of vesicular transport. He shifted his focus to basic science, earning a F>\u000e:\u000e in biological chemistry from >CI in 1976. He then spent two years as a postdoctoral associate in the labora-tory of Harvey F. Lodish, F>\u000e:\u000e , a preeminent biochemist at the Mas-sachusetts Institute of T echnology. In 1978, Rothman moved to the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford School of Medicine as an assistant professor. At this time, he and Randy W. Schekman, F>\u000e:\u000e , of the University of California, Berkeley, conducted parallel research programs, using biochemical and genetic tech-niques to identify and characterize the proteins that are necessary for vesicle transport, and for the docking and fu-sion of vesicles with membranes. For this early work, Rothman and Schek-man have shared many awards. Rothman continued his research at Princeton University from 1988 un-til 1991, when he became the founding chair of the Department of Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics at Me- morial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New Y ork as well as vice chair of the Sloan-Kettering Institute. In 1993, Rothman discovered a complex of vesicle membrane pro-teins that he implicated in membrane fusion, and based on this discovery he formulated the \" ID7H;\u0001 hypothesis,\" which has become highly infl uential in the study of membrane traf cking. This hypothesis posits that distinctive, complementary pro-tein complexes known as ID7H; s, expressed on both vesicles and target membranes, rst ensure that different classes of vesicles bind to appropri-ate membranes and then unleash biochemical changes leading to fusion of vesicles with those membranes and the delivery of the vesicles' cargo to its proper destination. Rothman has given invited lectures on his work throughout the world, and has served on the editorial boards of Science and Cell. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science, and a foreign associate of the European Molecular Biology Association. Rothman succeeds Ira Mellman, F>\u000e:\u000e , a distinguished cell biologist and immunologist who was chair and Sterling Professor of Cell Biology at the School of Medicine until 2007, when he joined the biotechnology company Genentech as vice president for oncology research. Since Mellman's departure last year, former chair James D. Jamieson, C\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001F>\u000e:\u000e , professor of cell biology and director of the medical school's C\u000e:\u000e /F>\u000e:\u000e\u0001 Program, has served as interim chair of the Department of Cell Biology.example to those around us, Mila's impact on this world can grow expo-nentially.\" Friend and classmate Mag-gie Samuels-Kalow said, \"Mila was the person that you wanted at your side when the patient was getting sicker and you didn't know what to do.\" A group collected photos and remembrances for a book to be given to Rainof's family, while other students also organized efforts to work with the city of New Haven to improve safety at intersections near the medical school.

The $1 million Kavli Prizes, which will be presented biannually for achievements in neuroscience, nano-science and astrophysics, are a part-nership of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Oxnard, Calif.-based Kavli Foundation, and the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. Rakic, a neurosurgeon-turned- neuroscientist, was honored along with , professor of M. Jessell, F>\u000e:\u000e , professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Columbia University for \"discoveries on the developmental Pioneering brain scientist is winner of inaugural Kavli Prize and functional properties of neuronal circuits.\" \"T Jessell and Grill- ner to decipher the mechanisms that govern the forma-tion and functioning of the complex networks of the neural system to a level of understanding never previ-ously achieved,\" said Jon Storm-Mathisen, professor of anatomy at the University of Oslo and chair of the Kavli Neuroscience Prize Committee. \"The insight spans from the level of signaling molecules to cell and net-work wiring and action, to behavior. The new knowledge carries promise for future treatments of brain disor-ders by repairing damaged circuits.\" For the past three decades, Rakic has carried out pioneering studies of how neurons in the developing cerebral cortex are generated and how they assemble themselves into the highly ordered, distinctively layered and densely interconnected circuits that direct higher order sensory and motor functions. \"Pasko Rakic has contributed much to our understanding of brain function, de ning the mechanisms by which cortical neurons move to the proper location within the cerebral cortex,\" says Dean Robert Alpern, C\u000e:\u000e , Ensign Professor of Medicine. \"He is an outstanding scientist who has not only made signi cant contri- butions himself, but has developed an exceptional department of neurobiol-ogy here at Y ale.\" Early in his career, Rakic discov- ered that previously enigmatic sup-port cells known as radial glia serve as guides for the migration of cortical neurons in the developing brain, and he showed how this process is critical for the organization of the multi-layered structure of the cerebral cortex. His \"radial unit hypothesis\" set the stage for our current view of the steps involved in the evolution of ever more complex and sophisticated brains among the vertebrates. Rakic's four-dimensional model of devel-opmental events over time, from the initial divisions of neuronal stem cells through their migration and strati- ed settlement in cortical columns, is reproduced in virtually every basic neuroscience textbook. Rakic also introduced the infl uen- tial idea that different regions of the cerebral cortex acquire many of their specialized anatomical and functional properties through genetic programs intrinsic to the cortex itself. The Kavli Prize is named for, and funded by, Fred Kavli, an entrepre-neur and philanthropist who was inspired to seek a career in science and engineering while marveling at the northern lights in the skies above the tiny Norwegian vil-lage where he grew up. He later moved to the U.S., where he founded the Kavlico Corporation, which became one of the world's largest suppliers of sensors for aeronautic, automotive and industrial application. In addition to funding the new prizes, Kavli has established 15 re-search institutes devoted to neurosci-ence, nanoscience and astrophysics at leading academic institutions around the world. Since 2005, Rakic has been director of the Kavli Institute for Neu-roscience at Y ale. At a ceremony in New Y ork an- nouncing the prizes, Kavli said, \"The Kavli Prizes were created to recognize achievements in three exception-ally exciting elds which we believe promise remarkable future discoveries and bene ts for humanity in the 21st century and beyond.\" In April, Amy F.T. Arnsten, F>\u000e:\u000e , professor of neurobiology and psy-chology, was one of 11 scientists to receive a Distinguished Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and De-pression ( D7HI7: ) for her research on the genetic basis of schizophrenia. According to D7HI7: , the award was established \"to support highly signi cant research by established scientists . . . who are on the cusp of a breakthrough, or who are poised to test an innovative new idea that has the potential to make a signi cant advance in a given area of research.\" Arnsten's research group has made important contributions to under-standing the prefrontal cortex, the most evolved part of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is key for abstract thought and goal-directed behavior, and is weakened in mental illnesses such as attention de cit hyperactiv- ity disorder ( 7:>: ), post-traumatic stress disorder ( ), bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Research in the Arnsten lab has revealed many of the chemical infl uences at work in the prefrontal cortex, which has led to new treatments for 7:>: (guanfa- cine) and FJI: (prazosin). Recently, Arnsten has expanded on the insights gained in her re-search to explore whether a loss of function in the gene Disrupted-in- Schizophrenia 1 , or disc 1, in the prefrontal cortex leads to a collapse of neural networks and loss of dendritic spines\u2014protrusions on nerve cells that play a key role in the transmission of signals from cell to cell\u2014and ultimately to the cogni-tive dysfunction that is characteristic of schizophrenia. This research is conducted in collaboration with Y ale experts, including Arthur A. Simen, C\u000e:\u000e ,\u0001F>\u000e:\u000e and Min Wang, in neurobiology; and Constantinos Paspalas, F>\u000e:\u000e , of the University of Crete. The highly competitive Distin- guished Investigator Award, which is given to investigators of brain and psychiatric disorders who have established themselves as leaders in their elds, includes a one-year grant of $100,000. \"Dr. Arnsten exempli es the kind of individual we try to single out for the Distinguished Investigator Award\u2014an outstanding scientist, represent-ing the very best in the eld, with an important body of work behind her and currently pursuing innovative and promising research,\" says Geoff Birkett, , chair and Barklie McKee Henry Professor of Psychiatry at Weill Medical Col-lege of Cornell University and a 1961 graduate of Y ale School of Medicine, chaired the committee that selected the winning proposals. \"The work of Dr. Arnsten is extremely impressive,\" Barchas says, \"and, like that of our other 10 Distinguished Investigator awardees, has very real potential to produce insights that will lead to new approaches to treatment for serious mental illness.\" In addition to Arnsten's award, two medical school scientists in the Department of Psychiatry were also honored by D7HI7: with Y oung Investigator Awards, created to help the most promising scientists who are now entering research . . . to generate pilot data necessary for larger grants.\" The awards carry grants of $60,000 each distributed over two years. Savita G. Bhakta, :\u000eF\u000eC\u000e , a post- doctoral associate who does research at the V A Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven, Conn., plans to gain a better understanding of the neurochemistry of schizophrenia by studying how cannabinoids (chemi-cal compounds found in marijuana) induce schizophrenia-like behavioral and cognitive effects in healthy people and exacerbate symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Fei Wang, F>\u000e:\u000e , associate research scientist, will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging technology to study adoles-cents with bipolar disorder to identify abnormalities in brain circuitry serv-ing the emotional processing that are implicated in the illness. The Long Island, N.Y.-based D7HI7: is the world's largest donor- supported organization supporting research on brain and behavior disor-ders. Since 1987, D7HI7: has awarded more than $230 million to nearly 2,700 scientists.

Ivanova's work exempli es the philosophy of the center and its founders\u2014to keep a focus on basic questions of stem cell biology, with the idea that this will lead to clinical applications.As Lin explains, \"We actually know very little about stem cells, and that makes me feel that some people are jumping ahead too fast. If we don't know how they work, how can we harness their potential?\" This vision dovetails well with the medi-cal school's strength in basic research, and makes the OI99\u0001 a unique player in the stem cell eld. \"Few other places have been focusing on really understanding the inner workings of stem cells,\" he says. \"We think we can and believe that by doing that we will generate more impact and speed the development of cures.\" In that effort, state support has been a critical factor, but it is only the beginning. \"We will be eternally grate-ful for the support from the state, but we have to think of their contribution as seed money,\" Lin says. \"Stem cell research in still in its infancy. Our center is a new baby that has been born, but now we need to feed it and let it grow up. One thing we know is that this baby is full of potential.\" Stem Cells "}
